In 2001, I bought an '88 Honda Civic which already had 140k on it. Paid around $450 for it, then put another $600 in it to get it running just the way I wanted. In the first year I had it, I put close to 30k on that car, and the only thing it asked me for was a brake job and two new tires. The second year, I drove it more moderately, replaced the timing belt just in case , the alternator, and the front and rear seals. I think all told I put just over $1000 into that car in exchange for it giving me 50,000 miles of dependable transportation. I finally replaced it with a Toyota Tercel b/c the Honda didn't have power steering, and passed it on to my boyfriend's son. He's had to put more into it then I did (clutch, radiator, steering column), but then again, as an 18 year old male, he drives it harder then I did, and it just passed the 200k mark. I'm pleased enough with the Toyota I have now, but when I'm ready to replace it, I'll be going back to Honda.
