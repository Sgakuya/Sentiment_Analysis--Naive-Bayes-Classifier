They're really bad about placing stuff in their ads and then not having it in their stores. My first visit there 3 yrs ago I was looking to buy a new game when it was released at their store. I went there and they didn't have a single copy. I asked an associate where it was, and he said heh, you're like the 5th guy who's asked about it...we won't be getting it for a few weeks. Would you like to order it here and pick it up later? Uh, no thanks. I went across the street to Target and they had it in stock. A few months later I was at another of their stores looking to get a DVD burner they advertised the day before, and again, none in stock. I didn't go back for a while. Skip forward to 2004, and I was looking to get a wearable MP3 player. Best Buy had the best price on it, so I decided to deal with the devil and go there. I walked in and instantly had a salesman all over me. I shooed him away and made a b-line for what I wanted, grabbed it (wow, they actually had it!) and went to the register. At this point the sales pitches should be over, but the cashier kept pushing the extended warranty plan. I told him no 3 times, he harumphed and hastily checked me out and booted me out the door. He must get a commission on those dumb warranties. I may be wrong, but at one point Best Buy frequently advertised something to the tune of no pressure, no pushy salesmen or something to that effect. Those days seem to be long since gone. In a press release one of the execs at Best Buy wanted to get rid of demon customers like me, who only go for the loss leaders. That's OK guys, you lost me a long time ago. Best Buy is a testament to the power of branding and marketing power, and they're coasting off their long-past repuation for having low prices. I say avoid them.
