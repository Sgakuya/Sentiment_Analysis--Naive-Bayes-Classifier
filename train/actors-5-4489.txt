He is truly the best actor of our time and deserves all the awards and honors that can be bestowed on one performer. I just saw In the Name of the Father this weekend and was blown away by his performance. He became the character and it was just incredible to watch him knowing that he really wasn't that person he was portraying and probably had never lived that life. Yet I don't think anyone could have created a better performance. He was so real - in a none distracting way. I read on the internet that he actually tries to live, in real life, as the characters he is trying portray. It is obvious when you see his movies because he really is that character. I saw him years ago in My Left Foot. Though I was too young to really understand the film the memory of his performance - superior acting ability - still stays with me (visually in my mind) to this day. Do yourselves a favor and go see a couple of his films today and see what a truly phenomenal actor really is. It isn't an action star, Tom Cruise, or Brad Pitt - it is the most top class actor of the century - Daniel Day Lewis.
