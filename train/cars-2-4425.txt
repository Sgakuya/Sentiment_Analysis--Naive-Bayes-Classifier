We purchased this Ford Windstar, and although we like it, it has given us trouble starting, but not limited to the head gasket. It is disturbing to know that our friends, or aquaintences who have owned 95 windstars also are having head gasket, and little electronic sensor problems. This van needed to have been modified before, or the extended warranty extended to 5 years, and 120,000 miles. The reason that I say 120,000 miles, is because in the service manual, the only thing suggested as far as maintenance on the van is regualr oil changes. So how can a head gasket that goes out at 75,000 or so miles, be considered regular mainantence?? We are stuck with the van now because the problem is known, and people don't want to touch our van, even though we have replaced the head gasket already.
