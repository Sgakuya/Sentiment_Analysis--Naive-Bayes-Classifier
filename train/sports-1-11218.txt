I've been a Michigan fan all my life and I think Lloyd Carr is a terrible coach. He plays so conservatively, which keeps games very close and allows weaker opponents to stay in the game and win if we make a mistake towards the end. He insists on using the running game to setup everything else, even if we aren't running the ball well and even if we have a great passing attack. I think he under-utilizes his talent. Look at Justin Fargas at USC. Tom Brady is doing incredible in the NFL, yet his team couldn't beat Illinois and Michigan State in college? If Michigan had Steve Spurrier coaching, do you really think we would have only had 12 points going into the fourth quarter against a ND team that allowed 17 points against BYU? We have incredible receivers, and while our QB is young, you can't let a team stay in the game by not running plays longer than 5 yards. If you aren't creative early on (in a game or in a series of downs) you put your QB in very difficult situations (down by 2 scores with 5 minutes to go, or at 3rd and 8). I could go on forever about how Michigan needs a new coach, but I'll stop with one more comment. The only way we'll ever win a NC again under Carr is to have an unbelievable defense that will bail us out when our offense plays too conservatively.
