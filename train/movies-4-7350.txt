I saw this movie when it came out with some friends, mainly because one of them had had a part as an extra and we went as a group to support him. (Bearded w/glases talking to Gary Cole as seen over Ron Livingstons' Charactor shoulder in one scene.) Besides, it was filmed here in Austin, and my curiosity got the better of me. Never being a Beevis and Butthead fan, I didn't expect too much from it, but instead, found it pleseantly surprising! While not a great film, either in script or technique, I did think it had some truely original and funny moments. And, as another person here has stated, it kept you guessing, which, for me, is one of the pleasures of seeing films. Definitely worth seeing at least once.
