hi, i was wondering if moving to new orleans should be an option for me. i am 20 years old, and have a boyfriend and a child. i wanted to know how well are the job opportunities, as well as education. i was also wondering how easy it is to find housing that isn t ridiculously over priced, and the crime rate would also make a big difference. i wouldn t know much about new orleans, since i have only been there for mardi gras, but i don t want to make it a point to pack up and move there, only to have to move back because something wasn t right. i currently live in ft. myers florida, so the move wouldn t be ever so drastic, yet i don t want to waste my time, if something should go wrong. thanks your any insight that some of you may be able to give me.
