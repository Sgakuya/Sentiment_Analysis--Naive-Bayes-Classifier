Politicians from downstate campaigning in upstate New York for the past 40 years have done nothing but give us lip service. Year after year of empty promises. Rick Lazio is no different. He is from Long Island. That might as well be another country. I'll take my chances on the carpetbagger. At least Hillary is her own person. You may not like her style, but she at least concentrates her efforts on what she will do instead of constantly attacking her opponent. Rick Lazio is using the emotional blackmail tactic. That is so typical of someone who cannot defend themselves on the issues. When you have nothing to offer, attack your opponent personally in public. Just another bully! Hillary remains a stateswoman and determined under fire and that is what New Yorkers need in the senate.
