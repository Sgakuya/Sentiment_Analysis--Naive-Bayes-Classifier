Alan Keyes is a brilliant, articulate and capable man. He was astounding as ambassador at the UN and as a presidential candidate. His understanding of the problems facing the US is profound based on the nature man and the founding principals of the Republic rather than pop culture bromides. In reviewing some of the screeds about his Roman Catholicism, I find it laughable that a knuckle dragging bible thump still has trouble with the only original and truly authentic Christian church when their choice of creeds constantly breaks in to sillier and smaller confessions. It would be in your best interest to examine the canon and creation of the Bible. There was a Catholic Church before the canon was settled and it was Catholic Church Councils that decided the bible's content. One of Luther, Calvin and Zwingli s first acts was to eliminate or change the translation of passages in the original canon that disagreed with them. Luther called for the extermination of Baptists while Calvin persecuted Lutherans with greater ferocity and maniac glee than he did Catholics.
