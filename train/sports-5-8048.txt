Iverson is my idol.He kicks major ass at basketball. I think he's 100 times beter than Michael Jordan. He's my man.I have a big ass wall in my room covered with Iverson pictures, cards, plaques, and posters. I'm a wannabe Iverson. He is the one who made me love the 76ers. I really want to meet him but it's really rare. I have a million rap CD's so I don't see why he's so bad. Everyone tries to make him look bad but he's my man. I've got his shoes and his jersey and all. But who ever hates Iverson is messed up because he's a normal person. Rapping doesn't mean anything. So who ever hates Iverson has a problem.I would kill myself to meet him. I'm also getting cornrows. Also, my nick name to all me friends is Iverson. He's my dawg (i wish). What ever I hear about Iverson that's bad, I won't believe it because rapping isn't bad so forget you people who think he's bad. And Iverson, if you see this know that your my main man. call me if you can @ 829-0207!!!! one more thing, YOUR AWSOME ALLEN!!!!!
