I've lived in Toronto for 7 years now. I've also lived in Montreal for 4 years, Vancouver for 6, and London England for the other half of my life...so I think I can be quite open-minded when speaking about cities. When I first came to Toronto, I found was living in the downtown core and found it quite obviously full of concrete and lacking in a certain flair. However after a few years in the city, where I began to discover the many festivals and unspoken treasure, I began to appreciate a very different city. For those who say there's no nature in Toronto or surrounding areas, they've obviously never been to the High Park area, or along Mount Pleasant or so many other beatiful, tree-lined streets with gorgeous English type houses. Go 30 minutes north of the city to Newmarket, or West to Halton Hills / Georgetown region and you'll appreciate a truly Canadian type of nature and scenery. There may not be the mountains that Vancouver has, but I find the mountains seems to block off the rest of Canada (and the world!) to those living there. Vancouverites are very narrow-minded, ultra-naive people who tend to think they are 'chilled and hip' but this is just a cliche. Toronto has incredible multi-culturalism, not a 'them vs. us' feel that Vancouver possesses because of the almost 50% Asian population. Here, you can be proud of whoever you are, and there is no conflict, no tension between any of the many many nationalities and races here. On the surface, you may find Toronto dull, but dig a little and you'll find a whole underbelly of goings-on and nice people that you just won't get elsewhere...definitely an international city with an international population.
