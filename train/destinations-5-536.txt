After reading some other reviews -- I believe it is all in the timing (regarding other guests). We were there May 30-June7 and it was EXCELLENT! If risque behavior bothers you - don't spoil it for the rest of us. If nudity bothers you - same thing. If people having sex at the side of the pool bothers you - then this isn't the place for you. Otherwise - go, be open minded, have some drinks, snorkel in the nude, go diving (the guys at the dive shack are AWESOME - and tell them that the crazy couple in Austin say HI!!!), enjoy the band at dinner, blow off what you might find annoying, and realize up front it is NOT anywhere else -- it is JAMAICA and the people are beautiful and lovely and wonderful. Get off the American high-horse and be human -- THAT is what Hedo is all about. If you expect it to be something different - then you are only setting yourself up. Stop comparing resorts - each are unique! Your vacation (escape, homecoming, etc.) is most dependent on your attitude. If we wanted them to be the same, then there would be one and all would complain about how crowded it is. Hedo is just that - HEDO. You can't describe it - you have to cast off your cares, your inhibitions, and your clothes and EXPERIENCE IT! And to everyone at Hedo - we can't wait to come home - see ya in 2005!!!!
