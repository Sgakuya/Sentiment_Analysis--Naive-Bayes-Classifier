9/28/05 It is now nearly a year after President Bush's reelection, and it looks to me like his administration is crumbling. A war that is not going well, a mishandled natural disaster, an indicted House majority leader, continued catastrophic congressional spending - nothing seems to be going well for GWB at the moment. If the torture thing blows up like it looks like it may - things could get really messy. I've made no bones about how politically, philosophically, morally - I could not draw up a President that is more diametrically opposed to what I believe in. But President Bush's politics and governing philosophy have been the consistent part of his presidency, and not to blame for his fall from grace. What I think is happening, is that lumbering, majority, moderate America is starting question our President's competence. To their ongoing shame, the Democrats have failed to present an alternative vision for government. Third party anyone? 11/3/04 President Bush received a stunning mandate last night. More big government, deficit spending & tax cuts, preemptive war, unilateral foreign policy, and religion influenced positions on social issues seem to be what we have voted for. With such a large mandate, it would be unrealistic to expect a more measured President than what we saw in the first term. In fact, I believe talk of Bush reaching across the aisle to try and mend the fractured country is wishful thinking. Why should he? The American people have spoken, and a significant majority have stated that they like what they see. We should expect more of the same, but perhaps even more aggressive. If you like what Bush has done with his first term, you are probably ecstatic. If not, you should be shuddering.
