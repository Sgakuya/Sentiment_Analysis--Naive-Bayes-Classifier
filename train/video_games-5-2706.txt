Sega Sports was a huge part of the Genesis, competing with EA Sports, Accolade and others. But, when the Saturn came around, they didn t have much support (aside from the excellent Worldwide Soccer and World Series Baseball series) and the system sorely lacked in quality Basketball and Football titles. Visual Concepts and Sega solved that with the Dreamcast. The details on the actual players are great, with rendered faces, wrinkles in the uniforms and even small details like breathing in cold weather and many celebration animations. The one area where EA s Madden series has almost never been able to compete is play-by-play. Barring the two years that the nifty FMV commentary was used on the Playstation and Saturn versions, Madden has had dreadfully boring play-by-play. Sega Sports and Visual Concepts took a different route. Voice actors. The announcers in the game are Dan Stephens, Peter O Keefe and Michelle Westpaul. Bottom line, they are the best announcing team out there. They never stop commenting, they have tons of humorous remarks. All makers of sports teams should take a cue from Sega Sports. Only the announcers of 989 Sports and Acclaim Sports football games come even close to touching the great team of voice actors. I love the control for this series. It s faster than Madden for the N64, Quarterback Club for the DC and more like my second favorite football series, Gameday (the versions from 99 on). The players control on a dime with no delay. The gameplay is some of the best around, the graphics are among the greatest, and it features the most original and amusing commentary team ever along with a great amount of customization equals the Madden killer for the 2000 year. Highly recommended!
