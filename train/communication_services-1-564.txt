Just a few days ago I purchased a T-Mobile to go (prepaid service) from a T-Mobile wholly owned outlet at my local mall. I needed the phone for a very specific purpose - to access a subscription internet database while away from home or the office. I thought prepaid would be fine because I really didn't need to use it too much since I am mostly at work or home. The T-mobile employee told me I should be able to access the website through T-Mobile's T-Zones, and if not, I could just return it within 14 days. So I bought it, found out immediately that it cannot access that database through their prepaid to go network. Took it back the next day and , Lo and Behold, - It's not returnable: Well, yes and no. The phone is returnable - but since I got the phone free with the purchase of prepaid time and activation - Yes, I can return it, but I can't get any money back. The activation and prepaid time is lost forever. NO ONE at T-Mobile cares. I can't even sue them, because I am bound by forced binding arbitration and must pay a fee of $25 to begin that process. They are not regulated by FCC or CPUC, so no government regulatory help is available. Basically, the employee committed fraud by informing me incorrectly. That is a crime, not a civil matter. I am in process of dealing with the City and County's DA offices, but it appears they have more important things to deal with - plus I can't prove what the employee told me. I never signed anything, but am bound by their agreement once I activate service. My service was activated by the store. T-mobile's user agreement states a phone CANNOT be returned if it HAS NOT BEEN ACTIVATED, but prepaid fees CANNOT BE REFUNDED IF IT HAS BEEN ACTIVATED. WOW - BUYER BEWARE!!!
