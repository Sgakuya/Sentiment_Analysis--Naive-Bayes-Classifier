Folks who grew up under FDR in general tend to look back on him with fondness, apparently because he was a charismatic leader who made the American people feel good about their plight and helped unite them under an ostensibly noble cause (WW2). History, I think, will eventually begin to take a dimmer view of the man. Where to begin? The court-packing scheme? His soft spot for "Uncle Joe" Stalin that led to all of Eastern Europe coming under the control of the communist dictator's iron fist? The Japanese-American internment camps? His alphabet soup of New Deal programs that were mostly a miserable failure and did nothing to alleviate the Great Depression? If it weren't for WW2, FDR would most likely be remembered as a failure every bit as much as Herbert Hoover was. A Hamiltonian in the worst sense of the word, FDR created the oppressive federal monolith and the gimme-gimme mindset that exists today. He apparently thought he should be president for life, breaking with the two-term tradition that every other president before him adhered to. He was also a shameless opportunist who would use any excuse, any tragedy, for personal and political gain. New Deal not working? Let's let Japan bomb us; then I can backtrack on my promise to stay neutral and let the war kick-start the economy. Yes, there is much speculation that FDR knew Japan was going to bomb Pearl Harbor and chose to do nothing, specifically to get us into the war. If true, there's a lot of blood on his hands. Even if not, his shameless opportunism is well-known, even among his supporters. He had no regard for the Constitution or on reasonable limits on government power -- all that mattered, much as with Bill Clinton years later, was his own legacy. A contemptible man who duped a lot of people by being able to talk a good game.
