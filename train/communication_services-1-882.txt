To follow up on other comments and to add that I agree that STI mobile is a total rip off, let me add these comments. They say send an Email to cancel web browsing (0.19/day), well I sent 2 emails, no response to either one. After literally hours on hold I finally got to speak to a rep (whose English skills were minimal at best), and he informed me that the charges have been applied, even though I sent Emails and have never used the service! I am filing a complaint with the FCC and BBB and if there is others in the same boat, please respond to this letter and we will petition for a class action legal action. A business like STI must be stopped from ripping off everybody, and they do not respond to any other form of protest.
