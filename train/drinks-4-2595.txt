Come on admit it! You know you cannot ignore the lure of coffee and a nice freshly made doughnut. If you walk into a dunkin donuts and get only coffee while you sit there, then you are better suited for a low fat, skim milk, sugar free, decaffeinated, latte (hold the cinnamon please) with a sugar free hard as granite scone at starbucks. I have a special place in my heart for DD coffee from all the memories as a kid all the way to graduate student studying at 1 AM for a final while drinking a large coffee with a sinful Ã©clair followed by an assortment of munchkins (if you do not know what these are then you were raised in a communist block state (New Hampshire?) and just made it out). Overall, it will always be a good coffee for me.
