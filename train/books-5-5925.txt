Dr. Kay Scarpetta is a great character and all of Cornwell's books are interesting and well written. But with every new installment in the series she has put more stress on Scarpetta's friends and their lives.. and less on the mystery at hand and the forensics. This is mistake, I think. I really don't care how tasteful her house is.. or what a wonderful and talented person her niece is. (She isn't.) I care about how she goes about solving unsolvable cases through forensics. I also wish she would find a new bad guy. This ridiculous werewolf person is getting tedious. He isn't even believable. I wish she would go back to her original strengths.
