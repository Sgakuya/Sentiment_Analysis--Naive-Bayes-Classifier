An almost four. Better than I expected. I thought at first that this would be a teenager movie since most of the cast is under 21. but it is more like teenagers are in this but the content is more interesting. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannson are both good as just graduated girls. they like to follow people they see in restaurants they find intersting. after seeing an add in a couples section Enid meets this one man to see what he is like at first it is to kind of make fun of him but soon they become friends. a kind of quirky movie. but pretty well done.Steve Buscemi is also good as the man they meet from the ad.
