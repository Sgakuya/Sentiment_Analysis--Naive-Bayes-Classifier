Here's one we've got to keep our eye on. For quite a few years, the news out of Iran was quite positive, with a burgeoning reform movement taking root, despite the continued influence of the mullahs in that nations politics. The election of Ahmadinejad this past summer represents a significant reversal in these trends. He was able to ride to victory through a populist, religious message. His election occurred for a variety of factors, among them a weak economy, strong support from the religious and military establishment, and international developments, specifically the West's confrontational stance with regards to nuclear weapons. Iran contends that since they are surrounded by nuclear powers (Russia, Pakistan, Israel, and India), that they should also be permitted to have a deterrent. Motivating this stance is the US invasion of Iraq, which increases their influence in the region. Tensions with the US put a damper on the reform movement in Iran which led up to the election of Ahmadinejad and most likely confrontation with the US over Iran's nuclear program. In fact, it is becoming increasingly likely, at the rate events are going, that the US may make tactical strikes on Iran's nuclear development sites as soon as next year. Since coming to power, Ahmadinejad has banned Western music and claimed that the Holocaust never occurred, suggesting that Israel should be wiped off the map and re-located to Europe. His rise can be at least partially attributable to the United States' increasingly unilateralist stance regarding sanctions and economic matters. Indeed, from Latin America to the Middle East, we are witnessing the rise of regimes which are increasingly hostile to US interests. Sometimes, its merely saber-rattling, such as is the case with Venezuelas Hugo Chavez, but Iran poses a more difficult strategic problem. His avid interest in developing nuclear weapons is well known. The concern is that there is a darker motive behind that underlies this interest. The fear is that Iran will begin to enrich uranium on its own soil and develop nuclear weapons. On the diplomatic front, Russia and Europe are trying to find solutions. Russia has offered to permit Iran to enrich uranium on its own soil so that only materials that can be used for peaceful purposes like nuclear power. Europe is trying to find a solution to Iran's desire to produce uranium, but the United States' unilateralist sanctions are making agreement very difficult to come by. However, the rise of the fringe element also does not benefit Iran, for it isolates it from the rest of the world. In fact, the political establishment in Iran might have just might have overplayed its hand by placing a hard-liner in power who is not willing to negotiate; they would have some leverage over their neighbors and the West. As the rhetoric between the US and Iran grows increasingly hostile, the potential for military action goes up. Tactical strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are becoming increasingly likely. As long as the hard-liners are in power, it is fairly unlikely that agreement can be reached. 9/11 gave us an opportunity to create a political environment in Iran that could have permitted us to shore up the reformists who were more amenable to US values and interests. Instead, the West has produced a confrontational stance that may prove costly in the long run for all the involved parties.
