Just got back from nine days on the ground in Ireland - it is, overall, a really beautiful country. A couple of negative points to address first: it's pretty expensive (real estate values are astronomical), and Dublin is pretty dirty (I'll probably do separate ratings of Irish cities). The weather was predictably rainy and overcast during most of my stay, but somewhat miraculously, it managed to clear every time I needed to take pictures. I also experieinced first-hand the joys of driving on the wrong side of the road, on very narrow country roads - I would not recommend it to anyone (maybe I'm just getting too old for that kind of radical readjustment). All of that aside, Ireland is by and large a very beautiful country. The Ring of Kerry is hard to beat for scenery. Pleanty of quaint cottages throughout the countryside (although one has to wonder where the heck people go to shop). Lots of sheep throughout the country (I went from Dublin to Cork to Galway, with plenty of short stops along the way). It also seems that every town has at least one shop that has tons of Arn knit sweaters (interestingly, the pricier sweaters made of Merino wool use woll imported from New Zealand and other places - I'm told that the Irish do not raise Merinos). Food is pretty good (especially if you like fish), people are nice enough (although I heard very few stereotypical Irish brougues), service is generally good. Interestingly, with Ireland in the EU, there are a lot of foreigners working in service industries - I ran across a number of young Poles, Italians, and one Slovak working in hotels and restaurants. The economy is thriving, and there are plenty of tourists (even in the off season). Now I can finally say I've fulfilled a lifelong ambition and been to Ireland (although I didn't kiss the Blarney Stone, despite the fact that I climbed to the top of Blarney Castle). If I were younger, I'd probably plan a return trip, but at my age, this trip will have to do.
