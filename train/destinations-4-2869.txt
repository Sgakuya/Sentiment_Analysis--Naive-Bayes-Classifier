Although this city has been my home for 18 years I will take an impartial view on it. The city is not all that expensive if you steer clear the more touristy and ritzy neighborhoods...in fact, New York is capitalist competition at its best. The city is also very efficient. Everything has its district, and the public transportation system is among one of the cheapest and most expansive in the world. You can get to nearely every crevice of the city by bus or subway in rather good time. Crime is another mis conception of the city. Although in the 70's and 80's NYC accumulated a reputation for being one of America's crime centers, the crime rate is currently alot lower then most major American cities. Although neighborhoods are improving and beautifying on their own, the main problem with NYC is the cleansliness. New York's subway really appears filthy as do many apartments. Occassionally the garbage is not picked up as often as it should be. However, this rarely occurs on a noticable level. Tourists can enjoy the city without this being a detriment to their visit. However, if you plan on living here, I'll take away 1 star. All other stereotypes are really uncalled for. Like any other city NYC is home to pricks and wonderful people, devils and saint,...there is not a noticable difference in the amount of people who are stuck up then in other cities...so any claim to nyc being the home of snobs and dirt bags really has had far too few encounters to be judging. All in all I would say this city is perfect. It has personality and I wouldn't trade it for anything. However, for the sake of judging without too much of a bias, it is a decent city.
