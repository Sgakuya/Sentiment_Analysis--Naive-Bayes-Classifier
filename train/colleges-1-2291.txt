They just really don't have it together! I enrolled withdrew within a one month span. The people in the billing/business office were rude. When I went over their heads, I couldn't get their superior to return my calls or emails. For example, they billed me almost $600 for health insurance, although I am a 26 year old, non-traditional (married) student living in a different state doing distance education. That's just the tip of the iceberg. If you hope to get good service or ANY individualized attention, forget you ever heard about this school. I personally am retreating back to the school I WAS transferring from.
