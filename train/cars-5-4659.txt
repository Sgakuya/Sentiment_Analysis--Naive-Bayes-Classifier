I own a 2000 F150 XLT 4x4 Sport Jet Black in color, 17 off road rims, skid plates, Fully loaded, Tinted windows... etc etc etc.................................. And let me tell you something... I was never a Ford man, but now I am.. I realized that the new Chevs look worse than my ass crack, and are about 5Grand more for the equivalent model in Ford.. Not to mention FORD has an awsome financing rate.. Chevs are very low to the ground, like take a look at the front end of a 2000 4x4 Silverado, and then take a a look at the front end of a F150XLT 4x4.. Theres just no comparason... FORD has more Foot pounds of torque at a much lower RPM than a Chev, and to top it all off, the Chev dealers a Freaking pricks with you, Ford has excellent customer service... 2 cents..
