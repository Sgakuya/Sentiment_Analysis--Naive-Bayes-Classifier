Released in 1980 and directed by John Landis, The Blues Brothers is the most successful film spawned by television's Saturday Night Live. The story starts with the release of Joliet Jake Blues (John Belushi) from prison who is picked up by his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) in a surplus police car. Upon visiting the orphanage where the brothers were raised, they are told by Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman) that she does not have the money to pay the property taxes. Now on a mission from God, the Blues Brothers are off to assemble the old band so they can have a charity concert. Along the way, the brothers receive inspiration from Ray Charles, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin (among others), must avoid Jake's revenge minded ex-fianc√©e (Carrie Fisher), are chased by a neo-Nazi (Henry Gibson), and elude the entire Cook County law enforcement community. This film has Belushi doing his normal thing, but is essentially made by Aykroyd's best comedic performance in a movie, the music, and the classic, over the top car chase scene through the streets of Chicago.
