Al Gore proved his worth during the 5 week election fiasco. Despite pressures from his opponent and the republican right to conceed, he fought a difficult political battle and fought for the right of Americans to have their votes count. Bush had the opportunity to have all the votes counted in the republican counties the first 72 hours of the election, which he refused to do. Why? Because he wanted to go for a sure win, by discouraging the votes being counted by not having them counted in the republican counties of Florida. Gore has been criticized for not having all the votes for all counties counted in the beginning..but that should have been Bushes responsibity to make sure his voters in republican counties were accounted for. Bush was smart enough to know that he wouldn't have the votes and would lose if republican counties were counted.He decided to go for the sure thing....and use his political croanies, Jeb Bush, the Florida Secretary of State, and lastly, the Republican majority Supreme Court as his final trump card. He's the one political figure in history who meneuvered around the peoples will, and got to be president.Gore also showed his statesmanship and love of his country by a inspiring concession speech which even touched many right wing hearts, and made many who questioned him see beneath the stiffness to the true patriot and leader he is. What a sad day in American history when the true American patriot with the most votes loses to the politician who has friends in all the right places. Some democracy!
