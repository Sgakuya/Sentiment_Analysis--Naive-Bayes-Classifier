Joe Montana 4 super bowls, 4 rings 11 touchdowns, 0 int 3 super bowl MVPs 127.8 passer rating (which is the kind of QB rating you will only see again when a top QB for some college team like USC or Oklahoma is pounding some college like Southeastern Backwater State 60-3). He is also the author of 31 4th quarter comebacks. You can't say he did it because of a system like the West Coast Offense. Is Michael Jordan a bum because he played in Phil Jackson's Triangle Offense? 49er offensive coach Mike Holmgren says it didn't work until the right QB came along, Joe Montana. Many one-hit wonders came along, like the Jim McMahon Chicago Bears, and Phil Simms' NYGiants, but teams adjusted. Still, year after year, teams saw teh 49ers and knew what was coming, but were confounded by Joe Montana. And Montana was no sissy, either. . .who can forget him coming back to the 49ers after major back surgery to win 2 more Super Bowls, or him playing another time with the bursa sac on his elbow swollen up so much it looked like a cantaloupe was hanging off his elbow? Don Shula, Mike Holmgren, Bill Walsh and others who have coached Hall-Of-Fame QBs of their own agree that Montana was the best. Jerry Rice, the greatest receiver ever, said the same thing, and complained about Steve Young for years because Montana read the field better, was more accurate, and threw a more catchable ball. John Elway didn't win until he embraced the team concept and let Terrell Davis carry some of the load. Marino was prob the best passer and had the quickest release ever, but had too big an ego to fit into anyone's system and ran two of the game's greatest coaches off the field and into retirement (Don Shula and Jimmy Johnson). Montana understood team in the beginning, and ran the field like a coach himself. Thanks for the memories Joe.
