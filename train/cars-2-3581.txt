We thought we were upgrading from a Windstar to an Explorer. With 2 kids in carseats and a dog, we have no room! The 3 person bench in the rear seat is not big enough for 3 people. We are squashed! FORD really gets ya if you dont choose a 3rd seat option from the beggining because now we cannot add one, our truck was not equipped structurally for it. That is so lame and inexcuable. There is no room in the front to move around, or place a purse, etc if someone else is in the passenger seat. The cargo area is big, but that is about it! Odd shaped plastic pieces continually fall apart from under the seats in the back. This isnt even 6 months old and we already need all new shocks as well. Very deceiving from the outside. After a couple of weeks, we wished for our old Windstar back, this is waaaay too small and seeming cheaply made.
