Perhaps the greatest hurdle JP was up against was the conflict of the dinsosaur special effects with the story. There is no doubt that JP pioneered these particular special effects, and in a way, this is what sets apart a good SF/FA from the wannabees: making the movie work with effects that may not enthrall the audience enough to get them to suspend their belief. For example: every dinosaur movie which preceeded JP is absolutely flat in that there is no natural movement by the 'stars' of the show, and it is immediately seen that the effects are contrived. The advent of the computer brought a totally different approact to making these movements natural, and the viewer has a difficult time realizing that these things are not real.
