Boston appeals to me mainly because it has so much to offer the history buff. A walk along and around the Freedom Trail is to experience the early American story at its finest. The surroundings in and near the city are gorgeous--pleasant parks, lakes, rivers and (during Summer) beaches are all within a short walk or drive. Contrary to what others have said here, I generally find the people to be very friendly. And is there any finer baseball venue than Fenway Park? I hesitate to give Boston 5 stars though because traffic (even away from the Big Dig) typically is horrendous, the climate is uncomfortably cold in the Winter, and a visit here anytime can become very expensive very quickly.
