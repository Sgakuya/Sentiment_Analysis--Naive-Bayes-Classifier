Wow pretty low ratings for this car, I almost feel like a tool for driving one....NOT!! Are you kidding me? Lets look at the numbers here: 260hp + 280lbs-ft = SMOKE YO ASS!! And the TAPshift paddles on the steering wheel lend to a driving experience that is FAR from mundane. I admit the new style took awhile to grow on me, but now I actually prefer the current body style over the 97-03 models. The Grand Prix GTP w/Comp-G is an all around performer, perfect for long distance cruises or the dragstrip. In fact there is a very good chance I'll be going to hell, because of some of the things I've done in this car...Truly a guilty pleasure. >>>>>Clearly... I've struck a nerve...
