This movie's purpose revolved around having a scene with a depiction of gratuitous sex acts covered by bad digital imagry. While Cruise's character does undergo a downward spiral which is entertaining in some respects and tedious in others, the plot was without a good deal of merit. Additionally, the camera work was a bit too edgy leaving it hard on the eyes. This would be okay, but I was trying my best not to get up and leave my seat anyway. This is with little doubt, Kubrick's worst work of all time. In my opinion, if you want to make pornography or perhaps art eroticism, you don't need to take two hours getting there, and you might as well make pornography.
