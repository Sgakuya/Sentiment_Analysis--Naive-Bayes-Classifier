Because you can travel (rush) through it easily because it is small, plan ahead to satisfy your interests. Cape Cod beaches- as beautiful as Caribbean, but much more expensive. (a three month swim season). Much better than French Riviera. Boston- a walkers paradise, no background in history is needed, because the experience presents itself. (The Big Dig is not a tourist stop; it's a taxpayers trap. Stay away if you can.) Quincy Market is historically significant, but do leave your money and your Visa card at home. For lunch buy picnic materials and stroll, sit, munch and interact on any of several beautiful college campuses- even in the suburbs. Western Mass Berkshires is a deservedly recognized cultural center. The views are significant only at foliage time.
