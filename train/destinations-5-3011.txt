Vancouver my hometown. Voted best city in the world twice.. a great city with unique flavour... and great beauty.. this city is the Beauty of Canada... Nestled by the Pacific Ocean and beautiful Mountains. Vancouver has been given a great repuation as one of the best in cities in the world. Largest shipping port on the Westcoast, of North America. A hustling business and a growing city at an alarming rate. Vancouver's population tops at 2 Million people. Expensive because of its beauty and nature and well worth the price. I love my city. see Vancouver at the 2010 Winter World Olympics and the World Junior Hockey Championship. Westsiiiiiiide!
