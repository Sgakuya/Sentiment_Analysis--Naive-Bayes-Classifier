Lok'tar Cho'gall! The latest installment in the ongoing Warcraft Saga features not only Orcs and Humans but hordes of slavering undead and packs of environmentalist night elves. The plot is a typical example of the tried and true blizzard formula, betrayal, deception and rifts between former allies. The age old problem of massing units and winning by sheer force of numbers has been remedied with much greater restrictions on army sizes and greater reprimands for having a large force, the focus now is much more on strategy and developing your heroes (quite satisfying actually). The inclusion of the night/day feature seemed a little superfluous though. As with any Blizzard game there are little snippets of dialogue when you click on your various warmongers too many times (my favorite is when the reaction you get from the female sorceress You don't get out much, do you?). This game is overall, humorous, fun and very much improved even from its mighty predecessor.
