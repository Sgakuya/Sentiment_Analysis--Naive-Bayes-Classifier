Al Pacino is an amazing actor. I can't believe that Serpico (1973) is hardly mentioned on this site! It is one of my favourite films and is based on a true story, where Frank Serpico joins the NYPD and is inadvertently exposed to corruption. He opposed the idea of pay-offs and criminal protection, and finds himself in a difficult situation when his corrupt colleagues don't want to work with him unless he co-operates. A fantastic film with powerful, energetic acting from Pacino. Other good examples of his work include The Godfather trilogy (although Part II is my favourite), Scarface, Dog Day Afternoon, Heat and Carlito's Way. Even Scent of a Woman, although too lengthy, involved a strong performance. I appreciate that some of his recent work has involved Pacino playing himself, but that works well where the storyline is less than interesting (for example, Insomnia). Overall fave film is Serpico - check it out if you can!
