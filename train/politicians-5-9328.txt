With the possible exceptions of Reagan, Tyler, and McKinley, Calvin Coolidge is our most underestimated president. He presided over one of the longest and strongest periods of economic expansion in the nation's history. He cut taxes twices, kept the government budget small, and (with Harding) ceased the progressive drive towards eroding the Constitutional limitations of the goverment. While he was a bit too protectionist and didn't properly keep an eye on the folly committed by the federal reserve (which ended up causing the depression), he did defend the liberty promised by this country. Additionally, Coolidge never would have conceded these values like Hoover did in times crisis. This man was flanked by two failed presidencies and followed a rather immoral and corrupt man with a morally far more superior administration. He was certainly one of the best to hold his office.
