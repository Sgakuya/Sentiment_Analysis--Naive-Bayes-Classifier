At the 2004 All-Star Game, many talking heads (Stephen A. Smith, anyone?) hemmed and hawed about Carmelo Anthony or LeBron James being snubbed for the game. As usual, no one bothered to bring evidence to back up their claims. At the All-Star Break, Elton Brand was probably the league's third-best player, behind only Garnett and Duncan. He was also single-handedly keeping the Clippers near the playoffs. To say that he was shafted out of the All-Star fun was probably the largest understatement in NBA history. More disturbing, though, was the indignation on the commentators' part over Anthony's absence at the Game, when he was lagging well behind Brand in every statistical category... and if they had a meaningful way to measure defense, he would be trailing in that, too. I hope they didn't genuinely believe that Anthony was better, though the alternative was worse: that they took the side of the more popular Anthony over the unassuming Brand to boost their credibility. Either way, the pundits have got a lot to learn about exactly what wins basketball games.
