So I guess the Left needs a new whipping boy, since they can't figure out how to demonize GWB. But what has DeLay done to merit this? He was key in getting House Repubs to inspect the evidence collected by the independent counsel during impeachment (Dems didn't bother to read through witness testimony, but why should that trouble anyone?), which led them to vote for the articles. Sounds like a bread and butter Texas conservative to me, and not the bigoted self-centered Nazi that some moron on this board claims. Sure, he believes in the Constitution and traditional moral values. I differ with him on several issues, but I won't join in the charade that he's a bad person.
