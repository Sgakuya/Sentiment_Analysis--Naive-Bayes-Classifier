I don't care what other jealous young men say (get a life, boys), Leo is a true gift to this generation. He is by far one of the most talented actors around, any age hands down. He has a long and rich career ahead of him. He could've easily gone the route of the Brat Pack and done a bunch of cheesy, cutesy little comedies but he has shown smarts in choosing unflashy, gritty and realistic roles. He's been awesome in just about all of his movies (except Man in the Iron Mask, which was just WEIRD!) and I'm looking forward to seeing him in his new movie The Gangs of New York, it's coming out this month. He totally deserved an Oscar nomination for Gilbert Grape and he was robbed of one for Titanic. Go Leo!
