I might have given the Cheesecake Factory higher marks if the factory made better than average cheesecake. They make the typically dense, topped with fake fruit topping that a diner would expect from a chain of restaurants of much less quality. I must admit that I've only had superior cheesecake once. It was very light in consistency, smooth in texture with an obvious cheese taste. The cake was tall yet could be cut without the cake falling apart and instead of eating something equivalent to lard it was whipped with air so that it melted in your mouth. The dense hard cheese cakes are not even close to the fine cheesecake I described.
