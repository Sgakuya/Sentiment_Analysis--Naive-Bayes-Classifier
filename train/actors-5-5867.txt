Leonardo DiCaprio is the one actor who can get me into a theater on his name alone regardless of the film. That's how talented I think he is ... quite simply the best of the best. I've seen all his films except Critters 3 and he delivers the goods every single time from This Boy's Life to The Beach. Even when the material he has to work with is weak he somehow manages to transcend it. As for his looks - he's definitely HOT. He has a beautiful, expressive face, the best eyes and eyebrows in the universe, perfect lips, and now that he has filled out and matured somewhat, he's the complete package, head to toe gorgeous.
