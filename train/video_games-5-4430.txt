Wow, Age of Kings, a classic. Perhaps the only game to date which allows one to control the armies of Joan of Arc, William Wallace, El Cid, Attilla the Hun and many other historical greats. The format of the game is Real time on an isometric grid and yes, you guessed it: building a huge army quicker then the other guy and destroying his town center quickly is far more important then complex strategy. Predictably this makes gameplay linear but who cares when it's this much fun? The graphics are still very intricate and detailed even though the game is now rather dated. You should be able to pick up the gold edition along with the conquerers expansion quite cheaply now if you're looking for a nice and simple old fashioned gather-resources-to-build-armies-and-pillage-em-up.
