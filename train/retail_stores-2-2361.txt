I visited WinCo Foods store #0009 in Portland, Oregon late on the evening of 11/10/04. I was purchasing sparkling cider for a birthday party the following day. When I was in line to pay, Julie O. (the cashier) hollered across 2-3 lanes to the next cashier, telling him that the supervisor said that he needed to stop talking and start checking. At first I thought she was kidding, but after repeating it at least 3 times, it became apparent that she was serious. It was no doubt embarrassing to the other checker, and very inappropriate. Then, after paying for the cider, I grabbed a few extra paper bags to wrap around the bottles for protection. Julie very loudly and rudely told me that I could NOT do that, and that I would need to pay for the extra bags. I can appreciate the fact that extra bags would be extra, but her tone and attitude left a LOT to be desired! I left the store very irritated, and am not sure I will return.
