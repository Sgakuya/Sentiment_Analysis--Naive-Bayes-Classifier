Numerous must-see tourist sites:Arc de Triomphe,the Champs Elysees,Eiffel Tower,Notre Dame,Montmartre,The Louvre,Versailles,the Pompidou Centre,the bateaux mouches boat-trips on the Seine(like Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade ), and the beautiful Sacre Coeur.Perhaps not the cleanest of cities,but i didn't find it any dirtier than London and the Metro is superior to London's.The weather's also better.The queues for taxis i found chaotic compared to what i'm used to in Britain,took a while to realise it's every man and woman for him/her self,no quarter given.The people i found no more or less friendly than others,though it's probably an advantage to speak the language( the French tend to be less at ease with English than most European nationalities.)Sitting outside on the terrace cafes is pleasant.My wife was delighted with the shopping,agrees with me it's quite a romantic city.Beware the prices at the artists' quarter at Montmartre- i fell for this as a teenager and had to walk round the whole city instead of getting the underground as a result-tiring but memorable,as it turned out.I spent several Easters there,on school exchanges,when younger,and was in madly in love with a French girl when a young man,so i have fond memories.Can't resist saying, I love Paris in the Springtime (i'm sure this is the best time to go).
