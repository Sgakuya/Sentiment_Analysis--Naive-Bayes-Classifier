An absolutely hysterical series of books, but like a lot of cult classics, you either get it or you don't. ClassicTvFan obviously didn't, but the rest of the people on here seem to have. These books make no attempt to take themselves seriously, and that makes them a thoroughly enjoyable read. No one else on here has mentioned it, but there was a book released from stuff found on one of Douglas Adams' hard drives, called the Salmon of Doubt. While not a true Book exactly, it's worth a read if you're a serious Adams fan. I read it, and it made me truly sorry that Adams passed away. I think he still had a lot of good books in him, and it's a shame they never got out.
