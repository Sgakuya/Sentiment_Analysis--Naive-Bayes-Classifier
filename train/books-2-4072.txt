This is one of the more notable entries in the literary canon that crunchy granola touchy feely types in the 1960s and early 1970s drooled over. I re-read this not long ago and was somewhat amused at how puerile and naive, poorly written and shallow this supposed great philosophical novel is. This is nothing more than a ripoff of Candide and not nearly as well told, engaging or entertaining. A faux spiritual piece written in a most hokey and prosaic style. Hesse is one of the most overrated novelists in western literature who was a fad for a brief period during the days of the counterculture, but was eventually assigned to the scrapheap of triviality and insignificance shortly afterward, and rightfully so.
