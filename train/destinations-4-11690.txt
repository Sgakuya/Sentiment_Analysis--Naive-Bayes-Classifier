Padre was amazing, but the best tips I can give are these: 1) If you have a fake ID, be VERY careful w/ it, or a $275 fine is coming (but go see the judge b/c he will lower it atleast 75-100)...if you feel like testing it out at a club, go to Louies after 11 b/c there are about 25 ppl taking IDs and you can find one who doesn't care. 2) When you put down your deposit, do it w/ a credit card or you won't see it again...we took 12 guys and those who paid credit got it back, those that did cash didn't. 3) While the entire beach is a party, make sure you hit up Coca Cola beach at the south end...if you are staying up north (i.e. the Bahia mar) get your ass down there even though it's a long walk. So that's my input, great place to get wasted and meet ladies!
