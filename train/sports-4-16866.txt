They looked pretty weak this evening vs. the Colts and the secondary got shredded. Congratulations to Peyton Manning. He played a great game. Once again the Pats have been decimated by injuries on the defense. Regardless of what happens this year the Patriots are a dynasty. Nowadays its almost unheard of to have a football team win 3 of 4 Super Bowls. The only other teams in the last 20 years as dominant would be the Cowboys and possibly the 49ers. Other than that no other team comes close to New England. It may not be too late to change the momentum and get back into the playoffs. They have the best coach and best QB in the league. I believe Brady is still superior to Manning as he performs at his best in big games and has fewer weapons on offense. And to all you dirtbags leaving stupid comments, please do some research before shouting out and crawl back under the rock you came out from. Thanks for listening!
