senator-elect obama is an intelligent young man with excellent oratory skills and has come into national prominence at at time when the black community is dominated by extreme left wing leaders who tend to irritate most non-black americans. mr. obama gave a rousing speech at the democratic national convention and has a bright future in national politics, but indicating that he will be the first black president is a bit premature. he is still the junior senator from illinois and has yet to serve a single day in the u.s. senate. i wish him well and i sincerely hope he can change the victimization that is plaguing the dialogue coming from leaders such as jesse jackson, al sharpton, and that spiteful hag maxine waters.
