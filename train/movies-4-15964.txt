This was a good movie about a man named sam who is academically challenged and has some autistic tendancies and he has a little 7 year old daughter named Lucy. They haev a good father daughter bond and Sam is a loving father that is devoted to his daughter but when she starts school the trouble begins where they take Lucy away because sam is not qualified enough to raise a kid. So when Sam gets a lawyer to help him get his daughter back they go through the long court cases doind everything they can to make Sam out to be the bad guy. Lucy although knows that her dad is a good caring dad who would do anything to keep her safe. Sean Penn did a good job at playing Sam. This movie was a sweet heart warming movie.
