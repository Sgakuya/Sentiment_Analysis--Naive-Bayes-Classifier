An excellent leader on and off of the field. Green threw for an amazing 4500+ yards in the 2004 season, second only to Daunte Culpepper. He should have been a pro-bowler. He's had some excellent games in the clutch. As I recall, KC hasn't lost big games since he came on board because of offensive issues... 2005 is supposedly a down year for Green... He's only thrown the more yards than any other quarterback this year besides Tom Brady. With 4,014 passing yards, Green has led the Chiefs to be the ranked #1 in offense in the NFL. Why can't everyone admit it? He is an elite quarterback. He deserves to be mentioned with the likes of Peyton Manning and Carson Palmer... seriously. UPDATE: For the fourth straight year, Green had a 90+ QB rating. This is only the third time a QB has done that in the history of the NFL. It's also his second season in a row throwing 4,000+ yards. Green is going to be a QB in the ProBowl for the second time in his career.
