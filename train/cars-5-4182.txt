My family has had a 1997 Subaru Legacy Outback for 6 years now and it has NEVER given us any trouble. Sure, it isn't very powerful, but its not supposed to be. Thats what the Impreza and WRX wagons are for. The Outback is very reliable, very safe, and has done everything we've asked it to. When you fold down the back seat, you have a huge amound of cargo space. My mom used this car to completly re-landscape our front yard and she carried all her plants, supplies, dirt, rocks, and tools in the back of her Subaru. If you want a performance wagon, the Outback wont satisfy as much as other cars will but for a tough and reliable everyday car, the Subaru Outback is the perfect car for the job.
