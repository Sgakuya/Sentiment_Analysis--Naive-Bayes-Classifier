I love this Album!!! I'm a die-hard Metallica fan and I don't have a single album that has disappointed me yet. I've noticed there are quite a few people here who complain about every album after about Master of Puppets. I think it's just them showing off how they can do other things other than just play hard, speed metal.... Low Man's Lyric, Mama Said, Nothing Else Matters....they're some of my favorite songs. St. Anger is what they created to A)try to go back to their roots and B)take some things here and there from current bands like System of a Down. Nobody complained when they took inspiration from bands like Motorhead in the '80s...why complain now? Metallica is the best heavy metal band to walk the planet. They'll be around for a bit longer, call them whatever you want or say whatever you want...they probably don't care anyways!!! METALLICA FOREVER!!!
