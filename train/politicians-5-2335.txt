It is amazing that a man that my father briefly went to high school with in the Bronx, N.Y. is currently on a track that may lead to the white house. Mr. Powell probably be a heavy favorite to succeed George W. if he were white and had conservative views. In reading Mr. Powell's autobiography, I belive he fully remembers his roots. His support of affirmative action in the face of overwhelming opposition in the Republican party should show that he is one who is in tune with the aspirations of African-Americans. While the idea of a V.P. or Pres Powell is a interesting thought, I feel that too many people are looking to Mr. Powell to be something he is not. A V.P. or Pres. Powell cannot solve the racial problems in America. It instead will take a collective effort by all of us.
