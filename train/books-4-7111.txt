I'm don't know why this very good book(also very short, if I remember correctly) is rated so low. People find in depressing, I suppose. It takes place in the aftermath of a nuclear war that has devastated civilization. Life survives, and society slowly recovers from the catastrophe, retracing its earlier progress from tribes to kingdoms to empires and finally space-age nations, once again. The story takes place in snapshots, skipping at the end of each one by several thousand/hundred years. Each time we are introduced into a new historical period, so the novel is really a series of smaller stories, inside the larger story of makind's evolution. In a way, Canticle is closer to mainstream fiction than most SF: it is neither space opera nor 'hard' (intellectual) SF, but a parable of man's tragic yet inevitable tendency towards destruction, ending in MADness (Mutually Assured Destruction). There are also endless recurring religious themes (Catholic), some of them a bit over-done. OK if you like that kind of thing. Some stuff is dated, too (it was writen back in the 50s, I think). I do remember being very impressed with this book when I first read it, though.
