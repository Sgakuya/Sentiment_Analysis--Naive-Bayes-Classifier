i think he is so awesome. he is so sweet in dawson's creek. i mean he didn't even get upset when gretchen told him that joey lied to dawson. i think that was great. he knew she had to do what she had to do. i mean dawson is better off with gretchen anyway. joey and pacey make a better catch. but when gretchen told him that i thought he was going to be mad but he supported her decision. i saw a preview of upcoming episodes and is joey pregnant by pacey? i think that is what it looked like! i hope so! can anyone write me and tell me if this happens!!!! blair ps- he has the cutest voice and prettiest eyes also.
