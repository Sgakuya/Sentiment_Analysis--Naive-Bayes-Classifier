TRULY Spectacular DOMINANT!! Michael Who? Charles Could score, Charles was much better on Defense, steals, REBOUND- 20+ /a night; ( could MJ even rebound, 5/ night- NO!!; oh, he's a G, well, look at what Jason Kidd pulls down a night, 11.) Dunking, ball control , passing, team leadership, positioning, intimidation- Charles was the COMPLETE PLAYER. MJ Could dunk/jump and exploited it(and later became better). Wilt exploited his vast size advantage. Charles did Everything as well or better than All, at 6' 41/2 !! He played COMPLETE Basketball, NOT just exploiting ONE natural advantage. This is Rare. Top 3 Spot, if NOT #1. .....
