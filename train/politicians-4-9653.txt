LBJ was not responsible for affirmative action; that was a Nixon program. He was however responsible for ending segregation as America new it. He also, cut poverty in half with Great Society programs, which despite reputation were largely succesful. Did escalate Vietnam, but war had reached point of no return once Kennedy authorized Diem's removal from power (which ended in Diem's death, as Kennedy knew, or should have known, it would). Idea that he was behind Kennedy's assasination is beyond idiotic; no proof has been produced, and while LBJ was not above getting his hands dirty he never went beyond graft and the occasional electoral chicanery (both of which Kennedy was also quite guilty of). Has been slandered so Kennedy could be sainted, and is due for a reevaluation.
