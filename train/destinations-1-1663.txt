Two words: Ganga, mon. And what kinda freaky religion is that there Rastafarian mumbo-jumbo? It's a small, rather bland, insignificant nation on the face of the planet. Their economy relies heavily upon tourists from Europe and America (not that real Americans would deign to set foot on that impoverished country, what with all those drugs and Miss Cleo look-alikes). Why do so many of them there Jamaicans come to America? 'Cuz it's the SUPERIOR nation! Montego Bay? Kingston? Puh-leez. Tourist traps to the nth degree. Drug-infested, immoral sorts live there. Hey, remember the Jamaican bobsledders? How moronic and nebbish can you get? AMERICA, BAY-BEE!!!!
