The Eagles keep silencing the critics. They are undeniably the best team in the NFC. They should make it to the Super Bowl pending that the whole team doesnt come down with a freak illness. Now, once they get their they should give the AFC team, whomever it is, a run for their money. This team has talent, they have charisma, and they are hungry and tired of being called chokers. They have a top 3 quarterback, the top reciever, and one of the most exciting, up and coming running backs in the NFL. They have numerous weapons on offense and defense. They have won blow outs and they have won close games against very good defenses. The Eagle's own defense has also become much more effective these last 5 games. These are the facts, all you haters out there can yell and scream all you want, but it is what it is.
