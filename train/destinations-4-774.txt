Okay,I'm giving it such a high rating because I live here.So sue me. 'Everybody knows that lots of Canadians don't like the US simply because they have a historic jealousy.Americans wins canadians in all.'-Khalid Ever hear of the War of 1812?It was a war between The US of A and Canada (which,technically,wasn't a country at that point in time;it was a war between Americans and British immagrants inhabiting what would soon become Canada).We are the only country in history to burn down the White House.(Not sure if I should be proud of that..) Our government is terrible.The Liberals (I'm from Saskatchewan,mind you) don't care about people who don't vote liberal.And the fact that we have a Queen is just sad.(I respect her,but do we really need her?) And we aren't cold all of the time.Unless you live near the ARCTIC CIRCLE.Which VERY FEW people do. Heck,Saskatchewan is considered to be nearly a desert;it gets that hot in the summer. Did you know that Superman,the telephone,and basketball were all invented by Canadians?We have plenty of things to be proud of,though we shouldn't go overboard. And to that one guy who said our accent is annoying-chew on this. EVERY COUNTRY has a distinct accent.They just don't notice that they have one. And personally,I can't stand the Deep-South American accent (Louisiana being the acception).That accent annoys the CARP out of me. kthxbi
