An easy candidate for the worst video gaming console of all time. Bill Gates should have never thrown his rich hat into the video gaming arena. The X-Box is a hideous looking beast that is oversized and plain ugly. It is also unreliable and noisy. The controller is a monster than is hard to handle, but easy to drop. I have to admit I love the colored, gel-filled buttons though. The game selection is dreadful. Like Sony, Microsoft has no Mario or Sonic-like mascot to lift its gaming library to greatness. Instead, it relies on Halo, easily the most overrated game ever. I played the First Person Shooter and was bored instantly. Where's the creativity? Where's the character? And, when do I get to save the world? Those were all questions I asked when playing Halo. Why did I buy this? That's the question you should be asking yourself if you bought Microsoft's Ick-Box over Nintendo's immortal GameCube.
