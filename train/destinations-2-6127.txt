Kentucky is a beautiful state. Expansive rolling lawns, perfectly clipped grass and horse heaven. Here and there you'll find very genteel southern towns with Victorian showcase housing. Although the scenery is pretty I didn't feel very welcome here. Although the rolling green estates are nice to look at, it seemed like private property galore and I got the feeling that this territory was very Keep out or we'll release the hounds kind of place. On the flip side the city of Lexington is very boring with not a damn thing to do and a crappy downtown and Louisville looked very poor as did a lot of other areas so I felt Kentucky is a place of Haves and Have nots. I was looking forward to coming here and unfortunately I was disappointed when I did.
