Taxi Driver Silence Of The Lambs are the great moments of her career. In both she wasn't the one carrying the picture. Silence had Buffalo Bill(Ted Levine) Hannibal Lector(Hopkins) carrying her. Taxi Driver had Travis Bickle(DeNiro) and Martin Scorsese carrying her. She is occassionally very good, but she is more often appearing lathargic and disinterested on film. Beautiful? Not in my eyes(granted on of them isn't real). Intelligent? Seems to be. The best thing I can say about her is that she does take roles that aren't designed to garner glamour and cash. She does appear to have more integrity than actual ability.
