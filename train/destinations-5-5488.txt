Hartford is indeed a basket case- but change is slowly coming- and perhaps this old and historic state capital well again prosper- Hartford is surrounded by some very attractive suburbs- some of the best in the northeast- and the quality of life would put many areas of the nation in envy. New Haven is a city also rebuilding- with Yale as a center-this old city is making great strides. Eastern CT is a gem- and is slowly being discovered by Bostonians, New Yorkers and Californians with its small towns,quiet living, culture, wineries and history- its closeness to the sea and mild climate are among its many treasures. This state has issues-like slow job growth, some cities in stress, and at times a climate that is not pleasant-however the plus factors outweigh the negatives- and overall the state offers one of the highest qualities of life in the USA. The concept of old money and pretention is a falacy- for in this state there is wealth-but there also is incredible diversity- from rich and up and coming professionals- to new immigrants and gritty blue collar people of simpe means. Connecticut citizens by in large are a tolerant bunch- be they blue or white collar, old money or new money- or ethnically white, black,Latino or Asian- and tend not to judge quickly.
