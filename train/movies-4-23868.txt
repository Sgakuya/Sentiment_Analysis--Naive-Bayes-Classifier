When I heard that they were planning on making a motion picture based on the highly successful video game, I must be honest, I had my doubts. After all, Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter were both jokes at the Box Office, so why would this film be any different? However, after seeing it, I must say that I was quite impressed- the acting, the storyline, the special effects- all of it was good. I agree with PBeavr- this film probably disappointed many fans of the game due to its lack of gore, but it probably faired much better with people who had never played the video game. Overall, it was fairly suspenseful and a good film. Reccomended!
