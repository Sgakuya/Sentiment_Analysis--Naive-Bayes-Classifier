Gotta love Alan Rickman. He is one of the most delicious villains in film history. He was the only thing I liked about Die Hard (sorry Bruce, your cowboy act was kind of grating), and the only good thing about Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves. He is over-the-top without being too hammy. Unfortunately, he can be pretty bland in non-villain roles, and he looks uncomfortably restrained in the Harry Potter films (because he is kind of a villain, but not really). It sounds like a back-handed compliment when I say that he is brilliant at playing characters who are one-dimensionally wicked, but I assure you I have complete respect for the man and his approach to the craft.
