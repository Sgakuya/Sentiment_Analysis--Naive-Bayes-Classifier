This film is great for kids! It has the normal Disney style animation and the story line is just about modern and futuristic enough for the kids of the new generation to enjoy! The characters are interesting and the whole film has a few morals which you and your children will pick up on. Action sceens are great and will keep the little ones on the edge of their seats! The adaption of the orginal Tresure Isleland is definatly something different and will capture the imagination of the viewers young or old. I really enjoyed the film and think that its one of the best that Disney have come up with for a long time..
