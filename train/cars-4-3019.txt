The MX-5 Miata is an excellent small sportscar and one of the best bangs-for-the-buck you car going to find regarding sportscars. If you can fit in the small tight cabin, you will be in for a treat regarding handling and road feel. If you are long of leg or generally of large size, you will either find the little two seater a bit snug or simply too small to be comfortable, especially for runs over a half-hour or so. But, if you fit the car is easy to like. Not really an econo-box, the car can make 30 MPG on the highway. It don't have a lot of room, in the cabin or in the trunk but it has enough baggage space for one and even two if you travel light. There have been three versions of the MX-5/Miata to date, with the newest just coming on-line as I read this. All have essentially the same strengths and complaints and even though the newest is apparently slightly larger, from intitial reports, it probably still isn't going to be a car for a really 'big guy'. Is the MX-5/Miata a chick car? Sure, but it's also a great handling car for anyone who appreciates great handling cars. It's a sportscar in the origninal definition. Not extremely powerful but, plenty of grunt to get you going fast and enough tire and suspension sophistication that you don't need a huge engine to be quite fast on a road or a road course. If you like sportscars, you probably have considered a MX-5/Miata sometime on another. If you haven't driven one, you're missing out on an experience that don't require you to be Warren Buffet to afford. Performance and reliablity for a decent price. That's the MX-5/Miata
