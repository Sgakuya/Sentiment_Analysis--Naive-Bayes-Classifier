Mark Twain's novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is a good read for anybody interested in Mark Twain's opinion on racism. The reader's view on racism also affects the perception of Mark Twain as a controversial author. When the word nigger is used in the novel, readers may assume that Mark Twain is racist. For example, when the steamboat crashed Aunt Sally said Good gracious! Anybody hurt? Then the watchman replied No'm, killed a nigger. This shows that niggers are not valued as much as a white person would be if he died. The reader could view this as two different ways. Mark Twain could be viewed as being a racist or he is making a point that racism predominated in the South before the Civil War. Also, to make a point that Mark Twain is not racist, when Jim ran away from Mrs. Watson because she was going to sell him, he came into contact with Huck Finn. Huck Finn found out why Jim had escaped and he began to help him. This shows that it didn't matter to Huck why Jim had escaped or the fact that he is a nigger, but that he was in need of help. Mark Twain continued to follow Huck Finn and Jim as Jim continued to find his way back to his family. In effect, Mark Twain is writing about Jim's quest for freedom and how a young white boy with not much to offer helps him. To conclude, Mark Twain writing can either offend a reader or can show a reader that Twain was revealing the racial situation at the time period. Twain uses Huck Finn to show that a nigger should be treated as humanly as a white person.
