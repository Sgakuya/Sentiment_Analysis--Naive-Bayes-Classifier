The Stratosphere is not on the strip so you will have to take a cab to get there if you are staying on the strip. The cab ride from our hotel(Bellagio)to the Tower was $14.00. The cost to go up to the tower was $12.00 per person so it is a little costly;even hotel guests must pay to go to the top. If you are at all afraid of heights-dont't go to the top! The restaraunt offers a fantastic view of Las Vegas, we would suggest going at night. When you are at the top the windows are curved and there is nothing underneath you since the tower is round so it is a little nervewracking, but it is fun to walk around and look through the telescopes and see ALL of Las Vegas. The casino itself wasn't all that great and it is a LONG walk to get to the line to go up to the tower itself. If you go onto the observation deck of the tower be prepared for high winds (it was 40mph when we were there)and we were told that the rides close often due to the winds so be prepared for that as well. Overall a good sight to see but there are better.
