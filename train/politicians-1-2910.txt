I have absolutely no political respect for this man. While I believe it is an exceptional to find someone who makes decisions based on his values, I would feel betrayed if I voted for him. By making this change, he has show he is not the man he said he was during the campaign; if I voted for him, it was for him as a republican, supporting the views espoused by himself and the party. He is no longer the same man. I'd push for a re-call election. Standing up for your convistions is something of which to be proud, but when you are the elected representative of the people, and you change your mind mid-stream, you should step down and let the people have someone that will stick to the platform and promises.
