Although it could have used more events, this Winter Sports game is great for anyone who just can't wait for the Torino 2006 Olympics to start (like me!!!). With a slick ESPN presentation, Konami has put some unique spins of some classic Winter events. Sure, there are the classic button-mashing-mayhem games (Speed Skating) and the skilled-timing games (Ski Jumping), which are fun on their own. However, there's also a great Snowboarding (Half Pipe) game where you must enter a series of buttons and stick turns in a certain amount of time to pull off the move. Figure skating is the same way. Finally, there's also a full-fledged International Curling game included. The graphics are amazing--from the falling snow to the detailed players. I only wish there had been more events, difficulty levels, and detailed play-by-play banter.
