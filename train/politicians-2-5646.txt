I don't live in New York- so I really cannot make an educated analysis on this woman's accomplishments as the Senator of that state. I know that she is a power-hungry woman who simply put has used her popularity to get into office. However, she was very instrumental in securing over $25 billion dollars for cleanup and relief after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City. She also supports equality in education, educational benefits for all, a universal healthcare system and she is an environmentalist. She's no Saint, and I'm getting sick and tired of hearing about her being a strong woman just because she didn't divorce Bill Clinton after she cheated on him. What lady in her right mind would divorce the President of the United States, espescially considering that she was getting a little on the side as well. Again, she's no saint, but she's not the anti-Christ either. UPDATE: I've decided not to delete the above information out of respect for Hillary fans, but I have to drop a star for that atrocity that she calls a book. It reads much more like a State of the Union Address than a biography... she spends most of its pages talking about Bill's accomplishments in office rather than the personal words that we were promised. I guess every cent counts.
