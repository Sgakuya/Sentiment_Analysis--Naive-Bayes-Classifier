Anybody want to guess who the ONE person to agree with ClassicTVFan47 on this subject - so far, anyway - is? Me! I never thought I'd say it, but ClassicTVFan47 made a groundbreaking, beautifully concise assessment of Michael Bitter, Socialist Tub of Lard Moore. I am totally dumbfounded by this, but I'll take what I can get I suppose. Moore may or may not be a socialist, but as I am currently re-reading Atlas Shrugged, he reminds me more and more of the type of selfish (and there is nothing inherently wrong with self-interest, necessarily) bastard who wants to advance himself at the expense of those who have actually earned their fortunes. So he plays to the lowest common denominator and bitches about the wealthy in order to become wealthy. And the guy is making a killing, but unfortunately he has made as such by way of misinformation and an overall lack of integrity.
