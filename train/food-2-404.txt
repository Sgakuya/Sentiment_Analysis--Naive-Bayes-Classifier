These taste really good, but it's not really worth it putting up with mouth lacerations. It stays so crunchy that it really shreds the roof of your mouth. This is a problem that I have been hitherto unable to get around. Maybe if I affixed strips of cellophane to my hard palate it would work, but there's a very real choking risk involved in that approach. Or I could add the milk the night before and keep it in the fridge so it's not crunchy anymore when I go to eat it the next day, but that would be like eating cold mush. They should do a time elapse study of the effects of milk on the decreasing crunchiness of Cap'n Crunch in order to find the optimum time to let it sit before it becomes too mushy to be enjoyable and yet safe to eat.
