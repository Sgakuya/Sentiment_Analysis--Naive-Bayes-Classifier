I really liked this movie. It started out boring and lagging of my interest. But the movie kept stepping up the suspense. Not exactly scary but it kept me interested. Johnny Depp does an excellent job as Crane and so does Chirstopher Walken as the Headless Horseman. I've never read Washington Irving's official Sleepy Hollow but I really liked seeing some history of the headless horseman (how he loss his head and all). Tim Burton does another great job making everything dark and gloomy but at the same time keeps it beautiful. It gets better and better as the movie progresses. The only problems were that the story was sort of hard to follow b/c the characters in the story (such as the magistrates and all) weren't identified well. Too many names and not enough interaction with each character to remember who that person was. This one got four stars instead of 5 b/c the entire plot was hard to follow, it wasn't that scary, and it started off slow. But still it's pretty dang good!
