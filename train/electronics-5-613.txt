The overall design of the V220 is great. The buttons are nice and easy to read and push. The size and weight are good and it is easy to flip open. It has a button on the side for the camera and volume as well as voice dialing. The features on the phone are great. It is a camera phone and has the option of playing real music ringtones. You can download Java games to play right on the phone. Picture messaging and text messaging are very easy and convient. The battery life is alright. If you plan on talking on the phone for long hours straight be sure to have your charger handy and ready to be plugged in. It still has a long life though so you can text message and play games for a while without having to worry at all. The call quality is very well done. THe volume is great and you can hear the other person very clearly. It has a speakerphone aswell. The speed dialing makes it easy to call a friend. So does the voice dialing. This is my favorite phone. It was inexpensive and was worth every penny and more. I just absolutley love everything about this phone and everything it provides. If you don't want to spend alot of money on a phone with alot of bells and whistles, but still want a good phone this phone is for you.
