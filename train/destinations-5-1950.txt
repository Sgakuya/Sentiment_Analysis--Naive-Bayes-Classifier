First, let me say, I am proud to be an American. Yes, there are Americans who embarass me (William Jefferson Clinton comes to mind...but he may be Chinese) and give the nation a bad face. But then, how about this proud list: Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, Henry VIII, Fergie, Adolf Hitler, Nero...you get the idea. Every country has its bad seed...we just give them more air time on the nightly news. This is a young country, but we have a proud tradition. We have replaced Great Britain as the saviour and whipping boy of the world. For a country that sucks SO bad, how come everyone immigrates here and not Canada? Hmmm...
