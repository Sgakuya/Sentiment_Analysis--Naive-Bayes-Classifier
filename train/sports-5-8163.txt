Vince is a premier shooting guards in the league. SHOOTING guard. How can you say he is over-rated? How can you say he can dunk, but he can't shoot. Vince is average this year is 28 points/game. Does that mean he dunks the ball about 10 times a game plus free throws? Come on. If this was the case then it just means that the defence in the NBA is pathetic, which is not the case. How come a guy like Tracy Mcgrady got recognized as a superstar when he was playing with Vince, and look at a guy like Morris Peterson who is having an amazing year because Vince Carter has taken him under his wing, and now Morris Peterson has a very good shot at rookie of the year honours. Vince Carter is amazing, when he got hurt with jumpers knee he still played through the pain, and only missed two games. Vince is the saviour for the NBA, and his postitive attitude towards life presents himslef as the ideal role model for today's youth. Can you say that about Lattrell, Allen, or Kobe?
