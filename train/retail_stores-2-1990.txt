We (my fiance' and I) usually don't buy CDs, DVDs or games there, just computer parts & maintenance software, and at least for that they tend to be pretty good. They offer rebates on almost everything that we buy (again, we don't get CDs & etc. there), and most things end up costing at least 50% less because of it. The stores we frequent usually have pretty friendly staff, and can point out pretty good deals. We've never dealt with returns, we never had to. If you're looking for computer hardware and maintenance-type software, I'd recommend checking this place out. UPDATE: Wow, my initial comment was a 4 star rating, but I'm sad to say Best Buy has fallen out of favor for me and my husband. Best Buy used to be a dependable place for all of our computer needs, so naturally when my husband he needed a splitter of some kind, we took our trip to Best Buy. Noticing that their store layout has changed, we had to go searching for our part, and we just couldn't find it anywhere. We finally asked a member of the staff where else it could be located, and he told us that they are no longer carrying parts like those and we'll have to go to CompUSA. They still seem to be carrying hardware like DVD Burners and Hard Drives seperately, so it seems silly to me that they wouldn't carry spare wiring and such.
