Let me start by saying, yes, I am an American. I have been around the world, lived in other countries, and hands down the USA is the best, most beautiful country in the world. I get a laugh out of you people from other countries who like to cut us. I've been to your pathetic countries. Places where you get tossed in jail for saying the wrong thing, or trying to vote, or not hanging a picture of your latest dictator or religious fanatic on the wall. Go ahead and criticize us, and stay where your at, live in poverty and worry, and starve. We don't want your kind. As for us thinking we're the best and always right, let me tell ya something, we have the right to our national policy and opinions. This is a country where we are allowed to voice our opinions openly, unlike many of your police states. As for the racism this country was founded on, at least we have confronted it, put it in the open, and made it a lot better. a generation from now, it will be ancient history here. What about your evil countries and their killing fields, ethnic cleansing, religious intolerance, dictatorships, deforestization, etc. Before pointing a jealous finger at us, look at the three pointing back at yourselves, jerks!
