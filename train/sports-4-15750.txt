Despite his age, I'd say Sammy Knight is one of the best defensive players in the NFL. He has been one of the most underappreciated forces at the safety position. Since joining the league in 1997, Knight has ripped off a startling 46 takeaways (35 interceptions, 11 fumble recoveries, and another 10 forced fumbles). That would be more than anyone else in that time frame. 2004 was considered an off season for him, despite managing 4 INTs, 127 Tackles, 3 Forced Fumbles and 1 Fumble Recovered. Whenever Jerome Woods went to the Pro Bowl in 2003 he had just 3 INTs, 99 Tackles, 3 Forced Fumbles and a Fumble Recovery. That would make Knight's play in a down season better than some players' Pro Bowl seasons. To top it off, Knight has been consistent. He has played six straight seasons with 100+ tackles. He's also played in 108 games straight. He has a coaches mentality and can help bring together a defense. He's intelligent and knows how to study for a game. A true genius, he even has a photographic memory. He has been one of the most trustworthy players in the NFL. UPDATE: 2005 was a down year for Knight. He only had 89 tackles, 2 sacks, 2 interceptions, 11 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries while playing in a new system. Comparitively Bob Sanders went to a ProBowl while having 91 tackles, 0 sacks, 1 interception, 2 passes defensed, 1 forced fumble and 1 fumble recovery. See my point?
