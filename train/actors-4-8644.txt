Underrated by most people unfortunately. A career spanning decades (including leading roles from the 1940s on) lends to her credibility, but she now is most well-known for supporting roles in the 60s and 70s. Of course she is also noted for being high-strung, raucous and difficult to work with. But you've got to hand it to her: with 2 supporting actress Oscar wins (Diary of Anne Frank and A Patch of Blue) and two nominations (the powerful A Place in the Sun, and perhaps most famously, The Poseidon Adventure), she's got the credentials. At a ripe old age, she has still continued to work, including a great supporting role in the indie movie Heavy, and a recurring role on the TV series Roseanne. She's also done great work on the stage. She's a wonderful, colorful and talented lady.
