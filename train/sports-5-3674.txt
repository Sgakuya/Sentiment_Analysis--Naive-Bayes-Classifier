Pbeavr...the streak doesn't impress you that much? I can't understand why it wouldn't. That many games without an injury or scandal to sideline him is very impressive. And Ripken was good. He was an MVP in both the 80's and 90's. He was no Ozzie Smith, but he was consistently one of the best defensive shortstops during his career, and he was the best offensive shortstop of his time. Who was a better offensive shortstop when Ripken was in his prime...Larkin would be the closest guy I could think of. A-Rod is surpassing Ripken now in regards to offensive prowess, but Rodriguez attributes his play to Ripken's example. The contemporary shortstops might be better than Ripken was, but when Ripken came along, he was the best all around shortstop the game ever saw.
