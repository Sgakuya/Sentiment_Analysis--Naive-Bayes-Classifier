How can anyone who's ever seen Buffy NOT feel that Xander is extremely endearing? Just for Nicolas's performance in this series alone should give him proper recognition. He was able to successfully pull off being a bad guy in numerous episodes (half-hyena, vampire episodes, etc.) after playing the typical 'good' guy. And there were many cases where people could relate to him being the outcast (by just being a normal human being, how's that? because all his friends had some kind of mystical ability in them- he didn't) because I'm sure we've all felt at one point in our life that we didn't belong. Now to admit, I've never seen him in anything else so I'm basing this solely on his role in Buffy. But he did a wonderful job.
