GREECE IS AWSOME!!!!!! I WAS THERE LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO THE TRAVEL CHANNEL AND OTHER TRAVEL MAGAZINES, CRETE WAS RATED OF HAVING ONE THE TOP 10 BEACHES IN THE WORLD. ANYONE THAT TELLS YOU GREECE SUCKS OR HAS BAD SOIL OR THE ECONOMY STINKS, BETTER GET THERE HEAD EXAMINED OR SIMPLY PUT, AN ANTI GREEK HATER. ALSO, THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT.. IN ADDITION, YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF ISLANDS, ANCIENT RUINS, SITE SEEINGS, GREAT RESTURANTS,NIGHT CLUBS AND MORE. ECONOMY IS GREAT TOO, MUCH BETTER AS OPPOSED TO 20 YEARS AGO..NOW THAT GREECE JOINED THE EURO, IT S VERY EXPENSIVE!!! HOWEVER, GREECE DOES HAVE IT'S DOWNSIDE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. ONE IS THAT THE PEOPLE THERE HAVE ATTITUDES AND TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU IF THEY CAN, ALSO THE SYSTEM THERE IS BACKWARDS; EVERYTHING THERE HAPPENS LIKE MOLASSIS. BUT OVERALL, IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO VISIT AND EXPLORE.
