Robin Williams place a strange man who works at a one hour photo.He becomes obsessed with a family who brings their film there to be processed. He has taken their photos for years and without their knowledge makes photos of them for himself, He has a whole wall of photos of them. I guess since he did not have a family of his own he has adopted them. It gets weirder when he finds out the husband is stepping out with a gal.His boss fires him for problems at work, and he seeks out the husband at a hotel. Not really all that scarey, but an odd kind of stalker movie. Robin williams did a decent job as CY the photo guy.
