Coco's comments here are extremely close to exactly how I feel about the University of Phoenix. I will begin my fourth online course August 9th, and this is not an easy degree. I average about 30 hours a week in studying, in preparing papers, in reading text and weekly assigned articles, and in class participation. I have had excellent instructors in the first three classes, who respond to questions quickly and thoroughly. I cannot understand anyone who thinks this is easy, and like Coco, the team assignment are one part of the experience I do not like. But, it is like taking bad tasting medicine, the team atmosphere is good training in working with people in the work place, so even something I do not like is beneficial. I was lucky in my last class and had three good learning teammates, but this is definitely not always the case. I have learned very much during the first three classes. I look forward to my next 12 classes for the great experience, knowledge that will be gained and feeling of achievement I will receive in completing them. For full disclosure, I also need to say that I have some anxiety regarding the time and effort it will take to complete these 12 upcoming classes, as again gaining a degree at the U of P is not easy. But I am glad it will not be easy.
