I'm giving it a five rating because this album belongs with the greats of all time. But, let's face it: It's really sad when a band peaks with their debut album and follows it up with the weak-assed Illusions. Sure, there were a few decent songs on the Illusions, but they were written during the Appetite time frame and didn't make the cut for Appetite. I think Axl and the boys knew they were a one trick pony. That's why they milked the spotlight while it was on them. Of course, taking the stance they've taken this past decade is only going to create a longing for them, but don't expect anything great. Sure, like everyone else, I'm gonna buy the new album (new members or original), but they will NEVER be able to top Appetite. It must suck to pass your prime before you even hit it.
