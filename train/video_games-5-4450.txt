This is the game that truly defined RPGs on the computer, as no other game has come close to what this game achieved. The basics, such as graphics and sound add depth to the great gameplay. Because you create your character from scratch the game also has a great replay value because you can play someone with different attributes and abilites. Also because you can have different characters in your group this also adds replay value for interaction. It's also really cool to watch your character start out as a poor, weak person (or elf, halfing, etc.) and then gradually gain skills to become a fearsome warrior (or mage, thief, priest or whatever you have chosen). There are some minor faults such as missions that require you to do nothing more than play fetch , and pathfinding in dungeons and narrow areas can be problematic. But these minor faults take nothing away from the overall enjoyment of playing this game. Once you have played through the game (several times in my case) you can pickup Baldur's Gate 2 which even outshines this game. Get this game and start your epic adventure today!
