This game is awesome. It is the follow-up to the first person shooter Heretic, that used the Doom engine. This latest forray into the Heretic universe uses the Quake 2 engine... in 3rd person. In this game, you play an energetic, agile, acrobatic, super-elf, who has just returned from fighting off the forces of evil in the last game, only to find that his people have been affected by a mind altering plague that causes them to kill everything in sight... including our hero. Corvus must fight his way through the mess, and find a cure, while slowly being eaten away by the virus himself. This game is an action game with role-playing and adventure elements, including puzzles, magic spells, characters, progressively better armor and weapons, etc. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, a cross between Unreal and the somewhat worse Quake 2. The graphics manage to be dark and atmospheric, yet colorful, using purples, blues, yellows, reds, and other brilliant colors. Corvus is an absolutely amazing hero. He is super fast. His walking speed is as fast, if not faster, than the running speed in Quake 2. Corvus can flip forward, backward, polevault, jump, climb, swing, creep, and run the speed of Michael Johnson. His downfall: he can't hold his breath that long under water (though he is a fantastic swimmer). You definitely need to get this games if you are an action, Quake, Doom, Heretic, Hexen, adventure, or RPG fan.
