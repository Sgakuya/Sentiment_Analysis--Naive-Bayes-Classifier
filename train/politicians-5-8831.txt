I wish things were as good now as they were when Bill was president. Remember when Monica and Whitewater were our big concerns? That was more tabloid fodder than anything. I'll take that over weekly beheadings anytime. Remember when traveling to foreign countries was exciting and fun? Remember when our economy was soaring (due to Newt Gingrich and Ronald Reagan?? Whatever!!), and most countries respected our role in world politics? We are going in a direction that could take us years, if not decades to recover from folks. I can't wait till November for John Kerry to restore some order, and save our reputation on this planet.
