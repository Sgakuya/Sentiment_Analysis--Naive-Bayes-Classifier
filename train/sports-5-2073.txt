They are still a contender, but they really did nothing this offsesason to get better... Craig Counsell really came on in the playoffs last year as a player, but he was always a good leader, a glue guy for the team... What I have to wonder is, which is the real Tony Womack? The one that was awful in the first half or the second-half version that hit .327?... Luis Gonzalez is among the top 5 offensive players in baseball, hands down; the guy hits for average and power, he's selective up there, his only shortcomings are a lack of speed and a really weak arm... The 1-2 punch of Johnson and Schilling is as good as we've seen on any staff in the last 10 years, including Atlanta.
