Let me preface this by saying that my husband and I rarely go to the theater to see movies..so when we rent, we tend to go for the big ones..like Traffic or whatever..usually successful dramas, sometimes action, whatever. We don't often rent comedies, so I was pleasantly surprised when he brought home What Women Want. I enjoyed it, as did he. Even thought it has been labeled a chick flick we both found ourselves laughing out loud. It did get a bit lame toward the end. But, for me, the hilarious moments in the middle of the movie made up for that. Helen Hunt does an adequate job..Gibson shows his comedic side that was evident in such films as Lethal Weapon. I found out that they showed some of the funniest parts in the trailers, but I still enjoyed the movie. If you are looking to rent a fun loving, light comedy that won't take too much brain power, rent What Women Want for a few laughs.
