I wish people would try to see this movie not as a film including J-lo but the as the best film that Jennifer Lopez has performed in. In her staring role she pays a hotel maid who finds love with an unsuspecting state senator and she struggles to find her way through the tough time ahead of her.I think that this film is a great feel good movie that everyone can watch and at least enjoy a bit! The story is predictable but as it is a romantic comedy who cares?? Its a must see for j-lo fans and for everyone else its a film with alot of talent and contians some great comedy sceens. Its a real warming treat compared to a few of the more recent movies of its type!
