People say they hate the Yankees but when they sign with them they always say It's a dream come true! Pedro will probably say the same thing if he goes to the Yankees. Love them or hate them, they have a rich history and kicked butt more than any other team in history of baseball. ****UPDATE***** Well redsox04, no sense in getting personal with the fans! Yes, we know Redsox is on top now but it took them almost 100 years to come back. They had to fight the Yankees like crazy to win. They didn't sweep the Yankees like they did St. Louis. Enjoy your year because you might not see it for another 100 years (yes, we'll all be gone by then).
