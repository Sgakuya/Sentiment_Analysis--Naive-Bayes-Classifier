Songs From an American Movie, Vol. One isn't nearly as good as Everclear's previous CD, So Much for the Afterglow, but it's still really solid. AM Radio is one of the catchiest pop songs I've heard in a while, and thankfully it's not catchy in a way that gets on your nerves after you've heard it five times (e.g., a song like Mambo No. 5). Unlike most of the critics, I even like Everclear's cover of Brown Eyed Girl, and the song Wonderful that's being played on the radio right now is really good. I'm happy I bought this CD, and I'm looking forward to hearing Vol. 2, which, I think, is going to be released pretty soon...
