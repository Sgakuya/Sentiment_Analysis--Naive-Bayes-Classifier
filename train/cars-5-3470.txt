We just bought a Sundown-red pearl 2003 Highlander. This is my first Toyota purchase - my wife's third - and also my first non-USA automotive purchase. I have purchased a total of 3 brand new american vehicles over the course of 12 years. I have purchased many more used american vehicles over the course of 19 years. The highlander is the most superbly engineered vehicle I have ever owned. In fact, everything that I've owned prior to this was not even a vehicle in accordance with the standards set by the Highlander. Thank You Toyota - job well done. I will be trading in my 2002 Ford Mustang next year for a 2004 Celica. The battle cry for me is no more A.J. A.J. = American Junk.
