A monster on the boards and blocking shots, there's few players in the league more fun to watch than Ben Wallace. And with no offensive skill to speak of last season, this year he's shown his game develope with jump shots, slam dunks and hit a 3 pointer in the final seconds against Washington. Everyone hates the Pistons and their defensive grind-it-out ugly way of playing, but the fact is that in the past 2 years they've won 50 games both seasons, won back-to-back Central Division Championships and made it to the Eastern Conference Fianls. Look for the 2 time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace to start getting some much over-due respect that he deserves in the near future. When they talk about MVP, how can they not mention Big Ben?
