Let's be honest with ourselves. There is no other candtidate with the honesty and integrity of Nader. The Republicans, regardless of their intentions (compassionate), are racist, sexist brutes who slavishly pander to wealthy interests. Their highly charged and muddleheaded catch-phrases (class war, fuzzy math), are idiotic and deceptive. The mainstream Democrats have shifted to the Right in order to steal some of the Republican thunder, and in the process have compromised their own beliefs, but worst of all they have compromised their liberal (actually compassionate) constituents. Gore is the worst of these because he really believes in the liberal cause but abondoned it for votes in this Right leaning political atmosphere. The Greens stand for ordinary people, the other parties do not. I don't want to see the White House go to the highest bidder.
