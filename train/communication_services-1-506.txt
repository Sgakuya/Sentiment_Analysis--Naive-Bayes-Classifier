Alltel is slowly but surely becoming a very poor company. I was a loyal customer, continually recommending them to everyone I knew. Even though I consitently had trouble with them. Most problems were fairly minor.. except the ones I've had within the last 2 years... MY GOSH... they are so money oriented. THANK GOD I ONLY HAVE THREE MONTHS LEFT ON MY CONTRACT..Which by the way I pay for but do not use. The alltel phone sits in a drawer in my bedroom, and I'm paying the lowest monthly price possible until this contract runs out. I went to CINGULAR.. so far, no problmes. Alltel decided to turn my service off aprox. 8 months ago stating they did not recieve payment.. funny.. my payments come directly out of my credit card. It took four months for them to post the payment even though I had faxed, mailed and then hand delivered copies of my credit card statments, as well as the cancelled checks for 2 months of payments.. They still had to research and find out where the payments are meanwhile.. I had to pay this amount twice just to have my service restored. Not to mention the countless times I had to argue charges of calls that I apparantly made to people I dont know during the time the phone was off while research my payments. I would not advise anyone to use Alltel service.
