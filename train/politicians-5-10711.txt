History is vindicating this great man, as the Khmer Rouge wing of the Democratic party gets sleazier and more corrupt. Disgraced ex-President Clinton has done much to elevate Nixon in the eyes of the public, given his extremely degenerate example. Nixon is a lot like Lincoln. Both struggled hard to keep this country united, even if some degree of illegality occured. (Lincoln was an excellent President, despite censoring critical newspapers, having dissident Northerners arrested, and such.) Nixon kept this great union preserved, even at expense of his own reputation. That is leadership, whether liberals approve or not.
