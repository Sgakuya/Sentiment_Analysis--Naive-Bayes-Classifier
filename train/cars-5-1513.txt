I bought a 2006 G6 two weeks ago and I love it. I bought the "base" V6 G6 sedan and was surprised how much standard equipment it had with power windows, mirrors, power height seat, six speaker stereo and the fantastic looking LED chrome bezeled dash. It's something Pontiac should have done five years ago. The exterior is clean and its styling is reminiscent of an Audi A4 from the rear. The little GM badges on both front doors are a nice added touch and the honeycomb grille is actual steel, not plastic. Mine is black with black interior and I think it looks fab. I think Pontiac's on the right track with their new cars, especially with the G6 couple and convertible. Nice job guys. BTW, this is my 5th Pontiac I have bought in the last ten years. So, they must be doing something right.
