Gray Davis is a great Monday morning quarterback in his recent statements regarding utility deregulation in California. It is a catastropy waiting to happen all over this country simply because supply cannot meet demand. Rules are constantly changing thanks to the CPUC; both suppliers and consumers are getting screwed as a result. There is plenty of blame to go around. Our Republican and Democratic leaders alike should seriously re-think this thing called deregulation. Bottom line is that we need more power plants, but they cannot all be natual gas fired folks. There are alternative fuels, but perhaps we need to revisit nuclear technology in order to meet the future electricity needs of this country. There need to be more incentives for conservation as well. Just think about all the hotel rooms where air conditioners are running with no one in the room! Texas is next in line for disaster.
