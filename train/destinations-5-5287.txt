Pennsylvania is quite possibly one of the best well rounded states of them all. I could honestly write endless pages on why but Im going to keep it short. The diversity between old and new, culture, mountains, countryside, small town life, big city life(2 great big cities and several medium ones),great suburbs, short distance to the ocean, food, amazing history, white collar, blue collar, battlefields, outdoors, rich sports (From pro to the HS level), amusment parks, ideal location, distance to the rest of the NE cities, ect, ect. What they dont have...the plains and deserts, oh well. One of the most beautiful states out there that will leave you in awe
