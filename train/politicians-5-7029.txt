The great Rev. Jesse Jackson, an impressive man with masses working experience who is always fighting for a just cause, and a minister of God, and takes the blame for everything. A role model for the young adults and future leaders of our nation, he gave precious advice to Bill Clinton. He told Clinton how bad it was having an affair. He is one who teaches love, compassion, and respect for fellow man. He is a man of great responsibility He was a family man, he spent quality time with his family. He was also very faithful to his wife, and to God. He sets a good example for all the Christians in the world. He always practiced safe sex. You would never see him going to court to pay child support nor in a divorce court. He would never break one of the Ten Commandments. He has a great charisma, his speeches are very emotional, and his voice will never bore massive followers. He is always minding his own business, and very worried about his work. He would be so unhappy if he would have to go to a podium to complain about something. He always stands up and supports the victim of racist crimes in the southern part of the U.S. He is also one of the most respected leaders in the black community. He always defended the innocents. He would never boycott an Emmy award or another award show. He would never go any where and cause distention, confusion and stirring the people up to a point where there may be disorder and fighting. He rather lead in prayer then riots. This is a satire
