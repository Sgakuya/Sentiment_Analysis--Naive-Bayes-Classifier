Tired of the rise of cable prices and the slow pace of new channels being added, well your troubles with the cable company will be gone forever once DirecTV is installed in your home. After many years of being a Comcast Cable subscriber, we finally went the way of the satellite by calling DirecTV by the number on the card they sent in the mail. A few days later, the installer arrived hooking up the dish, the cords and of course the DirecTV receivers. As day two of installation arrived, the installer finally finished his job and we ve got our 130+ channel pack (Total Choice Plus). The only problems you'll get out of DirecTV is that when rain or snow comes through the area, the satellite signal is lost a few times until the weather passes. For about $39.99 a month, DirecTV is just right for you.
