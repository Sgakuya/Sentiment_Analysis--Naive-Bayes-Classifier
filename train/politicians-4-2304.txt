Has a personal charisma that hasn't been seen in a politician in a long time. . .I don't know him personally but he has a remarkable self-image. People talk too much about Powell's race- the man is a winner, plain and simple. He is an average city kid who grew up and earned his own personal American success story. How can you not like this guy in Washington? D.C. has too many silver-spooned politicians. Americans trust Powell because he seems like an 'everyman'. . .whether this is true or not remains to be seen. I find Powell's critics to be highly offensive in light of other targets in Washington that are more guilty and responsible.
