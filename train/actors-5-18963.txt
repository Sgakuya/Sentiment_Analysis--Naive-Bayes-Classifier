First off, not showing support for the policies of the current administration is not disrespectful of our troops. If the men responsible for our troops risking their lives over seas are corrupt and the premise for war is a lie, then how is it not in fact a righteous cause to expose the truth and try to bring the troops safely home? Being pro-troops and anti-war may seem like a contradiction on some level but not everything is so simply black and white. I finally figured out what the NRA'ers and pro-Reagan connection comes from: a bizarre Hollywood image of the world with America and its guns at the center. I don't know what an interview with a pathetic, senile old man like Heston has to do with Moore's ethics, but it would be nice if people were a little more specific with their opinions. If you call someone unAmerican just because they speak out against the President or the wars he starts or the company he keeps, or against the brainwashed masses that believe his transparent lies, then I believe you are the most unAmerican of all. If your idea of patriotism is blind, sheep-like agreement with everything the government says and does, then you are the enemy within. Despite the incessant lies that it is a Democracy we are living in, we must fight for Democracy if it is ever to become a reality. Michael Moore is a courageous man. No matter how his opinions might conflict with yours, his books and movies get people talking and generate awareness. That is what true Democracy is all about. He knows we don't live in a Democracy, hence Miramax, subsidiary of Disney refusing to distribute his film. Why would a big corporation like Disney want to ban a political commentary? I guess it would be unwise to piss off friends in high places. They are just another example of a giant greedy media conglomerate which obfuscates the truth by being a special interest political contributer. Popular culture is just unaware of what those special interests are. Awareness is the key.
