I stopped at a local KFC for the first time in years and I'll never go back. First of all there were only 3 in line yet it took 35 minutes to get my order, a 3-piece breast and wing combo. The ghetto dude behind the counter kept calling everyone chief, ace, or slick. His personal cell phone kept ringing and he had to tell his lady friends not now baby. Anyway I finally got my meal and when I got to a park to eat it, it turned out to be 3 thighs, dripping in grease, no napkins and no utensils for the side orders. How the hell do you eat baked beans and macaroni and cheese with your fingers? I wound up throwing the greasy crap into a garbage can. I called the KFC consumer complaint line (800 225 5532). They apologized and promised to send a refund, I'll wouldn't be surprised if the check they send was soaked in grease!
