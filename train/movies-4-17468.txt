well done movie. Imelda Stuanton was wonderful as Vera Drake, a middle aged woman who secretly performs abortions. It takes place in England around 1950. she is a kindly woman who comes from very modest means. to her she is helping out these women who need abortions.most of the women she helps are poor, or fearful of what will happen if they have a baby. after an abortion she performs ends a woman in the hospital she is found outher family knew nothing about it. she has never taken money for the abortions only saying she wanted to help the woman.she is arrested and there is a trial.it shows the devastation is causes her and her family.Vera Drake is not a horrible woman, she did not perform abortions out of greed.Abortion is still a very debated subject today.back then it was illegal.well acted all around.i am not going to use this movie to give my own opinion about abortion. I thought this was a good movie.
