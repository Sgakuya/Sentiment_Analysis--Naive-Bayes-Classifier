Ok. I live in Arkansas and I love it. It is a very beautiful state that just so happens to have a horrible reputation. It is so sad that people really think that all we do is run around bare-foot and with messed up teeth! Ha'ha! I have traveled my whole life and I have never seen a more beautiful place. People here are nice and greet you when you walk by, unlike the other states. Oh and about us all being stupid rednecks ...right..we are just like everyone else...how about you go ahead and grow up and find something else to put down, not us. Have you ever visited Arkansas by the way? Probably not, because if you had then you would not say the things that you have said. Try going to our state parks, that will shut you up real fast. God has blessed Arkansas with a scenic beauty that is one of a kind and I thank him that I live in an un-selfish, non-stuck-up state. By the way: Woooooooooo PIG SOEEE''RAZORBACKS!!!
