This guy deserves a Pro Bowl nod. Greg Wesley has elevated his game to a new level this season. Wesley has more picks [6] than any safety besides Darren Sharper [7] and is only two picks behind the League leader Delthea O'Neal [8]. He's been outstanding in run support and coverage both. He has 70 tackles so far and a good shot at breaking the 100 tackle mark by the end of the season. In the game against New England he had a field day against Tom Brady. Wesley snagged 3 picks from a man many call the most cool and collected quarterback in the NFL, and nearly a 4th until fellow teammate Sammy Knight pulled it down first. Wesley has great speed and is a crushing hitter who has been fined for his brutal hitting in the past. He's a complete package despite being a relative unknown.
