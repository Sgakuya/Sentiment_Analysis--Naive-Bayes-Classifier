Had a very bad experience with them. Got a good quotation first, but when buying - they jacked up the premium $300 (worse than my previous provider) because of a claim in CLUE report. The accident was not my fault, and was reported only because the claim was made. Called them right away, and was told that they will cancell the installment if I provide a clean experience letter. After calling them in fifteen days discovered I will be charged the installment regardless if it was my fault or not. After requesting for a manager - I was told that they reviewed the record, disovered something, and will return the money. This didn't happen in a month and I called them for the 3rd time - and got a response that I have a record and it has to be removed in order for them to return the $300. The company that placed the record says that my fault is 0% and this is a non-point record, but it cannot be removed as this is a claim record and the claim cannot be reversed. It may be the policy of Esurance - not to give good rates to people who have been in any accidents regardless of the fault, but they never gave me that answer up front, neither they commented on any previous promises they verbally made. By that time, I already had a lapse with my previous insurance company and there was no way back. Also, they claim that they read customer e-mail - bunch of bull. Out of three e-mails I sent them - none was responded, neither any action was taken. I have to contact customer satisfaction deptartment in order to get some answer. SUMMARY: The customer service is terrible. They never gave me a correct answer why they increased the premium, and thus kept me with their company. Think twice before going with them!!!
