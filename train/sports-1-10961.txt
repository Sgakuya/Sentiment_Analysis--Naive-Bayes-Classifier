The absolute worst coach Clemson has had since Ken Hatfield. He underperforms, struggles against weaker opponents, gets blown out on national TV on a regular basis, is unprepared for big games, and had a team that completely quit on him last year after the Georgia loss. His staff is full of old friends and family that can't seem to coach their collective way out of a pee wee football game. In short TDP should be in Columbia when ULL plays USuC to put out feelers to Ricky Bustle or call Nashville and bring Bobby Johnson back. Bowden is in a tailspin. He has done some good getting facilities. Otherwise he is a complete bust and unless he pull out a miricle 10 win season he should be shown the door.
