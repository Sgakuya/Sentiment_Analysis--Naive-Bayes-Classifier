I think she has a very natural lust for life. Jennifer has a refreshing spark about her that makes her seem very genuine compared to her contemporaries. I expect her to be around for quite some time. She seems to be stuck in too many generic, crowd pleasing roles and I wish she would get a chance to play something altogether different (and hopefully not some trampy, slut role which too many actresses consider to be stretching their boundaries ). I think Jennifer lights up the screen in a positive, likeable way, and I'd like to see more from her. Her singing career seems to be a waste of time; maybe it's just something for her to do while she contemplates which direction her acting career will go.
