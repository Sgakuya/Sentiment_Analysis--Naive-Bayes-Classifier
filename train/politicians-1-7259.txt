Jesse Jackson - you are a hatemonger . Instead of uniting your people, you cause nothing but hate. No one should call you reverend . That is a title one must earn. You certainly have not done that. Isn't it obvious to you that you are not wanted or needed? You are always sticking your nose into places where you were not invited. Instead of preaching hate, shouldn't you be trying to unite people. You are certainly no Martin Luther King. You aren't even in the same arena. You need to learn acceptance and to keep your big mouth shut. I am a caucasion woman and I look at all people as equals. I don't care what color their skin might be. I judge everyone as equals until they do something to change my opinion. There are good and bad in every race, color and creed. You, as a reverent need to learn tolerance and judge not lest ye be judged. Now, step down off your soap box and go home like a good little dog, with your tail between your legs. We're all sick to death of you and your kind of hatemongers.
