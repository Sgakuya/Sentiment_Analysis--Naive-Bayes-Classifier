Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot. This movie is the must see event of the past 10 years, possibly more in my opinion. It was amazing. Star Wars fans will love it, regardless of some terrible writing on George Lucas' part, he needs to hire a different writer who has a bit more talent than him. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD The effects and the storyline were great. It was very touching, being a HUGE Anakin Skywalker fan myself, I loved it. The light saber dual between Anakin and Obi Wan was awesome, very intense and very upsetting at the same time, to see such good friends go against each other, but this only added to the film. I must agree that Anakin gave in to the dark side rather quickly. It were as if all the Chancellor had to do was snap his fingers and Anakin was his. No resistance what-so-ever. Another thing that dazzled me was how quickly Padme's stomach grew with her pregnancy, it seemed as if every day her stomach got increasingly larger. Then at the end of the movie, it is revealed that she is carrying twins, and for some one carrying TWO babies, that was the smallest pregnant belly I have EVER seen. Then, Luke and Leia (forgive my spelling if that's incorrect) come into the world, and Padme dies immediately following, which makes one question how Leia later states to Luke that she remembers something of her mother. But other than the bad script and a few minor plot flaws, this movie was great and I really loved it and I'm sure all who see it will love it too.
