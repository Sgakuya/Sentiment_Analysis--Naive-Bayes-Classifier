Have lived here about 8-years now. Lived in Southern Cal before. It was time to move out of Cal, crime, too many people, costs. But I love the ocean. So my choices were few. I live in a seaside town in eastern Connecticut. Its a great place to live. The eastern part of Connecticut is by far the best part of the state. Ramshackle beach cottages, clam shacks, and nice uncrowed beaches. House prices are still reasable in eastern Connecticut. I love the huge waves in Rhode Island (only 15 - min away)! And dont be fooled, the climate of coastal Connecticut and southern Rhode Island is mild. Temps are great 9- months a year, most of the snow turns to rain in eastern Connecticut/Rhode Island. People call Connecticut "New England", but this is not a true New England climate.
