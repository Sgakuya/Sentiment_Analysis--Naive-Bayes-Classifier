Ok guys, I have to admit the McLaren F1 is sweet, anyone else trying to convince you of otherwise is selling something. It has become over-rated though, fact. Are we all forgetting LeMans? The McLaren got it's freakin butt handed to it time and time again. And do I even need to remind you that there are prowling road versions of the cars that whiiped the McLaren raoming the streets of Europe as we speak? Deadly 1 million dollar weapons such as the Nissan R-390 and the Toyota TA030(GT1). These cars, remaining road versions, have been proven to absolutely demolish the McLaren's 0-60, 1/4 mile, and top speed times, not to mention their ability to handle. While I admit though of having endless wet dreams about the R-390, I'm just as broke as the rest of you and have to work with the realistic road cars, mine being Nissan 300's. I'm all for beating 1 million dollar cars for hundreds of thousands less though. Here's to Japanese tuninig!
