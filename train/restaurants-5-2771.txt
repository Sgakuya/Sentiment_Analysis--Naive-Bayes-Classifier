Ok, I cannot speak for the Hardee's in other towns, but the Hardee's here is great. When I've tried their Angus burger, I was hooked. In fact, for a while I lost all interest in other burgers. I just couldn't taste them. Also, their spicy curly fries are my favorite fries of all time. The Frisco burger isn't bad either. What other fast-food restaurant offers sourdough breaded burgers? My only reservation about giving a five star is the commercials and the price. I do kinda understand that they have to be a little more expensive than other restaurants because of their new thickburgers. However, their commercials are inexcusable. They're condenscending because they try to manipulate their potential customers by presenting an image of what people who eat at Hardee's shouldn't be. Only manly men/women should eat at our restaurant. I know they're not trying to limit their range of customers. They just want people to think that their burgers are soooo big that only a real man could finish it. However, I'm sure people do not like to be attacked personally when they sit down to watch t.v. So, my rating is for the restaurant and the food itself. The commercials just suck.
