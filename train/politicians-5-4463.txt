A real conservative. The first Black president will definately be Republican because Republicans actually want Blacks to succeed. Bush appoints Black Americans to higher level positions than Clinton ever did, and the Republican party lets people like Rice, Powell and Keyes be heard and do their thing. The Dems, by contrast, put forth such intellectual giants as Jackson and Sharpton because they know they won't win! Even when somoeone like Sharpton runs, the leadership gets Mosely to run so the Black vote will be split and calls Sharpton a joke. The first Black President will definately be someone like Keyes because Republicans let people stand on their own merit, while Dems want to keep the Black vote, and at the same time Keep 'em where they belong . Look at the economic prison created by the welfare state. It serves two purposes: (1) Keep minorities impovrished by making them dependant and removing the father from the family; (2) Buy the minority vote by looking as if we are trying to help. Do you really think the same group of people who voted against the Civil Rights Act of '64 had the best interests of minorities in mind when they created the welfare system? GO KEYES!
