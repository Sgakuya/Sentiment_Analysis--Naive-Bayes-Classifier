I used to listen to Stroke 9 a long time ago. This was when their lyrics had meaning and when they were basically unknown. I had this tape that had been passed around at least 6 different people. When Stroke 9 had their first radio hit with 'little black backpack' I was excited to hear that they had made a major record label but then when I listened to the song and their other songs, I was really disappointed. I really dislike the teeny bopper music about the little black backpack, besides the fact that those little black backpacks went out of style like 7 years ago. Their song sounds exactly like all the other songs on the radio right now. It is too bad when I thought they were going to be different.
