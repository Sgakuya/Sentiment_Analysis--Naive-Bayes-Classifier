Love the Liberty. Like the look and feel and am happy to be back in a Jeep (I know not very scientific). Traded a Nissan Exterra for the Liberty. Liberty appears to have more usable power for the auto trans but is lacking in rear cargo dept. Since it is just my son and I this is not a problem but could be for families looking for car to travel in. Steering feels more precise with a smaller turning radius (rack and pinion?) with a stiffer suspension. We do car camping over some rough trails and use 4wd often - the two feel equal in this area. Height is same although the side rails on Xterra really helped when loading the mtn bikes - side rails are in the future. Front and back seats are an improvement - better visability/higher profile in the front while rear seat has more room. Undecided (have yet to ride in back of Liberty) about role of stadium seating in rear of Xterra although I did like this when i had to ride in back - less motion sickness. Overall, I do not regret my decision to buy the Liberty (in fact I am estatic); however, each person must decide what is best for them. Both SUV's have many pluses.
