I think that all in all, Edward Furlong is a pretty talented actor. Perhaps his annoying performance in T2 was not accidental; after all, his character was sort of a What's up dude? kind of kid- how exactly do you play somebody like that? Brainscan was kind of whacky, but he was not that bad in that film either. I also enjoyed his performance in American History X as Edward Norton's younger brother. His role in that film probably was one of his better performances and it showed hope that Furlong may be able to take on more serious roles in the future. His performance in A Home of Our Own with Kathey Bates was very well done indeed, and if any of you have seen it, you know that because of his performance in that film, he can be forgiven for his so-called annoying performance in T2.
