Jim Carrey stars in Bruce Almighty , a weak attempt to bring back the Carrey that we knew in such classics as Liar Liar The Truman Show . In this show, he plays a news reporter whom is given the powers of god. However, with him onboard, things all go wrong, and it could be the end of the world as we know it. Carrey delivers a weak performance as Bruce Nolan, and rarely makes the audience laugh. He performance is over-the-top completley forced. Jennifer Aniston comes off better as his perfect wife. Morgan Freeman is miscast and wasted as god, although he does receive a few good one-liners here and there. Skip this one.
