I have lived in New Orleans for the past four years, and recently tried to move away. What a mistake! Since leaving, I have missed it with a palpable pain in my heart. It is simply the best town, with the best people, that I have ever had the good fortune to experience. It must be said that it is a love/hate town; that is, even when you are monogamous with the city, you sometimes feel a great desire to strangle it. But you always stay, or you at least come back. It is truly not for the faint of heart, and that is part of the appeal; it makes you work for it's love and at times seems to take on the feeling of an entity, a real force. In the years that I lived there, it was not uncommon to hear the name of the city invoked at least twice a day in conversation with other locals. It is very self-conscious that way; there is a very real sense that the city is incomparably unique and a constant influence in everyone's life. Nothing ever feels muted or suburban. It feels at turns bleak and terribly, blood poundingly alive. And there is a sense of community that is comforting and thrilling; a metropolitan feeling, and also the warmth of a cradle of people around you at all times. And the locals are welcoming but at the same time vehemently protective of their beloved city; it feels that the world is divided between those who recognize the beauty of New Orleans and those who disparage it. Visit, or better yet, sell all of your things like I did and simply move there tommorow.
