Excellent evaluator of players and coaches. Has assembled a very good group of both in the short time that he has been at UVA. Very good developer of talent--see Elton Brown, Heath Miller, Chris Canty and Billy McMullen all 1 and 2 star recruits that became or have become All Americans. Also great game day coach. Excellent half time adjustments. Has been able to consistently put his teams in positions to win games. His teams have played smart and with emotion, a tough combination to beat. Now that his early recruiting classes are starting to mature (first group are rising sophmores), expectations and excitement is rising in Charlottesville.
