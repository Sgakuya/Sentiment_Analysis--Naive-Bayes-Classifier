Perkins was born to play Norman Bates - a gift that also made him almost too weird to be completely believable as anything else. I don't really think he was typecast; he just exuded a kind of serene reptilian oddness similar in some ways to the calm, but unpredictable edginess of Jeff Goldblum. He is fascinating to watch but always leaves you with a sense of uneasiness. Still, this kind of persona can be compelling enough to pull you in time and again. Growing up I can remember always being a little fascinated by his films. For a long time that list didn't even include Psycho, which, for some odd reason, I didn't see until I was in my late teens or early twenties.
