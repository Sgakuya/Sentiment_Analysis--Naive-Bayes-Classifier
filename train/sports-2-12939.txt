I am glad to say that the comments of Hola de Chile are absolutely incorrect. From 1904 to 1966 Georgia Tech had ONLY three coaches. The famous John Heisman from 1904 to 1919, William Alexander from 1920 to 1944 and Robert Dodd from 1945 to 1961. Very few schools can claim a period of 63 years with such stability. Heisman never had a losing season in 16 years as head coach and is credited by most with the national championship of 1917. Alexander did have 9 losing seasons out of 25 but was also unbeaten and untied in 1928 and credited with that years national championship by most organizations. Dodd had only 2 losing seasons out of 22 coached. Dodd also coached Georgia Tech to 10+ wins in a season 4 times and can claim 3 titles during the 1950s but none are considered legitimate. This era of Tech football is certainly filled with a tradition of winning. As to the current teams: They are winning but barely. A proud program I hope to see get a better coach than Chan gailey. He cannot return them to prominence.
