I ordered a pair of boots. The company accepted my Paypal payment, then after they sent no confirmation of shipment, I received an E-mail that they only dealt with verified Paypal buyers. I canceled the transaction and gave them a credit card number and still received no confirmation of shipment. I called to get confirmation and was twice put on hold, with the promise that it had shipped and that they would give me the tracking # by E-mail. I still do not have that tracking number, nor do i have written confirmation that the item shipped or will get there in time for X-mas. This is not how a company should do business. i have used Paypal countless times and have never had this type of problem. Do yourself a favor and order from a major shoe distributor.
