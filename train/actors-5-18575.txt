David Lynch is one of my top three favorite directors. He is incrediblly brave and creative. His pictures are thought provoking and masterful. His ability to create worlds all his own for the sake of art and self expression rather than the shallow institution of modern film that creates such trash as Tomb Raider and Scream 3 for nothing more than profit. David Lynch's work is remarkable. All of his pictures give off a very seedy and realistic vibe that is always very aparant. Each picture has great undertones and deep meanings that if felt can open windows in your soul. His work always seem to pit right and wrong, good and evil, love and hate. David Lynch is highly under rated as a film maker and as an artist. This is only because his work is not cookie cutter run of the mill movie goer blah. His films are for thinkers and those with creative and artful minds. Though he is without a doubt not for everyone, his work is a little on the strange side compared to most films, those who really give him a shot should find themselves in awe. He doesn't care if the viewer gets it. It isn't ment to be gotten. It is meant to be experienced, to be felt. David Lynch is a visonary and truely a BRILLIANT BRILLIANT artist. Long live Lynch! A true artist and creative genius.
