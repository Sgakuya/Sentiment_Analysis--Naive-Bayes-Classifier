The reviews of Magnolia that are on this board show me that this is one of those films that touches people in a variety of ways. For me, the most powerful part of Magnolia was its emphasis on forgiveness. How much can / should you forgive from the people that are dear to you? At what point do you need to cut the cord? And up to what point do you shrug your shoulders and let your love for the person heal whatever pain that they have inflicted on you? Everyone has a different tolerance level for pain, and everyone has different reserves of forgiveness. What Magnolia does, and does well, is demonstrate the role of forgiveness in the lives of some very real, and very f***ed up folks. This is a powerful film, and one that takes chances. Definitely worth a look...even if you hate it, you will probably hate it passionately.
