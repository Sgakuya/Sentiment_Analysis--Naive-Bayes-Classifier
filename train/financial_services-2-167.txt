What really annoys me with this bank is that cash deposits aren't credited until the next business day. It's bad enough you have to wait on the check deposits, but why when they have the cash in hand isn't it credited immediately. My bank in Indiana, Homebank, used to, WHY Can't this one! It's totally frustrating. Then I transfered funds from my savings to my checking to avoid any ISF fees and for ONE WHOLE day, 24 hours, the money I had transfered was LOST in their system and I received the ISF fee anyway.. The money was no longer in my savings NOR in my checking.. It was completely inaccessable. Their system seems to be utterly primitive for being in Washington DC, the hub of the world. I can't wait to switch banks!
