This movie is historically incorrect. It shows as a fact that all sides of the war are to blame equally, and were equal murderes and beasts. The fact is actually that Bosnia-Herzegovina became a souverign state, recognized by the international community, who then did nothing to stop the mass murders, mass rapes and the ethinc cleansing. The fact is that the muslims in Bosnia have (didn't have before the war) nothing to do with arab muslims, and arab fundamentalist muslim terrorists that murdered the main character's wife. It also needs to be said that Bosnian muslims were the main target in the war. Both Serbs and Croats (from Serbia and Croatia respectivelly) consciously used mass murders, rapes, torture and ethnic cleansing as a tool in the war. The Bosnian muslims are also guilty of atrocities, but not at all in the same extend, and they came first as a revenge, the longer the war weant on. It must also be said that the Bosnian government did not have direct or in fact almost any control over some troups, depending in what part of the country those troups were. The movie is terrible, especially for stigmatizing the war (that is making it a fact that there is a hate rooted deep in the history in Bosnia), and for equalizing the murderes with the victims.
