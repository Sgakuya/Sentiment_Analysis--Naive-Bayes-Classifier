Not being a computer tech junkie, my analysis of an operating system is limited to typical everyday use, namely word-processing, web surfing, and a few games. In typical use, the system seems pretty stable, only having problems when I multitask (say) five or more windows. I either don't know or can't remember the difference between Win98 and Win98 Second Edition, but the latter comes with many of the extras that were only available with the Plus add-ons (eg desktop themes). In the end, Windows 98 was a small improvement over Windows 95 (which was a huge step-up from its predecessor). As another comment noted, the word on the street is that Microsoft is no longer supporting Windows 98, which is a concern.
