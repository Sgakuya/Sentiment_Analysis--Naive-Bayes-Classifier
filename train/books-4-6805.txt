The first Foundation Trilogy was originally published in 1951 through 1953, namely Foundation, Foundation And Empire, and Second Foundation. For the uninitiated, the concept is roughly equivalent to the historical fall of the Roman Empire, the subsequent Dark Ages, and the rebirth during the Renaissance; however, in this case psychohistorian Hari Seldon attempts to shorten the downtime after the fall of the futuristic Galactic Empire by creating two oases of learning and technology (ie the Foundations) that will provide the catalyst for an earlier renewal. Through the process, the Foundations must survive petty warlords, internal strife, a renewal of the Empire, plots against each other, and a mysterious mutant who threatens the entire plan. The bottom line is that while the Foundation Trilogy is well written and enjoyable, it is not as imaginative or complex as it could have been which keeps it from getting a five star rating.
