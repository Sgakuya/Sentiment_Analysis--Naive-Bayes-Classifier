Good luck trying to figure out what to order at the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is almost intimidating it is so big. But, that is also what makes the restaurant so good. You can go there with a big group (of course, be prepared for a long wait because there is always one) and each person can get something completely different and every portion is huge. They have salads, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, pizza, chicken, fish, steak, and probably a lot more things that I'm forgetting, not to mention a list of really good appetizers. Cheesecake Factory is definitely a good choice for lunch or dinner, but as I mentioned earlier the wait for a table can be a bit rough, so I would recommend going at an off hour.
