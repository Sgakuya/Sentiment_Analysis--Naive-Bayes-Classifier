One of the top three or four plays the Bard wrote. Familial loyalty put to the test and found lacking, with disasterous results. I don't know if KikiD is kidding or not, but I certainly hope he/she/it is. Maybe William Shakepeare didn't actually write his plays, maybe he was a frontman, a beard, a plant, but whoever wrote the plays that bear Shakespeare's name was hardly a fraud. Whovever wrote these plays was by far the greatest dramatist of all time, and one of the greatest poets who ever picked up a pen. Maybe these plays were written by committee, but even if they were, they're still magnificent, and not at all deserving of a one-star rating by some idiot who probably whacks off to Adam Sandler films.
