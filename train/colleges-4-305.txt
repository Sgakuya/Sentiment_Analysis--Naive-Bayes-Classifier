I studied as distance learner. Because of the high work load at my company it took me 5 years to finish. This is one big advantage of HW MBA that you can choose your study route as flexible as needed. Examinations in Germany were perfectly organized. Distance learning material is well structured and self-explaining. All information needed to pass examination are contained in the studying material. In my opinion there is a high focus on psychological aspects of manager's dessions, negotiations, organisational structure, presentation of facts and figures, etc. This was and is of high value for my day-to-day business.
