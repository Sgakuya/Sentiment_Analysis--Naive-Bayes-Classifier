THE ENGLISh PATIENT. At the time, this reviewer's mother observed that there was nothing wrong about 'The English Patient' that splitting the story into three separate full-length movies couldn't cure. What exactly was it that made the Kristin Scott-Thomas character so unfulfilled in her marriage that it drove her to engage in adultery? Mere ennui, perhaps. It is not easy to grasp narrative purpose in much of director Anthony Minghella's work; a David Lean wannabe, he seems incapable of telling a story simply, including in good efforts like 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' (with good contributions by all others involved in what at the time, novelist Patricia Highsmith notwidhstanding, was an unacknowledged remake of Ren√© Clement's 'A Plein Soleil', 1960, with Maurice Ronet and Alain Delon), and lesser ones like 'Cold Mountain' - another bit of Minghella heavy going.
