I just don't get it. When Macaroni Grill opened in Denver, people waited up to two hours for a table- at lunchtime! I was pretty curious about it, so I joined the throngs of people carrying pagers. What a disappointment! It could have been my crayon-wielding waiter or the loud, cavernous dining room reminiscent of my high school cafeteria that turned me off. In any case, I just didn't like it. The food was fine, but nothing to write home about. The worst part was feeling like I was part of a cattle herd as they shepherded people in and out. This is not the kind of experience I like when I go out to eat, and I do not plan to go back!
