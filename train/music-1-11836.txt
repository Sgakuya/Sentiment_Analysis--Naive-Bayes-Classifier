New Found Glory is just another boy band with guitars,wheres the individuality these days?It seems as if large money hungry corporations have got a hold on this so called punk fad they practically took everything that punk stood for and raped it up the a** just to fill they're fat wallets bands like New Found Glory,Good Charlotte,and Simple Plan are the complete opposite of what punk stands for, I just don't understand why these bands can't put all the fake crap away and just admit that they are mainstream pop.I have to say NFG isn't nearly as irritating as simple plan and they certainly aren't as horribly and disgustingly annoying as Avril Lavingne.Their music lacks any thing special or deep and their songs are juvenile and shallow,to me NFG is weemo(whiney emo) the kind that sing about their girlfriend dumping them.But if superficial and light pop music or carbon copied radio friendly so called pop-punk is your preference then this CD is a perfect choice for you.
