WARNING== **MAJOR SPOILERS** ahead!! This movie is just really upsetting. I saw no real motivating factor for this woman to cheat on her husband, he was a perfectly good husband and they had a wonderful son and beautiful home ... I just didn't get why she was so willing to throw it all away. And okay, so maybe she is so selfish that she is willing to throw it all away just for the sex but why would she go and give her lover something that her husband gave her?! That's just insane!! The scene of violence in this movie really made me sick to my stomach and actually so did the sex. The sex wasn't sexy to me at all, it was just too sad to be anything remotely close to sexy. I just felt really sad watching those scenes, knowing that she was throwing it all away. The ending is kinda bad and leaves you hanging a little bit but I saw it on DVD(just finished it) and they have deleted scenes on there, one of which being a sort of alternate ending and that ending is much better than the one they went with so make sure to watch it if you are unsatisfied with the ending. I could go on about the many reasons I didn't like this movie but I really just need to get my mind off of it. The reason I rated it a 2 instead of a 1 is because it DID hold my interest, because it had decent acting, decent directing, some decent symbolism, and a few scenes that I enjoyed - one showing us how Connie found out what her hubby did and the other being Connie thinking about catching that Taxi instead of going up to Paul's place after they first met. Those few things warranted a rating better than terrible, and bad is the only other choice before Ok and it certainly wasn't Ok ... Now if you will excuse me, I have to go wash this bad taste out of my mouth!
