Dominates in every category but can't stay consistently healty. Virtually everything he throws is wicked, with a weird circle changeup and mid 90's fastball. He also has a nasty slider, and backdoor slider. It looks like a fastball and breaks very late, a true slider. He's kind of a smartelic in real life and tends to pitch inside, a little to inside at times. Despite being on a team that hits .295, he gets virtually no run support, resulting in a lot of no decisions, and his health keeps him from getting enough of everthing to win a CY. Possibly the best pitcher of all time, but I saw him get smashed against the Orioles earlier this year.
