Though now showing its age, FF7 remains a landmark in not only the role-playing game universe but the beggining of a new chapter in the gaming world. Starting off in the slums of a corporate owned gorgeously noir metropolis (unconventional to the playstation at the time, there are NO loading screens between FMV and the action, and it seamlessly flows from the vast overview of the city to the action on the ground, what black magic is this?!) it's fairly obvious this game is something special. Combining plot elements of corporate greed, corruption, love, betrayal and the most reflective of tradgedy the game manages to create a diverse cast of characters with their own attitudes and agendas whilst continually leaving you in awe of the landscape and the epic, unexplored nature of the world. Using an unprecedented ATB (Active time battle) system as well as creating the idea of materia that grows and evolves with the character, not to mention the innovative concept of limit breaks which can shift the course of comabt instantly (particularly interesting in adding a strategic element to the game in that the more damage you recieve the closer you get to your next limit break). The plot is nowhere near as silly and cliched as previous FF outings and rest assured you will not be rescuing any princesses or gathering any crystals, rather you might be cross-dressing to get closer to the local crime lord or snowboarding down pistes to reach the location of your adversary. On the subject of which, all the mini-games are superbly executed and provide plenty of arcade distraction for the more action orientated gamer. With a glorious soundtrack which peaked at number 1 in the Japanese album charts for weeks on end this game provides a truly feel. FF7 has incredible longevity estimated at between 45 and 70 hours of gameplay. Less a game and more of an experience, one that I will never forget.
