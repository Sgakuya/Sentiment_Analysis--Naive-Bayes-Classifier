I received a gift basket of Bigelow Tea and biscuits. After our kids opened their presents on Xmas morning, my husband and I decided to have a leisurely, relaxing time and tried the Bigelow Tea. My God, it was awful! I had to brush my teeth again just to remove the after-taste! I definitely do not recommend the Bigelow Tea! I prefer the well-known, traditional tea like Tetley or Lipton teas. At least with them, I know tea will taste like tea not some crazy ill-invention! I prefer not being a guinnea-pig experiment for Bigelow products. Obviously, they have not conducted their focus group or market /product research thoroughly. Or are they too cheap to test their products before mass distribution?
