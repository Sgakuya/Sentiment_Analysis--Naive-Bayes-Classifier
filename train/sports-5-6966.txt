My favorite player of all-time, Larry Bird is the epitomy of a player who was probably not gifted physically. Nevertheless, what he lacked in physical talent, Larry Legend made up for by his brutal work ethic. Practice was a drug he craved, and satisfied to no means. The 'Hick from South Lick' was a coach's dream and opponents' nightmare. Here was this great player who could play both offense and defense. And as a shooter, Bird was a sniper. But what defined him most was his legendary rivalry with the equally great Magic Johnson. Both men raised their bar of play, especially against each other. In return, they not only made themselves great, but succeeded in making the NBA great.
