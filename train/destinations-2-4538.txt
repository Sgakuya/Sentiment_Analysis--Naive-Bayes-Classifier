I lived in the Phoenix area for 7 years. Loved hiking in the desert (gorgeous, especially in March when flowers are in bloom)and driving to Tucson, Bisbee and Sedona. Hated the traffic around Phoenix and the horrible drivers, the relentless heat, the plastic brainless culture of the city. Loved the Mexican and American Indian cultural flavor that infuses the place; hated the segregation of Mexicans into menial labor and poor neighborhoods. Hated the high crime rate (a friend was murdered the 1st year I lived there) and the lack of social cohesion and the rabid right-wing politicians. In the end, despite good friends and the desert, I really was glad to move away.
