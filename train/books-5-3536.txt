Funny as hell! And it's good for one's facutal knowledge as well. It's clear that Al Fraken certainly knows his statistics (as evidenced by the Waylon chapters). The chapters on Newt Gingrich are classics (particularly the one entitled Sex, Giraffes, and Weightlessness ). And the 26-chip system for television that was proposed was HILARIOUS! The book is intended to be funny, and funny it certainly is. Rush Limbaugh makes the claim that he's an entertainer who happens to be conservative. Well, sorry, Rush, but the round of entertainers with political views definitely goes to Al. One cannot go through life missing Operation Chickenhawk . Enjoy.
