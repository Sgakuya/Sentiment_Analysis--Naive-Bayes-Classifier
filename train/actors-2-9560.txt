 This woman was very good in an old British TV series years ago and then suddenly WOW she was in these big Hollywood blockbusters. I would assume she would be a bit haughty but that might have been from 'hard knocks' and nobody would begrudge her having that saggy arsed Micheal Douglas as her husband....How hard it must be for him to keep up with her and can you imagine how many times he would have to tell her how 'beautiful' she is before a big awards night out? I was personally disappointed with her delivery of 'All the Jazz' in Chicago....Way too much vibrato and not very good vocal gymnastics to boot. That song is meant to be sung straight, not overcamped up the way she ruined it......All through that film you could see she was competing with Renee Zellweger and I actually got the feeling they really 'did' hate each other and not just their characters.....She likes older men (Gere, Connery, Douglas) yeh for sure but she's cold as custard on screen.....She's mutton dressed up as lamb sorry......
