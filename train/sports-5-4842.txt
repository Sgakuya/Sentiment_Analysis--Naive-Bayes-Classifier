A coach is usually graded on two things. The number of wins, and how tough the team is to play against. I will concede that Herb has not had as many wins as some other coaches. But I assert that NC State is one of the toughest teams to play in the NCAA's. How often do you hear opposing coaches say they have to try to make State play a fast paced game? Almost all the time. That is because most teams don't think they can outplay Herb's teams in the 1/2 court. What this shows is that most teams are willing to change their normal game plan to try to beat State. What other coaches come to mind that make other teams change their style just to beat you? Dean Smith, Jim Boeheim, Lute Olsen, Coach K. For a coach who some say isn't very good, he does seem to garner respect from coaches of so called better teams... hmmm I wonder why that is..... Maybe it's because he's a prettry darn good coach????? NOTE: He has more votes on this board than most of the other coaches... Another reason why this guy is great!!!!!
