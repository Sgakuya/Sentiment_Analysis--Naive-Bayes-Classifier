Wow did this book grab me! I purchased it after reading all of the glowing reviews on RateItAll and was not disappointed. The whole idea of whether leaders are born or created has always been fascinating to me, and Orson Scott Card does a very believable job of demonstrating how it might very well be a combination of both. The mind games which the military played with Ender as a child in order to prepare him for his role in history were captivating. The idea of isolating someone from every peer group which he has, teaching him again and again that nobody will ever be there to rescue him when the going gets rough, and knowing exactly the moments when he has had too much (and all before the subject turns 12!)... this is a riveting book. Ender's Shadow is next for me...
