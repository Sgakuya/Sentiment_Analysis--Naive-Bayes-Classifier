Started our trip to Kansas City in lousy fashion with a U.S. Airways ticket lady with a TERRIBLE Disposition. This lady Debbie had a rotten attitude towards me & my wife- & took a woman 15 people behind us first. We left from Providence early to make our flight, but this woman comes in late. This ticket lady yells at us after we moved up & we were there for 5 minutes waiting - I said this woman has NO PERSONALITY whatsoever & is miserable in dealing with people. Then we wait in Kansas City for an hour to file a Complaint that they lost one of our suitcases. They call at 10 o'clock to say they will bring our luggage tonight- - but never came! They call at 3 o'clock in the morning -then to say- they will definitely come later with our suitcase. They arrived late in the morning. The man asked if they were all tied together! I said no because we had given to the people passing them through the checking tunnels! How ridiculous can you be & so sarcastic. That was their explanation to us- they were not tied together. It was a Terrible way to treat persons traveling. We are there to enjoy ourselves & I found U.S. Airways has hired many imbeciles. On the other side of the coin- the flights were a OK & the people in Kansas very nice to us. No wonder they are losing Business- the way they treat people! The Black woman in Providence was very helpful & those at the counter in Kansas- I found very Helpful!
