Tom Wolfe's amazing Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test chronicles Ken Kesey (groundbreaking author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ) and his early experiments with LSD, his leadership of the Merry Pranksters, his ground-breaking Magic Bus trip, his involvement in establishing the music and popularity of the Grateful Dead, and his numerous run-ins with the law. Wolfe's fiction-like non-fiction style, which he also used in The Right Stuff, is the perfect medium for telling Kesey's incredible story. Acid Test really does an excellent job of taking you inside the heads (no pun intended) of Kesey and the diverse band of drop-outs and misfits who follow him, including the legendary Neal Cassady (the basis for the Dean Moriarity character in Kerouac's On the Road ). If you've ever had any interest in the 60s counter-culture, you'll have a hard time tearing yourself away from this book.
