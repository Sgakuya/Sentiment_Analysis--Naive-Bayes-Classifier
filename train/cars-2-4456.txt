Its not just the headgaskets, its the transmissions too! Bought my 1995 Windstar new from dealer. At 35,000 miles the transmission was repaired--but that only lasted a few months. Thank god it was covered by warranty, because then what happened next was also covered. The fixed transmission had to be replaced by Ford at 43,000 miles. Then that second trasnmission lasted less than a year, and had to be replaced again by Ford at 53,000 miles. So then I'm driving around with my third transmission. CAN YOU SAY DESIGN DEFECT? They just burn and grind themselves out prematurely. OH--and heaven forbid I should forget--I HAD THE HEAD GASKETS BLOW at 61,000 miles TOO!! Of course the dealer salivated when offering to buy it from me at $3,000 under WHOLESALE book value in that condition, so I could buy another heap from FORD. No thanks Mr. Edsel.
