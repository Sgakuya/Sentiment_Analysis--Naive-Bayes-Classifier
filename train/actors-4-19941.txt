You can tell she puts a hell of a lot into her acting and I am aware that is well documented. What I don't particularly like is her Hollywood way of smiling sweetly at the camera and saying what she has been told to say. She is intelligent as well as quite obviously beautiful so she should be allowed to carry herself naturally on camera to her fans. I've never met her but I did write to her and only got a reply from her fan club - bummer. Anyway, just being critical, sorry if I have offended anyone and I am also saddened about the end of Buffy - well, at least after series 3 when it stopped being any good......
