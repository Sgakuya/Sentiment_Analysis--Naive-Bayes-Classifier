Mary was discovered by Jack Nicholson and he cast her as the lead in his film, Goin' South . I first saw her in her second film, Time After Time and found her irresistable. While starring parts have been rare ( One Magic Christmas , Dead of Winter , Cross Creek ) her supporting roles have been great, ( Parenthood , Ragtime , Miss Firecracker , Back to the Future III , Gilbert Grape ) even when the the movies themselves left a lot to be desired ( Romantic Comedy , Nixon ) To see a true example of Mary's talent rent The Butcher's Wife . The only time this film comes to life would be her scenes (and she gets to sing too!) Oh, did I mention she is an Academy Award Winner for Melvin Howard ? The downside is that she doesn't seem to be offered the types of parts to showcase her talent so we don't get to see her ofter enough in the movies (except in nonsense like Pontiac Moon ) But she has done some wonderful TV movies especially The Attic But obviously the age thing pops up again which is why the best actresses aren't working as much as they should. Bottom line: Mary is one of the best underused performers today.
