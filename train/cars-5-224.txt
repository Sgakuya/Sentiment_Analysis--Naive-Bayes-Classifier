I absolutely LOVE my Honda Rincon...I feel bad for everyone else. :) The Rincon Doesn't necessarily need a low range with it's torque converter. I can crawl up a hill that would make Mountain-Goat nervous; or I can move at about 10 mph comfortably. The Rubicon is a fine machine to be sure - however, the Rincon and the Rubicon weigh the same (600 pounds), and the Rubicon's Engine displacement is only 499 cc's (compared to the Rincon's 650 cc's). Because of its power-to-weight ratio, the Rincon DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEED a low Range, but it would be nice to have one lower gear for pullng an elk out of the back country. The Rincon offers the smoothest ride in the world of ATV's to be sure. A powerful and smooth machine.
