Been to Sierra Vista in March 2003 and Phoenix/Scottsdale in July of this year. I drove through Sierra Vista looking for something fun to do and drove plum out of town into the desert without finding anything fun to do. I did find a real good steakhouse called Daisy Mae's. Scottsdale was 110F every day. Anyone who tells you that crapola about It's dry heat and ain't that bad, is on crack. I'm in decent shape but felt like I was running an 800 just walking in the afternoon sun. Fortunately, the casino I visited each day had the AC cranked high. Nights and early mornings are rather pleasant, however. I found the people to be very friendly. One old guy at my hold 'em table told me he has lived here for 43+ years and still can't tolerate the heat. AZ definitely falls into the category of nice place to visit, but I don't want to live there.
