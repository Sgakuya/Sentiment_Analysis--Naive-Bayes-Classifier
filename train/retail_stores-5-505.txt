I recently got introduced to Lands End by my mom. It may be that I am getting older and I care more about clothes that are comfortable and functional than looking cute. It may be that I look for value and quality instead of style but Lands End has some really great stuff. They have great outdoors wear. I have a couple of fleeces and windbreakers from Lands End that are just great. They have some pretty stylish 3/4 length sleeved shirts from casual to dressy. There is one pair of cargo pants for women that I really want to get. It is reasonably priced too. It is a great place to get gifts for anyone from kids to grandparents. I am so excited about the new discovery.
