The man's a joke! He's a horrible speaker, always screwing up his words to the point where it's embarrassing to the country. I used to just laugh it off. I thought it was good that we had a prime-minister who didn't fit in the usual phony polititian catagory. After two terms though, I've realised (along with the rest of Canada) that he is a phony. He is just really bad at it. However, he has mildly taken advantage of the good american economy, and by that I mean he hasn't screwed up our own economy. One thing you can be sure about with the liberals in power, is that nothing will drastically change, and therefore nothing will drastically take a turn for the worse. Isn't it strange that the PC's are wanting to implement change, and the liberals are content with things the way they are. Doesn't that contradict their names?
