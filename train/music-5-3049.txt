One of my favorite Beatle albums, Let It Be is a must have for every Beatle fan. I mean, it's got sooooo many great songs- First off, Let It Be, which you just can't explain, it's so beautiful. And what a GREAT guitar solo in the middle by the one and only George Harrison! And the lyrics, wow. You've also got Across The Universe, which I absolutely love. The Line-Pools Of Sorrow, Waves Of Joy, how wonderful is that? Ladies and Gentleman, the beauty of John Lennon. And Two Of Us is just a great song altogether. You've also got Get Back, The Long and Winding Road, and so on. This album is just altogether legendary. It's really sad that it had to end, and that they were fighting pretty much through the whole making of this album, but look how it turned out! A masterpeice, is all I can say. The only thing that takes that away, is that they didn't really put it together themselves, Phil Spector did. Other than that, a masterpiece!
