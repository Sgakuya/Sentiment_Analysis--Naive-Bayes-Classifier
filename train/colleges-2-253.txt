I enjoyed earning my MBA from UOP. I say this with both pride and realism. My program was intensive, non-stop and intellectually stimulating. The program was also rife with poor instructors and unworthy students. I got a great deal out of the program because I put a great deal of effort into the program. Many people went through on autopilot and should not have receive the degrees they received. I pursued the UOP MBA even though I was aware of the school's poor reputation, limited accreditation, and, in my opinion, questionable marketing practices. I remember a school recruiter trying to convince me that regional accreditation was better than AACSB accreditation. I enrolled at UOP because it fit my life. UOP allowed me to go to school and maintain my marriage, child, and work responsibilities. My employer also paid the bill. My investment was the two years. I know that many potential employers chuckle when they see UOP on a resume. Fortunately my employer, a major telecom, finds UOP to be an acceptable institution. Many of my peers and subordinates are pursuing various degrees from UOP. Since graduation I have received two promotions, both at least partly due to my MBA. My salary has also doubled. [Don't be overly impressed with this one. 2 X 0 still equals 0.] Yet I know that having UOP on my resume is not always helpful in my quest to potentially grow my career away from my current employer. I also realize that my UOP MBA will not be my ticket to an executive suite at corporate HQ. UOP can't compete with the B-schools that get people into those offices. My advice to anyone reading this would be to look at schools with stronger reputations and accreditation. There are many more flexible programs at good schools today than four years ago. UOP should be a last resort. However, if UOP is your best option, I would say go for it and get the most out of it you can.
