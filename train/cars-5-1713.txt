The ZX3 impressed me as much as any car I have ever driven. I test drove one for my daughter who was thinking of buying one. I had no intentions of buying a new car at the time, but after the test drive I was sold. My daughter bought the automatic but I had to have the 5speed model. It's handling characteristics are unbelievable. It drives and corners more like a sports car. Good ride, plenty of room, fantastic stereo and great fit and trim quality. Beautiful malibu blue color. I just can't say enough about this car. By the way, I traded in a Camry for this car and I am having a lot more driving fun. I am totally satisfied and would buy another one if need be.
