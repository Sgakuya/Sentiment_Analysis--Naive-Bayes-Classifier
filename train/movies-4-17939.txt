The reason some people say that the Exorcist is not scary is because it has been copied over and over again throughout the years. But you have to understand that when it came out there had been no other move like it. For example, people talk about the part where she turned her head all the way around as looking fake. Well the only reason it looks that way is because we're expecting it. Suddenly seeing it happen without knowing it is going to happen can catch a person off guard! To me the movie is still as powerful and intense as it ever was. But it's probably not for everybody. For anyone that hasn't seen it, be forwarned that it's pretty hairy.
