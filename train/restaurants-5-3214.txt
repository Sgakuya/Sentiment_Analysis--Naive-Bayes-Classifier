I've always liked Papa John's Pizzas far better than the oil soaked Pizza Hut Pizza's. I was thrilled when a Papa John's opened up within the appropriate turnaround distance near work (Southlake, TX). We decieded to give them a try. I placed the order and then left to go pick up the Pizza. Things got off to a very ominous start. The order while correct in the ingredients, was not the right size. The manager immediately offered to cook a fresh pizza while I waited, so I told her to go ahead. While I waited, I was offered the customary free drink for having to wait. Within the promised six minutes, they had a fresh pizza of the proper size boxed up and ready for me to go - free of charge!!! The staff at this store did everything possible to make up for the error in the order. We will be back again.
