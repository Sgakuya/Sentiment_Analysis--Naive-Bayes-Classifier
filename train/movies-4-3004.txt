Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. What a combination. Their timing was impeccable! The female lead role portraying Elizabeth Hadley was way off, especially with regard to her looks. She was an excellent actress. However, she would have been better cast as a CIA person either in the field or in the office. It would have been more believable if someone similar to Helena Bonham Carter had played the damsel. The pace could have been a tad more staccato and the soundtrack could have increased the suspence factor more in a few places. I rated the movie a 4 because the audience was not spared several ugly truths about spy games and our intelligence was not insulted as much as in other movies of this genre. Be still my heart... Robert (experience, charisma, machismo!)...Brad (Strong appeal, passionate, fun!). Yes, I'll buy the video!
