I sat in the theaters for about 3 hours watching this movie. I've said this over and over, but I'll say it again...I really wish that there was a 3.5 rating. Anyway, this movie was partially romance genre, which in my opinion, kept the war plot a little more interesting. I have to admit, however, that I was not in awe after leaving the theater. The movie was pretty good..worth the pay. The movie could have been a tad better, however. As others said, it was nothing compared to Saving Private Ryan . Not bad, however. Good enough for me to give it the benefit of the doubt and not give it a 3. :o) Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett were quite good...
