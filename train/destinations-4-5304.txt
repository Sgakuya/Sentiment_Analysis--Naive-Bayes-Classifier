 Pennsylvania is a ggod state. I have lived here all my life. The Eastern portion has easy access to the Poconos, NYC, and Philadelphia. The Montgomery-Bucks-Delaware County suburbs are great places if you can afford to live there. Allentown-lehigh County is a dump. Northampton County is a good spot. Bethlehem is a great town and the surrounding areas in NORCO like Bethlehem Township and Nazareth are great places to live. Easton is a white trash city but there exist a few redeeming qualities to counteract the trash that live there. Reading is a dump and Berks County in general has some real boring close minded miserable people. Harrisburg is a dump. Penn State is cool. Johnstown is a solid working class town. Pittsburgh the few times I have been out there is a cool town that is revitalizing itself nicely after the mid-70's 80's recession and shift away from blue collar to white collar.
