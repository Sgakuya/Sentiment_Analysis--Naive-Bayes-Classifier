While it is hard for peaceniks, treehuggers and socialists to comprehend, Reagan ingeniously halted the largest system of human oppression the world has ever witnessed by accelerating the arms race and literally starving out the Communist beast. Had he resorted to negotiation and arms talk, much more of the third world today would be under Communist rule. In the 1970s, the Communists were poised to become decidedly more aggressive against Western freedom and were already contemplating their chances of victory in a first-strike nuclear attack against the West. We'd still be there had Reagan not had the vision he did. A big thumbs up to one of the greatest presidents in history - a man who not only did great things for America, but the world.
