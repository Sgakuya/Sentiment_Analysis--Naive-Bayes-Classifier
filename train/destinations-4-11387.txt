I recently camped for two nights in Joshua Tree National Park. I couldn't really explore as much as I would have liked, because I had my dog with me and he wasn't allowed on any of the trails. But even though I was confined to the roads I had a great time. Joshua Tree isn't as naturally stunning as parks like Yellowstone, Glacier, or Yosemite, but it has a really interesting desert feel, and the tortured trees the park is named after are pretty wild. It's also one of the best places in the country for rock-climbing, and there are all kinds of crazy rock formations jutting up in the western half of the park. I was there in February, so I didn't have to deal with the extreme heat of the summer - it was warm during the day and cold at night. This isn't the kind of park you'd want to spend a week exploring, but it's well worth a day or two.
