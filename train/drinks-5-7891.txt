Great, smooth, wonderful Whiskey. Tried Gibson's 12 year old and it just isn't as good as Crown Royal. If it has to be Whiskey and it has to be good... Go for a Crown Royal. alicat: I've actually stepped up to a crowded night club dance bar and ordered it by name. It wasn't cheap, but it was much much better than the 25 cent draft! It is amazing how many people notice you are drinking something really good when they hear you order it... prattrd: Seagram's 7 Crown = Crown Royal? Interesting opinion. Seems that Seagram's 7 is an American type wiskey and Crown is a Canaidan type . The only way would be to actually try both at the same time... It isn't hard to believe that Crown might have some Seagram's 7 in it, since it is a blend of the finest whisky's and Segram 7 isn't a blended whisky at all.
