This is one of the great classics. Ernst Hemningway drinked a lot of this drink when he resided in Cuba. This is the receipt I use 4 cl Rom (White or Brown - ex: Havana Club 3 anos) 1 Lime 2 ts brown sugar 10 leaves of (pepper) mint Soda (Carbonated Water) (If you don't understand cl then you should read some more about the metric system... ) Use a morter to crush 1/2 lime(include all!), the sugar and the leaves of mint. Add this in a glas. Press the other half of lime in the glas. Add Rom. Add Soda. Stir. Serve. The Lime can vary very much in strength and sournes. Add/remove sugar/melis too get it as sweet as you appreciate.
