The OUBS is the perfect way to combine learning and work and get more from both. I studied for an MBA and found the course material was well written and helped me turn theory in to practice. The course tutors were excellent; because they actually worked professionally in the areas they taught and were able to illustrate the subjects with lots of examples. My OUBS MBA has done more to help me develop personally and professionally than any other course I have ever studied. It was really hard work and even though I studied alone there was always someone to contact to if I needed support, whether it be the course tutor, the course internet conference or a fellow student. I am full of admiration for the OUBS and it approach to learning which is open to people, whatever their age, financial or domestic circumstances
