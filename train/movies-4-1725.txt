Since when do all movies teach a moral message? This is a true story, and the lesson is that even humans with a lot of training and knowledge can make mistakes. The ranking officers who planned this mission made a ton, and the story is about the men forced to react to their mistakes. This was not an easy movie to watch; but extremely well filmed and acted. I actually felt what it was like to be in the midst of chaos and battle, in my opinion high praise for the director and actors. All the men portrayed in this film were flawed, with prejudices and weaknesses just like any average human being. What made them heroes was their courage in the face of unsurmountable odds.
