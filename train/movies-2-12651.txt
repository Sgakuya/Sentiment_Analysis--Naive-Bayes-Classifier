. . . Well, it's not like I was expecting this to be a great movie or anything. But, sometimes, you just want to see things get blown up and people kicking butt. SYNOPSIS: Centuries-old battle between vampires and werewolves, blah blah blah . . . Round two is just the battle between the ex-werewolf hunter and her werewolf-vampire hybrid lover versus the first werewolf and vampire brothers. Lots of fighting, lots of things getting blown up. The End. PROS: Well, you're not going to the theater for this movie for the dramatics. You pay matinee prices to see fight scenes, and it delivers that much. CONS: You know it's a bad movie when they gotta throw in the gratuitious sex scene within the first half hour of the movie. Come on. At least it was kind of funny: They might have well said "We're being chased by this ugly badass guy who wants to kills us . . . now's a good time to get laid!" It was nothing special, but then again, it wasn't expected to be, either. OVERALL: Meh. It was pretty much all that I expected: an hour and forty-five minutes of prettier vampires and werewolves beating up uglier vampires and werewolves.
