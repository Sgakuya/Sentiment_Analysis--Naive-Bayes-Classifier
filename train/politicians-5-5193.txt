President AlGore is an outstanding American. His environmental views are ahead of his time. Overpopulation and environmental destruction are the two greatest dangers for this country, and in the world in my opinion.(Witness the 600 jile dead zone off the state of Texas, from the fertilizers flowing from the Mississippi river.) I know that Al Gore understands this and other problems. I live in Texas, and I promise you, we do NOT want George W Bush as President. Texas is a mess, and the rest of the country will follow.... Wealth concentrated in 7% of the population and more guns on the streets.....could mean major social unrest. This state is a regression from the rest of the states. Sign a petition to have George Bush do the 'right thing' and step down. He is not 'equipted' to be president of this great country. If we want intelligent government that willseriously problem solve, we want Albert Gore for president. I promise you.
