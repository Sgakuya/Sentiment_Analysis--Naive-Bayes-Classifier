Cold winters, but collective attitude of Chicagoians cancel that out. Have only visited, but will move there permanently in near future. Have lived in (touristy area) in Florida for over a decade and, it's not a myth: Chicagoians have the nicest attitudes (next to Texans). In contrast, I can regognize people from my home-town region (northeast coast region) just by the chip-on-the-shoulder, superior, aloof, "Apaprently Done Something Really Horrible to Me in a Past Life or Something" attitudes. I'm a born and raised east coaster myself, so not biased. Just never noticed this until I moved to Florida. Chicago (the entire midwest & south, for that mater) have their fair share of issues, whether it be congestion, tragedies, bad weather, crime ... so what's the deal that people (everywhere) can't exhibit 2nd grade-level consideration when out and about? Their problems are no worse. This has intrigued me for 11 years now ... is there something funky in New England/Jersey (& neighbors) drinking water?
