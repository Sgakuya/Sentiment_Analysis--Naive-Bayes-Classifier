I am so pleased to have Dish now. I recently switched from Direct TV, because of the cost. I hear so many people complain about both networks, because of the service or installation people. Both companies subcontract, so it is Russian Roulette when call. I have the same programming with both Satellite companies, but Dish is $16 less a month. For a few days, I had both satellites hooked up, and the Dish picture was incredibly better. My advise is if you have bad service or installation techs, get the number for Retention, and file a complaint. If no one complains about the subcontractors, they will keep doing a poor job.
