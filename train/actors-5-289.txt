I?ve mostly just seen clips of different bits done by Chaplin. Unlike prophets, comedians are sometimes best appreciated in their own time I think. While I could see that this man was talented and had the added fortune of being very appreciated in his life and career, I really did not get the humor. Part of that opinion is no doubt due to the fact that his stage persona was imitated to death over the past 80 or so years. I do feel that one of his best works was his send up of Hitler in ?The Great Dictator?. And, I don?t have to guess how I arrived at that conclusion since I KNOW it is based on the fact that I grew up and developed my sense of humor during the very cynical 60?s and 70?s.
