Cannot believe this is not the number 1 store. I just love Lord Taylors merchandise, selection, and classy displays. Have trouble getting the coupons and savings pass in the mail. Believe they should be sent to each active charge customer with their bill - even if they need to be post dated - that is OK. I miss out on many events since the mailed coupons and savings passes are not received, someone must be stealing them before the post man has a chance to deliver them - I am a dedicated customer with an excellent credit rating and active Lord Taylor account and would like to receive the coupons/passes preferably via e-mail or with my bill. I cannot get any satisfaction speaking on the courtesy phone. Please make contact via e-mail possible. Thanks so much.
