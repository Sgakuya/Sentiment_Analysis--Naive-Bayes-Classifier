I think this is where I stopped loving the Harry Potter series. When I first read book 5, I got sick of it and put the book down towards the middle. Several months later, I decided to finish it. I shouldn't have. This is not only the worst Harry Potter book ever written, but also the worst fantasy novel I have ever read in a long time. Harry gets treated like trash in the first few chapters, and no one will tell him what is going on. Very annoying. And throughout the entire book, the authorities of the Ministry of Magic ruin Harry's year with their impotence and their false rumors. But what J.K. Rowling doesn't realize is that the many tragedies that Harry experiences throughout OotP simply escalates the level of garbage in this book. Percy becomes evil. Harry and the Weasleys cannot play Quidditch. Hagrid cannot teach. I mean, there's no magic or wonder in this book, just drama. It's not fun. And what's with Umbridge? Was J.K. Rowling out of her mind when she crafted this character? Did she think Umbridge would add great elements to the book? She made the story more unbearable to read than Snape. Finally, Sirius dying? What kind of a stupid ending is that? I'm convinced that if this book ever becomes a movie, it will get a PG-13 rating. It's just awful.
