I went to Atlantic City for the first time this past May. I have never been inside a casino before in my life. Walking into Trump and Taj Mahal was an amazing experience for me. The atmosphere of the casinos with all the classy architecture, flashy lights, and diversity of people made an unforgettable experience. I only spent a few hours though and didn't gamble much. Just as the other commenters wrote, outside of the casinos, Atlantic City is a dump. It is an interesting place to visit but not a place to live. The southern Jersey coast, from Atlantic City to Cape May, is also a good 2-3 hour excursion if you are in the Atlantic City area.
