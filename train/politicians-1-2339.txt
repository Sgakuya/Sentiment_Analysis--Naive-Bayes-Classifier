I understand Mr. Powell was the only one on the Joint Chiefs of Staff who opposed the Gulf war. He was in the position to relay comunication between President Bush and General Schwartskoff.According to the documentary I and my Brother saw on the Gulf war, when General Schwartskoff asked permmision to pursue and annihilate the Republican Guard, General Powell relayed to the President the Republican Guard is retreating northword . The President then said well, I guess thats all we can do . General Powell then contacted General Schwartskoff and said Let them go . General Schwartskoff replied Yes sir . I could not believe what I had heard! That ended the gulf war without finishing it!!! The destruction of that Guard would have meant the fall of Saddam Hussan. Instead, ten years and Billions of dollars later We are still there!!!!! No, I don't think Colin Powell is so wonderful! Just an ordinary man who can make mistakes, too.
