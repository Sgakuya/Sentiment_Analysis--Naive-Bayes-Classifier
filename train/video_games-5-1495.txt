This is a great game. The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a GCN game. Throughout the duration of the game (which is very long) you'll not see a single loading screen. Through the whole game you get to explore several sections of planet Tallon IV, which range from a tropical oasis to an ancient city, and from firey underground lava filled caves to a polar paradise. The game itself isn't that hard until you get to the last couple of bosses. That is, if you've collected a sufficiant amount of energy and powerups. If you don't collect enough energy tanks or missles, the game will be very hard for you, and unfortunately, these items aren't entirely easy to come across. Some are very well hidden while others are out in the open. Now for the fun part... The gameplay. This game feels like a Metroid game, a scavenger hunt of sorts to find the most items you can to beef yourself up for the final battle. There's a new feature in this game called the Scan visor. It basically gives the player the ability to scan items and creatures to learn more about them. It can get boring, though, so it's a good thing the scan visor is mostly optional. The controls on this game take some getting used to, but once you learn them it's like second nature. Jumping is one of the worst aspects of the game as you can't see your feet and have basically no idea where you're going to land. All in all, this is a very good game that any Metroid or FPS fan should definately buy.
