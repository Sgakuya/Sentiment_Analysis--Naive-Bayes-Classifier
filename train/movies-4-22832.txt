This was a very good movie that captured all of the images that were in my head from reading the books..however, for some reason, it lost some of the magic for me. I am a Harry Potter/J.K. Rowling fan and have read the series of books several times. Every aspect on screen lived up to my imagination..that was definitely the Dumbledore, Hagrid, Harry..troll etc..in my head..however to see them up on the screen somehow tainted the experience for me. However, if I am to just rate the movie, I would have to say it is excellent. The acting is genuine, the special effects spectacular and the overall message is warm and triumphant. However, if you are a big fan of the books, the movie may lose a bit of the magic for you..for reasons I can not explain! Also, I have read the books to my children (sons, ages 4 and 5) and we did bring them to see the movie. My husband and I decided that if it got to be too much (too scary or too long..2 1/2 hours) we would simply leave. However, we did not leave and the boys loved seeing on screen all of the people and events that had taken place in their imaginations while reading the books (having the books read to them, they are not child prodigies). So, as far as the age guidelines, you really need to assess on an individual basis, I do know 4 and 5, even 8 or 9 year olds who may not find the movie entertaining. Overall, a great movie and honorable message and a wonderful 2 and 1/2 hour escape from realities into the world of Hogwarts.
