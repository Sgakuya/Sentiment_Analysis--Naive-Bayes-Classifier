I've been playing deep, rich, complex games like Baldur's Gate and such on the PC. However, the level of freedom, interactivity, and complexity can sometimes get tiresome. When this happens, I turn to console RPGs. They usually have great stories, little interactivity, and simple interfaces so you can get right into the game and just experience a great story. FF8 fits this bill perfectly. While more complex than others of its type, its not up to Dungeons and Dragons standards certainly, but his was just what I was looking for when I played it. It has a great plot and good characters. People fawn over its graphics, which I didn't think were to spectacular (too used to playing PC games) but I did think the effects were spectacular! Never have I seen such a spectacle as when you use a Guardian Force attack. And the vibrations on the Dual Shock controller were quite a nice touch. I've never been crazy about random battles, and this game is no exception. They are, in general, evenly paced and spread apart, but sometimes, like when you're almost to the exit of a town or something and you get attacked, it can be irritating. Overall, I think it is a great game, with excellent story, spectacular effects, enormous world to explore, and great characters. Its downfalls are its lack of interactivity (you walk a few screens, watch a scene, repeat ad infinitum.) and random battles.
