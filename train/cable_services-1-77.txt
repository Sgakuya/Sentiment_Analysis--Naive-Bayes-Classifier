I'm a charter rep and i say the company s u c k s. it's not the techs and it's not us and it's not the supervisors fault. it's everyone in corporate making all the BIG decisions that are sc.rewing things. not a day goes by that there is something changing with our sales or service. every single day the way charter runs it's business changes. it's either prices, or the way we schedule work orders it changes all the time. nothing is every uniform there. our customer service s.ucks because half of the people in customer are so f.ing slow, the techs are lazy as hell, and the supervisors do nothing but run around and talk all day long. for those of us who do understand how crappy the charter service is and actually know what the hell we are doing at work and actually realize how fu.ck.ed up things are, are so sorry. i personally hate it when i can't get a customers issue resolved because it is beyond my control. charter is so fucused right now on trying to fix customer service without fixing the actual services first! i feel you guys' pain. i have a tech coming out this weekend because of bad pic tiling and hsi connection dropping whenever it feels like it. i'm praying to God that it gets fixed but if not we have to be just like a customer and complain and complain.
