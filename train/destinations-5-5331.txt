I was born and raised in PA. I lived in Lititz, which is 8 miles north of Lancaster. Lancaster County was so beautiful when I lived there (I moved in 1997 to DE). I noticed there is a lot less farmland and more stores now, but that's the way America works I guess. I will ignore the other comments I read about rude people and slums and what-not. You can find rude people and slums everywhere you go. Anyway, a few places in PA I've been to that are beautiful, interesting, and/or fun are: Hershey Park, Dutch Wonderland, Fallingwater (my favorite Frank Lloyd Wright building), Greensburg (at least the drive from DE to the Rolling Rock concert along I-70 and Route 30 was beautiful - awesome view from the mountains), Philadelphia Museum of Art (lots of fun), Fairmount Park (Philly), Olde City/Society Hill/Penn's Landing area (Philly), and of course Lititz (my old hometown) with its Lititz Springs Park, Wilbur Chocolate Factory (they make Wilbur Buds, which beat Hershey's kisses hands-down!), Sturgis Pretzel Bakery, main street, etc. etc...
