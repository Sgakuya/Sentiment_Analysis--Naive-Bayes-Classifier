He's right up there with a couple other illustrious Boston predecessors in Left Field, Ted Williams and Yaz. Ramirez is a better hitter than Carl Yastrezemski (could never spell his name) and just below Williams in hitting ability. Other than the high total of strikeouts, Man-Ram's numbers look a lot like Joe DiMaggio's hitting stats. He led the AL in homers last year, which makes me wonder if he has not been the best power hitters among the [steroid] Clean players below. WS MVP in 2004. 165 RBI in 1999. Led 2 teams (Boston & Cleveland) to 3 World Series. He still is in his early 30s and has an outstanding chance to hit the 600-homer plateau. I know he is a defensive liability, can be a goofball, and the opinion I heard from more than one person is that If he couldn't play ball, he would be working at a minimum wage job. But I have a hard time naming a better pure hitter(outside of Barry Bonds).
