This is the best LP from the early 70s singer-songwriter era, though spots of Joni Mitchell's Blue showed more inspiration than the rest of the genre combined. Just about every song is like your most comfortable blanket -- you never tire of lying around with it. King was one of the truly great songwriters of the rock era (you'll know several of these songs because King gave them to other artists first: James Taylor (You Got a Friend), Aretha Franklin (Natural Woman) and a girl group that escapes my mind right now (Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow). Here she sounds wonderfully relaxed in every song, to the point where you wonder why she wasnt recording these herself when she wrote them. I also want to sneak in a pitch for Mary Lou Lord's song Blowtown which is about this whole era and makes reference to King's unfortunate early retirement. That song is on MLL's Got No Shadow CD from a couple years ago -- well worth finding as well if you're a King fan.
