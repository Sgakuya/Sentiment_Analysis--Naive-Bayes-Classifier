The new Altima is nothing short of a revelation. I can't think of another automotive makeover that has resulted in such a quantum transformation. The exterior styling turns heads and looks good from every angle. Hey, if they had to copy somebody, the Audi A6 was a pretty good source. And who wouldn't be happy with a 240hp V6 purring under the hood? Plus, it remains one of the very few non-German offerings that lets you shift for yourself - something Lexus and Acura are only just figuring out. A recent editon of Motorweek clocked a zero to 60 time of 5.9 seconds with the 5 speed stickshift. This, in an otherwise comfortable, spacious and luxurious family sedan that doesn't cost any more than a Camry. You really can have your cake and eat it too.
