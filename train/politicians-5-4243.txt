Nader knows he's not going to win. His candidacy is all about getting the Green Party 5% of the popular vote, so that it will have federal funding for the next presidential election. Unlike the Reform Party, which was built around one man (Perot), the Green Party already exists in other countries, and its presidential candidate (Nader) has a greater history than any politician in activating people to form grassroots political organizations (such as the Public Interest Research Groups, which exist throughout the country). The greatest threat to democracy in the USA is the widespread political apathy of its citizens. Sure, corporate lobbyists write legislation and Fortune 500 companies pay no taxes; American citizens can't even be bothered to vote, much less complain to their congressperson or representative. The only chance democracy has in the USA is if we the people take it back into our own hands; and that's what Ralph Nader is campaigning for. That's what the Green Party can do, if we overcome our own fear and apathy. Vote Green!
