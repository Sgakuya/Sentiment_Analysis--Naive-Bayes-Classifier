california is probably the greatest state of them all. it's unbelivable. i go there for two weeks every year and let me tell you, they are some of the best weeks of my life. from surfing or spending a day at the beach to snowboarding or skiing on the mountains, california has got it all. going to da san diego zoo, hiking in yosemite, going on dolphin and whale tours. i'm not gonna even try to name everything there is to do. Las Angoles, San Diego, San Fransisco, Sacremento, Hollywood, Malibu, it's just one great city after the next. if you're looking to spend a weekend to any amount of time just having the best time of you're life, go to california.
