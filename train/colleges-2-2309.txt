This school is very nice and appeals to the senses, until you have to sit in class with bad chem and calc teachers. I have unfortunatly had to tolerate teachers trying to make visiting them very hard due to their inconvenient office hours. Also, the teaching at this school is very fast in which, after a year has passed you ask yourself Did I even learn anything? Many students alreasy seem to know the material because most have AP credits for courses that they are taking. People with GPA's and SAT scores in the bottom 25% should really think about another school. Here, you are treated as a number of 7,000, many of whom are stuck-up. Contrary to popular thought, a community college education is much easier on the pocket, with a better student to teacher ratio...and better instruction.
