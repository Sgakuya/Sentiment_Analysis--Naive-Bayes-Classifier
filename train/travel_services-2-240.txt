I just had a pretty bad holiday traveling experience with United. To make a long story short, United booked a connecting flight for me with only 25 minutes between my arrival into Dulles, and my departure to Philadelphia. In the rush to get from one flight to the next, I got on a shuttle to the wrong gate by accident. While this only cost me about 10 minutes, it was enough to cause me to miss my connection. This forced me to stay overnight in Washington. Not only would United not pay for a hotel, they wouldn't even pick up the cost of a taxi to my buddy's house so that I could get some sleep before getting on the next day's flight. In denying me, they basically called me an idiot for getting on the wrong shuttle - which may or may not be true - but definitely not something that I needed to be hearing after a long day of Holiday travel.
