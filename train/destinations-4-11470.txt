I'd rate this a 4.5 if I could, but will settle for a 4. Capri tends to be overly romanticized - it's a great little island in the Bay of Naples (Roman emperors liked to build summer villas there, so it has to have something to recommend it), but I can't say that there really is an awful lot to see. There is a great view from the little piazza above the harbor (the place that was used as a location in the Sophia Loren/Clark Gable move It Started in Naples), and riding up on the funicular is fun. The other attraction is the Grotta Azzurra (Blue Grotto, also in the movie). This is an incredible sight to experience - it's hard to believe that a grotto filled with water could be so beautiful. At the right time of day, the light inside is fantastic. Take a minibus up the really narrow, really winding road (full of switchbacks) to Anacapri for another great view. If you have any fear of heights, keep your eyes closed during the whole bus trip - there are places where it's hard to believe that there is a road under you. You have to take it on faith alone, trust the driver, and pray a lot. Lots of seafood (calamari are a good bet), and you can get mussels, octopus, and basically any local fruits of the sea as the Italians call seafood. Wines are all OK (reds tend to be better than the whites, but you'll be able to get decent whites to go with the seafood). Language normally not a problem; English spoken in the service trades. A nice day trip from Naples (and it gets you away from the Naples traffic and congestion). Plenty of ferry and hydrofoil connections between Naples and Capri - they used to have a hovercraft service as well, but am not sure if they still do. Worth a visit.
