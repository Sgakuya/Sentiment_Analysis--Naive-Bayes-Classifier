A nice little film. While it doesn't pack the emotional and artistic punch of the De Bernieres Novel that it is based off of, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is definitely worth seeing. The storyline is exceptional - a love affair between an Italian officer and Greek girl set to the backdrop of the bizarre, joint occupation of a tiny Greek island in WWII by the Germans and the Italians. The cinematography is outstanding, and the location that the movie was shot is breathtaking. Penelope Cruz surprisingly good as the Greek beauty Pelagia, and Nicholas Cage passable as Captain Corelli (though he struggled with the Italian accent). The cinematography reminded me of The Talented Mr. Ripley, the storyline of Romeo and Juliet, and the war scenes and tension of Life is Beautiful.
