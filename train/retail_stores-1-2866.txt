I have to say I agree with most of these horrible ratings.I worked for Whitehall Jewellers for three years, and felt like a used car salesman. What they are selling customers are lies. First of all who runs a 50% off sale for 365 days a year. What they are doing is doubling the price so they can say I'll give you a great deal and cut the price in half. A deal yeah right! Seconed of all their ratings for diamonds are not what we are used to seeing when it comes to GIA certification. Oh and the service plans they try to get you to buy are not worth the hassle when you try to use them. If you want good quality jewelry I recommend you not to shop here and try a local family jeweler one who who can say you would trust with your grandmother's ring. I must say my only regret is being pushed to sell something that wasnt worth the asking price to wonderful people.
