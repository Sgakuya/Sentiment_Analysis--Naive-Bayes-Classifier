I am from Canada and I have a 2005 MINI Cooper. It is the most fun car and best handling car I have ever driven (I driven CRX, Civics, Jetta, Tercel hatch, Prelude, Integra, Corolla, PT Cruiser Turbo, Dodge SRT4, Magnum, 300C, Protege5, Mazda 3 Sport, and more). What I love is that you can get the MINI Cooper going too fast too quickly, not as quick as the Cooper S but quick, and the handling is as good and it corners and holds the road like it was glued. The braking is also amazing, when you hit the brakes really hard you feel the car slow down like you just drove into a lake, stops on a dime and gives you a nickel back! I love all the many included standard features, and the Premium and Sport option packages offer many more great features. When BMW redesigned the Mini they made a good car a great car! Yeah it is designed by a German design team, but they were guided and influenced by the original English car, they worked together with the John Cooper company headed by the son Mike Cooper to developed the upgraded Cooper S engine and the John Cooper Works package upgrade to 210 hp, and they still manufacture the MINI in England. Unlike past English cars that had issues with rust the new MINI's have galvanized body panels and a 12 year rust perforation warranty. The MINI's inherited many features from the BMW line-up, features that have been proven in BMW;s premium line-up, like the multi-link rear suspension and the available Dynamic Stability Control to name just two. I love my MINI!
