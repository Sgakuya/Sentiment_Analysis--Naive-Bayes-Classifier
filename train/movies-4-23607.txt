This movie starts off with a bang. Its concept is intriguing and the way that it is played out is original and interesting. There are memorable performances by Kiefer Sutherland as the doctor and Jennifer Connelly as the wife. However, this is one of those classic examples of style over substance . It's true, this movie has a distinct style that's kind of reminiscent of the 1927 Metropolis (a GOOD thing) but as the movie goes on, it starts to drag, and the fast paced action and paranoia that begins the movie, is muddled in the dialogue and mundaneness of the direction of the movie. The aliens are somewhat creepy, kind of similar to Buffy The Vampire Slayer's The Gentlemen in the Hush episode, but not AS creepy. Their ability to tune allows for very interesting cinematographic tricks, which without otherwise, would make the movie kind of boring. So essentially, watch the film. The beginning makes up for the middle to end of the film.
