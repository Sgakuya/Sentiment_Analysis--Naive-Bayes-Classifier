I bought this bike last week and have really enjoyed it. I do not have a long torso, slightly long legs and the bike has a slightly more agressive posture than I'd prefer, but I consider myself a fast leisure rider. The Ultegra group is really nice and the wheels are great. I replaced the race-type tires with training rubber and the painful seat with a much more cushy gel model. Aside from the Ultegra components and the wheels, the components are good, but a little on the heavy side. The steel frame is nice but heavier than aluminum models. This bike is ideal for me because I'm more of a leisure rider. I'd rather be comfortable on the bike than shaving 1-5 seconds off a 10 mile ride. I'm also not a bike snob like these guys: http://www.jump.net/'macnutt/bikesnobs.html
