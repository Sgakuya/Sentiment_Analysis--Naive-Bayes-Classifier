Moved four times with this comapny. Each time my disappointment, worsening. Two times, long distance and two times within 500 miles. Each time things were broken and this last time, huge mirror over fireplace didn't make it the 2000 miles. The packers left it there and two months later, to the day, I received it after many weeks of emailing them and finally writing their headquarters. This last driver, Jeff, was wonderful and clean and professional in every way, but somehow didn't oversee the packers leave this 5' x 3' mirror, staring at them all day in the living room. Will not use them ever again. Gave them four chances to improve, but to no avail. Sorry to have to write all this but am trying to spare, others some pain and anxiety.
