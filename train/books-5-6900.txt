I am fairly new to fantasy literature, but I apparantly started with the best, that of Tolkien. I then took a nosedive into some fantasy that was unskillfully written and undetailed. Apparently the author of these works has taken almost no time developing a plot that is even remotely complex. And then I found Robert Jordan's The Eye of the World (book 1). I finished the first long novel, simply itching for the next. Then the next. And so on. Woven tightly into these books is a complex plot with many sub-plots that seem to affect the central plot. The likeable characters develop as the story progresses, each following their own personalities and desires. Draws the reader into the story emotionally, will leave you both crying and laughing. Excellent fantasy, well written, pain-stakingly developed in most likely a time-consuming manner. Props to Robert Jordan!
