Renowned as the last hitter to hit .400 in a season (he hit .406 in 1941), he combined power and average in one package. Experts deem that all aspects and fundamentals of his swing were flawless. Best swing ever, they all say. A professed student and author on the art and science of swinging the ash lumber, his observations on batting made Williams some sort of hitting Zen Guru after his playing days were over. Ted Williams was a 2-time AL MVP winner and 2-time Triple Crown. Ironically, he didn't win the MVP in 1941 because that was the year of Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. Williams's lifetime batting average, .344, is the highest BA of any player who appeared in a game post-1940. Using the bottom-line batting indicator of on-base plus slugging, (OPS), Williams OPS of 1.116 is bested all-time only by Babe Ruths 1.164. An acclaimed aviator (Williams eyesight was said to be better than 20-20), Williams missed roughly five years during both World war II and the Korean War. Was AL Manager of the year in 1969, taking a moribund Washington Senators club to their only winning record in their short, tortured tenure in DC (Before moving to Texas). Though the Splendid Splinter's corporeal body rests in a frozen vat in Arizona (What a travestry!!), Williams actually resides with the gods of baseball, alongside Ruth, Mantle, Gehrig, Cobb, and Cy Young.
