Barbara, keep up the good work. We need you to show the American people what the true soul of the Democratic party is. Your pointless, obstructionist grandstanding today achieved nothing for you but much for the President. For this we thank you. Not even the likes of Kennedy or Byrd could see their way clear to support you. Of course, what you did achieve, in employing a tactic that has only been used once before in the last 100 years, is to give the Republicans license to use the Nuclear Option to stop the democratic party's super-majority tactic in blocking the Presidents court nominations. Again, thank you so very much.++++++ UPDATE: Thanks again to Babs Boxer, the women is unbelievable in what she does to support the Republican Party. Her Churlishness at the Rice hearings couldn't have been better for the Republicans. And, as if that wasn't enough, she gets Kerry to join her as the only two negative votes. She is priceless, as is Lurch. They couldn't have made Condi look better.
