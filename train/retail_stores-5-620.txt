OK, first for all of you who think AE is an A F rip off... it's not. AE doesn't put out pornographic catalogs and they don't have kids clothes. They actually have customer service standards and the prices are much more reasonable. For all you who had bad customer service experiences, find out who the person is that was unfriendly to you (we wear nametags... yes, i work there) and tell a manager. They like to know which employees are maintaining the standard of the company and which ones aren't. If you don't like the clothes, no one cares! It's a personal opinion. I don't go writing opinions about stores just because I don't like their clothes. For anyone that goes in and has a great shopping experience there, tell someone! Nothing is more encouraging to an employee than getting a compliment from a customer! Happy Shopping!
