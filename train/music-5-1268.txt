In my opinion, this 1978 debut release from the Cars is the best full-length debut of all time and one of the best releases period. There is not a weak track in the bunch, and the track list looks like a greatest hits compilation at first glance. The only complaint is that it is too short even for vinyl. The Cars definitely had a unique sound which has not yet been duplicated and appealed (and still appeals) to fans of pop, rock, and new wave. The release contains some of the signature songs for the Cars (ie Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl, and Just What I Needed) as well as You're All I've Got Tonight, Bye Bye Love, Moving In Stereo, and All Mixed Up. The only weak tracks in my opinion are I'm In Touch With Your World and Don't Cha Stop, but they may only seem weak due to the overwhelming strength of the primary tracks.
