How could this guy have only 2 1/2 stars. It makes me wonder if it is possible for the people voting to have ever even seen him in anything before. Billy Crudup is an actor not a star and his work reflects this in every way. His style is very theatrical. He is one of those core actors who remind us that acting is an art form. His style is hohnest and real. If people want to see a holly wood beauty who is more concerned with his smile than his charcter Billy Crudup is not the actor for them. His good looks and presence don't get in his way. Because of this he is able to play a wide range of character successfully. When I go to see a Billy Crudup movie I don't go to see him as a person; I go to see the charcter he has createed. I have never been disapointed. This is someone to keep an eye on.
