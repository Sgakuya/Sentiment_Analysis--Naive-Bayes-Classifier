This was pretty bad.... the author was talented enough, but he wrote about a spoiled loser who gets wasted and buys a girl. Wait a minute..... there isnt any plot! When is he actually in a big problem that gets resolved at the end? Maybe.... never? The title had almost nothing to do with the novel, other than Holden's pedo dream job of catching children. And the story has many holes in it. It is enphasized that he looks older than he is, but every single time he tries something, for some reason nobody takes notice of that. Holden even had to point out to the mom on the bus that he had grey hair. I mean, teens always have grey hair, anybody could miss that. The girl he buys knows his age too. He calls everyone phoney, but he himself is phoney. The book makes no sense whatsoever funkytommyman
