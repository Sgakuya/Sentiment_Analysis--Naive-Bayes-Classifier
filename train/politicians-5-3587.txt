What an exhibition of ignorance and malice all rolled into one place! One ignoramous states he doesn't know what laws are being passed and blames that on President Bush! Amazing! I suppose the President should come to his house and read him the newspaper every day. It's also amazing how people can be so incredibly intolerant of those they call intolerant. Another candidate for The Phonics Game is concerned because Bush's cabinet has some experience. I suppose this misguided individual misses the old days of The Clinton Misadministration when our foreign policy was a remake of Babes in the Woods (or in some cases Babes in the Oval Office ). One display of arrogance looks down its left-tilting nose at the word folks which is perfectly acceptable to most educated people, but doesn't know the word Afghanis, using some garbled amalgamation of letters instead. Also, now that the counting is finally over, how foolish do the Our-Election-Was-Stolen Crowd feel? Probably not nearly as foolish as they actually are. The truth is that Bush is doing a monumental job and people who actually follow current events underatand that. One final thought: An 84% Approval Rating may be a temporary thing, as it almost certainly is, but this man has united the country in a way that his critics neither appreciate nor have the capacity to understand. God bless President Bush.
