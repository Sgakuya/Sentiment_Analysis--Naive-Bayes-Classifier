Hot Dog !! Ya sure can't beat the Old Crow ! Only thing is, I sure would've liked to check out Dr Crow's original recipe before it was changed in the 1960's !! But one thing's for sure, the Crow won't fly, when drinkin' time is nigh. I was in a Hilton in Delaware about a month ago, and I picked the Crow out of about 40 different whiskey choices. When I got the first shot into the glass with ice.... Wow! Smooth and silky, with a bold barrel taste that kinda fools you. I guessed that the barrels were fresh and not aged, and maybe made out of something slick, like spruce. But I was impressed with the warm and gentle bite of the Crow. Mellow, fairly full flavored, but not sharp. And I felt great the next morning too !! Sour-mash drinkers: TRY THE CROW !
