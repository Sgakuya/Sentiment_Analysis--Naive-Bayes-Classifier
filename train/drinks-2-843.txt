Here is an unfortunate story about Red Stripe. Back in 1992 I was bartending at a yuppie bar in Washington DC. I remember one weekend, everybody started asking for Red Stripes. I couldn't understand it - I had sold maybe 3 in 2 years of bartending, then in one weekend, I sold about 50. It turns out the movie The Firm had just come out, and apparently there had been a scene in the movie with Tom Cruise drinking a Red Stripe. So, all the young lawyers and political types who hung out at this bar started asking for it. I don't know why this experience disturbed me so much, but it did... Oh yeah, and the beer sucks too, unless you are lying on a beach in Jamaica.
