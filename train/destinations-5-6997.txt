The city is very hip, the people warm, open-minded and friendly. Very trendy and people dressed up-to-the minute fashion as London is one of Europe's major innovation centres. Downside:as a born and bred Londoner, it is disappointing to see that due to it being a 24 hr place it has been impossible to keep clean, lots of graffiti, litter, unattended road and building works; grimy streets, badly maintained, broken railings and fences and posters slapped everywhere, the people not socially considerate any more. Unchecked mass immigration is greatly diluting its Englishness- I know that sounds old-fashioned but I think it's sad. Lots of new high rise structures that make no effort to harmonise with the rest of the landscape. The parks however are great and ARE very English and the South Bank route along the Thames is great for a sense of British history; the London Eye is a particularly superb new attraction, despite its rather odd location. The city is frankly a rip-off, unnecessarily expensive and Londoners stress over the highest taxes/costs than any other European city. Leicester Sq used to have a wonderful Swiss Centre restaurant and food shop but now it's a tacky cheap tatty clothes store. I hear Westminster Council are seeking to renovate the entire north area of the Square- that'd be good! Having said all that, London can be anything you want it to be and definitely has a buzz like no other place on earth. So much to see and do and a friendly, tolerant place. You should see it at least once in a lifetime.
