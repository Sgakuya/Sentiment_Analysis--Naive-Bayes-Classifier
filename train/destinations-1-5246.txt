California is the worst state in the Union. Not only does it not have any culture, but the people go out their way to ruin the natural beauty it once had. I have lived in the three largest cities in the country and LA by far is the worst place I have ever lived. The government sucks a fat one. The people are retarded and arrogant. The women are hideous. The stereotype of hot California women could not be more misleading. I have never seen such ugly people. Southern California is one disgusting flatulating suburb with no redeeming qualities. I would as soon live in Fargo. It is too bad that you have to give it even one star.
