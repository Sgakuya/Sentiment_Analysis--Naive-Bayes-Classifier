1. As a biology student, of course Evolution is taught here, you are confusing a research university with some State Board of Education bafoon who thought it should be elminated from HIGH SCHOOL circulum, although never passed because Kansas may have idiots, we don't let them make the decisions. 2. Bad location -- Don't like small towns...not our problem. Take your crime, pollution, waiting, congestion, and poverty with you. 3. Undiverse -- Well, Kansas is an agricultural state... therefore, not as many manufacturing jobs to lure post-reconstruction blacks or giant markets to attract people from around the globe. Kansas was settled by Germans and the Irish in the 1870's, and still remains 70% prodominatly that way... not our fault were are not coastal to attract Indians, Chinese. We do have a healthy number of all cultures of students, though admittedly, since Kansas is historically undiverse, its public school is reflective of that. I have found friends of all cultures here however. Black, Asian, Indian... 3. Bad Academics -- K-state is 4th on the list or producing Goldwater, Truman, Marshall, and Rhode Scholars in the past 20 years... who are ahead of us.. Well, Hardvard, Columbia, Yale... maybe you've heard of these schools. 4. Overemphasis on sports? Well, Athletes are considered at least dukes on the royalty scale, but certainly not kings. Grant you that. Not any different at any school that has a sports program that develops professional athletes, and we don't cheat then academic system (Ohio State, pay attention).
