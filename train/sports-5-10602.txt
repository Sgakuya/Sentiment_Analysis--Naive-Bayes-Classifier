I agree with the previous comments, but how many 3 loss seasons can Georgia have when they are Top 10 in recruiting, Top 5 in the SEC, and Top 5 in the country at any given time. Tonight's game against West Virginia in the Sugar Bowl, which by the way was played in Atlanta (home field advantage), and the defense couldn't a soul and then give up a fake punt which every one in the building, but the Georgia defense saw coming. Yes, Richt is successful, but in this day and age he has to win a championship. The SEC Championship mean zip if you don't win the bowl game. Especially against a Big East team like West Virginia.
