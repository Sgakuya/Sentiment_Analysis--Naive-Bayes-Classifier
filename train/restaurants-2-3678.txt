Back about 12 years ago I would order Pizza from Domino's, the Pizza was really good and had alot of toppings on it, the cheese was excellent. I ordered a few recently and they suck big time, hardly any toppings, very little cheese, and the Pizza was cold and I forked out $13.00 for this pile of crap. I figured it was a bad night for Domino's , so I ordered another one a few weeks later thinking it will be good, the Pizza comes and it is worse than the one I had before that, with even less toppings and the cheese wasn't even on parts of the Pizza, I could just see the crust from the top of the Pizza. Domino's you suck and I will never order another half ass Pizza from you guys. I don't know what kind of scam you are running, but you are running one.
