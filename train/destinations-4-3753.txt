i like it. was there over the summer for the annual Taste of Buffalo sure it's cold and not too big, but has a triving cultural scene, which is more than i can say for a lot of the other so-called Rust belt cities. Of course, i guess i'm biased b/c i'll be moving there in 2 months.UPDATE: just got back from Buffalo and will be moving there April 1st. such a beautful little city. can't wait.UPDATE: well folks ole Skizero is just about done w/his last day of corporate hell. leaving NYC in a week to land in fair BUffalo. dont know when i'll be back on RIA is i dont have the net at home, and i'm desperately going to try to avoid an office job. so if i dont come back for a bit, good luck to all.
