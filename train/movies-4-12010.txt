Ok. So this Clive Donner movie is not Marx Brothers or Woody Allen's own zany caliber, but it can become a guilty pleasure. Peter O'Toole (MIchael), a womanizer determined to be faithful to Romy Schneider (Carole) attempts to remedy his condition by becoming a patient to psychoanalist Peter Sellers; tempted again, he incurs in a tryst in an out of the way hostel. Figure out the rest. Quotes: 1 - Dr. Fritz Fassbender (Sellers): My father, the most beloved gynecologist in Vienna, before they took him away on a morals charge for indecent exposure at the State Opera House, said, and I quote: "Please do not take me away, I will not do it again." Victor (Woody Allen): Brilliant quote. Dr. Fassbender: He was a brilliant pervert. _________________________ 2 - Michael (O'Toole): Did you find a job? Victor (Allen): Yeah, I got something at the striptease. I help the girls dress and undress. Michael: Nice job. Victor: Twenty francs a week. Michael: Not very much. Victor: It's all I can afford. __________________________ 3 - Liz Bien: Would you excuse me for a minute? I'm going into the bathroom to take an overdose of sleeping pills. Michael: I like you. You're a nice stable girl. __________________________ 4 - Dr. Fassbender: I am a doctor of the mind. Victor: Really? Dr. Fassbender: Yes! Victor: I have terrible emotional problems. Could you help me? Dr. Fassbender: You certainly picked a very odd time to ask me, just in the middle of a suicide. ___________________________ 5 - Dr. Fassbender: Silence when you're shouting at me! ___________________________ 6 - Michael: What in the name of all that's gracious is a semi-virgin? ___________________________ 7 - Dr. Fassbender: You're grotesque! Anna Fassbender: Lascivious adulterer! Dr. Fassbender: Don't you dare call me that again until I have looked it up! ___________________________ 8 - Anna Fassbender: Is she prettier than me? Dr. Fassbender: Is she prettier than you? I'M prettier than YOU! ___________________________ 9 - Carole Werner: We're married thirty seconds and already you look at other woman. Michael: I have to look at her, she was talking to me; I looked in the direction the sound was coming from. ___________________________ 10 - Victor: Do you have any salt? Dr. Fassbender: Have I got any salt? I got a boat, I got kerosene, matches, firecrackers, two swords, and this flag. But, I ain't got no salt. ___________________________ 11 - Dr. Fassbender: My wife, the creature that ate Europe, is here. ___________________________ 12 - Victor: I just burnt my finger! I'm going to go in the bathroom and scream. I'll be out in a minute. ___________________________ 13 - Dr. Fassbender: You'll like this group analysis, it's a real freak show. If it gets dull, we sing songs. ___________________________ 14 - Michael: In Britain, we have a national therapy, we call it cricket. Unlike other sports, it doesn't involve anxieties or pressures. It's leisurely and lyrical. It's the song of willow on leather. Dr. Fassbender: Is there any sex in it? Michael: Oh, no. This is a game for gentlemen, played by gentlemen. Dr. Fassbender: It's sick, sick. ____________________________ 15 - Dr. Fassbender: I, uh, decided to follow you here. Michael: If you followed me here, how did you contrive to be here before me? Dr. Fassbender: I followed you... very fast. ____________________________ 16 - Dr. Fassbender (to deceive wife about adulterous meeting in hotel): What you see happening here is merely an illusion... Anna Fassbender: An illusion? Dr. Fassbender: An illusion. Shut the door, count three... Anna: Three? Dr. Fritz Fassbender: Four, if you like, but close the door and you'll see it's just an illusion. ____________________________ 17 - Michael: I'll be back tomorrow. If I'm not back tomorrow, send for the police. If they're not back tomorrow, send my clothes. ____________________________ 18 - Clerk: I can't spell Sigmound. Dr. Fassbender: I think that you have a little sexual block over the spelling of that naughty name. Allow me to help you, I'm a psychoanalyst, among other things. ____________________________ 19 - Carole: You got something to eat? Victor: Some, uh, some fig newtons, and some Hershey bars, and some cough drops. ____________________________ 20 - Dr. Fassbender: You are a monster and a monster, in that order. ____________________________ 21 - Dr. Fassbender (leafs through a dictionary): 'Lascivious adulterer..: a man who is a lascivious adulterer'? What kind of book is this?
