Tony Geary is without a doubt my favorite daytime actor. Part of the reason I love this performer so much is his uniqueness. Just a couple of things that make him stand apart from his peers: -His quick wit and amusing ad-libs. -His mercurial, energetic, presence even at 55+ years of age. (He can still pull off Cool Luke at such an age). -His incredibly expressive face. (Not beautiful in a conventional sense but able to evoke a remarkable range of emotions). -His fearlessness in expressing heartbreaking vulnerability. (E.g. Attic Wedding Vows, Rape Revisited storyline, Goodbye to Laura, Lucky's Death , etc.)
