Giving my own country four stars was one of the hardest things I have ever done. The US is a beautiful place, a nice country to live in, and has many other good qualities, such as prosperity, which we kept despite Ronald Reagan's efforts to destroy it. But the people here are kinda self-absorbed and a little arrogant. After the 9/11 events, our countries flag became a symbol not of the love and beauty that our country is supposed to represent, but of the violence, hatred, and oppression some of us are directing at Afghanistan. I feel I am taking a great risk giving the US only four stars, since most of the users of this site are white male Republican US citizens. But I feel it is the right thing to act upon my feelings and not my fears, at least in this case. Another reason that I gave the US only four stars is that our president is a moron who is cheese compared to England's Queen Elizabeth (although I don't know much about her politics, she is a nice person). Sure, I love my country, but sometimes I feel that my country doesn't love me. And if we blow Afghanistan to bits, I will never forgive the US. Also, this is supposed to be the land of the free, but sometimes it feels as though I am not actually free---not free to be an atheist, not free to be a pacifist, not free to be a liberal. But other times I feel free as a bird. I heard a song by the rock group Queen that perfetly describes our situation. It's called Heaven for Everyone , and I think it perfectly describes the situation the US is in. As in, this could be heaven for everyone, but we need to make it so. Think about what I have said, and take care, everyone!
