I bought a used Honda Prelude and drove it for about seven years. And I really worked that thing - over 10 trips from Kansas to Michigan, a trip from Michigan to Key West and a non-stop trip back (23 hours straight), a trip from Kansas to California and back, many round trips from Kansas City to Denver, and years and years of city driving. After all that, the car broke down a total of one time (on a drive from Ann Arbor to Chicago, which turned out to be a great weekend, but that's another story). The Prelude is a very solid little car. I don't like the new design, so I'd never buy another, but if you like the look then I can definitely recommend these cars from a perspective of dependability and performance.
