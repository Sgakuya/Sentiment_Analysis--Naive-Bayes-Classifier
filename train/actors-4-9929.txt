I saw Bette in person at the Oakland Coliseum, a 3 hour show that flew by. The whole show is Bette solo and she is a fantastic entertainer who held the audience enthralled. The amazing thing was that even though the whole 3 hours featured just her, there wasn't one boring moment. I likred her o.k. before the show but after seeing her in person came away very impressed with her talent. She was generous too in insisting that the audience clap for her backup group and when they responded in a lukewarm manner she stated they were a hardworking talented group and deserved a more enthusiastic response. I also admire her commitment to improving the urban environment in New York by cleaning up abandoned lots and planting flowers there to improve the lives of less fortunate people. In other words, she cares about others besides herself.
