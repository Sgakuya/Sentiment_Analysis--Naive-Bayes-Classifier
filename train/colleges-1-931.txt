If a CTU recruiter contacts you... RUN! Their Software Engineering Program is about $32,000 shy of being a diploma mill . Their recruiters make the following promises: we provide the textbooks as a part of the tuition, wonderful instructors, great online interactive learning environment, online library, online resource, but worst of all they tell you that the program is specifically for students that are completely new to programming. AND that you will qualify for a job as a programmer upon graduation. LIES! The free books taht they provide are so poor in quality you cannot even find their isbn's on the internet. Not to mention, the books do not cover the required material necessary to complete the assignments. It is impossible to be successful at this university or to learn everything. There are students in the very first programming class and even after taking this class twice they cannot write a single line of code. However, they finish the class with an A!!!! If you are already a programmer and just want a degree, this is the university for you. But if you want to learn something... stay away and go someplace that provides students with the tools necessary to get jobs when they graduate. Please someone tell me how this school received a regional accreditation!
