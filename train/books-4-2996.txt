I've always had an intensely ambivalent relationship with King's work. As a horror fan, I've read many of his books and often been quite entertained, but he's just not a great or original writer. His characters invariably ring false, his dialogue is contrived, his full-length novels tend to run on and on and the endings are awful, there's inevitably a precocious child in every story, and his physical descriptions run along the lines of "He was a tall man who looked a lot like Harrison Ford." The fact that he's one of America's best-selling authors is just an indication, to me, of how much our culture has deteriorated over the years. Conversely, I've enjoyed some of his work, particularly his short stories, in the same way I enjoy a sordid horror comic book from the 50's-60's. Cheap thrills, I guess. "Salem's Lot" is definitely my favorite King book, although not necessarily his best (he seems to be improving somewhat with age..."Misery" was actually fairly well written). "Salem's Lot" is not original by any means...cinematically, the theme of a vampire in modern small-town society was covered earlier in the films "Return of Dracula" with Francis Lederer and "Count Yorga" with Robert Quarry. "Salem's Lot" suffers from all the deficiencies I mentioned above, and more. And yet, inexplicably, it works in this instance for me. Maybe it's just that I'm a sucker (can't seem to avoid that bad pun when writing about the undead) for an old-fashioned, no-holds-barred vampire story. Again, don't expect great literature, but there are worse ways to while away an afternoon than reading the escapist vampire fiction of Stephen King. I guess until the next Edgar Allan Poe or Lovecraft comes along, King will have to do...
