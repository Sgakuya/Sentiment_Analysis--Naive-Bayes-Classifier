I am an employee of Kay. I am in Warrens district. I know of this 'story' from warrenmallrat. I know for a fact that this story, (2 comments) is HUGELY falsefied. Sounds to me that this is from another employee, who has a huge grudge with another employee. This is so childish and stupid. I will NOT explain anything to gratify these comments, I KNOW that this is over exagerated and I hope the people looking for honest reviews of our store do NOT take this 'story' and opinions -from a grudge, seriously. We work for the customer, not soap opera fanatics who like to use the computer to make themselves feel better. My store is highly rated with customer service, and has won several customer service awards. I will not speak for other stores, but my store does all possible to make the customer happy. And I am so sorry for all of you who have had bad experiences. AS for the warren mall commentator, I would hope that you find some better use of your time, and slander. I love Kay and I love working for the company, I also love the customers and I will keep doing my job to the best of my ability, customer service awards and all. could this be a case of revenge from an ex......? I wonder.........
