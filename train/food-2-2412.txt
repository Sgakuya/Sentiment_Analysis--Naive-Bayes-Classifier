They taste alright, but that is probably the worst name I have ever heard for a candy bar. When you name portable snack foods, the name shouldn't be five syllables long, that's too unwieldy, and there's a much greater chance that people with speech impediments won't want to buy it because they would have to spend a good thirty seconds pronouncing the word, and that would be humiliating, so they'd order a Twix or something that doesn't taste good just because it's less likely to call attention to their disability. Also, that name isn't clever or imaginative at all. Calling something a 'Whatchamacallit' means that the marketing people had absolutely no originals ideas that day, and just wanted to go home early so they settled on this unoriginal, unimaginative, blase kind of name. It's like that mascot for the Atlanta games (the Whatizzit or something), just goes to show that lazy uncreative people were in charge of the naming committee. I really hope that no other products come out with stupid names like this, and anyone who suggests them at a board meeting should be summarily fired and escorted from the building wearing a diaper and crawling on all fours for maximum humiliation.
