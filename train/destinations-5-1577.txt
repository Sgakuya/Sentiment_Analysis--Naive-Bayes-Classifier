What a pile of crap, Janey_Lane. I'm assuming you're from the United States (correct me if I'm wrong)... and we've got absolutely NO history of killing endangered animals. As far as environmental offenders go, the United States should be number one on the list. We use more fossil fuels and more nonrenewable resources than any other country in the world. We single handedly destroy natural ecosystems for corporate gain, and we think nothing of polluting the world. And you're bashing NORWAY for environmental wrongdoing? They only have one of the cleanest, most pristine countries in the world. Contrary to your experiences, every Norwegian I've encountered has been very friendly and sincere. I hate to attack your opinion directly, but it seems to me that you're being unfair and hypocritical.
