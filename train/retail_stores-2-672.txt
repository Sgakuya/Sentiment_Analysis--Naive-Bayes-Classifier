Not sure what my mother was thinking when she got me a gift card to Old Navy this year. I have never shopped there before for a reason. I'm not a trendy preppy person. Bright pink and lime green are just NOT my colors. In fact, they make me appear ill. I've never been comfortable in Old Navy stores and that was no different when I went in to attempt to use my gift card. I bought two ribbed tank tops. I tried on jeans, trying to find something sexy but not trendy to discover that I am a size 1 and they only make the 'short' versions in size 2 and up. My fiance and I spent most of our shopping time making fun of the merchandise. LOL...
