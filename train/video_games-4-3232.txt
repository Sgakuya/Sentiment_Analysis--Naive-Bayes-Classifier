Here is a game that wasnt even on my most wanted list but after seeing a demo at a local EB World, I had to get it.Its a wild racer which puts you into the illegal game of street racing.The graphics are clean and crisp and the gameplay is arcade like. You can plow head on into someone and push them out of the way. There are also pedestrians on the street you can run over even though they try to dive out of the way. There arent many game modes on this game but nevertheless, it is a hell-o-fun to rip through downtown NYC and London!..Please check this one out if you like games like Driver.This game can be difficult and you have to have paitence with it.A lot of the races are trial and error..so dont say I didnt warn you.In the end, you will be glad you got this game.
