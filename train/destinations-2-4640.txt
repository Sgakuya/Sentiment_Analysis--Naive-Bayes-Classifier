Interesting city...great food, cool tourist attractions... I have only been to Memphis once, when I was a kid. I had never really scene blantant racism before me... And I know I can't judge the people of Memphis by this one occurence, and from a 12 yr olds eyes, but it's stayed w/ me ever since. We were at a restaurant and a white couple requested to be moved b/c a black couple had sat at the table adjacent to them. I found this bizarre and appalling (and I'm white). Anyway, it just left a lasting impression on me. I haven't been back since, but I really have no desire to visit again. Was cool to see Graceland and Mud Island... I just didn't feel safe there though...
