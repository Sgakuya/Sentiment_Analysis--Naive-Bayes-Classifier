Although I am not a Virginia native, I lived there for about thirty years, so my comments may be somewhat parochial. According to sme people, there are two Virginias, i.e., Northern Virginia (the counties close to DC and Maryland), and the rest of the state. Northern Virginia is booming and bustling, and shares some (but not all) of the negatives I have described for Maryland, chief among them being overbuilding and strain on the infrastructure. There are still some very tranquil places in Northern Virginia (places like Middleburg) that have resisted the urban sprawl. Old Town Alexandria is also a very interesting place. There is no lack of things to do in NoVa - plenty of shopping, cultural attractions, scenic attractions, etc. However, the downside is that things tend to be always crowded, and roads are oversubscribed, so to speak. The rest of Virginia has plenty to offer - plenty of historical sites, lots of beautiful scnery (Shenadoah Valley, Skyline Drive), places like Williamsburg to visit. Services (government, health, etc.) seem to be pretty good. I was flabbergasted the first time I filed a Virginia income tax return and the Commonwealth sent me a nice letter (and a check) back explaining that there was a more advantageous way to file my return, enabling me to claim more deductions than I had, so they did it for me and reimbursed me. That's unusual. As much as I liked many aspects of Virginia, I moved because of the overbuilding, overpopulation, and horrible traffic (in Northern Virginia).
