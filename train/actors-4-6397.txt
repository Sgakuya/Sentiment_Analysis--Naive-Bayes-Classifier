Jon Voight is a wonderful actor. However, it boggles me that, as President X-D said, he chooses to play in supportive roles only. When's the last time Jon Voight starred as the lead in a movie? Maybe he's content with being in second place, but I think that if he was given a chance to star in a leading role, he would be much higher up on this list. My favorite of his recent roles was his portrayal of Franklin Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor . He fared much better than any of the other actors who have tried to portray FDR (notably John Lithgow). He beat out Gene Hackman for that role, and I personally think that Voight was the perfect choice to play President Roosevelt. His performance in Ali was also impressive. I also loved his performance as Coach Bud Kilmer- talk about phenominal acting. I had never seen Voight so intense with his acting. He also delivered in Enemy of the State , Anaconda and Mission Impossible . In the final analysis, Voight is a great actor who needs to work his way into a leading role before it is too late.
