I worked at a Quiznos for 4 years. I was manager for the few year. I think Quiznos has awesome food. The preperation is handled well. The stores are always cleans b/c of the chance of suprise inspections every months. The food is very good. I never got tired of it. Even now that i dont work there, i still get cravings. But having to pay for it now, its very pricey. They are great places to work at. Pay for managers is excellent for a food place. And corporate in Denver keeps a close eye on all the stores, If one is doing bad they will take it away from the owner. Try Quiznos--It's the best. Ex. The Chicken carbonara!!
