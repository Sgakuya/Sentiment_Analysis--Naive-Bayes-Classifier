I think the News Media were correct with their original projections. Its not surprising that the son of an ex director of the CIA (known for manipulating elections all around the world) and a brother who is governor of that state would win under a cloud of suspicion! Its funny that the argument that the Demorcrats did the same thing in the 1960 election so now its our turn, would be actually brought up.In the end Gore will concede, rather then peer into the dark side of American politics and History, He will feel pressure from the powers that be to walk away. Nader was right how can you spoil an Election that is already rotten to the core!
