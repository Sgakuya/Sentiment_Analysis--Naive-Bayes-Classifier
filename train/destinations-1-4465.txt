My brother and his wife , who are from Rochester like me (yes jimorama your generalization proves to be not so far fetched) moved to Atlanta 5 years ago thinking it would be the ideal place to live because it has a good economy (for now) and a warmer climate. Now he hates it. Its the whole new south bull crap. It is all yuppies who think they are better than everyone else. the weather sucks too. Thunderstorms all the time, and when it does snow there, it closes everything down (and i'm talking one inch) and the worst traffic on the east coast, gets to be about 100 times worse!!!!! Needless to say, my brother is moving back up north as well, he's not sure exactly where yet, but boston looks to be an option for him or maybe back home too. I only visited him once down there when my nephew was born and never again will i go back to that generic, overrated place they call Atlanta.
