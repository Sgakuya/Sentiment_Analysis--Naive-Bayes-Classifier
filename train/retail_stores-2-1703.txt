My problems with Wal-Mart are mostly on the corporate and management levels. I sympathize with the associates. They have to put up with a whole lot of crap. Plus, I've never really had a bad experience with customer service. The one bad thing is the checkout. Nearly every time I've been in there they have only a few registers open out of abou fifty total. People are often in long lines all around that area. It takes a really long time to check out, plus it makes it hard to move around the store as people are all standing in line in the main aisle. Ditto to the other comments about Wal-Mart destroying or severely damaging local economies. Not only that, but they have a tend to leave ghost stores everywhere. A city near mine has two Wal-mart ghosts. My city has one. They're uglier than operational Wal-Marts, and it usually destroys other stores in the shopping center when Wal-Mart leaves. It's so ugly having all these run-down shopping centers all over the place. And of course, the newer Wal-Mart supercenters are usually built on cheap farm land. I live in a college town. When the new Wal-Mart opened a few years ago, developers started building huge apartment complexes around the store, apparently so students could just cross the street to go Wal-mart shopping. That area of town used to be quite beautiful, with farmland and wooded areas. Now, about a square mile surrounding the Wal-mart is one of the dirtiest and cluttered areas of town, plus the traffic is terrible.
