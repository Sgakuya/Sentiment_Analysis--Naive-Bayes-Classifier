Winik offers a very interesting perspective as to how the Civil War ended and the ramifications this one month had on the entire history of the United States. His argument about their being lynchpin periods in history is interesting. April 1865 truly merits this distinction in our history at least. This book shows how it really was a logistical miracle that the North went on to victory. Had General Lee made a couple of changes in his battle plan, there might be still be a Confederate States of America . In history, good always wins the war against an inherent evil force. It happened in World War 2 against Nazism and it happened in the Civil War against the South and slavery. The reading could be a little dry sometimes though, but it offers a great historical perspective concerning the end of the Civil War.
