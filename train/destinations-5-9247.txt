Banff is one of the most beautiful places I've seen. The town itself is a tourist town, nothing more to it than that. But there aren't many towns where you just might walk around a corner and find yourself face to face with an elk -- in Banff, that's a very real possibility. No matter which direction you face, a spectacular mountain fills the sky. That's just the town. The park, itself, Canada's first national park, is so very much more. Its 2,500 square miles are threaded with hiking trails, and most of its land is wild and lonely. As a non-hiker, I've seen very little of the park's wilderness, but even the more populated areas are enough to fill me with awe.
