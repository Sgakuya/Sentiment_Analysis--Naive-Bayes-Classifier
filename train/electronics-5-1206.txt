Its sure great, I plug it wirelessly to my car via the I-trip and it has given me an outstanding performance. the I-Tunes interface is quite easy but however I find the windows media player way easier. I also use it as a protable hard disk. the battery is quite fine with me so far. note that you must not keep it on the charger like forever this will bust up you battery life time! recharge when needed .. ! I also like the look .. its pretty stylish and what i like most is the accesories of the I-pod you can find it almost every where ... !! I-pod was a complete turnover for apple and .. its quite obvious why ;o) keep it up !
