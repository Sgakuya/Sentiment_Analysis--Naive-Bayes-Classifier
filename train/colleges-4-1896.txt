My impressions of Mount Holyoke are quite mixed -- As an alumna I look back upon the strong science program, the outstanding professors, the unique traditions, and a variety of other strengths the college offered. Hindsight truly is 20/20. I wish I had taken advantage of more of the opportunities that presented themselves...the five college system, clubs, study abroad, Jan Term internships, etc. I think Mount Holyoke is an incredible college and certainly one of the most beautiful to be found anywhere. If I been more mature I would have better used the time I had. I should also note that while I was a student, I found South Hadley to be a very small community (not positive) and the single sex environment to be slightly oppressive.
