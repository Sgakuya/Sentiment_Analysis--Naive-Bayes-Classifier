It was so refreshing to go to a movie we didn't have to walk away feeling guilty about. Left Behind takes a look into the possibly not-so-distant future as it relates to the book of Revelation in the Bible. The movie was apparently produced on a shoe-string budget, and, in spite of the lack of funding, was an extremely well done movie. It speaks to the heart of the matter - the importance of having a relationship with Jesus Christ - and not being left behind . All the missing people - adults saved through their faith in Christ - and of course the innocent children - were raptured to heaven. There's plenty of action to keep youth attentive to the story line, and adults will find it intellectually stimulating. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it!
