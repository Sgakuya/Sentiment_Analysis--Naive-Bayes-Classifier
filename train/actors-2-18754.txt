 Platoon has been hist best effort. Wall Street was an unbelievable cartoonish trifle. The Doors was garbage and JFK was the most ridiculous piece of crap ever conceived by a so-called major director. Born on the Fourth of July was better than I expected, but still nothing great. The great misapprehension about this guy is the genuine, atmospheric feel for the time periods he evokes, when the actuality is that he gets the visual style but misses the ethos and emotional temper of his time periods. So, even his great strength as a director is flawed. His re-writing of history is a sad joke that will always consign him to the second rate category.
