I don't know if anyone else has noticed the variability in quality and composition of this product, but after years of drinking the Green Tea with Ginseng tall cans with great delight, I have recently encountered entire batches which taste just like that oversweetened Nestea powdered instant iced tea mix with lemon that I used to drink as a kid back in the 70's. It tastes terrible, way over sweetened and NOTHING like the normal, usual product I am used to and well accustomed to and I have often felt so bad thinking that anyone who tries this for the first time with find it to be awful or if not awful, extremely pedestrian and nothing special whatsoever ( like too much powdered iced tea mix in water). I have found this off taste both times I tried the gallon jugs, each a year apart from the last with the same result! NOT the same as the can. And the powdered tea effect with lemon is in the cans with a terrible aftertaste, once I tried to water it down and it became absolutely impossible to drink. It really made me wonder what I am drinking and I started feeling really good about drinking bottled water. I LOVE the Arizona Green Tea with Ginseng but these odd batches that are awful detract from the accomplishment they have gained and lose customers who will know know they got a bad batch. Incidentally, I was talking with a stranger in a chat room and she said that she too had tried the gallon jug and in her words she said it was "kindof ick". Exactly!
