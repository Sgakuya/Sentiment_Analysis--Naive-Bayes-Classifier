So Calvin Coolidge did nothing but sleep the Presidency away, well hold on just one little second and lets analyze the record. Under Coolidge measures were taken that included orderly growth of civil and military aviation, expansion of the services of the departments of Agriculture and Commerce, regulation of radio broadcasting, development of waterways, flood control, and encouragement of cooperative solutions to farm problems. Twice, he blocked enactment of the McNary-Haugen bill, which proposed to dump farm surpluses abroad in the hope of raising domestic market prices, because he objected to its price-fixing features and its cost. As an administrator, Coolidge was most successful. He demanded and got efficient and economical performance in government operations. He was instrumental in releasing the remaining political prisoners convicted under the Sedition Act during the Wilson administration. He also helped by his appointments to raise the level of competence among diplomats and federal judges. Coolidge also restored diplomatic relations with Mexico. It seemed for a while, however, in 1927 that the good relations between the two countries might end again as a result of restrictions on foreign oil rights and on the Catholic church in Mexico, and because of the sharp disagreement over recognition of a new government in Nicaragua. Working largely through special representative Henry Stimson in Nicaragua and the new ambassador to Mexico, Dwight Morrow, the Coolidge administration was able to settle the situation. This and other actions anticipated the Good Neighbor policy toward Latin America. Not exactly the inactive guys we thought he was huh?
