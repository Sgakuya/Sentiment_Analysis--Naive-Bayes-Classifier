Dear Mr Gore, It is my belief that you are the right choice for the office of the President of the United States. I side with you and the democratic party in many important issues like Medicare, a womans right to choose, social security and lowering the national debt. The record shows that yourself and President Clinton have addressed these issues during your administrations 2 terms. I applaud you for all you've done and attempted to do. But tonight our country is torn between you or Mr.Bush as the next President of our great country. I did my part,as I voted for you. I voted for you because I want you to be our next president and lead us through these great economic times as you have been a part of the economic boom.I voted for you because I believe your ideas for education are the best for all not just the few. But again, it's not clear whether or not you have won. If you are victorious, please follow you heart and try your best to make good on your promises,for alot is riding on it. But if you ultimately lose the the recount in Florida and Gov. Bush is declaired the winner please take the defeat with grace and class. It is my opinion that more harm will come from a bitter contesting of the election than it could ever do you any good. People ,like myself, voted for you because we can see the genuine,honest,goodness in you as an American,a public servant, husband and father. Please don't tarnish your reputation by dragging out this election any longer than you have to. We live in a great and powerful nation,you know that, and this nation and its people remember all the good and bad attributes of it's leaders. You have been good for this country in every aspect of public service that you've been a part of and I would hate to see you put any blemish on what is a public service record above reproach. I believe you can still win and hold out hope that you will. Win or lose you're a great man!
