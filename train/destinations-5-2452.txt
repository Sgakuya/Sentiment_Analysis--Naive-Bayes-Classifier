Great place - interesting city. Try to go in late Spring or very early fall. Attractive, interesting. Nice parks. Interesting attractions, good food, restaurants, bars. Happy Bar & Grill, in particular. Lots of things to see in the area. I agree with one other comment on this page and that is the train station. It is pretty heideous, though interesting in it's own way. They have to do something about the private bus station across the street. What a mess, particuarly in the rain. At least you can get a cheap beer there! They need to build a better facility. Lots of friendly wild dogs roaming around the street, so you always have a friend. Interesting sub-terraining passageway below the main station. Full of shops, bars, restaurents, kiosk, bureau de change, etc. Lively. Sofia is a very interesting place that is worth visiting. See the Monument to the Soviet Liberator..
