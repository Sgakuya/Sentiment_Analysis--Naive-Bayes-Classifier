when we're asked to give an opinion about cairo or Egypt in general i guess it will be fair to give an opinion which is based on facts .. facts of thousands of years , first what are the pryamids ? they are king's graves imagine a kind was baried there like thousands of years ago !! can u imagine who rich was that country and do you know that in cairo there are more than 70 pryamids !! but of course they biggest 3 are the famous 3 ! that was one example .. nowadays yes the pollution is there and poor people are there and reckless drives are there .. but hey is there any country which lacks those kind of things ?? give me a break !! and speaking abput the weather is quite amazing specially at night and even better in winter i recomend that city or country for those who are into history and they have the motivation to see huge great things which is there from thousands of years
