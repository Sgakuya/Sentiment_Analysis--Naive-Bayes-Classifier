Ok little whiney boy Chalky, I AM TALKING ABOUT THE METRO AREAS!!!!! THE ROCHESTER, SYRACUSE, AND ALBANY METRO AREAS ALL SAW INCREASES IN POPULATION!!! I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST THE CITY LIMITS, AND ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT DID LEAVE THE INNER CITY AREAS JUST MOVED TO THE SUBURBS!!! Ok, i am getting sick of this kid. I said from the beginning that the METRO areas of all cities in new york except for buffalo were growing!!! And if this kid would stop whining and making me defend my facts, i could better get my point accross. New York is a STATE!!! It is not a city, all of the stupid people who rate ny based soley on NYC are really not getting it. NYC is only a very small area of New York state, but i mean, NYC is great too!!! All of the state is great! We have adirondacs park, the largest national forest in the country, we have the catskills, and we have the finger lakes whine region just south of Rochester were i live. And in Rochester kodak is not leaving they are here to stay, and are actually starting to HIRE people, the layoffs have stopped, and all of the layoffs that did take happen were for the low paying factory jobs that went to china because of the tax loop holes that bush made. The high tech high paying jobs for kodak have stayed and are increasing in the eastman kodak headquarters here. Not to mention we still have 2 MORE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES!!! Xerox and Baush&Lomb are still in Rochester, and are getting back on ther feet, just like the other compaines affected by 9/11
