All he cares about is himself. I lost a ton of respect for Bob Stoops for how he handled himself in his two straight losses to end last season. First, after getting mauled by a mediocre K-State team, he brazenly and defiantly argued that his team deserved to be in the BCS title game...never mind the fact that every year before last year losing your finale by 5 TD's would get you jack squat, regardless of how perfect you'd been to that point... Second, as his OU team was getting exposed as a paper tiger in the first half v. LSU, Stoops gets into an argument about which team, OU or LSU, has the best defense (based on either scoring or total defense). I mean at that point, Who cares? Stoops made a horse's rear out of himself because his giant ego could not handle the b---- slap he was getting. He is a jerk, despite his obvious coaching skills.
