I liked this film a great deal. I don't get what the critics dislike about it.This is one of the most refreashing films in years. I can identify with the story of a young man who wants to live his life a certain way but due to circumstances beyond his control bhe can not. This reminds me of Steinbeck novel. John Grady Cole comes so close to fulfilling his dream but in the falls just short of it. Great actors, great cinematography, great story! The only fault I find is that the plot dragged in spots. Overall a very good picture. Classic Billy Bob Thornton and the best Western to come out of hollywood in years.
