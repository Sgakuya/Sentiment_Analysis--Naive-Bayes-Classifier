Good movie. takes place in 1942, two boys have to come and live with their mean old german grandmother while their dad works down south. they live above a candy store in Yonkers, with the grandma and their aunt Bella who is mildly disabled mentally. they work in the candy store. and put up with the nasty grandma and sweet aunt. their uncle louie visits for awhile,{he is caught up in illegal things and is hiding from the thugs who are after him} a lot of funny and warm moments. well acted by the two boy actors. and Mercedes Ruehl who played aunt Bella. gives an idea what living in 1942 was like. seen from the oldest boys point of view.
