I THINK THAT ALL THESE DISGUSTING REPUBLICANS ARE BLIND OR JUST PLAIN STUPID. AL GORE IS THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME THEM DAMN REPUBLICANS WERE IN OFFICE IT DOESNT TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO PUT 2 2 TOGETHER TO KNOW HOW MESSED UP THE UNITED STATES WAS BACK THEN AS TO HOW MUCH BETTER IT IS NOW. HOW CAN PEOPLE TALK SO RUDELY OF GORE WHEN HE CARES ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT DONT MAKE 100GRAND A YEAR THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THE TAX CUTS NOT YOU RICH PEOPLE. BESIDES I THINK THAT ALOT OF PEOPLES PROBLEMS ARE WITH CLINTON NOT GORE. I THINK THAT YOU ALL NEED TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS THAT IS BETWEEN CLINTON AND HIS WIFE NOT YOU. IF PEOPLE WOULD QUIT JUDGING GORE FOR SOMETHING CLINTON DID THEN MAYBE YOU COULD FACE REALITY OF THE WHOLE THING. BESIDES ITS NOT LIKE ALL YOU RICH FOLKS ARENT DOING IT YOURSELVES. AFTER WHAT BUSH HAS PULLED WITH THE FLORIDA VOTES WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT HIM IN ANYWAY?????
