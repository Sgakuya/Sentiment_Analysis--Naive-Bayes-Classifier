Just as I had feared, this movie was a flop. Before I even heard the details about this movie, I had a feeling that a 3rd A.P. movie would tarnish the reputation (of being hilarious) of the first 2 movies, and that A.P. never needed another sequel. I should go with my hunches more often. The only time I laughed was from a few snipits from the submarine scene and most of the fountain sequence. The rest was a snore. I just sat there and watched the screen hoping the tide would somehow turn. Notice how Jack Osbourne said ( IN THE FREAKING MOVIE EVEN ) that the movie was just repeating old jokes. Although that was suppose to be a joke in itself, there is truthful merit to that statement (it's more like an understatement). Mike Myers must now think he can put anything out and it'll be good. WAKE UP CALL!! Very disappointing to know that. I do admit, I was, at first, impressed by the many big cameos in the film, but by the time Britney Spears and Ozzy came on, enough was enough. In conclusion, AP3 is a letdown. No matter how much money it makes in the box office, it may end up being know as the start of Mike's downward spiral.
