I was going to school at the University of Michigan when the Fab 5 made their debut, so I've been watching Jalen play since he was a college freshman. His talent was never in question, but people used to claim Jalen wasn't mentally capable of taking his game to the next level. Jalen's performance with the Nuggets and his first few years with the Pacers did nothing to silence his critics. But he seems to be coming into his own under Larry Bird. Jalen can take it to the basket, he can hit the outside shot, he plays solid defense, and his size creates match-up problems for most teams. I wouldn't put him in the superstar category yet, and I still have doubts he's mentally tough enough to reach that top level, but Jalen has definitely proven himself this year. Playing in the finals is a great experience for him, and I hope to see Jalen continue to improve his game.
