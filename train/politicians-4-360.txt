One of the really interesting things about the US conservatives' love of Tony Blair is that he is a liberal. Exactly the sort of whiny, bleeding heart, idealist that many of those same conservatives would crucify if he was practicing politics in the US. Very ironic. However, I don't want to sound like I disagree with the approach of supporting someone based on what they do as opposed to what political team they are on. I think it's a fantastic approach. If only us Americans could apply that same pragmatic and intelllectually honest approach to our politics. For example, I think that a US conservative that turns a blind eye to the crippling, socialist spending of George W. Bush is not a real conservative. A cheerleader yes, but a conservative no.
