To say FDR was a war monger is totally ludicrious, to say FDR single handedly won WWII is equaly ludicrious. To say if it were not for FDR we will all being doing the gusestep right about now is highly doubtfull. The man did his job and he did it quite well in my opinion. But so did a lot of others, WWII was not a one man battle and this one man did not win the war alone.To say if not for him we will have lost WWII is totally irrelivent. How do you know this? Do you have prevy to some secret doccumentation. FDR did his job as commander in chief, he did it to the best he could and he did a damn fine job, and for this I commend him.
