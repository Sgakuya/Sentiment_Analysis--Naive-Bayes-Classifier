SISQO IS A GREAT SINGER EVEN WITHOUT DRU HILL... HIS UNLEASH THE DRAGON ALBUM IS FF THE HOOK.. I LISTEN TO IT EVERYDAY. HE IS WHAT I WOULD CALL A TRUE TALENTED ARTISTS. HE HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. FROM HIP-HOP TO R B WITH A TOUCH OF RAP LIKE THE SONG GOT TO GET IT . SISQO IS JUST SHOWING HOW SEXY HE IS AND CAN BE... I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.. BSIDES, HE COULD SING TO ME DAY AND NIGHT, I'M SURE HE CAN ALWAYS GET A WOMAN IN THE MOOD...... I GET IN THE MOOD JUST BY HEARING HIS NAME:) SO JUT IMAGINE WHAT HIS SONGS DO FOR ME.. SISQO BABY, IF THEY DON'T WANT YOU, I'LL TAKE YOU WITH A BIG HEART AND OPENED ARMS... Y'ALL NEED TO QUIT HATING ON THE BROTHER 'CAUSE HE GOT IT GOING ON. DON'T DIS-LIKE HIM, BE LIKE HIM.... THAT'S 4 ALL DA PLAYA HATIN' PEEPS OUT THERE.....
