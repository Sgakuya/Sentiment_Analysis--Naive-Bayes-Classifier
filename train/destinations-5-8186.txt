On our recent vacation to Las Vegas (which we tried as a family vacation for the first time this year) I took a detour with our son to the Shark Reef while the rest of the family did the casino thing. Actually, had I known how great this attraction was I would have insisted that some of the adults come along! For $15 adult/$9 child admission (and in Vegas, they could really charge more for this attraction) you get a phenomenal value. The Reef also provides handheld audiophone tutorials, with your admission, which give you information beyond what is on placards throughout. The attraction itself is modeled as if you were walking through an acient and sunken temple which has been overrun by natural coral and aquatic life. The fish and sharks are amazing and plentiful-there was not a single species on exhibit which we didn't easily identify in the tanks. While limited in scope, gallon for gallon, I honestly have to say this topped the NY, Philadephia and Boston aquariums we have visited.
