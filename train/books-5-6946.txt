This is the only long series (very long) that keeps getting better with every book. From a very funny, witty hilarious genre parody, the series has evolved into a very funny witty hilarious satyre on the way human beings think about the basics of life: life, of course, and death and love and religion and society and government and entertainment and taxes... etc. The books get deeper, the author's generous and warm insight into the mechanics of communal living in a city, a village, a country, more and more tought provoking. In brief, wehn you pick yourself up from the floor, face drenched in tears of laughter, you realise you've been laughing at very scary serious things and find out you can then think about them much more clearly then before. Really priceless. A word of advice, if you wish to start reading the series start with Mort , if you like people, Wyrd Sisters , if you like the theatre and Guards GUards if you're into politics. Then go on forward or back, as you please, by that time you'll be hooked too.
