Gerry Rafferty's full-length effort City To City was one of the best releases of the 1970s; however, it is often overlooked due to the more popular sounds of the day (ie disco) and the rise of punk and new wave at the time of its release in 1978. Nevertheless, this release is strong throughout and includes the immortal single Baker Street as well as Right Down The Line and Home And Dry. Those three songs alone make a purchase worthwhile. City To City was also chosen by Mobile Fidelity to re-release on its master series when it was first starting to do so which is also a testament to the value of this recording.
