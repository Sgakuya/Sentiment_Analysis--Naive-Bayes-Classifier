I absolutely HATE this extremely and rediculously expensive non-amusing amusement park ! This is NOT A RIDES PARK ! Yes,this is most definitely a park for kids and it is a place that YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SHOULD DEFINITELY SEE AND VISIT but in my opinion ONE TIME IS ALL YOU AS A SINGLE,ADULT PERSON SHOULD EVER NEED. OF course if you have kids and grandkids more visits will be required for each person,child or grandchild,until each person in your immediate family will have been there,saw that.But,if you aren't a parent or grandparent then in my opinion ONCE IS ENOUGH ! This is most definitely an ATTRACTION or THEME PARK ! And,in my opinion the theme here is THIS IS NOT A RIDES PARK ! No,this is most definitely a WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT PARK So,DON'T GO and WASTE A TON OF MONEY IF YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO RIDE ALOT OF RIDES ! There are so few rides that you stand in line ALL DAY and sun burn (even if you already have a deep,dark tan or even if you are not caucasion),in the no shade,sub-tropical sun and wait and wait for hours and hours and hours just to ride one,single,solitary ride ! My wife,children and grandchildren and myself use to always go there every year when we vacationed in Florida but as of last year we have all decided that it is just far too hot and muggy to go there and pay all of that money to wait all day to ride. Yes,even the little grandkids are burned out on the place. We have all agreed that going there is just too much work and is not nearly worth the money spent to be so physically tired and ehausted from all of the walking,sweating and fighting the bugs,mosquitoes and sun all day. So,since we have always went to Florida first and foremost because of the ocean and beaches we have all decided that we will just stay in our oceanfront condo and get our sun on the beach and not at the park. We will save all of that time and gas and no longer drive all the way to Orlando to PAY ALL OF THAT MONEY TO STAND AND WAIT IN LONG LINES TO WATCH OTHER PEOPLE RIDE THE RIDES ALL DAY !
