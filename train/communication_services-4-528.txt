Service is excellent. There are very few places where I do not get a clear, crisp signal. Having unlimited incoming calls is a big help. Text messaging with the i530 is tedious since you have to access the wireless application then go to the text messaging link. Battery life could use improvement. Nationwide Direct Connect at $10.00 extra a month is salt added to the wound of already paying high prices for the phones and rate plans. Kudos to the i530 for being a rugged phone. I've dropped it several times on concrete and asphalt and it still works just fine; I've even spilled a little bit of water on it. It's a bit bulky but it's worth it since it is so rugged.
