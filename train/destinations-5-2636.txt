I live in the Bay Area and have grown accustomed to trash in the streets, aggressive homeless people and panhandlers in Santa Cruz and San Francisco, and diversity to the extreme (The malls are mostly filled with Asian and Indian people. That is fine for many folks here, but I prefer more variety.) The place has as much class and culture as the trash in the streets. Chicago is completely different. While San Francisco boasts of the greatest public transportation system in the world, it has nothing on Chicago. Chicago is clean, the the streets are wide, the few panhandlers are not in your face, the suburbs are beautiful, and so are the midwesterm women. Santa Cruz women are grungy, unkept, and drugs are rampant. However, if you like Asian women move to S.F. All of my friends have Asian girlfriends there and it is widely celebrated. The Bay Area likes to celebrate diversity and multiculturalism. It is the highest value of the area. Everything else is secondary to this sacred value. In Chicago, diversity is also celebrated as fine and dandy, but at the end of the day there is a natural segregation to spend time with people we have something in common with. What a concept! If you like to stand in line at Starbucks and listen to Chinese, Vietnamese, and a host of many languages, people yammering on cell phones in many third world dialects, then move to the Bay Area. If you like overcrowding, fixer uppers for $800,000, and ugly strip malls, move to San Jose. If you like a slice of America, beautiful architecture, a high rise condo for half the price of a shack in East San Jose, move to Chicago.
