A great entertainer, and a tremendous ability to soothe the savage conservative while baiting the liberal in our midst. He's very good at what he does, even to the point of laughing out loud at what passes for knowledge in this tome (Rush's favorite word for book ). The man is entitled to his views, skewed as they may be. But a great read to pass the time if you're sitting on the toilet or waiting in the dentist's office. Heck, this book works just as good as, or better than, Novocaine. It numbs not only your mouth, but the part of your brain that lulls your thinking ability to sleep. Dittoheads seem particularly vulnerable to this. Credit this to Rush's tremendous verbal skills and talent for b.s.
