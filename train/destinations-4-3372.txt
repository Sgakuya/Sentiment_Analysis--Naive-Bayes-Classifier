Washington is an up-and-coming city. Gentrification is changing the complexion of the city, for better or worse. It's a small city, but is packed with plenty of things to do whether you're a tourist, transcient or local. The Mall, museums and tourist hot spots are a requisite to visit. The downtown is being revitalized, Gerogetown is a trendy neighborhood to visit. You always get the feel that there's something important going on in the city. Yes some areas are bad and there are some really crazy, stupid crimes that happen in the city, but that should'nt distract you from visiting. The Metro transit system is excellent IMHO. A couple drawbacks? It gets HOT in the summer. Driving in the city is a bitch. This is still a must-visit city if you're from the USA.On top off all that, Baseball is back in DC !
