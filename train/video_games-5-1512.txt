A staggeringly deep and complex game, despite apperances! Control is quite simple in this Mario-Kart like racer, with acceleration automatic. You can use the A button to slow down to charge a boost--which comes in handy when powersliding around corners. It can also be used to swallow power ups on the course which Kirby can suck up to obtain powers such as Needle Kirby, and one of my personal favorites, SNOW KIRBY! There are a plethora of different vehicles--each with differing pros and cons. There's a retro Top Ride mode which puts one in mind of the Atari arcade classic, Super Sprint. City Trial is even deeper, where you are put in a large city for many minutes to collect various power-ups for your vehicle while competing with other computer or human players. After this, your customized vehicle participates in a random mini-game. Very fun stuff. The graphics are astounding, with amazingly-detailed courses and smooth player models. The Nintendo creativity is also in full force here, with amazingly imaginative courses, games, modes, characters and more. Kirby Air Ride is yet another Nintendo Classic.
