Sorry, Blinkangel - Goodbye Earl is on the Dixie Chicks' second CD, Fly . This is their debut release and it's the one I go back to time and time again. Some of the lesser-known tracks are my favorites, like I'll Take Care Of You (a great wedding song), Am I The Only One (sooooo heart-wrenchingly sad) and Give It Up or Let Me Go (must be listened to at highest volume possible, especially so you can catch the YEEEEE-HAAAAW and the girls giggling at the end of the track). Natalie's voice is awesome, and the slide guitar and Texas-style fiddling are matchless. This is the Chicks at their finest - before all the Goodbye Earl hoopla.
