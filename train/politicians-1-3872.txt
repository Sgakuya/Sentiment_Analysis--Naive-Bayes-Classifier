I don't care if you like Bush better than Gore. It is most important that EVERYONE chooses the candidate that knows what he is doing. The Constitution vests foreign policy power in the office of the executive, therefore the president we choose on November 7th must know foreign policy. Bush, however, remains vague and ignorant on all facts of foreign policy. He couldn't even pronounce Milosevic's name. He has no experience in foreign affairs and apparently has made no attempt to gain any. Due to the fact that one of the main powers of the presidency lies in foreign affairs, George Bush is not, nor never will be, qualified. TO ALL WOMEN - How could any of us consider voting for Bush. He has stated that his favorite Supreme Court Justices are Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia. If you don't know their records - let me clarify. Both Scalia and Thomas will strive to overturn Roe v. Wade. They oppose abortion even in the cases of rape and incest. Even if you personally would never have an abortion you have the right to at least consider it. All women have the right to control their own bodies. 77% of all abortion opposers are male and 100% of them will never be pregnant. Don't let someone else tell you, or any other woman, what you can or cannot do with your body. Bush wants to take the government out of peoples lives in terms of taxes and other policies, but he wants government control of the most private part of a woman's life? Doesn't that have an air of disrespect? On the subject of the courts, not only the Supreme Court will be affected. The GOP has blocked numerous Federal Judgeship appointments from confirmation. The result being, the next president will appoint not only Supreme Court justices, but also a large number of federal judgeships as well. Hypotheically, we could wind up with the most conservative court system in the history of America. If nothing else scares you, that should. Conservative strict constructionists (as W himself said he would appoint) were responsible for the destruction of the civil rights laws following the Civil War. They are also responsible for the opposition before and during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Please vote responsibly on Election Day. If you like George Bush's personality or character, invite him to dinner, not to the White House.
