I agree with what seems to be a majority of raters who think that CellularOne is rather inferior in the service and customer service departments. Their contracts are weighted in their favor and full of surprises. I have been with them for 10 months and though it will hurt, I have decided to buy out my contract. I'd rather give them the $200 dollars now and be rid of them and their shenanigans, that to continue to be raped monthly when the bill arrives. Even if I refuse to use the phone, I'll be billed more that $200 over the course of the next 14 months. I was stupid and entered into a 2 year contract that I thought was proposed in good faith. I would discourage anyone from contracting with Cellularone. Since I entered into the agreement with CellularOne which seems to be the most widely advertised service in the area where I live, I have learned of three other people who have bought out their contracts because CellularOne failed to explain fully the ramifications of signing the contract unless you are very informed about all the situations which can arise after the contact is closed.
