I am a current OSU Student and I absolutely love it. In recent years the university has been making attempts to improve the quality of academics. For 11 straight years the incoming class of freshman has been better academically qualified than the previous. Because of it's massive size you can find anything that you want. If you like the party there is plenty of that, if you don't there sre tons of other things to be doing both on and off campus. Columbus is an amazing city: you could stay at OSU forever and never get bored. There are good and bad things about any university, but there is no where that I would rather be than The Ohio State University. Go Bucks!
