Robert C. Byrd (ex Klansman) the king of pork? Where did that idea ever come from? Maybe it is the Robert C. Byrd memorial truck stop with the Robert C. Byrd memorial bathroom, the Robert C. Byrd memorial urinal and stall, the Robert C. Byrd memorial sink, the Robert C. Byrd memorial soap container which holds Robert C. Byrd memorial soap, (it releases more soap if the lever is pushed to the left) the Robert C. Byrd memorial hand dryer and towel dispenser, the Robert C. Byrd memorial vending machines, the Robert C. Byrd memorial trash can, the Robert C. Byrd memorial you are here map, the Robert C. Byrd memorial picnic tables, the Robert C. Byrd memorial dog walk, and the Robert C. Byrd memorial sign that reads You are now leaving the Robert C. Byrd memorial truck stop............
