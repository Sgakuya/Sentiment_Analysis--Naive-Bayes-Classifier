I was born here, and I've returned to live here again. It's a beautiful city with easy access to beaches, snowy mountains (even during summer skiing is available), camping, and other outdoor activities. Within the city are a variety of parks, including high quality Chinese, Japanese, and Rose gardens. Theres a handful of good museums and shopping areas, and a truly great selection of friendly, affordable restaurants and bars with unique character. The people are mostly pleasant and intelligent (though their politics are far too predictable by their appearance-- thats true of both the left and right wing). Bookstores are everywhere, and the theatre, nightclub, and music scenes all have some vitality. And there is some racial diversity, but only if you live in certain neighborhoods. Those are the strengths.The weaknesses of Portland, however, include a soaring property crime rate (3 car thefts between my wife and I in four years), a growing problem with methamphetamine and heroin addicts, an anti-business climate within the city government, high unemployment, and increasingly bad traffic. Property values are still low in some places but are overvalued in others. And the rain can make half the year quite dreary. Some advice-- get a job here before you decide to move here!!!
