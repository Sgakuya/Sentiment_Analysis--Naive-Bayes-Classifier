Saw a screening foe DAWN OF THE DEAD earlier this week. It was great! I can't wait to see it again. As much as I love the orginal, I'll be the first to admit I was never impressed by the greenish-blue makeup. I also never found the lumbering zombies to be completely frightening. In this version the zombies are relentless. i haven't been this tense watching a horror movie in a long time. But what really puts the movie above par is that the script actually pays attention to developing the characters. The screenwriter realizes that this is just as important, if not more, than the zombies, effects, and gore. Ving Rhames has an interaction with a gun owner across from the mall which is actually touching. Finally, someone who understands that creating characters we care about heightens the suspense. And for those fanatics of the original who thought the film would skimp on the gore, there's plenty of it here. If you're expecting a bloodfest, however, look elsewhere. This isn;t that type of film. It's too smart for that. If there was any drawback it would the large number of people in the cast. We don't get to know everyone as much as we would like to, and things move so fast we don't even get to know some of their names. Overall, though, this is a remake that doesn't try to mimic the original but improves on areas that could stand improving and manages to also take itin a new direction. In doing so it not only does the original proud but also creates a new film that completely stands on it on. Shame on all you petition signers who wanted to prevent this film from ever being made. You would have deprived us all from an awsome movie.
