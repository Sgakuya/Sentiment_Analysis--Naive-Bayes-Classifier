Sonic is a cut above the rest of the fast food joints (Burger Division). They make really good burgers, thick with nice toppings. Their fries are great. The best thing about Sonic is their delicious shakes. They are out of this world. The only knock I got against them is that their breakfasts are not too good. The chain needs a catchy jingle like McDonalds. I remember when they were about to open the first one in my area, my friend's daughter (age 5) saw it (SHE ATE THERE BEFORE) and started yelling at the top of her lungs in the car: SONIC.SONIC.SONIC.SONIC.SONIC..SONIC..SONIC. I always wanted to pitch that to Sonic as a slogan.
