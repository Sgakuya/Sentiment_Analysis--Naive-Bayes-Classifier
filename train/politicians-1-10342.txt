in all my life i've never seen such a dumb political leader. this man only has his election to thank to his father. he managed to make the U.S. even more hated in the world with his unbelievably self-centered foreign politics. I'm glad I don't live in the U.S. cause i'd rather have a dog represent my country than this idiot. when are you gonna show us the evidence of the chemical weapons that are without a doubt present in Iraq. It's been about half a year already since you invaded this country and untill this day I haven't seen any evidence whatsoever. And the only people believing the bullshit excuse of freeing the iraqi people of the terrible saddam houssein are those who do not question the american politics at all. So mr. Bush, i'm looking foreward to 2004 when maybe a sane person will be in the white house and not such a redneck junky like you.
