I believe White America is terrified of outspoken, nonsubmissive African Americans. White America wants African Americans to stay in their place . Too bad we don't live in the 1940s and 1950s anymore! Al Sharpton strikes a nerve in bigots when he talks. If you are not a racist dog, you won't get offended by what he says. Besides, if America were perfect in every way you wouldn't have to listen to him because there would be equality and justice for all, not just for whites. Sometimes the truth hurts! Keep speaking the truth, Al!!!! I've noticed that a lot of you anal retentive conservatives like to call people like Al and Jesse troublemakers . You know, that's the same thing the rednecks of Mississippi and Alabama said when the Freedom Riders and others came to the South to register black voters. They called Martin Luther King, Jr. a troublemaker , too. You are confused! It is very hard for you to understand why Rev. Sharpton or Rev. Jackson say the things they say or do the things they do when injustice and racism doesn't plague your race. If racism and injustice did cause problems for you, I believe your comments would be in the reverse. You'll never know!
