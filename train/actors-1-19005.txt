Michael Moore is joke! He gave a one sided view and you bought it, Oprah. How about facing the truths in this world. You obviously have an agenda and it doesn't include revealing the truth. The truth is, there is evil in this world. Many people in Iran value your life like they value a mosquitos life-face it! Guns don't kill people, people kill people. How about making people accountable for there actions instead of I don't believe in the death penalty. It's not wrong to own a gun and protect yourself. It's wrong to own a gun with the intent to commit a crime. Michael Moore is the villian here because he sugar coats his lies. His concern is to play off people emotions thus making a buck. I want the truth, and the truth is there are many, many people in Detroit who are dangerous including Blacks. Get real Michael Moore. And as for bashing Bush, I have more respect for a man who prays for guidance and does what is right than for a jackass like Micahel Moore. The truth is Oprah, ever since the world began there has been evil people, and to try and make it like all human beings are godly , is not only naive, but evil itself. You and Michael Moore want to take the easy way out by being passive and not acknowledging the good of the American people. You are not the person I thought you were. How could you have bought into Michael Moore's crap? You've lost a viewer.
