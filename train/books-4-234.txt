This book has been out for a few years, and I avoided it for some time, because it was filled with unflattering pictures of Hillary. I am certainly a NON-fan of Hillary, but when I saw those photos, I just assumed the book was probably slanted too far to the right. But I decided a couple of weeks ago to check it out at our local library. I've read a little over half the book and am amazed. It's much more balanced and interesting than I expected, even insightful. This might be Barbara Olson's best work. Some parts are briefly sympathetic. But overall, it's a clear presentation of the Hillary that we already know exists: a woman driven to achieve power by any means. And we didn't need the book to tell us that. Hillary's own behavior and remarks show us the kind of person she is.
