Though Bangkok is currently building a new airport, the one I used for over 10 years (Don Muang International) was/is really good. Clean and efficient with 2 terminals, it's located in the north of the city. Good, comfortable and cheap micro buses will take you to major areas of town for only 120-150 baht (about CAD $4.00) and there's a neat little restaurant that gives you a full view of planes taking off and landing. Even the 3 baht red buses will take backpackers to Khao Sahn Road for less than 10 cents. The domestic terminal is only a free shuttle bus away also too. But boy does that Bangkok humidity hit you right away when you get in the terminal. I do wonder what they'll do with it once the new one is built though.
