Ivy League education on a working man's budget! ( OK, I am an Alum it is really a 4 Star school. ) If you want to party 2-3 days a week; don't go here. If you need your hand held when you cross the street, do NOT go here! If you want to learn, interact with brilliant people from all walks of life, and many different cultures, but can't affort MIT or Harvard; you will love University of Illinois at U/C. When I attended it was one of the top ten schools for Agriculture, Engineering, Education, and Accounting. They expect you to take responsibility for your education and, if you can't; too bad, they will find someone else in the next semester!
