Alright, this isn't the most healthy place to eat, but those donuts make it alllll worth it . . . . there is a wide selection, and they've got a killer bavarian creme donut! Their breakfast sandwiches are good, but a bit on the greasy side. I definately appreciae the use of real, fresh eggs for their sandwiches (at least the one that I frequent). My fiance' worked at the Barnes Noble Cafe' serving Starbucks coffee, and would go OUT OF HIS WAY to get coffee at Dunkin' Donuts instead. (I don't drink coffee, though, so I can't personally say whether it's any good or not). Plus, the one that I frequent has a very friendly and efficient staff. If you want a good ol' donut, this is a good place for it.
