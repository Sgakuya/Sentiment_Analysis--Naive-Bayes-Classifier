The old ones that I've read from back when Liz was just a small child often reeked of humour, and were very funny. Lately, they've gotten more serious, simply because the kids aren't kids anymore, and the only children really around are Mike's two. Each character has their own story now, and sometimes it's almost as if you're reading three or four different comics. April certainly is becoming a teenager, and Lynn protrays her as such. However, she should be starting to become a little more mature and less bratty than her friend Becky, as she is 15 now. I used to desperatley hope that Liz would end up with Anthony, but I'm starting to like that police officer guy. I'm impressed with how much Mike has grown. He's a husband, a father, and a very good journalist. I've grown up with these characters, and almost feel as if they're my friends. Liz better get married before the series ends!!!
