I think she's a lot more talk than talent. Her best work was in Jason's Lyric and I don't know where her real friends are. I say that because if she had true friends they would tell the child to pulease stop singing. She sounds absolutely horrible. I also think she & Will are kind of phony because they're always talking about how perfect they are, their marriage is, how happy they are....truly happy people aren't always announcing it---they're just happy. I think it's an act because no one's perfect and everyone has problems. They'll only admit there's a problem if it makes them look more human and hence---more perfect. I think she could use a boob job too cause my ten year old cousin has more breasts than her. But she's not all bad because she does have a lot of spunk....she's just a little too loud for me and I've always found Loud women to be a little tacky.
