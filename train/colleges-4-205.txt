IBS may not be HBS, but it is a great, and unique place. Do your homework, and make sure it's for you. If you have a finance/econ background, you may find the academics will hold you back. If you don't, you may find it too advanced. That may sound paradoxical, but since the school has grown so much, I hope the admin will take our advice and segment the finance and technical courses by levels, and career tracks/interests. As an MBA student with significant work experience, the international exposure is exactly what I was looking for. Students are from all over the world so it's a great place to learn how to work with different cultures - if anything, that's the distinction of the program today: it is highly global. In time, as the reputation builds, my hope is that the academic structure, and student services will adapt and improve, creating a virtuous cycle that will attract more of the right students, who will be challenged in a way that appeals to them, who will spread the word and attract more of the same. Don't be dissilusioned: it's not a top school (yet), but it is top at what it does, the professors are genuine, with relevent expertise and credentials, and there's room for you to contribute and grow. If you are an alum, don't forget your role - we need jobs to keep that cycle going!!!
