Fern they don't call them the Amazin's for nothin. I'm a huge Mets fan and though they blew it yesterday in the series against the Evil Empire as they are wont to do more often then not, I'm fairly pleased with the excitement out at Shea these days. I've grown up loving this team threw the Bamburger years, Torre's early years, Torborg, Dallas Green and Art Howe and though they normally come up on the short end of the stick they have delievered some of the most memorable moments in baseball history. Their current team won't be competing for the series title this year but they're playing competitive ball. And with the young players like Wright and Reyes, the acquisitions of Martinez and Beltran I wouldn't be suprised if the Mets are back in the series next year or the year after if they plug a couple holes.
