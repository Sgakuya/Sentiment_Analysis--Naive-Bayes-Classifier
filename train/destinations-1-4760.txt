Hard to get lost since the addresses are coordinates. That's about the best thing about the hole. Like all places ruled by religious adherants who seek to impose their lifestyle on others (Kabul, Afghanistan should be SLCs sister city) there is a feeling that you are being observed and judged all the time. It's oppressive. Utahns told to avoid gossip in church misinterpret this and simply avoid making contact with people outside their clique. It has to be the most boring place for it's size, unless you can work your way into a quilt-making group or like growing corn in your back-yard in your spare time. It's not the biggest per-capita consumer of anti-depressants for nothing - pretty strange for a people who claim to have the truth. It appears that while alcohol and other illicit drugs are frown upon, the Mormons hook into the prescription drugs with gusto. Alcohol runs to neighbouring states are a reality on Sundays. Child abuse and domestic violence are also epidemic, showing how hypocritical the people are. This is a city suffering mass denial. It appears that some problems just shouldn't be happening in a place where church life is so integral, so they are ignored. Unless you want to use SLC as a starting point, or land there, I suggest you avoid this horrible, closed minded city so obviously in need of a collective drink and a f*ck it's not funny.
