Clemson offers the most impressive classroom and campus life experiences in South Carolina and remains competitive in the Southeast for comparable level institutions. The Agricultural, Economics, Architecture Engineering departments are staffed with top notch faculty and are given the necessary resources (both private and public) to exceed the demands of a major land grant university. I recommend the University website to any potential student or faculty member (www.clemson.edu). After a little homework and ONE visit to this gorgeous campus I guarantee you will fall in love with this fine institution of higher education.
