The best Russian leader since Tsar Alexander II. Putin recently accepted the Kyoto protocol, following a compromise deal with the EU. But I'm betting the US won't ratify until Bush (i.e. Cheney) is out of office. Putin did a good job repairing the damage done by Yeltsin, and brought the oligarchs under control. Tried to redirect the Russian economy away from the resource-stripping of the Yeltsin years towards more productive enterprises, with some success. Within the narrow limits of Russian finances, tried to restore the social safety net that was destroyed by the hyper-inflation of the 90s. Admittedly, Putin hasn't been very effective in bringing the war in Chechnya to a close. But Chechnya is a no-win situation for any president: stay in and the carnage will just go on and on, or get out and watch the country become a base for terrorists-who hate the Russians for invading in the first place! The real mistake here was (Yeltsin's) original invasion of Chechnya in 96': a half-baked, disastrous stunt planned to help his re-election. But the stunt backfired, and both Russian and Chechen must kill each other for the rest of century just so Yeltsin could stay in office and his oligarch paymasters could get rich(er). Remind you of anyone else...?
