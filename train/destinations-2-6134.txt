The eastern portion of Kentucky is reminiscent of West Virginia and suffers mostly the same Appalachian hardships of poverty, joblessness, insufficient health care and services, etc. The western half isn't any more appealing but there are a few nice pockets , especially the rolling Bluegrass region which is anchored by Lexington, an attractive city of 250,000. The Kentucky Horse Park is a cool detour and a place where you can easily whittle away a few hours. Louisville is a gritty river city that combines aspects of the north and south in the same vein as Cincinnati, but there isn't much noteworthy worth seeing there. Along with Covington, it has some undeniably attractive historic architecture, though pretty ghetto and run-down in some areas. Oh yeah, there's this place called Mammoth Cave, which is supposed to be one of the largest underground caverns in country. So maybe then, you can finally remember the difference between a stalactite and a stalagmite. It's just too bad too many of the state's residents are in serious need of some book-learnin', and a few more progressive attitudes wouldn't hurt the place either.
