Why I went to see this movie is beyond me, but I thought it was good. The music was the best orchestral performance I have ever heard in ANY movie. I also liked how the movie is set in modern time. I would have rather seen Nicholas Cage playing the dark, spooky Wonka maniac role, but Johnny Depp wasn't that bad. He played the part well, except his hairdo made him look like he had just been on The Real Roseanne Show. Depp also acted silly when I was hoping for a more Gene Wilder seriousness. I thought it was stupid to call the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I can't get myself to call it that. I just say Willy Wonka, like every other person in the world who saw the first movie called it for years.
