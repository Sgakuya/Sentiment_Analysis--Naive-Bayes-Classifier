Actually, I would give it 3.5 Stars. I lived in Italy for a year (though nowhere nearly as attractive Tuscany) and it brought back memories. I'd have to say seeing Diane Lane in heat was as pleasing to the eye as the Tuscan scenery. Some implausibilities in the plot, but a passable movie. Definitely an estrogen-laden movie. At times, it played like something you would see on House and Garden TV (yawn!!!). While clicking through the bonus features of the DVD, my wife traipsed across a movie secret -- the dude artist clad only in bikini briefs was actually naked for that scene; the scanties were computer generated.
