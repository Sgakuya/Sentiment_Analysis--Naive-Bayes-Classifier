First rate actress with a long list of good moovies, and lovely girl-next-door charms, Winona Ryder is one of the MooCow's favorite actresses. True, lately she is known moore for bad flicks(Mr Deeds, Lost Souls) and kleptomania - why is it no one remembers that she helped search for an abducted little girl offer a huge chunk of her own moolah as reward? She is smart, has a flawless face, and has shown a knack(at least early on) for choosing good underground films that showcased her talents. Let the gossip rags howl - the MooCow is all about Winona Ryder, and she is destined to be looked at as THE actress of her generation
