Heartbreakers is a very good movie. And Why? Because of the charecter played so briliantly by Mr. Gene Hackman! If Hackman does not get nominated (if not win) for best supporting actor there is no justice in the world!!! His performance as the cigarette king (along with some great makeup) is terrific. Mr. Hackman should at least get an MVP (Most Valuable Performer) award for his effort. He makes you laugh out loud without before he says his first line. There is a real drop off after his charecter departs. There are many other performances by many fine actors Sigourney Weaver. (The look on her face the instant before she give Hackman's charecter mouth to mouth resuscitation is absolutely priceless. and when she comes up with a mouth full of cigarette smoke is hillarious!!! I was sorry to see this movie so poorly rated but, on the bright side, maybe it will hasten it's arrival on the DVD scene. I can't wait to add it to my collection. Roy rm2200@aol.com
