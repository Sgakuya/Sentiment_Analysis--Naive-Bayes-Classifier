This game is great. It was a good improvement over the original. Better graphics, sound, music, monsters, and weapons. It had a lot more story. The graphics were fantastic. They were not beautiful and colorful like Unreal, but they were very realistic. There was this one part of the game where I was walking through a hall, and the graphics looked so real I felt like I was walking through a photograph. Also, the return of the BFG made the game feel a lot more like the Doom games. It is also just as customizable as Doom2. Overall, the game is great. I hope Id continues to make shooters like this. This is probably my favorite first person shooter.
