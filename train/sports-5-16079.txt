I'm rating him as a return man. Over the last two years he has been the best kick returner at making big plays. I can recount at least four seperate occasions where he won a game on special teams, even as teams have been game planning for him and kicking away from him. That's an incredible impact for a guy that's on the field maybe a tenth of the time. If he had his speed and elusiveness in a frame just a couple inches longer, he'd be capable of being one of the league's best recievers too. Even just as a reciever he's a pretty solid slot reciever. He's capable of burning virtually any corner and can also make a short yardage catch turn into a long gain. You can't say that about most slot guys. Think about it... He's tied for the NFL record of most touchdown returns in a career... How much do you want to bet he breaks it? UPDATE: To any of you that still doubt Dante Hall and his ability to affect a game, consider that since he's came on board, the Chiefs have had amongst the best average starting field positions. That's because the only way teams can game plan for him is to kick it short or out of bounds. Even if he isn't ripping off monster returns, he's still having an effect. Plus, just look at this compilation video and tell me he's not badass! http://www.kevinmontalto.com/videos/dantehall.mpeg
