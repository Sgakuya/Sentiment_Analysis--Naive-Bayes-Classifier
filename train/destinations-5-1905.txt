I'm truly suprised at the depth and breadth of sentiment here, even more suprised at the vehement hate that some of you are spewing. You can disagree with a country, you can dislike a country, you can even argue that it should change but to argue that you 'hate' a country is pretty extreme. In order to hate America, you have to hate the people of America, the laws of America and the ideals on which it was founded. Anyone who would dare assert that they 'hate' America is obviously too ignorant to understand what America is. America is a county founded by immigrants that has historicaly welcomed people from all backgrounds into a community that is built on principles that most other country's have not even begun to consider, let alone implement. America is a place where Machiavelli's assumptions are proven wrong. America is a place where its people genuinly care about other countries and one of the only countries that have put their money to work helping others. To hate America is to hate what is good and decent about this world. Long live the Red, White and Blue!
