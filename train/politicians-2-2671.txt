He's a Republican, and a mighty conservative one at that. Possibly to the right of Bush. I've had enough of their agenda! Any party that wants control so bad that they'll spend six years of the public's time, and untold millions of taxpayer's dollars to destroy a president is dangerous. It's a corporate coup in the making...nearly completed. This party still believes in trickle down...support the corporations and some of their profits will trickle down in the form of jobs and cheap products. The very words, 'trickle DOWN' shows us where we stand with them. Our paychecks show how well this system works. A family today makes less with two parties working than they did a generation ago with one party working. We've been had!
