So I saw a free screening of this and man, what an awful movie. It was so poorly written and the storyline was so weak that it was just laughable. If you ever see it, which I suggest you don't, please tell me what you think. It might have just been the atmosphere --theatre of college-aged wisecrackers-- but reallly, we were laughing so much when we probably weren't supposed to but that at least made the movie somewhat entertaining! I mean, basically the premise is that Meg Ryan's husband was kidnapped but they don't have any money to pay for his ransom so Russell Crowe, out of the goodness of his heart and because he has the hots for married Meg, decides he'll steal her husband away from the bad guys. You can only guess the sexual tension between Meg and Russel but not really since all the characters in this movie are horribly superficial and flat. So in a nutshell, I'm gonna have to say that it was barely worth the money I paid to go see it-- and considering it was free, that's saying a lot. (Okay, it wasn't that bad but after watching Gladiator THREE times in two weeks, I was hoping for more).
