You notice I gave William Felton Russell five stars. He deserves eleven stars instead, one for every Celtic championship he won from 1956 to 1969. To describe Bill as marvelous is simply an understatement. He put up with a lot of crap from non-sports fans up in Boston all those years and still had the mental fortitude to be as incredibly successful as he was. To top it off, Bill Russell is an even better human being than he was as a player. No. 6 of the Boston Celtics is one of the very greatest of American sports legends. The Numbers and facts: 1) Won 2 NCAA championships alongside K.C. Jones with the University of San Francisco Dons in 1955 and 1956. 2) Won an Olympic Gold Medal with the U.S. Men's basketball team at the 1956 Summer Games. 3) Won 6 MVP awards while playing for the Celtics. 4) Led the Celtics to a record that still stands, 8 WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN A ROW (1959-1966). INCREDIBLE. GO CELTICS!
