This is a great book that came out about 45 years ago. It deals with a North America that has sunk back into barbarism or even savagery because of nuclear war. After the war, many centuries ago, the surviving populace turned on the scientists who developed the technology resonsible for the war. A scientist, Leibowitz, founded a monastic order, so tradition goes, that was dedicated to the recovery and preservation of knowledge. The novel revolves around an abbey in the Southwest founded by Leibowitz. The abbot and monks proceed through the centuries as the monastaries of old, copying and preserving the knowledge of man. The area is full of outlaws and genetic freaks and monsters caused by the fallout centuries before. Slowly man improves and knowledge returns. What is devastating is the end of the novel. Society returns to the same old ways and destroys itself again. This time a space ship takes off for the stars carrying the future of man. Miller, I think, only wrote one other work just before he died about 2000, St. Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman. I just acquired it but haven't read it.
