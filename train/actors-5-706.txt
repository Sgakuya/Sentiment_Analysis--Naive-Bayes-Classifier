Though he was present in some of my favorite films like Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte and several others, I barely noticed Joseph Cotton in my early movie viewing days. He was kind of like certain types of foods you never really develop a taste for until much later in life. Once I did notice him I realized that he was a very good actor who gave an excellent delivery, created believable characterizations and had a very memorable voice. He was also just a little off-center, which is always an intriguing feature in an actor. This attribute was never more prevalent than it was in his many films with Orson Welles. Joseph Cotton could definitely hold his own as an actor and had a very long and distinguished career to prove it.
