Worst cable company ever. I had them when I lived in Connecticut. Very poor picture quality with so-called Digital cable. Channels going out alot. Also they like to advertise themselves every chance they get with the most annoying commercials possible. They talk about satellite vs cable and all the disadvantages of satellite. What they don't tell you is cable has many more faults than satellite. Don't waste your money on their cable, if you live in an area where the cable company is Cox Communications, get satellite instead, much better than the $60/month for poor picture quality. Plus for $60/month you can get more channels on satellite than with cable.
