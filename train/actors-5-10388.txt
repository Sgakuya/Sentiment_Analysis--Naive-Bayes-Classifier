I'm jealous that the Brits have such a lovely, talented actress to be proud of- there are very few American women that come close to her caliber, with the exceptions of Jodie Foster and Hilary Swank, perhaps. I loved Kate in Titanic - she was the ultimate heroine and made me proud to be a woman. I also like her in other roles, including the very bizarre Heavenly Creatures and the winsome Sense and Sensibility. She conveys an air of reality and wholesomeness in her peformances, and totally deserves an Oscar for Best Actress in something soon! I also like the fact that Kate is comfortable with her body image and doesn't diet or force herself into anorexia or bulimia to have the perfect body. She's proof that a woman of a plumper figure (like myself) can be sexy, successful, talented and still get the guys! I wish her all the best in the future - she has a long, blessed career ahead of her.
