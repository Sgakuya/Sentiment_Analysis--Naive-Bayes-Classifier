While visiting Poland I met a tourist who said I can't decide which city is grander, Budapest or Paris? It is true, Budapest rivals the unofficial romantic capital. Though I doubt that most people truly understand why. You will find everything you look for in a world capital, but with an original twist. Too bad that Bp never had the fortune to stay great. Unlike Paris, Bp has been plagued by would be rulers. It's been abused almost beyond help. Yet its original beauty shines through. Go see it.. If you knew all the stories you'd cry all the way back home. So melancholy is the history of Hungary! for the record, ..Hungary is located in CENTRAL not EASTERN Eu.
