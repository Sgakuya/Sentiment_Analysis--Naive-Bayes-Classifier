I grew up in Maine and have since moved away, but I still go back to visit as often as I can. Portland could be one of the best places to live if only there were more opportunity there (I moved away because I didn't want to spend the rest of my life waiting tables), but the people are the nicest anywhere, it's one of the most beautiful places in the country and you can't beat the fresh seafood. It's liberal politically (most the republicans I know there are pro-choice and pro-gay marriage) and Portland has a great art scene. Yes, winters are rough, but if you know how to ski it makes them infinitely more tolerable. It's also one of the few states to ban advertising billboards on the highways which makes driving much more pleasant.
