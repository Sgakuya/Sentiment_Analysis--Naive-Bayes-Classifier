Truly the greatest monarch in English history. The danes drove his Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex into a tiny resistance in the swamps of of the south west. --- For those not versed in English folklore let me tell you the story of King Alfred and the burnt cakes. It was said that when Alfred was hiding in the swamps he came upon the hut of a peasant woman, the woman asked him to watch her cakes which were cooking while she was out. Alfred fell asleep and when the woman came back the cakes were burnt to cinders. The woman was furious and she scolded Alfred and beat him out of the house with her broom. When the Kings men arrived she realized who she was dealing with, she fell to her knees and begged forgiveness. Alfred didn't even forgive her, he said that it was ok and she had every right to be angry with him. (of course this is folklore) --- Even though the Danes had pushed him and his followers into hiding in the cornish swamps, he still managed to push the pillaging danes back and ultimately defeated them and signed a treaty where the danes and the anglo-saxons could live in peace (hence danelaw). He encouraged exploration, and his intrepid adventurers explored as far as Greenland. He made a major investment in teaching people to read and built many monasteries. He mapped the lands under his control well and established roads and signposts which hugely helped the battered post-Roman empire British infrastructure. Overall Alfred left a legacy of being tough but very fair minded, peaceful, intelligent and tolerant and showed the sort of class that leaders hundreds of years later would struggle to match.
