If i ever had a choice to go to any country, I would go to Egypt. Egypt is one of the most ancient cevilizations in the world. I like the mysticism behind its history. I wonder how inteligent ancient Egyptians were to built pyramids without the help of the modern technology and machines. The statue of the great Sphinx is as timeless as any wonder in the world.The only thought about pharoas, mummies, tombs gives me both excitment and chills. I once heard that ancient Egyptians were the most beautiful people in the world (think Nefirtiti), I believe they were both mentally advanced and extremely unique.I'm totally blown away by this country and absolutely stunned by its history.
