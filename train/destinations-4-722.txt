Tijuana is what it is. It's cheesy, dirty, gaudy, sketchy, and a complete tourist trap. It is also one heck of a good time. Avenida Revolucion is lined with clubs, strip bars, and vendors as well as people armed with decent English who are determined to sell you chiclets, be your guide, or otherwise influence the direction of your evening. Once inside the clubs, you will find pounding music (mostly american), cheap drinks, and waitstaff who will pour tequila down your throat, blow a whistle in your ear, and shake your head as hard as they can. One of the most interesting aspects of my trip to Tijuana was the trip home. At 4:30 in the morning on a Monday there was a line of what must have been 3,000 people waiting to cross the border into the US - virtually all Mexican, virtually all (based on their clothes) on their way to some manual labor type job. Standing in line as a drunk, privileged American, it really gives you perspective on the sacrifice that thousands of Mexicans are willing to make for the chance to do back breaking work at sub minimal wages. In an odd way, I found those people n line to be inspirational, and it made me proud to be part of a country where almost everyone is an immigrant of some kind, and where hard work is rewarded with a quality of life that you can't find elsewhere. The border community is an amazing phenomenon - if you want to read more about the dynamics of what is taking place on the Mexico-US border, pick up a copy of the Amexica issue of Time Magazine.
