The polaris predator is a very well preforming machine. i had diffuctys when putting on a yoshimura off road exuast, on the paper to instal the pipe it said to rais the needle 1-2 positions. so we did that and it would not run, it would just cut ont when reved up high. then all of the local motorcycle shops said to jet it up to a 175 or bigger. so i did that then it would still not run rite. so we took it and had it worked on and the person who worked on it put a 175 main jet in it and he had the needle in the therd position witch is stolk, and he had to adjust the air screw. then it fixed the problem. now the preditor is a loud machine,
