Absolutely gorgeous, affordable destination with a variety of attractions. Outdoor opportunties about all over the state - it contains five national parks, the Great Salt Lake, numerous reservoirs, and countless hiking paths. Salt Lake City is a pedestrian and car friendly urban area with great shopping at the Galleria and on Main Street. Park City is urban mountain chic and a haven for local artists. Ogden sports a darling historical shopping district on 25th Street, as well as Ogden Nature Center, a Dinosaur Park, and several museums. Skiing is unparalleled. People are very friendly - the only religious proselytizing we've encountered is if you take the tour at the Temple in Salt Lake City. Utah is the perfect vacation for anyone.
