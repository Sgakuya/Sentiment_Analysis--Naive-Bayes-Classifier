I smoke menthol exclusively, otherwise I don't think it's really worth it. I've tried virtually every well-known menthol cigarette out there, and I've been smoking Newport Lights consistently for quite some time now. The menthol oil they use isn't as fresh and minty as the kind they put in marlboro or camel menthols, but in my opinion the newport tobacco is much better tasting and smoother than these other brands. They have a unique taste thats hard to describe, it's almost a buttery taste. And for the record, NO cigarettes contain fiberglass. Newport may use fiberglass filters (I think they actually use cellulose acetate, which is different) but unless you like smoking the filters, you wouldn't have to worry about getting fiberglass in your lungs.
