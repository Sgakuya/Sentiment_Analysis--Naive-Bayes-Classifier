I'm Puertorican so I'll say a couple of things about San Juan and its people. First of all Puertoricans are very friendly and in San Juan the majority of the people speak english. It's a beautiful city but in all honesty there's too much trash. The nightlife is pretty good, there's everything to do. Yes it's a little too expensive but don't tell me that american beaches are prettier because it's not even close. And finally it's not true that almost everyone here hates America when like 47% of the population wants PR to become the 51st state and another 45% wants PR to stay as a commonwealth of the US if you add that's about 92% of the population!!!
