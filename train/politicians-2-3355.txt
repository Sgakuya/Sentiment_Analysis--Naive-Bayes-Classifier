He's broken the law in a big way, so I, too, agree that Bush needs to be impeached...and it breaks my heart to say it, because I really don't necessarily think his motives and humble, awshucks, chuckle behavior is insincere, he might be a very nice guy, but he's really crossed the line now with his disregard of America's checks and balances, in ordering spying on Americans without even FISA approval. (I minused another star because of his role in cramming through the Road Map to Peace in the Middle East and then intransigently sticking to it despite Palestinian noncompliance with Phase I--rather hypocritical in propping up Mahmoud Abbas while condemning the other Mahmoud, Iran's Ahmadinejad...both deny Holocaust (Abbas in Ph.D. dissertation) both condone annihilation of Israel (just that Abbas does it by, contrary to Road Map, allowing Hamas to run as a party in elections though total destruction of Israel is a stated Hamas charter goal)).
