My wife I have just bought 2 new 2002 virages, we have used them only twice since we got them but have only had them 7 days. The first time we took them to a lake had great fun,we also towed a tube which was also good fun.We took them to the ocean at the weekend where we were jumping massive waves, we had never skied on the ocean before to go in out of the waves was awsome. We were airborne for some of the time which was a bit scary but fun.I would not recommend taking a tandem pair on the beach unless there are at least 6 stong people to help launch load up as the trailer is very heavy which sinks in the sand.
