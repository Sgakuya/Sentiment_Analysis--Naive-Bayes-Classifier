Perhaps I'm biased, seeing as I'm one of the more obsessive lot of Dave Matthews Band fans. However, Dave, Carter, LeRoi, Stefan, and Boyd have done it again. Their unique blend of music transcends genre restrictions and creates a delicious piece of ear-candy on Listener Supported. Recorded in September of 1999 for PBS, this is one of those shows where the band's energy is just on fire. My only complaints about Listener Supported are that the shots (on the video release, of course) cut to audience members a little bit too much (show me the band, dear God, show me the band!!) and the slight overuse of The Lovely Ladies, three backup singers who sound (arguably) enjoyable on songs such as Granny and #36 (though many fans dispute this) but just lead to overkill on Stay and Long Black Veil. All in all, however, Listener Supported is a great trip for your mind and spirit. The Dave Matthews Band, kings of summer tours, never disappoint!
