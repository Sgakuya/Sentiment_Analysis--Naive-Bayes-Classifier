I couldn't agree more with abichara1882. The one question everyone has to ask about Hillary is can you trust her. The answer is an emphatic NO! She has lied and created scandals including how she made all that money speculating cattle futures, Whitewater, Travelgate, the cover-up of Vince Foster's death. No, Vince wasn't murdered, but I'm convinced she had her brainless minions raid his office and remove any damaging papers involving the Clintoons and Whitewater, among other things. She also lied about how her Rose Firm billing records got in the White House, Chinagate, Pardongate (she even tried to shift the blame toward her bungling brothers) and Filegate. It is obvious she was intent on getting incriminating files for her blackmail dossier. It was shrugged off as a bureaucratic snafu, a patently ridiculous claim. Clinton should have been impeached for that offense alone. Hillary cannot be trusted, and she holds socialist and extreme political views. She is power hungry and needs psychoanalyis for her hatred towards authority and sacred institutions, which probably stems for her disdain and fear of her father Hugh Rodham. Mr. Rodham was reportedly a mean SOB who didn't treat his family with love or respect. I might be inclined to feel sorry for her because of her dysfunctional family. However, this is no excuse and she has never taken responsibility for her actions or mistakes. She is always blaming someone else for her deviant behavior, ie: the vast, right wing conspiracy. If people think the country has gone in the toilet now, wait until Hitlery attempts to take control of the White House and become the first woman elected President. She will wreak havoc with her bitterness and will most likely go after her enemies with a vengeance like Evita supposedly did.
