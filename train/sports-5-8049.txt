I am in love with Allen. He is the most beautiful person. He has incredible talent. He might not be a team player..but who else on the 76ers can play. Allen needs to go to a team where he doesnt have to play 56 miuntes just so the team can win. I think all the stuff about what a 'thug' he is is all crap. People just need an excuse to say he isnt good, without saying they dont want him on the USA Olympic team because he is true to himself. People need to loosen up and not judge amazing people on the tatoos and their SEXY hair. Critics need to get past his ghetto life, and see his true talent. Critics have said that he is not a good person, but he founded orginazations in Philly, and supports his two children. How many 25 year old men can say that? I LOVE HIM! Allen Iverson is the most amazing basketball player ever, and to compare him to MJ is a joke. MJ is a sell out. Allen! WHOA!! DAMN! I am behind him 110% in whatever she wants to do.
