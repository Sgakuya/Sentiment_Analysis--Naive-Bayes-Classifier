I was introduced to Target more than twenty years ago when they opened a store near my home. At first it seemed like most other discount-type stores on about the same level product and quality-wise as K-Mart. I soon realized that there was a difference. At the time it mostly had to do with the arrangement of the store which was much more organized and convenient. Then, over the next few years, the quality of their merchandise also began to improve greatly. I think this has been especially true in the last five years or so when it comes to household items like lamps and smaller furniture. Some things they now carry, such as dishes, glassware, etc., are even very similar in style to some of the more upscale companies like Crate Barrel and, at a much lower price. I have also always been able to count on a good price for personal items like toothpaste, shampoo, makeup, etc. Unlike K-Mart and especially Wal-Mart, you don't have to fight your way through tacky piles of boxes sitting in isles and rabid shoppers who seem to have no qualms about running you over to get to the next great bargain. Target just doesn't have that feeling of frenzy. My one and only gripe with them is that they recently closed 'my' store and left an area of loyal shoppers in favor of what I am sure they believe to be 'greener pastures'. It's the old story of moving 'toward the light' of a newer, currently booming suburban area and away from an older one. Still, I'd feel a little better toward them had they at least bothered to acknowledge the receipt of my letter protesting the closing.
