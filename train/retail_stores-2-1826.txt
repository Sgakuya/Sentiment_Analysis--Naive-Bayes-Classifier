I have an insane love/hate relationship with Wal-Mart. I love the selection and the convenience of having so many products and services offered in one store. I HATE the customer service. The only competent person is usually the greeter, and how hard can smiling and saying hello really be? Most of the time, the clerks and stockers act as if they have had partial lobotomies, and I know they get decent pay, so they should try harder. I have numerous past experiences that reflect the average Wal-Mart employess complete disregard for customers, but I won't bother writing them down, b/c everyone I know has had similar experiences. It is the only big store in my rural area, so I am stuck with them. If they would only overhaul the customer service program, my 2 stars might shoot up to five, but I don't think that there is much hope.
