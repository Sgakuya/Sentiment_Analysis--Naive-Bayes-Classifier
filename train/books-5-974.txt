 When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. for whatever reason, I love the opening line to this excellent book. I remember my shock when I found out that S.E. Hinton was a woman..a 16 year old girl, in fact, when she wrote this classic tale of the struggles between the greasers and the socs. Ponyboy was an unlikely hero who stood for loyalty, determination and sincerity. An educational and heartbreaking tale of this family of young men struggling to come out on top. So many life lessons are taught throughout the book. It is a must read for all young adults as well as adults. Stay Gold.
