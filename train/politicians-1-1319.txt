Qaddafi is a bit of a nutcase. Libya would be better off without his brand of Islam mixed in with socialism and nationalism. The people in Libya have no rights whatsoever to speak up against the government. This is a country that would benefit greatly from Western business, considering the fact that it sits under one of the worlds largest reserves of natural gas. Basically, Quaddafi is a megalomaniac who wants what is best for his legacy and not his people. Luckily, he is no longer a threat since President Reagan took him to the woodshed for his attack on U.S. military personnel in a Berlin disco in 1986...Let his majesty Muammar disappear into the Saharan sunset!!
