Hooters is a great place to eat! the New Orleans Shrimp is amazing! The staff is amazing the manager sat at our table for a few minutes to just talk and make sure the food was delicious! The staff has a variety of beatiful girls. They all seemed very nice and had a great attitude. I didn't even have to ask for a refill. For dessert I chose carmel fudge cheesecake it was delicious. This was my first experience in the resturant and I had a preconceived notion that the restaurant would be degrading but it's not, the girls are just trying to pay bills and some are paying for their own school. I am definately going back in the near future! keep up the good work girls!!
