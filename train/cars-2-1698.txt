I've been driving a Ford Focus rental car for a week now, and I really don't like it. On the plus side, it's not unattractive and it has a powerful air conditioner. On the minus side, it feels like I'm driving a tin can, and some of the basic controls (door locks, for example) are extremely awkward to operate. Another strike against the Ford Focus is the limited visiblity out the rear window (there's some sort of a panel obscuring quite a bit of the view). The driver's seat sits very low in the car, so I feel like I'm driving in a hole, which is very annoying, too. I hope the body shop finishes repairing my Honda Accord soon...
