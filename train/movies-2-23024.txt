Is that Peter Parker or Peter Pan? He's like 18 but he has been in love just once with a girl who he thought she was an angel. Can anyone be more affected than that? In this childish Disneylike version of Spiderman, there are only things that we have seen once and again through decades. Of course the nerd uses thick glasses and of course he's constantly teased by big gorillas (Is this 'Saved by the Bell'?). All what appears in this flick is a refried clich and with an unbearable humour 'for the whole family'. Add to that many stupids unexplainables references to DC characters what makes you think not even Sam Raimi was taking this seriously but for the sake of the money and the easy laughter. The action secquences are barely good but nothing we haven't seen in many other 'movies of the week'. Green Goblin is not a scary haloweenesque character anymore. He's just a green Power Ranger. Plus, why hire great Willem Dafoe if you're gonna hide his face behind a plastic mask? Goblin could have been a stunt all the time. The irony, however, is present: Kirsten Dunst is told to take acting lesson and Goblin sums up the entire movie: Spiderman, you're pathetically predictable . And obvius, should I add. With a great budget comes great responsability. Remember that, Sam, remember that .
