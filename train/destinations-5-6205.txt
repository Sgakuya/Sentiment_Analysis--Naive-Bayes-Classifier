This is one really great state in the union! Full of lakes large and small, gorgeous countryside and lots of historical things to see. Mackinac Island is a terrific place to travel back in time no cars just horses, sand, sea, surf, great old buildings and, of course, the famous grand hotel. If you want to see what I mean, rent the wonderful romantic film Somewhere in Time with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. I have lots of good vacation memories from that run the entire length of Michigan that include doodling around in boats, swimming, riding bikes, playing on the dunes and spending time with my great aunt and uncle in a cute little town called Three Rivers. I highly recommend it!
