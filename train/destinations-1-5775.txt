Apparently the people say New Jersey smells have never been to the Sunshine state. I went to the Outback bowl in 1996 at it didn't stop raining the whole 4 days I was there. Tampa is so dangerous we were told to leave the hotel at our own risk at night. The place is a run-down cesspool. Then there's Miami. I though Southbeach would be nice, but there was an aweful smell in the air. One time I flew out of Jacksonville Apt. I had to park in a grass field!This whole state is nothing but asphalt, except where there needs to be some. And when they say they have Palmetto bugs, it actually means the state is infested with roaches. Don't be fooled. Only Georgia is worse. Take your family to Arizona instead.
