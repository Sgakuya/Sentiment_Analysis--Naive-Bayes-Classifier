She's a very good actress, really underrated. True she's been in a couple of really average flicks but she graced the screen on a few classics and cult movies too. One of the most attractive faces in Hollywood, I just love her big brown expressive eyes. As a public figure, well, it seems people are really shallow and like to bear a grudge or make mountains out of molehills, when she hardly hurt anyone. She's always stood to defend the abused or those who are discriminated against and has often given a lot of her time and money to charities and noble causes. I also admire her for that continuous record of humanity and dedication. I wish she made new films soon.
