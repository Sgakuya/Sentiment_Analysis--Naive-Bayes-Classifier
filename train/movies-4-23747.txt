A guilty pleasure for sure, but the more I see this movie, the more I like it. Some of the effects weren't the best but it went further and developed a more surreal universe as a setting than most sci-fi (loved the fact that mathmeticians were the ones with the power, loved the utterly diabolical Harkonnen way of life, loved when they used voice alone as a weapon). A couple of the worm scenes on Arakis were well done, giving that sense of the worms awesome size and endless, wasteland quality of the desert. I read the book too, after seeing the movie, and enjoyed it. I think people who read the book first were porbably outraged with the movie, but I can't help but like it.
