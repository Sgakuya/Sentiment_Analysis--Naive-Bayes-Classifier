The greatest ball-handling skills of any player ever. Pistol Pete would have averaged well over fifty points a game for his career at LSU (As is was, he averaged 43.8) had they had the three point shot in those days. Hamstrung by inferior teams until his final season with the Celtics, Pete didn't get many chances to play on a national stage. But those who saw him play will never forget him. He played with the ball like it was a yo-yo on a string. He would show it to you, take it away, put it between his legs, then run by you with it on the way to the basket. And there was nothing that you could do about it.
