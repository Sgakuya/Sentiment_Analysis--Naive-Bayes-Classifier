As much as i want to say i loved the Others, i really didn't. I liked it for what it was, a suspencful artfully done summer sleeper with a brain. Nicole Kidman is really showing off her talent contrasting the Diamond Dog lover in Moulin Rouge to this role where she is a strict and over protective christian mother is wonderful to behold. Kidman is a great talent and she desplays it proudly here. The supporting cast does an equally good job especially the young cast members playing Kidman's children. They hold their own but do not steal the show like Haley did from Bruce in the Sixth Sense ( Not a hard task when co starring with ol'Bruce) The Other was laking something however...I saw the end coming a mile away and i wished the rules of beinga ghost were explained a little. Like, When ghosts eat do they eat our food? Do they move the plates around and eat at our table? The breakfast scene needs some explination. The Others is good bu not the best ghost movie i have ever scene. Recommended far more than 13 Ghosts.
