> ...[Keyes] wants to make it so Senators are not elected by the people. Hey knuckleheads - ever read the Constitution? Obviously not. Originally, Senators were to be elected by the State Legislatures, but the 17th Amendment changed that in 1913 (a very bad year for the U.S.). Y'all must have bought into the U.S. is a democracy B.S. that they teach in the public (gov't.) screwl system. Wrong answer - the U.S. is not, nor has it ever been a democracy, nor was it ever supposed to be. It was supposed to be a Constitutional Republic, but it isn't that either. The difference between y'all & Alan Keyes is he knows all that & you don't. I can't agree with him on everything, but on fundamental Constitutional issues I sure can, because he's right.
