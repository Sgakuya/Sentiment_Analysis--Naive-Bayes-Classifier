Lenny was the best, those who didn't know him or of him are quick to make stupid remarks, if you never saw him play then don't comment. He was as good or better than Jordan, it's a shame as to what happened, it was as hard for us fans to take as the theft of the Baltimore Colts in the dead of night, we all felt empty, I remember being at Memorial stadium when we all found out thier was a stunned silence and tears as if something in all of us had just died. I also feel sorry for his mother whom ended up losing her other son as well. Please try to be mature when you comment, how would you feel if someone made a stupid comment after your sister or brother died.
