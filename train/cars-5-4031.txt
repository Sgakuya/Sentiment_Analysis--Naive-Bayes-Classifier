Whoever says that Hyundai is a piece of crap and is worse than Toyota or Honda, blow it out your ass. My Hyundai at 17,000 miles has been in the shop less than my dad's Acura (read: Honda) TL with 18,000 miles. All I do is put gasoline in the thing and change the oil. We looked at the CR-V and the RAV4 and don't even bother trying to load cargo in the back or real people in the back seat of those cars. RAT4 and CR-V (crappy recreational vehicle) can't match this wonderful vehicle. And last I checked, the Santa Fe's 9.4 second to sixty time beats the hell out of the 10.5 seconds of the RAV4. You can kiss my Hyundai's tailgate!
