One of my favorite books of all time. I realize it is not for every taste; Melville writes long, irrevelant and tedious digressions which have some bearing on the central metaphor, but often an obscure or rather facetious one. Skip over them if you haven't the patience, but follow the story, for when he is good there is NOTHING in the literature like it. Ahab pursues the whale with a single-minded intensity, and his literary forebears are Satan in Paradise Lost, Macbeth, and King Lear (most of all). Warning: if you try to read Moby as a good vs evil tale, you will give up in frustration; the central metaphor is far too complex and ambiguous for that. Look bigger, much bigger. This book is an existential crisis in print a hundred years before Sartre, and in many ways a more powerful one. There is something about the language, too, which is so strange, but yet so right; it is a mix of Shakespearean and 19th century prose. Hint: you can take many of the soliloquys (for instance the magnificent one by Ahab nought but the iron way! and parse them perfectly in iambic pentameter; try it).
