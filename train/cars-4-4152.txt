This car is an excellent car. You get exactly what you pay for and then some. The Kia Sportage is the only mini-SUV in it's class to have a true transfer case. Yes, it has a 4 cylinder, and yes it is slow. But as far as being the slowest car Car and Driver ever tested, well the person who wrote that is not to smart or I should say, just plain ignorant. Shall I pull up the ratings on the first Samurai (why do you think the have VW engine conversion kit for it), or maybe even the 87hp Metro, or how about the Yugo. Obviously the person who made that statement didn't do anything as far as research before they opened their mouth. And as far as being Dangerous, what kind of crap are you trying to push, the Sportage rated number one in it's class for being safe. Being the only vehicle in it's class to have the new knee bags which prevents the driver from sliding underneath the steering wheel in a high speed head on collision. The door side beams are also a standard now in most vehicles in it's class which originated in the Sportage. And yes the person is right about the 2 door being far more unsafe than the 4 door, but aren't all of them including the old Tracker/Samurai/ and the Sidekick. All in all the Sportage is an awesome vehicle, it has a true frame, not a uni-body like all the other mini-suv's in that class.
