This is the best small sports utility for the money. Especially for anyone who is truly using the vehicle for a sports utility. With the easy clean up seats and lack of carpet, I can pick up my son from mountain biking or a muddy day on the football field without any fear of messing up the interior. I am a little lady but I can easily lift the seats up to the windows and have hauled all sorts of things from furniture to a big barbeque. I love the view and the four wheel drive was a blast in Mexico. (We even put down the seats and slept in the thing with Hondas cool window curtain accessory). The only down sides to this amazing vehicle: while the leg room is amazing in the back seat, the ride is a bit bumpy. Also, the windshield seems to be a rock magnet. All in all, I would buy this vehicle again in a heart beat. Ugly yes, but I love it.
