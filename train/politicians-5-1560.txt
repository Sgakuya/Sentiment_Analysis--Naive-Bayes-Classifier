Saddam Hussien has a right to protect his contry. And if any one really think that he has ABC-Wepons they should beawere of the fact that the U.S. has a not so proud history of deploying every weapon they ever devolped... Nagasaki was not a military target, nor was Song Mei(unsure about the spelling). And this is only two of the many warcrimes The USA forces are responisble for. In 1998 The Un concluded that 95-98% of the Iraqi wepons arsenal was destroyed, along with the facilities requierd to rebuild it. How the H**L can he rearm himself so quickly with the U.S. keeping such a tigth watch on him? And if Saddam Hussein is such a bad guy, why did the U.S. sell him weapons in the first place? Keep in mind that 5000 iraqi children die each week due to the sanctions The (not) so great contry in the west insist on maintaining. (That UNESCO fiqures not mine)
