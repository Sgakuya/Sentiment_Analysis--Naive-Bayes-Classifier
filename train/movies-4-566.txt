Released in 1985 and directed by Bryan Singer, The Usual Suspects is a complicated, modern film noir which revolves around a group of small-time cons who get caught up in the schemes of the mysterious Keyser Soze. The film is told from the perspective of one of the two main cons Roger Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) who is being interrogated after the events by the police. Kint relates how the action started when the usual suspects were brought in for questioning regarding a theft of gun parts. The story then winds itself through how he, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), and the rest of the gang continued to get pulled deeper into the surreal world of Keyser Soze until ultimately nearly everyone but Kint is killed during a boat heist. The movie climaxes with one of the most original twists in cinema. This film works so well because it is superbly cast (save for the exception of Stephen Baldwin as one of the gang), it effectively uses a non-linear format, the action is sporadically paced, and the entire aura of the movie is dark. The bottom line is that The Usual Suspects is a mystery film that easily survive repeated viewings and was a landmark release for the 1990's.
