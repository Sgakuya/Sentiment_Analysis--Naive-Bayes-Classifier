The Orioles aren't getting anywhere? What? Yeah, okay. If you say so. We will just see how it ends. If you ask me, this is one of the best teams this ball club has seen in a WHILE. Javy Lopez doing great as a DH (along with Raffy), Brian Roberts stepping up in both 2nd base and hitting (avg. is pretty fricken amazing), Melvin Mora doing great at 3rd base, Miguel Tejada on fire, and also you can't count out Erik Bedard pitching well the past few games. The only flaw is that Lopez's pitching hasn't been well, but the bullpen picks it up. Anyway, I'm a lifelong O's fan, so even if they don't do good I will still love them! GO ORIOLES!! In 1st so far!!
