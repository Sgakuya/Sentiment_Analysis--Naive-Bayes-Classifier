I wanted to give him one star to balance him out, but who am I to judge a guy with such high gross? I think over time he won't be remembered as fondly. His early films were much better to endure than LOTR. Heavenly Creatures being his finest work. The problem is that he didn't match everything well. 50% of the special effects / trickery looked hackneyed. One CGI bit would really get me on the edge just to go down the drain with a poor body double or a poor angle based around trickery or just lazy CGI. If you're going to do something, do it right - and he did that early on. I expect that he will fall flat once all the blind LOTR fans get bored with his other work.
