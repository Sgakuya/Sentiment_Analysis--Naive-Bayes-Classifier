The Panhandle - I laugh when people say they're going to Florida but don't make it past Destin. This ain't the real Florida, its an extension of Alabama. Even though the Redneck Riviera is getting so overbuilt, it still remains its Deep South character along with the whitest beaches in the Country. Pensacola was voted the friendliest city in America by some big poll a while back. Besides the beaches, check out Apalachicola and Blackwater River. North Florida - I like this area with its horse farms and rolling hills alternating with cypress sloughs. Its a lot like Georgia (i.e. The Old South) It has a lot of wild areas with beautiful springs and such. Jacksonville is basically a very large town, not a city. I've met a few locals that refer to it as The Armpit of the South, but I don't think its all that bad even if it is rather unispiring. Daytona has some super wide beaches that you can drive on and good surfing by US standards. Central Florida - a variable area that has some of the best and worst that Florida has to offer -A Land of Mickey, citrus and traffic. South Florida may as well be in the Caribbean but thats whats so good about it. The Keys are unique and beautiful.
