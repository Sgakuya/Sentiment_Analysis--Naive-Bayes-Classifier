I have flown US Airways a couple of times recently and, despite the bad pub ( US Scare ), I had a pretty good experience. Since I bought my tix through Priceline, I can't speak to the quality of the ticket reps. But everyone that I dealt with was pleasant and quite helpful. A couple of the legs of my flights were delayed (due to weather and not them) and the pilots, flight attendants, and gate agents kept everyone up to speed. The food was decent and I actually had a couple of choices. And, each of the terminals at the airports were recently renovated providing plenty of fast food options and comfortable seating.
