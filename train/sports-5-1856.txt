Ok..this is one topic that I am gona be straight up about. I am a big Braves fan. First of all, i don't like these people that did, come up in here and diss the Braves. The Braves do not suck. Where they get that..I have no clue. The Braves are a good team, and they know how to dominate. They have one like 10 eastern Division Titles in a row...More than a lot of teams can say. They've been to the WS...yeah they didn't win it...but they've still been there. Some teams can't even make it to the play-offs. Some may call the Braves chokers...Ive heard it before. But they are the people who are not fans..therefore, they dont see what the fans see. Second, Braves do not have bandwagon fans..to the guy that wrote that...You need to get your facts straight honey or don't say anything at all. And to the other person who said they are a bunch of rednecks who think they're better than everyone...hate to break it to ya homeboy, but you are also wrong. I think you need to get over the fact the Braves do a job well done every year. Yeah maybe we don't win a WS every year..or even get that far...but we play to the best of our abilities year after year, and that's why us fans love the Braves! We may not be the Yankees....but hey, we come in second place to them.
