Had fourteen days to check phone service out in my area and if it did not work to send it back. I returned the phone in three days because of no service in my area. That was three months ago and my credit card has not been credited with the 140.00 I paid up front. In fact I have received two bills for thirty nine dollars and today a notice that my service would be cut off if I didn't pay those bills. Are all Okies as ignorant as those who work for Cellular One? I have tried for hours to get a customer service person to held me but they just say we will call you right back but never do. As a Texas I spend all year long waiting for October when we can go the Cotton Bowl and Kick their OKIE ASSES!
