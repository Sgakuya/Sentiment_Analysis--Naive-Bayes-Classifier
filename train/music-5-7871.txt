I recently had a chance to watch some of the videos I used to like back in the late 80s and early 90s, and I was for the most part embarrassed. Not so with Cradle of Love. Everything about this video is top notch. The cinematography is very well done, the acting is great, the upscale urban apartment lends a lot of class, Billy Idol singing in the pictures on the walls is another nice touch, and of course the choreography. She can play her tape at my apartment anytime. As the ladies surely noticed, Billy Idol's visual performance easily meets the dancer's energy, which is no small feat. In a word, Cradle of Love is a classic.
