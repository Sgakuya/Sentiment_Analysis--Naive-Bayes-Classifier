This album is a perfect example of what a romantic album should be! It goes from a look at how no amount of fame can amount to the one you love, to the contemplative Tougher than the Rest, to All that Heaven will Allow, the most romantic song in the world (if only it could be longer!) then, after a few other good songs (including one dedicated to Springsteen's father) the title track takes us through that roller coaster ride known as love. Two Faces, Brilliant Disguise, One Step Up, and When You're Alone bring a realistic, longing for true love to return, beautiful part of the album, and then, the final song, Valentine's Day adds a shot of optimism. This album is so good to play while sitting on the couch or window seat with the snow falling lightly outside the window. Bruce proves again that he is the Boss and that he always will be! He may be middle aged, but he still has an awesome, expessive face and soooo much poetic talent!
