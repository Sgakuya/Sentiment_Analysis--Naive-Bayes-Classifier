Wow! I am just blown away by Halle's achievement as the first woman of African descent to be awarded the Oscar! The Monster's Ball was a harsh look at the reality of racism and hatred in America. The writers took the story a step farther, to show that, through our sufferings, we are all only human and can touch one another in a truly intimate way. I am so proud and truly believe that Ms. Berry is the quintessential representative of today's Black woman. As beautiful as she is, her humility is amazing! Her stint on Barbara Walters' show before the Academy Awards showed her true spirit. I loved it that she said that the HalleBerryPersona is not who she really is at all. She is just as scared and insecure as the rest of us! Her tears at that podium showed how she, just as we all, want only to be accepted for our gifts and forgiven for our faults. Right on, sister! You make my heart swell with pride! THEDOCLADY IN ATLANTA
