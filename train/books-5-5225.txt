For longer than I can remember I've read an average of 2-3 books every week. Over time, my reading tastes have changed, with fiction now taking a backseat to non-fiction. The Kite Runner is the perfect book to bridge these two genre. The author was born in Afghanistan, and lived his early years in that country. Then, after a stint in Paris, his family moved to America. The main character in the book only loosely follows the same path as the author, but the animated narrative style and strong images painted in the book clearly demonstrate that, if not in actual fact, at least in spirit, the author and his subject are true kin. Those of us living in the United States have a highly propagandized view of Afghanistan, after years of politicizing this sad country's fate. With this book, however, we get an insider's view of daily life in modern Afghanistan, as well as an outsiders perspective of the cultural shock following a move to the U.S. It is difficult to remember a book in recent times that was so exciting to read, while at the same time being so affecting. For anyone who wants the guilty pleasure of a quick and interesting read, but at the same time wants the benefit of actually learning something from the experience, The Kite Runner is one of the best examples of a satisfying book to be had in current literature.
