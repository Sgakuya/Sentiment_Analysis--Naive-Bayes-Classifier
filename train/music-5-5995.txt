Rage doesn't get the props that they deserve for being one of the first bands to blend rap and hard rock. They weren't one of the MTV favorites, because alot of their videos had political messages that were deemed to controversial. Most of the time you'd have to catch their video late at night. Tom Morello is perhaps the best guitarrist of the latter decade, because of his unique style and ability to create some of the most outlandish sounds out of a guitar. Timmy C. is an excellent bassist and Brad Wilk was the perfect drummer. Zach De la Rocha, was the last piece in the equation. His political lyrics served with the hard rock sounds of the band, made for excellent listening and also enlightening experience. The first album is their best and every song is worth a listen.
