While it is widely (and properly, in my view) held that the three top shortstops of this era are Garciaparra, Jeter and Rodriguez, I would further suggest that the competition really comes down to Jeter and Garciaparra. I comment on Rodriguez elsewhere, so if you're interested in why I reduce the list to two, look that up. Both Garciaparra and Jeter are similar players, great in the field, great at the plate, and great in the clubhouse. At there best you can't shine a flashlight between them. It is tempting to give Jeter the edge because he has played on championship teams, and he seems more durable, but frankly, I think they are more or less equal. Given the choice, I'd take Garciaparra.
