I have a '98, and it has been a very good car. I would give it a 5 on design, 5 on performance, 4.5 on build quality, 5 on reliability of the major components, 4 on little components. Approaching 50k miles the only thing that I've had it in for service on was a little creaking noise in the brake pedal, which went away before the dealer got the necessary tool(?) to fix it; this dealer had just picked up the Olds line. It came and went once more since. Had to futz with the door molding chrome a couple times as it moved out of place. It is a dream to drive. We have a C-Class Mercedes, and though the ride and performance is different, I couldn't tell you which I prefer. My wife gets uncomfortable in the passenger seat after a while, but I don't so I think that's a body-fit thing, and there isn't a way to adjust for that. Very fuel efficient considering the excellent get up and go . If there were a 10 point scale, it would be a 9 ... so is it a 4 or a 5. I say 5 because we should give GM credit for trying hard to break form. They did focus groups with people who had bought foreign cars, then set out to put those characteristics into an affordable American vehicle. I told an exec at GM that I had narrowed it down to Maxima and Intrigue before deciding... and he said primary goal was to make a car that would be attractive to Maxima enthusiasts. Then they went and just did it. The 5 is partly, therefore, based on right intentions. I wish this conviction would spread within GM and elsewhere.
