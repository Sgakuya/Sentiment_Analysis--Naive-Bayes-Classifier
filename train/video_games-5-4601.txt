this game is just amaizing!! baldurs gate is nothing compare to this one... it looks like this project started even before baldurs gate was released, it creates a great atmosphere, cool infinite like world, and the nost interactive enovirnment i have ever seen in an RPG in the sence that you can do so much in the game. there is an infinite like number of posibilitys in the game, i almost commited a suicide because of all the things i had to rememgber. over 100 important NPC's to talk to.... tons of quests... there's an amaizing feeling of a real live and breathing world, i can't imagine how did they maneged to pull off such a huge project they probebly spent more then a whole year just planning it. every NPC has it's own story, character, and tons of interactions. it's just amaizing to sit back and watch how every little thing is connected with everything, not to mention how every little thing is eventually connected to the end. inside of every building and room there's something completely diffrent going on, it's just so fun exploring it, even though you have tons of things to remember if you want to do as much as possible. not to mention the diplomacy and talking, when you talk to someone, you get to read a whole speech, then choose one of the 9 talking options, then get another speech and another 9 options, and this repetas itself like 10 times or something... not allways though, but it's a good way to describe it. it makes the game into a real torment sometimes if you play 7 hours a day like i did, but i'm telling you it's worth it. the story line is the most flexible i have ever seen, and it keeps surprising you every second. no RPG fan should miss that game, travel to another country if you must, but get this game, you'll regret it if you don't.
