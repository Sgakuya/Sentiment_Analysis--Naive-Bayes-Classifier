You gotta love NY. It's not my favorite city but if you can't have fun here then there must be something wrong with you. I agree with most of the comments below, no denying it's dirty, inflated ego's, and everything costs astronomical. My kind of New York is food and shopping. New York, like Boston and Montreal are cities that took in the wave a European Immagration and embraces other international cuisine that food in these cities just can't be beat, it's the best hands down. Shopping in New York is better than anyplace on the planet. It has everything your heart desires. Maybe you can't afford it but window shopping on 5th Avenue is fun if you can dare to dream. Also if you look hard enough there are some great bargains to be had in places and the selection to choose from is a dream. It would be redundant for me to say nightlife in the city that never sleeps kicks a**, Duh ! Central Park, the mere fact that it exists is amazing, walking among the trees and rocks. New York offers an adrenalin rush of exitement that nowhere else can match. With all that said, for me it's strictly for visiting and all that chaos wears thin on me fairly quickly that I feel I need to leave after a few days there. Like any good American outside of NY should, I hate the Yankees and watching the Red Sox put them in their place was one of the sweetest moments in sports. But that just brings up another point, NY's teams bring on that kind of passion. Enjoy New York !
