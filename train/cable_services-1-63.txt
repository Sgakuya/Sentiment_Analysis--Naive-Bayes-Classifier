I live in Langhorne, PA and I wrote the following message to Comcast: Besides Comcast high-speed internet I also subscribed Comcast Cablevision. I've selected the Digital Gold option. The cost of all services together was a high $115.47/month until the end of last year. But, in the beginning of this year Comcast raised my bill to $130.09 (increase of $14.62). Yesterday (3/20/04) I received a bill of 135.20 (another increase of $5.11). I (and not only myself as you can see in some news media) already feel that Comcast is overcharging for TV services taking advantage of their quasi monopolistic situation to ripoff customers. Comcast profits are so huge that they even can afford to buy Disney. Therefore, in the same day I received this bill increase, in order to protest against this ripoff, I decided to cancel the Digital Gold service. And soon I'll replace the entire Comcast service, (including Internet) with other possible technologic means as satellite and DSL or similar. Also, I'll share my disappointment with as many people and official entities as I possibly can.
