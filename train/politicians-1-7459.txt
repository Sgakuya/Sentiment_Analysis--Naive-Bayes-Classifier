Nagin is just the fall guy. Make no mistake, he's no ubermayor, but even if he did everything right NOLA would not have been any better off. For those of you who think it was just 'a black thing' believe me the demographic would have been different if it had been in Utah. Don't count on the government for *hit except taking your money and spending it. The people of NOLA needed help the DECADE before Katrina hit. Now they're spread to the four corners of the earth so they can never get back and billionaire developers like Donald Trump can come in and gentrify the 9th ward into $500k condos and million dollar gated McMansions.
