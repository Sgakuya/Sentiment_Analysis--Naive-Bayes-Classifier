I've lived in MN all my life (23 years) and the MN Nice is mostly true, as people here are fairly considerate and honest. MN is a liberal (Democrat since 1972), hard-working, labor-friendly state that others should model themselves after. Best: Clean lakes, healthiest state in US, best weather in spring, summer and fall, Most educated people per capita (college graduates) and most golfers per capita. Great sports scene with Twins, Vikings, Wild (not this year), Gophers and Wolves. We use to have a great health system that is starting to fall apart, taxes are fairly low and are cheap to travel to. Crime is fairly low, unless you go into North Minneapolis or certain parts of Western St. Paul. Worst: -Cold/Winter (but you can still ski/snowboard) -Drivers...by far the worst drivers I've ever experienced, not enough state-mandated experience and training...I've been all around the country. Overall: MN is a good state, with mostly smart, well-educated and active people that enjoy life, privacy and the great outdoors.
