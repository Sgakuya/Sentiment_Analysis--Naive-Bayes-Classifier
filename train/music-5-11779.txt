OK, First of all, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, whether they love or hate Good Charlotte, or anything in between. Saying that Good Charlotte is not punk means nothing. If you bothered to read the inside of the second CD cover, you would know that Benji says that he used to beat up anyone who calls him a punk poser. Read on, and you'll see that he agrees that he can't beat up the entire world. He says that people can call him whatever, but he's gonna keep doing what he's doing. Good Charlotte, in my opinion, is an awesome band. They write lyrics from experience, and all their own songs. I read in another comment, that the music is for fat 14 year olds. Benji says that he wants to give kids something that helps them through the day. And that's exactly what he's doing. Just because you don't like Good Charlotte, doesn't mean you have to categorize them, or anyone who listens to them.
