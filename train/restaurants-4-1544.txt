I think its one of the better chicken places, just one thing i have to say, NEVER GO TO A KFC IN THE RALEIGH/DURHAM AREA, besides the fact that the area itself sucks, the KFC's just can't get it right, they are never fully stocked, and it isnt because they have so many customers. I like the wings, eventhough they bread them. lol but that is just the south doing that, putting breading on wings. I really like the flavor of the secret blend, and the extra krispy is good, just make sure that you dont take it home and eat it, eat at the restaurant or it will get extra soggy. So basically, everywhere else i have ever had it is good, but not in Raleigh NC, the service here is horrible, we left screaming one time because the people made us wait for 25 minutes for the stuff, then told us they were out of legs AND WANTED TO CHARGE EXTRA TO GET TWO BREASTS INSTEAD OF A BREAST AND A LEG AFTER MAKING US WAIT!!!!!!
