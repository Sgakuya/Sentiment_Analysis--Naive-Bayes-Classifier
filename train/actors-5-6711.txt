A very talented actor. He started at a very young age and provided a riveting performance in The Man Without A Face . He brought his character to life, which, in my view, should be the number one priority of an actor. I felt for Stahl's character in that film- he learns the truth about his father, and then is told to stay away from his best friend, a disfigured teacher (Mel Gibson). Nick gave an intense performance in Bully as Bobby Kent, the real-life 'bully' who was murdered in Florida by his friends. With all the nudity, sex and rape in that film, it had to be difficult to play that role, but Stahl pulled it off. Moreover, Stahl's performance in the new HBO series, Carnivale , as the poor and confused Ben Hawkens is equally riveting. Nick Stahl is only in his twenties, and does not have a long resume. However, what he has done has been extremely impressive to this reviewer, and he is definately on the way up in Hollywood. Not only was he the best child actor in the 90s, but he is also, in my view, the best young actor in this decade (his competition in that category would be Paul Walker, Josh Hartnett, etc.). Stahl is extremely underrated and soon hopefully everyone will realize his true abilities as an actor sooner rather than later.
