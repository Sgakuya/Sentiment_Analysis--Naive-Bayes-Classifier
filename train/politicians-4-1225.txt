being great proponents of human rights and international law, Britain and the US should feel disgusted with themselves. Firstly, Britain should be ashamed of producing the tatty piece of paper called the Balfour declaration, which gave the British governments approval for the creation of a state for jews in Palestine! What right did Britain have over Palestine? Britain stabbed the Arabs in the backs, promised them independance and then supported the creation of an illegal state on their traditional homelands. The US for its part also supported the creation of this illegal state. The jews claimed a historical claim on Palestine, which dated back some 3000 years. Although the Jews did inhabit the land in the past, modern day jews are converts. They do not descend directly from historic jews. However the modern day Arabs are direct descendants of the ancient inhabitants of the land the Canaanites. Their only crime was to convert to Islam some 1700 years ago. In conclusion I believe that the state of Israel is an illegal entity and the US and its supporters cannot truly promote a universal policy of human rights and international law unless they undo this grave injustice. PS the jews gained immense sympathy after the holocaust (justifiably), SO how did they manage to annex the land of people who had dwelled there for centuries? Also the Israeli constitution has uncanny resemblance to the US constitution. (an illegal annexation of land to which they have no historical right)
