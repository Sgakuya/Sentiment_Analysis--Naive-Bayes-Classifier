This movie was bawdy, creative, energetic, satirical fun. It is NOT to show people that if you kill someone that you can get away with murder. Hello it's satire and very clever satire on society. It shows how self-centered and self-absorbed we can become and how we can manipulate the media and how the media can manipulate the public. The music was excellent high energy jazz. The dancing was great, even for the actors who are not known for dancing such as Richard Gere. The acting and singing were superb(who knew Richard Gere could sing) Queen Latifah practically steals the show. The best performance is John C Reilly as Amos Hart because the audience can identify and sympathize with him. The best musical number is Mr Cylophane Man by Reilly because it is very personal and he radiates a sense of pahtos. If you enjoy musicals, a movie with a clever commentary on society, humor, and good acting then I would recommend this film. However if you do not like musicals or you are not a fan of Richard Gere, Rene Zellweger or Catherine Zeta-Jones or you might think this movie is too bawdy and sends the wrong message then I would not recommend this movie.
