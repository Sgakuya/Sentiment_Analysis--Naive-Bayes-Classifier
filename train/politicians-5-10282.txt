As of right now the economy is steadily improving, the jobs that we lost are slowly coming back, and guess what? It's all because of the policies that Bush has. I think that it is great that he opposes gay marraige, don't get me started on those selfish pigs. Also, if everyone hates Bush so much, why'd they vote for him. Or rather, why did more people vote for him than Gore. Hmm. Maybe because Gore couldn't have handled 9/11 as well as Bush. Maybe Gore is afraid of going into Iraq, another great Bush idea. The reason he invaded Iraq was to remove Sadaam Hussein from power, check the 2004 State of the Union address. If I do recall correctly, Hussein is now out of power. The War in Iraq has costed us the lives of many, but the soldiers made that choice when they entered the armed forces. Their sacrifice is incredible. I can't wait to vote for Bush in November, it'll be fun to see what he does in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008.
