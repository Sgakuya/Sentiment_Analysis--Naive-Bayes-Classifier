* NEWSFLASH: It is now apparent that there is more to T&E than meets the eye. Anyone care to see a VERY revealing sister website? Visit: http://www.geocities.com/ozarkaljobs/ The page speaks for itself. * I am just curious to know if T&E Nationwide Movers would ask the customers who have complaints to visit RiA and rate them? Given that only those willing to rate T&E highly have shown up it is doubtful. Another interesting issue is the lack of integrity. A clear attempt to tip the scales in their favor. I will add just this analysis... Within 22 hours 5 posts were made on this company. Prior to that none existed. The odds that 5 customers would join RIA and rate them within such a small range of time has to be extremely unlikely. Staff perhaps? Using information easily accessible to them? More likely. The bottom line is that no one would have even noticed had there not been a post from the owner.
