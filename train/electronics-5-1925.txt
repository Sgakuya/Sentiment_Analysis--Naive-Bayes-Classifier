Introduced in 1985, the Nintendo Entertainment System was a substantial improvement in home video game technology with lots of games to choose which are still enjoyable today. The limitations of the technology at that time, namely 8 bits, forced game designers to concentrate on action and game play instead of wow 'em graphics and visuals. Also, Nintendo used a lockout chip to have greater control over the quality of games developed by third parties and updated from a simple joystick to a game pad with more buttons and options. The bottom line is that the Nintendo Entertainment System restarted the home gaming industry due to its quality for the time, the included game Super Mario Bros, and the improved controls.
