A great airline! I flew on business from Orange County to Denver, and it was way better than expected. The slogan now is that they use only new airplanes...and I have to say this airplace was beautiful. It was pretty roomy...much roomier than expected. Each cheap seat had its own LCD screen in the back of the seat in front of you, that showed DirectTV, as well as an up-to-the-minute naigational map showing your location on your route to your destination. I hate flying....because the turbulence bugs me. On this plane, I never noticed the small amount of turbulence, because I was so entertained. It was a super smooth flight, and the pilot made an excellently smooth landing. Staff was wonderful, and snacks were better than expected. Definitely much better than I ever expected!!!
