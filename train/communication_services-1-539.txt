They state that their service covers all of NJ and yet from month one, we were billed long distance while being inside the calling area and my wife had to call them every month since then until they told us that that was the way it was going to be unless we added long distance to the plan. ALSO, NUMEROUS dead areas and dropped calls in the middle of a conversation. Customer service is terrible as well. THANK THE LORD this is only a one year contract. They want to charge us 200 bux to end our contract (so we could find better serivce) depsite knowing how we feel about their serivce. 3 other family members are also very unhappy with this provider. They actually had the gall to blame the problems on the company that sold us the service as if they have no control over what gets provided!
