Allen Iverson! What else can you say about the man he is the greatest. Since he has joined the Sixers in 96 he has done nothing but great things for the team. You see they may make it to the CS. I am a HUGE fan of Allen and it doesn't make sense the way people criticize him. They be the same people going to see him play at the First Union Center or anywhere elese. So PLEASE just let him live his life. If he want to rap i'm behind him 100%. But it's not cool to try to criticize his lyrics when we have rappers out already that rap about the same things and in certain cases worser. Allen, I just want to say being a fan for so long i'm behind you in anything you do. I LOVE ALLEN IVERSON!!!!!
