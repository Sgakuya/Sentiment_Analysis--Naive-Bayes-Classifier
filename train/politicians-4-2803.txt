I'm not from Oklahoma, so I don't know alot about him, except that he's a undaunted Black conservative. While I'm sure he has his flaws and has done his share of questionable deeds (as we all have in our lives), I wish him well. Even though I'm not usually very conservative in my political views, I get dismayed by the cowardly authoritarianism that dominates political discussions in the black community. A black man who dissents from the liberal left civil rights party line, a tired ideology of victim-focused rhetoric fostered by aging relics of the 60's, risks alot more than a white man who disagrees with victim-focused racial politics. It's relatively easy for us to blow off the pompous jackasses who call us racist for not agreeing with their every opinion. With the exception of P.C. white liberals who still cower with white guilt , most whites have learned to laugh at mainstream black leadership, because most of these people are double-dealing opportunists and hypocrites who are looking not for racial justice, as they claim, but merely for the power to manipulate the system and squeeze it for what it's worth. A black dissenter, however, risks real ostracism by declaring himself as openly as Watts has done. I suspect that being called an Uncle Tom carries a worse sting than being called a racist. People like Watts can hardly get a word in sometimes, so loud is the angry shrieking directed at him by the black mainstream and their accommodating white liberal flunkies. So, yes, I wish him well. Black dissenters are a breath of fresh air in American political life. I may not agree with all his positions, but I can respect him as a decent and brave human being. I don't feel that kind of respect for Maxine Waters, Al Sharpton and any number of other black politicians. To tell you the truth, I have more respect for the last bug I squashed than I do for Waters and Sharpton.
