Cher needs to pack her crap and get the hell out of America now that Bush has won. She, Alec Baldwin and Barbra Streisand could share a cab to the airport then leave forever. Of course, that would mean they were good to their word and we know that dimwitted Hollywood liberals have no conception of integrity or truth. Cher...just because you were once married to Sonny Bono who was later elected to congress doesn't mean you are qualified to pontificate on politics. Your comments betray your stupidity and I would love to see you take your liberal hate and leave the nation. Be true to your arrogant smack and beat it!
