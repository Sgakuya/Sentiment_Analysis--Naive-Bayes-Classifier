Well I have lived here my entire life (actually I lived 4 months in Philly at 18 and 1 year in Atlanta recently) and I must say that this city is the pitts for minorities. I heard from some older folks that in the 70's there were nice places to go have fun but since the Reagan administration and the rush of crack cocaine in the inners cities those places have been closed down. In my few years experience in the work force (I do administrative support) I rarely saw a black male in any of the offices I have either been a temp at or worked full time. This city sucks. But still it's better than the south because I could not stand the heat down there. This is a working town as my grandmother always said. To me, even SummerFest is dull. Downtown is just now starting to liven up with all the new stores being added on to the Grand Avenue Mall but still, I can't stand living here.
