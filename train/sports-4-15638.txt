I view Brian Dawkins as a downright prototypical safety. He plays smart. He plays fast. He plays hard. He leads his defense on the field as well as statistically. There are a couple reasons I'm not rating him a 5. First off, he's getting older and is starting to dip slightly in production (although he is probably playing smarter). Secondly, when you compare his career stats to some of the other great safeties his age he's not quite as good. At the time I'm writing this, Dawkins has 677 Tackles, 26 INTs, and 11 Fumble Recoveries. Sammy Knight has played one less season than him and has 824 Tackles (+147), 35 INTs (+9), and 12 Fumble Recoveries (+1). That's right, Knight has played a whole season less than him and got a good Pro Bowl level season's amount of production better than him. Mind you, I think Knight is a better on the field leader, too. He even has a photographic memory for crying out loud. The point is really simple. Dawkins is a great NFL starter, but he's not the greatest in history by far as a couple of you seemed to suggest. He's not even the best in the league at this time.
