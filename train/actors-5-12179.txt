I just want to say she is the best ive ever seen! she sticks with her role the whole way through the movie and dawsons creek. all you people that dont think so can suck an egg. she isnt that skinny so she isnt anorexic! i dont see how you can go about saying that someone is without knowning them. i look up to her. she thought she was never going to make it in this movie world. just as she was about to give up she got her part and was made a star. she came into my life just as i thought that about myself she has made me realize not to give up on my goals and to keep trying cause nothing is imposible. and i think we need more people in this world like her!!!!
