Man y'all must be bored. Nobody every writes about nobodies. The very fact that JJ elicits so much commentary and venom speaks for itself. Oh and by the way, not only was he McDonald's All American, McDonald's All-American high scorer and three point champ, current ACC high scoring average he is the all time NCAA foul shot champion (highest percentage) and one of the best ever three point shooters. I could go on and on. Re: the dude from Roanoke who thinks JJ is rich because he has a hoop in his yard, I say get a life. It is a old piece a junk hoop that might have cost $75 new - - 8 years and 100,000 shots on it. Not a bad investment, huh? I got a life to live. Go JJ
