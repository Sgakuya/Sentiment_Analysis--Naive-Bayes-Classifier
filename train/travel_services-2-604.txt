Very poorly laid out, not enough parking and what parking they have is all stretched out ( no parking structures here) so one will have to walk a LONG way in the hot sun. Alot of wasted space - long, large empty halls in some areas, small, extremely crowded in others. No seating to speak of. Both main terminals have very long security lines, but Terminal 1 has some of the worst I've seen (even worse than Las Vegas) mainly because the security check point is far too small (2 stations!!!!) for the number of people who need to pass through. The airport is not easy to access from the highway and requires driving on city and bay side streets to get to. Traffic is fair, but watch out for the 3 o'clock rush when the military bases let out! On the up side, their Commuter Terminal is wonderful, with easy parking right across from the terminal. Minimal lines at security and fairly good seating space. It's also a bit removed from the other two terminals and is the easiest one to access.
