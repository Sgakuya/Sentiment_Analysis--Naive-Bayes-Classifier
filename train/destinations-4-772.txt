Canada is pretty enlightened in many ways.I know quite a few Canadian people and they are all very intelligent,well educated,and most importantly:open-minded.Their culture seems quite civilized.My friends Mother lived and died there,and my friend was very impressed with the quality and affordableness of the healthcare her aged and ill Mom recieved there.They have a very LOW crime rate-yet almost everyone has guns.THAT speaks volumes!There is also some very nice scenery there,but I haven't visited Canada for about 30 years.(I kind of prefer warm places for my vacation).It is a place I'd consider moving to if the U.S. slips into facism and insanity.
