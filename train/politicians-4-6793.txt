i knew he would be at the bottom of the rateitall list now can we all please GET OFF THE POOR GUY'S BACK???!!! Since all the idiot conservative columnists and politicians have been attacking him for about a zillion dumb reasons other than the whole Chandra Levy fuss-over-nothing, he must be doing SOMETHING right! He has my sympathy---if he were not a Democrat politician, no one would give one way or the other what he did behind the bedroom door. Sorry, Gary, everyone sees you in your personal life, most of whom probably know nothing about your political career. Good luck in life! (And let's give up trying to find Chandra, it's taking valuable time!!!!!)
