While I think Rand's objectivism deserves a little more recognition in this society's victim driven, what-do-I-get-out-of it mentality, I just cannot excuse her poor writing ability. Atlas Shrugged was even worse than the Fountainhead I also have a problem with the idea that man is above nature and that humanity can rise above it and dominate it. Man is a product of nature and while we can do much to manipulate things for our benefit, we cannot conquer it. This is proven every time someone dies of lung cancer from smoking or a town is leveled by a tornado. I think a lot of our sorrow and depression in modern society is caused by this separation of humanity from nature. Also, while capitalism is proven to be a lucrative system, it is not without faults. Laissez-faire will never work because there will always be someone out there taking the whole pie and ruining it for everyone else. Just ask Ken Lay and Bernie Ebbers. Objectivism, like most philosophies has some compelling arguements and makes a strong case, however, nature abhores a vacuum and people who follow Rand's preaching tooth and nail are selling themselves short. There's a lot more out there intellectually than what this woman preached.
