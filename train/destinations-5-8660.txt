One time I realized I'd need some nicotine for a final math exam, where I couldn't leave to smoke (loyal JPS smoker for 2 years, so i went to the crappy little cornerstore where all underaged kids buy their smokes, saw skoal apple o the shelf an thought I'd give it a try, it was gross, turned my lip black for a couple days, still I was intrigued, bought an tried straight a few weeks later, pretty good, then discovered original mint, best taste ever an not nearly enough fiberglass to make gutting hurt. Tried cherry too, was reminiscent of cough syrup, and vanilla, which was good but lost its flavor too quick.
