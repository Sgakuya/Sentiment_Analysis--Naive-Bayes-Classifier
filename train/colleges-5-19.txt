The Fox School of Business and Management is one of the most interesting and innovative programs in the world. The Business School has campuses in London, Paris, Tokyo, and Rome, just to name a few. Fox also offers an outstanding value. My IMBA including expenses was approximately $32,000. I have a close friend who graduated from Harvard last year and she spent approximately $32,000 per semester, including expenses. Our base starting salaries were only about $10,000 apart and I had the opportunity to study all over the world. Temple is an excellent program and I was very proud to be part of it.
