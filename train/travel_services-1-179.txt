You have to rate based on an incident. When everything goes OK, all the airlines are perfect. Delta lost my luggage and it's been one of the worst experiences that I have ever had. So many memories lost forever. I had zero collaboration from them. Delta never cared about it. They did not try to find it. I found lately that no other airline was notified about my missing luggage. their only concern was to pay the lower possible compensation. I am, sadly, a frequent flyer, and I will walk before taking a Delta Jet again. People writing possitive comments on Delta in this page are, definitely, Delta employees.
