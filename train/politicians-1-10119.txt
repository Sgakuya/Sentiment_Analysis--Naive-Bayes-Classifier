W will go down in history as one of the worst Presidents. I won't go into detail because anyone with enough common sense already knows the details. To add to his hall of shame, Bush was one of the last world leaders to brief the press/world on the Asian Earthquake/Tsunami disaster, even Clinton made a statement days prior. W. was on vacation, yes again, in Crawford and finally made a speech promising aid, small when compared to smaller less rich countries, but I guess it's more important for W to dump Billions of $$ into Iraq a day then to help out with this disaster? All I can say is, Bush Voters pat yourselves on the back for a job well done!
