well there are some good points here about prejudice against arab countries. but it's often rather difficult to stereotype muslims as anything but violent - from egypt to afghanistan to indonesia to the philippines. but of course the whole focus of the movie was more about the rules of engagement . they didn't show the guns in the crowd in the beginning cause they wanted the audience to be in the same position as everyone except jackson - everyone who didn't actually witness firing from the crowd. and it was also to make people think about the reality of battle, conflict and politics. it's like a tom clancy version of a few good men. i agree with lala about the ending. it would've been cool to see the prosecuting attorney pick a fight with the security advisor.
