I lived in Chicago for 10 years before relocating to Florida, and I miss it a lot. It is an absolutely fantastic city. Summertime is great!! There are lots of festivals, music, and art shows. Winter is somewhat cold and long, which is the only downfall, but I've realized there's more to life than weather. There is definitely something for everyone in Chicago, no matter how young or old you are. It is a very big cosmopolitan city with a small midwestern town feel, and there are a lot of different areas to live in with beautiful architecture. My personal favorite is Old Town. It is also a very livable city, and housing is very inexpensive. The shopping is also great. Dozens of cute little boutique's on Armitage, Oak, Halsted, and Belmont. A lot of people say that Chicago tries to emmulate New York, but I feel quite the contrary. Chicago does not need to emmulate New York, because it has it's own distinct personality. It is definitely much cleaner, prettier, less expensive, friendlier, not as overwheling, and a whole lot more fun without the annoying east coast accents!! If you're into working out, try the East Bank Club. Great ammenities, and a great way to meet new people. Miss the Windy City, and can't wait to get back there!!!!
