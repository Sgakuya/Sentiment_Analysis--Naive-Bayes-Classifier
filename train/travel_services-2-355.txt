I've flown them twice...KC-San Diego, then San Luis Obispo, CA-Las Vegas... Not very friendly employees and their planes didn't seem to be maintained well. We were delayed in San Luis Obispo and no announcments were made regarding why or when. Once we boarded, the gate agent came onboard to inform us that the flight was overweight and they needed to get volunteers to give up their seats for a later flight, delaying the flight even more. I am very familiar w/ the airline industry and they should have known this prior to boarding. Once they got the needed volunteers, the captain came on the PA and informed us that the plane was still too heavy for take-off and we were gonna sit at the end of the runway and burn off the extra fuel and hopefully get us to the maximum take off weight, delaying us even more. What was supposedly an on-time departure, turned out to be almost an hour late, and no one informed us as to why until after we boarded and no apology offered. I had a connecting flight in Pheonix to Vegas and had to make a mad dash to the next gate...since the delay had shortened my connection to considerably. Once I got to the gate...turned out the connection flight was delayed as well! I understand delays, trust me...but an explantion and an apology go a long way.
