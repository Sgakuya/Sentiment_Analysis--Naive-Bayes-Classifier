The most underrated city in the United States. For all the complaining I see by some people on here, I've never been at a loss for things to do when I've been there, and I'm 25 years old. There are many good restaurants throughout the city, and the skyline has to be the most impressive of any second-tier city in the country. It's a city with Midwestern charm and livability combined with Northeastern cultural and educational attributes. On the downside, the highway system is severely inadequate for a city its size. Also, civic pride seems to be lacking, which is unfortunate because it is a very nice city overall.
