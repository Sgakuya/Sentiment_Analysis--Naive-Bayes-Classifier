Contrary to folklore and the misinformed, Harry Truman was not a memeber of the KKK, although he did freely admit that his family was of the South and had shared many of the misguided opinions of Southerners of the 19th century. Few remember that it was Truman that stood against popular opinion of the day and signed the presidential order that commanded the military to end segregation in the armed forces. Truman was a humble man, from a poor farming family. Self taught for the most part, certainly not a genius but he did command the respect and loyalty of those that served with him. This characteristic is probalby the most important aspect of his life, first as the Postmaster General, then as an enlisted soldier and later, a captain during World War I. As a state and federal representative, he was always known as a man to be trusted, honest and loyal. A truly great and historical president ' the Truman Doctrune, Berlin Airlift, use of the A bomb, desegration of the armed forces, Marshall Plan and organization of the Executive Cabinet structure we know today. Here's what Harry said reflecting on his thoughts the night he was sworn into office and of his Presidency: I was plenty scared, but scared or not, prepared or not, I promised myself one thing that evening, and in the days and nights that followed: that I'd work damned hard and try damn hard to be a good president. I think most perple will give me taht much: that I tried hard to be a good president and I hope some people will feel that I succeeded.
