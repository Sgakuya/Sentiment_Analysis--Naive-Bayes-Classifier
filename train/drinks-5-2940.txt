It doesn't get any better than this! XS Energy Drinks give you a WIDE variety from day to day! Feeling a little sick...pour a can of XS Teaberry Typhoon in a cup, microwave it and sip it nice and hot! Feeling better at lunchtime, you just may want to drink a nice cold can of the new Electric Lemon Blast, or maybe a can of Cranberry-Grape, or Citrus Blast or Tropical Blast, or....oh well! I hope you get the picture... XS Energy drink has revolutionized the Energy drink business with so many wonderfully tasting flavors...and the pure energy of B Vitamins to make my family quit coffee and soda altogether! A+++, 5 Stars and a partridge in a pear tree!
