This is typical Python. It is a collection of shorts which satirize everything about life. There are two parts which are absolute classics. The first is the sex education class. Instead of explaining the basic points about reproduction, the teacher, with the help of his female partner and on his desk in the front of the classroom, shows his class how to have sex. The second demonstrates the essence of gluttony as it shows an obese man stuffing his face at a restaurant. The conclusion of this short is worth the price of the rental. To me, this doesn't live up to the Holy Grail, but if you haven't seen it and you like Monty Python, you should check it out.
