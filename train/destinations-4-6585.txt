Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. Kansas has no mountains, no ocean, and very little geographic diversity of any kind. But don't write the state off just because it's mostly wheat fields. Sure, it might not be the most exciting destination in the U.S. to visit, but it's a great place to raise a family. It's inexpensive, it's not crowded, the people are nice, and it's centrally located so you're a short flight away from any other state in the continental U.S. Kansas City is in Missouri, but some really nice suburbs of KC are in Kansas, and some of them are right out of that movie Pleasantville (but in a good way, not a creepy repressed way). It's too bad that the recent controversy over teaching evolution in schools has to taint Kansas' image, because the vast majority of the people you'll find there are open-minded, genuine, and intelligent.
