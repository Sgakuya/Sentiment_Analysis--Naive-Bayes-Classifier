I used to be a relatively frequent Wal-Mart customer. But lately I've had several bad experiences. First of all I've come to believe that many of their brand name products are not the same as those offered in other stores. In my opinion because of the pressure Wal-Mart puts on its suppliers, some of them are shipping inferior products. Also lately I have had to return several food items (spoiled meat and freeze damaged citrus fruit). This morning I went to pick up several packages of prints from a digital camera. They did not prepare the CDs I had requested (and had a receipt for). Instead I was told that I would have to go get my smart-cards and bring them back. My reply to the clerk was that I didn't have to do anything. In fact I didn't have to come in their store.
