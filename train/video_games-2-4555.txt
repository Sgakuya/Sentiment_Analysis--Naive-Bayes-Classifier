This has to be one of the most pointless games ever made. Not only is it ridiculously boring, but for some reason it is very addictive. If you know anyone who is thinking about playing this game try to do some sort of intervention for them. Do something, get them away from it! People who play the game tend to talk about it a lot, leveling, raids, quests, lots of stuff that non-players don't understand nor care about. God forbid you get into a relationship with an EverQuest player. Your life will be based around when a raid is scheduled or something like that. No game should be this addictive. It isn't called EverCrack for nothing!
