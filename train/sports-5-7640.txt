Look at the numbers: Pippen had better stats than Jordan in every category except scoring (and that's only because he took fewer shots). Also, it was Pippen who always had to guard the other teams best player, as well as play point-forward, which must've worn him out and prevented him from putting up even better numbers. But if you want the real test, look at the Bulls when Jordan left: still a 50-win team, and one bad call away from going to the finals. Now look at the Bulls when Jordan returned and Pippen was injuried for several games: struggling to stay above .500. And that was with Rodman. Also, who came closer to winning a title without the other? Pippen, by far. I could go on, but I've made my point. One last thing: those who think Jordan's the best are brainwashed; those who know Pippen was the real reason for 6 titles know basketball. End of discussion.
