I was looking for a vehicle with more space and utility. Ironcially I was driving an RX8 and also wanted to improve my gas mileage. My sights focused on the small SUV class so I began studying the 18 different models and drove several. After statistically comparing them and driving the top rated ones, I came home with a 2005 CRV SE. It is a basic type of SUV but lends itself more to the urban/suburban driver who needs utility - the vast majority of SUV drivers actually. The ride is carlike and it has up to 72 cu ft of cargo space - more than some larger SUV's. I just got my second tank of gas and am averaging 21mpg with AC and in city driving. The power is acceptable - stats say -0 to 60 in 8.5 secs. which is no hot rod but fine really. Towing is only 1500 pounds and the 4WD is just fine for anything I would do. There are people who use these for offroad runs in Australia (saw in magazine) but I would recommend a Xterra or a Liberty it you do that a lot but beware of their MPG. If you drive little to no offroad, drive mostly on roads and need utility with light hauling (jet skis or fishing boat) then this is probably your best bet too.
