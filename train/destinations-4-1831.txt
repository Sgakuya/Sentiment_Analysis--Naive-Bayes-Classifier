Some Americans are rednecks, some are liberals, some are Christian, some are Muslim, one is the president, 51 percent over 18 years old voted for him, 48 percent didn't... people need to stop judging a country on just one factor. The government needs reform, as do most governments today, and some Americans need to be more open minded. In fact, the whole world should be a little more open minded- we need to create some unity in the world instead of just bashing other countries. The United States is powerful and many Americans, like myself, are just trying to make the world a better place, as are some Canadians, and Chinese, and on and on and on.
