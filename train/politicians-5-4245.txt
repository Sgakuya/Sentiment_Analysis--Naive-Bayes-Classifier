I'm voting for Ralph Nader because I think of all the candidates, he would be the best representation of what I'd like to see our president be. It is immaterial how my vote effects the other candidates, it is my vote to do with what I choose. Instead of Gore threatening possible Nader voters that it will be their fault if Bush wins, he should look inward to see that it's his own lack of convictions that have left people looking for a liberal alternative. If Bush wins the election I believe that this will inspire more activism throughout the country as people realize how his policies may come to play in their own lives. Go Nader!
