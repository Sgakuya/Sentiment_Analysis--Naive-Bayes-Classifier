This is a poor to average movie which definately did not live up the hype it was given here in England at least. I would even go as far to say that if Rhys Ifans' character (the funny roomate) was not in this film, then it couldn't be classed as a comedy. I would describe Julia Roberts performance as polite rather than convincing whilst Grant does nothing to dispel the theory that his acting has only one dimension. Yes, Americans visit England (even if they do have to avoid our trains and food), but I would doubt a famous film-star would fall for a bookstore owner and end up staying in a terrace. However, there are some interesting aspects to this movie. There is the portrayal of London's vibrant inner city life. The romance that blossoms between Grant and Roberts is undeniably sweet, accompanied by an equally pleasant soundtrack, whilst the pedigree of the writer (Richard Curtis) is undoubted having also penned Four Weddings and Blackadder, and it is this reason, I think, that so much was expected from this film. This time however, I would rate this gentle romantic comedy a miss.
