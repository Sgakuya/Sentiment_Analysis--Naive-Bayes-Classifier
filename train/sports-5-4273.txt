Tubby Smith is hands down the best coach in college basketball. Not just because I am a die hard UK fan do I say this, I have many reasons to back it up. Step 1 as a head coach: Recruiting! Tubby just went out and recruited maybe the best freshman class UK has ever had, and definitely the best in college hoops this season. He got three McDonalds All Americans in Rajon Rondo, Randolph Morris, and Joe Crawford. He also got Ramel Bradley from New York. Step 2: Coaching Ability!! UK plays one of the best defenses in college basketball and thats what makes them so good. With their great defense and their players athletic ability they are a top program every year. They also have a good half court offense and can beat lots of teams with their shooting. If you think he is a good coach, look at the facts. UK has been ranked in the top 10 in the RPI polls for 29 straight weeks. Thats just phenomenal. Step 3: NCAA tournament!! He has led them to the NCAA tournament in all his 7 years at UK and a National Championship in 1998 in his first season. They have also won a couple of SEC Championships under Tubby including last years. Step 4: Off the Court!! He helps raise tons of money for numerous reasearch organizations and charities in the Tubby Smith Foundation. He has raised tons of money over his years to help improve Lexington, Kentucy, and college basketball. Tubby has helped continue the tradtion of excellence in Kentucky and puts his name in a place of many greats, in Adolph Rupp, Rick Pitino, and Joe B. Hall.
