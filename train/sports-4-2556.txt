It's early. (AMENDED: lost A-Rod to Yanks, obviously a ownership limitation but lost out because front office didn't see this comming) However, Epstein should get some credit for showing that younger minds in baseball can get the job done and creativity won't kill the sport any more faster than the old fossils that work in many of the front offices on losing teams. Great find in D. Ortiz, I live in Minny and Tom Kelly's few if not only mistake was cutting Ortiz a season after he clearly showed a talent for hitting in 1997 only to make a point. DO spent a meaningless season destroying pitching in St. Lake City and set back his progression 2-3 seasons. As far as Boston is concerned, Theo will be a bust unless they win a ring. I will bet the Sox do not win a ring and it will not be because of Theo.
