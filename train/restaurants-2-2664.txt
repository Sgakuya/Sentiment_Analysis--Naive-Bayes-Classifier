Anybody remember this song from childhood...EVerybody SING...McDonalds is your kind of place, hamburgers in your face, french fries between your toes, (something something) up your nose, coca cola down your back you want your money back McDonalds is your KIND OF PLAAAACE! Then there's that other old kid standby...great big gobs of greasy grimey gopher guts...oh, kind of the same thing when you think of it (tee hee). I agree with Solenoid DH, definately NOT the stuff gourmet hamburgers are made of. I can't think of a thing they do someone else doesn't do much better. YET, like Coke, they've managed to advertise themselves into being a permanent icon of the American culture.
