What a bunch of idiots you all are. You know what ticks me off the most? When people blame the teams coach. Herb is giving them real good plays but they just sometimes dont execute them. He is not on the court rebounding for them or shooting for them. It is the players that make the play. He can teach them anything, but they just have perform it on the court. Is it the coaches fault if they miss a 3 or a 2?? If you all honestly think that.... then you have nothing else in life to do but sit there and blame other people for stuff that they are not responsible for. If I remember correctly last year NC State made it to the Sweet 16. You all are blaming herb because he is not another valvino. And your also blaming him because were not Number 1. Well you guys have alot of problems.
