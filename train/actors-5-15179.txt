Sure we all remember him as Will Robinson, that affable kid Lost In Space. I caught a bit of him doing a standup on some SciFi channel show in-around '93 and thought I'm glad to see he's doing well for himself. Liked his POV as well. A month after John Denver's death I became aware of his Barnes & Barnes work as a musician. It wasn't until I heard The Ballad of William Robinson that I had any inkling that the man was such a great musician, singer and songwriter. The song rolled around with me till summer of 2002 when I bought his Dying to Be Heard CD. Wow. Now I have 6 of his CDs, and not a stinky song in the lot. He's also a nice guy who responds to people via his guestbook on www.BillMumy.com
