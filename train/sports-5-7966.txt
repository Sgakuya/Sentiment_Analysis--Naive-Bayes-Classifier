Hi, I am dissapointed read all of the terrible comments made about Allen Iverson. They are unfair and wrong. Most of the people said they only watched him for about 10 minutes which does not do him justice, Iverson is one of the greatest players in the NBA, he is exciting to watch although I will admit that he has a few bad games you shouldn't take anything away from him. Some of the comments were good to read, like 1 which said this guy shows more guts than a world war 1 soilder.... Maybe not a world war 1 soilder but he does have a lot of guts going out every night playing his heart out just to please his fans. So everyone who said bad things about him should realy re-think what they said. JAKE
