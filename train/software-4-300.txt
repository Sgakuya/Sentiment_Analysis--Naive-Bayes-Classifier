This is a very poor site, because there's more to it than just 'Linux', and which distrobution you use is going to have a major impact on your experience. If you've not used it before, check out Mandrake... if you're looking to set up an incredibly stable server, you might be more in the market for Debian. Avoid Lindows like the plague; you can generally get the programs from their 'Click-N-Run' thing for free elsewhere! In general, most people aren't going to want to run Linux on their desktops at the moment, but it makes for solid servers, and geekier folks with an extra machine will have a lot of fun playing with it. And remeber--free software is not about 'free as in beer', it's about 'free as in speech'. Much of it just happens to also be 'free as in beer'.
