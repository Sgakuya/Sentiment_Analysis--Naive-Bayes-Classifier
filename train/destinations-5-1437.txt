France is not the enemy, nor do the French people, who are friendly and hospitable (I know, I've been there!) deserve the rude, ignorant comments that are posted here. In light of the post-war chaos in Iraq and the lack of WMD, I believe the French were right all along- we had no business going to Iraq for the sake of stopping terrorism. As far as the real war on terrorism, France has been top-notch. The French intelligence has consistently rooted out terrorists, most recently Christain Ganczarski, an Al-Qaeda operative from Germany who was arrested June 2 in after returning to Paris. France will prove itself to be a real ally in the war on terrorism with time, and all the fools who revealed their stupidity with their comments on this site will have found a new scapegoat to blame their fears on I'm sure.
