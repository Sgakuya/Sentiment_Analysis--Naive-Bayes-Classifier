If I were to write a list of all the restaurants I know in categories of how much I liked them, Denny's would fall into the Last-ditch effort, it's midnight and no one else is open category. The one I choose to frequent is a little cleaner and a little friendlier, but that's not saying too much, unfortunately. The food isn't that great, but hey, it's midnight, so I've got to give the cook at least some credit, I suppose. You're better off ordering the breakfast items than any of the dinner items, THAT I've learned. The Lumberjack Slam is great--what they lack in quality, they make up in quantity. Even at my hungriest stage, I could barely finish one of those. I give credit to the Denny's I go to--at least the waitresses there are sweet, unlike other Denny's locations I've been to. Nevertheless, I'd rather go to Wendy's for their late-night pickup window for a post-midnight snack.
