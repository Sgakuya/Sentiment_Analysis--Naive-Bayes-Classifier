Perhaps I'm partial because I grew up in St. Louis (and suffered through the years of mediocre play by the old football Cardinals) but the Rams RULE! I think they are the most dominant team playing right now. Their offense is unstoppable and the defense is so much better than last year- it's not giving up as many points and is easing the burden on the offense. They have such talented players, from Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce on offense to Aeneas Williams, London Fletcher and Grant Wistrom on defense. They are all truly a united team set out to WIN! They totally deserved the Super Bowl win in 1999 and I'm praying they get back there this year- GO RAMS!!!
