I have to say that I love this video. And Coldplay for breaking the stale mold of videos having to have non-stop action, corny visual effects, and a storyline(if you can even call it as such) that has little-to-nothing to do with the song itself. Yellow is oft-critisized for it's 'boringness' and 'unoriginality' but I think those claims are unfounded. Well they are in my case. Whenever I see said video I am touched by it's sincere simplicity. He is saying that his love is so strong, he doesn't need a lot of action, he doesn't need flashy, he doesn't need any of that, walking down this beach, comparing his loved one to the beautiful stars that surround him. And the sincerity in that is..beautiful. I was actually almost enthralled by this video and it's subtle symbolism. He may lose track sometimes and look away, but he will always come back, always be focused on his love. Coldplay is very simply a wonderful band, and this song reflects their style and substance very aptly. It still makes me cry, to think of someone loving someone so much that they would 'bleed themselves dry' and thinking that the stars shown for this one person. Don't we all want to be loved like that..
