great features with the dish 301 reciver! it has all kinds of features like: interactive tv.... you can get weather forcasts, horoscopes, tv news, celeb stuff, you can even play games on this thing like bowling! of couse you can also check headlines and sports scores. This reciver has a full menu system with options such as timer recording and vcr control... nice when your way and you do not want to set up an external vcr timer! also this reciver has a caller ID so you dont have to get up to your phone while you are watching a movie! good for all you couch potatoes out there! or those who want an extra convienice. Now heres the main part... the programming... it has a farily good value and it has about the same lineup as directv ( directv has more PPV and more music and sih has more interactive and HDTV-hi defintition programming and slightly more kids shows.) they even out to be the same... but dish network has lower prices,service, and flexablity... directv has better overall programming and variety... and to top it all off they are in the process or even merged!!! I just hope that they continue to be marketed seperatly and to have the same or better quality. I like dish and directv both abotut the same!!!
