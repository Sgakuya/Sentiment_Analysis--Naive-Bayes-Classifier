Among the best museums I've been to. Very interesting and a part of history that changed America forever. The Lorraine motel was converted into a museum. After the shooting, business declined rapidly and soon was sold off to preservation groups in 1982. The museum as we know it today was opened in 1991. Tour takes about 2 hours. You walk through passageway that takes you through the history of the civil rights struggle in chronological order. You'll pass by the actual Montgomery city bus used in the 1950s (you can sit at the front of the bus and a recorded message tells you to move to the back!), a replica of the diner sit-ins used during the early 60s, and garbage truck representing the strike of black workers in Memphis of the mid 60s. Then it ends at room 307, right beside where MLK stayed. The room where MLK stayed (#306) has been recreated and the wreath still stands. Room 307 has been transformed into part of the museum passageway in which you can peer through a built-in window into room 306. But this is not the end of the tour. Now you leave the motel and walk across the street into an underground tunnel and then into the building Earl Ray shot the bullet. You can take the Memphis trolley to get there. Just to make you aware, there are lots of beggars in the area. Highly recommended.
