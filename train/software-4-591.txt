DVD X Show is a great piece of software. There are a couple of things that could be improved:- 1 - there is no ability to automatically scramble selected pictures into random sequences - you have to scramble them manually. 2 - cannot easily override zoom/pan/transition time defaults once a file of pictures has been opened - you has to individually set the timings on a picture-by-picture basis 3 - you have to manually select music backgrounds to suit length of presentation. The software should tailor the show to match the selected music, even to the point of slide duplication or elimination, similar to how Sony's picture package does it..
