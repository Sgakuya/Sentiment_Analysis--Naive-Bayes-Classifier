To the Gevalia naysayers..READ THE FINE PRINT!!Gevalia holds no secrets from its customers. Everything is in the FINE PRINT. It tells you that future shipments will follow, credit cards will be charged for future shipments etc. You can customize your account by setting your own shipping intervals, making product changes, changing your method of payment such as removing your credit card and being billed. It's all in the fine print folks.
