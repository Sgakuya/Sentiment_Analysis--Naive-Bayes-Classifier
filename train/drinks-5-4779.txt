I love all of the positive and negative comments on Dr. Pepper. They're so funny to read. It's probably my favorite drink of all time, although I wonder if they've changed the formula in the last 20 years. It always tasted slightly better when I was a wee little one. It went well with Taco Bell...another favorite taste from my youth that has changed over time. Dr. Pepper is the first American bottled pop/soda. It was created in a soda shop in the 1800s by mixing a bunch of fruit flavored syrups together. It is not cherry flavored. It is not pepper flavored. And no, it doesn't cause cancer. It is simply a fruit concoction. I'm not sure how you can't like the taste. In fact, I've never tasted a soda/pop that I don't like. It's hard not to like sugar water.
