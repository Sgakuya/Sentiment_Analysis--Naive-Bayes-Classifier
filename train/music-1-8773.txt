Today I have a topic I am an expert on: how much Jimmy Fallon sucks. Who decided this guy was funny? They sure didn't ask me. Now, we all know SNL has sucked for years now, and I blame it on Jimmy Fallon. Even the seasons before he was around. His suckitude is so great that it transcends time and space.Now, to be a comedian, you have to be funny. Jimmy Fallon seems to think that being a comedian consists of mugging to the camera every second he is on it. And he's just got this smarmy, awful smile that just screams I'm funny, really! Look at me! He did the Weekend Update too. He tried, anyway. Not to say any of the jokes are good to begin with, but any that had a chance at a chuckle are butchered by his awful delivery. He cracks up laughing all the time at his own jokes. That is the worst thing you can possibly do when you tell jokes for a living. In fact, he does it in all the sketches he is in too. I don't see why he cracks up, either, the writers on that show suck. And he seems to think he is the next Adam Sandler and sings some awful songs (at least a few of Sandler's were funny). I heard one on the radio, and needless to say, I would rather listen to Hey Ya! on a two hour loop. This is not a complement to Hey Ya! either. I hate that song with the burning fury of a thousand suns. In conclusion, up yours, Jimmy Fallon. I hope you die.
