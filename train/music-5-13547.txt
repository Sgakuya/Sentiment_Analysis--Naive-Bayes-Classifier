Eminem has flow, can stick to a subject, is lyrically on point, and has the greatest production with Dr. Dre. He rhymes about real life situations. Some of the lyrics are what people call demeaning but guess what?? Life isn't perfect. 80% of the stuff he talks about runs through our minds atleast once in our lifetime and he is one of the few people to have the balls to say it. How many songs can one make about sex, diamonds, and money?? Not too many beofre it starts to get old. That's why Eminem is successful, because he keeps it real. Much success to Em in the future. On this CD, I especially like the track Remember Me with RBX and Sticky Fingaz. This album is a must have.
