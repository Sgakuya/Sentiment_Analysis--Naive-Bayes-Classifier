Unbeleivable! This is a masterpiece of computer gaming! It's so addictive I can't stop playing it! At first I thought the original Sims was the best strategy, even though I don't even think of it as a stategy, and I thought Oh, thats not worth my $30 . Then I bought it, and I was wowed once again. Here is a games that has no goals what-so-ever, and its limitless the gaming communities never stop making new items, skins, and roof, flooring, and carpet textures. The first time I played the original I made a Sim who had the same personality (according to my friends) and remotely looked like me. It scared the crap out of me, I lost my job due to a computer game addiction (very similar to real life except I didn't lose my job), all my plants died because I didn't have enough money to hire a gardener and I was too lazy to even water them myself, let alone flush the toilet! (That last part about not flushing the toilet bears no similarity to me what-so-ever, I am capable and do flush my toilet.) So even if you are not a big computer game fan buy this game and the expansion its worth the money. It'll put a smile on your face and give nightmares about what could happen if you did this when you sleep.
