I attended Temple from 1978 - 1983. I found it to be a great experience. Being a Philadelphian, I liked the idea of staying in the city. I was a commuter and can attest that back then campus life was kind of flat (dry campus back then). The neighborhood was quite beaten down back then, but I never experienced a single incident of crime. I used to have more problems dealing with drunken schlubs around the Penn Campus and the Great Northeast. I had a knife pulled out on me in cosmo center city, so who knows (disarmed him too -- I was stupid drunk at the time). Temple is a big-league campus, a leader in academics witha a med school, law school, dental school, and its own hospital. The professors (I was a biology major) were talented and cared about the students. Quality of opposite sex was fair. I met some nice women there, but as I said before, the campus life was marginal back then. A real plus was that Temple had great intercollegiate and Intramural Programs. Even though I didn't have a scholarship, I participated on the rowing team for 4 years and was a member of the school's College Bowl team, which was one of the best in the country. From what I have seen in recent years is the campus is much prettier now. For the $100-200K you could pay for 4 years at Penn, you can get just as good an education at Temple, for a magnitude less. Go Owls!!!
