KIRK IS MY FAVORITE AS WELL. HE HAS HIS BAD DAYS BUT THERE ARE THOSE GOOD DAYS THAT STAY IN YOUR MIND. HE IS THE BEST AT GETTING UP AND DOWN THE COURT BEFORE ANYONE ELSE. HE IS GREAT AT DEFENSE AND IS GREAT WITH THEM THREE POINTERS. HE IS SMOOTH AND QUICK, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM AGAIN TOO. I THINK HE WILL GO FAR AND HE WILL DO WELL IN THE NBA, ALONG WITH MY NICK. I LOVE WATCHING THEM ASSIST EACH OTHER, THEY PLAY GREAT TOGETHER LIKE NONE I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. KIRK IS SO FAST, WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT MAN ON HIS TEAM . . . SAME WITH NICK. HOPE THEY DO WELL. GOOD LUCK KIRK, HOPE TO SEE YOU WINK AT ME AGAIN SOMEDAY. :) . . . MICHELLE (COME BACK TO HUTCH, KS)
