Heres the dish, I work at CEC, been working there for about a month now. First off, I dont know where people get off saying the pizza sucks and the food sucks and blah blah blah...I think the pizza is delicious, borderline addicting.I think it's better then pizza hut. The problem here might be one thing, the pizza tastes good fresh and hot, but when it's left sitting out, it can be quite nasty. I've bussed enough tables full of left out pizza, it looks down right unedible. So if there is a problem with the pizza at your CEC, it may be that the people supost to be running them arent getting them as soon as thier out of the oven. We keep them under heat lamps, so it shouldn't be too cold. Second, if you dont like pizza, order something else! We have a salad bar with a huge array of stuff, even pasta salad! Sandwiches, wings, and when all else fails we even have alcohol! I will agree that prices are a little steep, but at least it's quality. We usualy have 1-3 people working in the kitchen, and thats on a busy day, so don't complain that your order is taking too long..do you want it done right, or crappy. I've done everything from kid check, run/bus, parties, and Chuck himself. Were working for you, the consumer, most of us no more then min wage. And all the tip I get is when someone leaves change on the table from thier dinner. Think about that next time your out to dinner at CEC.
