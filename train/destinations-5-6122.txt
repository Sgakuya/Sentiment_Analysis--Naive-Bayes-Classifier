The people are all really cool here! great food, home grown values, and the people are down to earth. i love the mild climate and the bluegrass mountains. yeah, it snows here, but not as bad as an ohio or michigan, or even my state, trashachutsetts. i spent 4 summers and 2 winters here with my relatives and now i have a full-time job and i am looking for anyway to get out of trashachutsetts and move here. although i cant compare it to any other state, but compared to trashachutsetts, life here is nice and slow, laid-back, people are nice, girls are cool, and cost of living is way cheaper than livin in wack boston.
