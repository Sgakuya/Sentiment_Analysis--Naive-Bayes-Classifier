RIPOFF! My experience has been terrible. Edward Jones brokers are usually not even CFPs (certified financial planners), and generally only have SALES training. Their primary duty is to SELL funds that are usually mediocre investments. Do NOT transfer ANY of your funds, accounts, or write a single check to an Edward Jones broker until you have IN WRITING exactly how much you'll pay to invest in ANYTHING they offer. This is because you'll be paying LOADS (ie, commissions) to the broker "advisor". Go with Vanguard or Fidelity. Go to suzeorman.com to read info re load funds. (disclaimer: I don't work for Suze Orman, Fidelity, or Vanguard.)
