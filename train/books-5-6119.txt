If you are perfectly fine with your weekly (guilt) trip to McDonald's, Wendy's, KFC and the like you probably should not read this book. Schlosser is exhaustive in his coverage of the fast food industry. He covers how things work at the restaurants themselves, the dirty (and I do mean dirty) little secrets behind the beef, fries, etc., economic realities, horror stories from slaughter house cleaning crews and numerous other topics. This book made me seriously curtail my fast food consumption. I feel a little guilty for not having quit entirely (but only a little;). This is the type of Non-Fiction book that could be one's first experience inot the genre. Extremely entertaining and informative.
