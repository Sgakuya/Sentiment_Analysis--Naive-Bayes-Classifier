I'll give Clinton an extra star because there were no steps taken to try Ken Starr and his supporters for treason. Their actions(over a blow job!)were no less than an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States,their guilt is too obvious,since they left a hundred-plus million paper trail,if anyone thinks the government was not run right during the Clinton yrs,they need look no farther than the majority of Republikans during that time,or the vile,paranoid,holier-than-thou, the life sentence for drug dealer proclaiming,nazi pill-popping,skirt chasing talkshow hosts who told Americans what their opinions should be and the amazing thing is,people believed them,sort of like people believed Hitler.
