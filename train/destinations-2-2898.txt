I want to give New York City a 3 but i cant cause their are a lot of things i didnt like bout the city! True theirs a lot of things to see but a theirs a lot you might want to avoid!!!1. i really hated new yorks subway sytems!!!the systems are dirty and theres a crap-load of graffiti on and in the trains as well as the tunnels!!!!!!!!!2. the air is really hot and muggy and full of pollution. if u are in a stroe in dwontown, as soon as you step out u feel the sudden air pollution and mugginess which i found extremely annoying!!!if u go to new york just visit!!!i dont think new york deserves to be rated all the way up here!!and those of u who havent been to new york!!U all shouldnt be rating this city!!!!
