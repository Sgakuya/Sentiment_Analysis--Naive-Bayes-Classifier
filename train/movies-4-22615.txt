I have been an X-Men fan for years and when I had scene the trailers for this movie I was given a low expectation, however, when I saw the movie it proved me wrong. This tale touches the viewer in a rare way, much like the comic. Here you are watching this movie which is done, for the most part, in a comic book 'storyboardesque' format, and finding that it moves you more than movies that try to be moving. This was a good movie for couples to go see. It represents the agression that men have and shows the balance for love that some viscious men possess, much like myself. Wolverine is the chief character for this. He is brutal and trusts no one, but he is in love with Dr. Jean Grey and feels a fatherly love for Rogue, just like the comic. Wolverine is the impossibility, but the necessary element in the X-Men. As for the type casting I thought it was very well done. Hugh Jackman took the character and personality of Wolverine out of the 'old school' comics and threw it on the screen. I personally did not like Wolverine's costume, and hair, design. He looked more like a fuzzy Elvis crossed with the late Freddy Prince. Famke Jensen brings her tough sensuality to the film, and she proves more and more how much of a genuine actress she is. Halle Berry was perfect, but again the costume and hair design needed more imaginative workup, in my opinion. As for the X-Men character cast I would have preferred to do without Toad and have Night Crawler there in replacement. If they use Gambit in number two I'm going to be sick. I suggest that everyone see this movie, X-Men fans and non-fans alike.
