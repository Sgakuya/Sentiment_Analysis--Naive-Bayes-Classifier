This book is hard going to finish. It is rambling and repetitive, and since my college German skills are long gone, I had to read it in English. A translation makes a hard reading book doubly hard. That being said, the book reveals the thought of the author and the mindset of Teutonic Superiority vis a vis the peoples to the East. The Jews are from the East, and show super solidarity, according to the author. What always startled me, is that the leaders of the Western Powers NEVER read this work. It is all there. The entire strategy of the War. The entire thought processes of what is coming next. Hitler came from Austria-Hungary and he considered that state as a traitor to the old Teutonic Knight style German cause. The conflict between Teuton and Slav in this part of the world has embroiled this area for the last 1000 years. Review the Battle of Tannenberg (Gruenwald) as far back as 1410 is an example. The Fall of Koenigsburg, in East Prussia, and Breslau, in Silesia, in 1945 is almost apocalyptic for its savagery and far-reaching implications. We must indict the leaders of the West for (1) the dreadful Treaty of Versailles, which gave Hitler his election platform, and (2) for deluding themselves that Hitler would honor the various scraps of paper on which the West placed so much reliance. His book would have easily informed them of his unreliability. A little enforcement of their treaty rights, byt the West, in the mid 1930's, would have toppled Hitler easily.
