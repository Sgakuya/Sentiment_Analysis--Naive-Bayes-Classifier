Baz Luhrman does have a future as a director. Yes, there are parts of this movie that are well-shot. But the actors are clearly over their heads with the Shakespearean text. Why does everybody yell through this movie? Why does every waking moment have to be filled with blaring uber-cool soundrack music? The fast cuts and quick scene shifts were supposed to create an exciting atmosphere but I thought it made the story more complicated than it had to be. However, I am pleased that the director though enough of shakespeare to make this film. Why did he have to turn it into a long music video? This movie had some good scenes but I expected better.
