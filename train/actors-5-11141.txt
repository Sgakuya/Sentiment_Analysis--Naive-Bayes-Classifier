Nicole has been in the acting business for 20 years and it shows. She has worked incredibly hard and is known professionally for always being on time, undemanding and dependable within the acting profession. I think the best work she ever did was Bangkok Hilton a wonderful video if you can get a hold of it. Check out the rating for it at www.imdb.com. Lastly, Nicole deserves every success she is now enjoying. For too long she was written off as Mrs Tom Cruise and declined parts so that she wouldn't be away from Tom and her children. Nicole can take on anything from drama, to comedy to a musical and she is a class act and a down to earth person with stong family values.
