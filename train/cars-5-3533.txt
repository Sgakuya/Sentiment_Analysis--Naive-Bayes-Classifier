I bought a new Pathfinder XE in 1993, and over the years I've put almost 100,000 miles on it, including several cross-country trips, some off-road driving, and lots of commuting to work in the city. In all that time I've never had a single major problem. The Pathfinder has been perfect for me in almost every way. I've moved a lot, so the extra space has really come in handy for hauling large amounts of stuff. I have a dog I take with me almost everywhere, and the ability to put the back seat down gives him a lot of room when he's riding with me. I treat the car very poorly, but it doesn't seem to mind. The only thing I've ever needed to repair is the radio, which started having wiring problems about a year ago. Overall, this car has greatly exceeded my expectations.
