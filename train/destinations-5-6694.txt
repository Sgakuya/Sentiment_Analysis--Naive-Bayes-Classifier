I can't believe all of the negative comments about this state. These people either have never been or haven't been there long enough to judge. Granted, Indiana does have it's number of hicks and some backwards people...but hello! Every state does! I live in the Northeast now and believe it or not, there are hicks here too! I can't believe the number of comments about rudeness in Indiana either. Midwesterners are some of the nicest people in the country. Indiana is a great place to raise children too. Growing up in a small town there, I loved all aspects of my childhood. Fresh country air, lots of land to run around on, close family and friends (although living in a small town also means everyone knows you business). I also lived in Indianapolis for a while and that city is so underated! There is plenty to do. Overall I think Indiana is a beautiful state. They are not stuck in the 1950's (although maybe a few of the older generation might be, but so what...they're nice people with good morals), they are not hateful toward minorities (I'm sure there are some people that are...once again every state has hateful people), and they certaintly aren't the armpit of America. For anyone who thinks Indiana sucks, just check out some places like Turkey Run State Park, Indiana Dunes National Rec. area, many other state parks, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, the Motor Speedway, downtown Indy and some of the posh martini bars, Bloomington, the country stores and antiques of the Amish region, the Covered Bridge Festival, the Feast of the Hunters Moon, I could go on and on.
