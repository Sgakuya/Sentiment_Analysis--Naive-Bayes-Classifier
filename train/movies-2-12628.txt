I also so Bewitched on a plane, and I'll say this - it beats sitting in your plane seat staring ahead for two hours. Barely. I actually thought Bewitched tried to be mildly creative. As opposed to just remaking the classic TV show, the movie recounts the story of a fictional remaking of the show, with the added twist of the noname actress chosen to be Samantha, actually being a witch in real life. Kind of a cute idea, but it just doesn't work very well. There were exactly two laugh out loud moments in this movie, and I still think Nicole Kidman is an incredible actress and Will Ferrell is pretty damn funny. It's just that the whole thing together doesn't work very well.
