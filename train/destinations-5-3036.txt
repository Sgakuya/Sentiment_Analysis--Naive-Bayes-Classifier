This is my favorite American city to visit. I spent a whole week here once and did differentt things everyday. I left my heart in San Fransisco may sound very cliche but it is very true. It's one of those places that your sad to leave when you depart. San Fran has so much character and atmosphere. It's one of those places you see in pictures and has that unmistakable look all it's own. So many neighborhoods to explore, very scenic with the bay and incredibly steep hills, and lovely archetecture with a style all it's own. If you venture deep into the neighborhoods there is an amazing array of food choices. You can eat well in this town and just about every meal I had here was above average. San Fran has a very international world city feeling about it and I think it's the most sophistacated city out west. There are great parks here to enjoy, you could easily spend a whole day exploring Golden Gate Park. Walking across the Golden Gate bridge is one of the most exhilerating things I've ever done and the view from the bridge is breathtaking. I love San Fransisco and I feel it is a city that one could repeatedly visit and not get tired of it. If you rated this city low you are either just generally negative anyway, or lame, or intollerant, or you simply just wern't trying hard enough, your loss though...... San Fransisco is fantastic.
