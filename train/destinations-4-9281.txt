As a natural wonder, Dunn's River Falls has got to be both one of the most aesthetically pleasing and accessible. By accessible I mean it is not too far from many of the Island's all-inclusive resort locations. And with a careful footing, and a little confidence you, too, can 'survive' Dunn's. (shirt logo) For those who are not too aware of it, you basically walk down a long and winding waterfall by foot. The waterfall leads to a beautiful secluded beach. The two caveats I'd offer are the following: One, the waterfall is not for the faint of heart- it's not really steep in terms of the actual steps you climb down- but it is very slippery, so you should have some good sandals or waterproof shoes, preferably ones that give you a good footing. Secondly, for those who do not like being bombarded by locals offering to sell their handicrafts, I suggest walking as fast as you can past the park entrance, since the way the park is arranged (not by chance I presume) all tourists are forced to walk through a long gauntlet of vendors who are experts at capturing your attention with all their 'cheap' handicrafts. And if you have to wait for a tourist bus- which incidentally is frequently late, presumably to allow you time to sample the local fares, beware the vendors. As cheap as their products seem, you may end up paying more than you bargained for, and trust me, you will be approached by many.
