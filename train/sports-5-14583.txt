LT was (and still is) one bad dude, but could he play football. He was an unstoppable and relentless force for the Giants. Barely working out in the offseason and certainly not taking care of his body, he had unmatched natural ability. He was an incredible athlete. I remember a story from when he was at UNC which pretty much sums him up. He was watching some pick-up basketball and wanted to play, but they wouldn't let him (maybe, they were in the middle of a game...I couldn't imagine telling LT that he couldn't play). What did he do? He went onto the court and tour down the rim so that no one else could play. An amazing athlete and a mean guy.
