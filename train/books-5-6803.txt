A masterpiece. Asimov's Foundation books will tell you more about political science than you will learn in most courses on the subject. The plot parallels Gibbon's The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire (Asimov's inspiration for the Foundation Books). Concepts such as the balance of power, the use of religion as a political tool, economic colonization, the struggle between empires, and the oscillation between democratic, oligrarchial and tyrannical political systems are explored via narrative development rather than a dry recitation of facts and theories. In other words, it's fun to read (a lot more than a textbook), and you'll learn a lot more than you might in class. As one writer noted below, the characters are 'cardboard'; these are, fundamentally, novels of ideas rather than action or character (the later novels have more complex characters, but the ideas aren't as good). Foundation complements the Hitchhiker's Guide very nicely; Foundation explores the possibilities of the social sciences (especially politics), while The Guide focuses on philosophical questions and technological possibilities.
