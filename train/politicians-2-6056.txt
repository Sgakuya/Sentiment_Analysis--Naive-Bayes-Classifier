Tough on terrorism-great. Horribly wrong on personal freedom and civil liberties. By the definitions that Mr. Ashcroft supports, common petty criminals, people who hold different views than the mainstream on certain events and issues, and basically anyone who dares to excercise his or her First Amendment right to speak out against perceived government injustices of any kind, among others, can be labeled a TERRORIST and stripped of their Constitutional rights!! We need to CLARIFY some things, Mr. Ashcroft, and stop the Nazi police state tactics against ordinary US citizens. Concentrate on finding, apprehending, and prosecuting the REAL terrorists and those who aid them.
