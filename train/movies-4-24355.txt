Paycheck delivered. I like movies where they use the manipulation of time as a theme. Paycheck reminded me of the movie Memento, where the character must reconstruct recent events despite having an affliction which destroyed his short term memory. In Paycheck, Ben Affleck plays a charachter form the future who does corporate espionage and has his memory of the events erased through a medical procedure. There was also some elements borrowed from Minority Report. In all, a very entertaining movie definitely worth renting. Though Mr. Affleck has been maligned as the ass-end half of Bennifer and his Lou Gehrig-like streak of stinkers like Gigli, this one was actually quite good for Uncle Ben.
