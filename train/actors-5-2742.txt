From reading the other comments it looks as if everyone has put into words better than I ever could all of Mr. Spacey's undeniable attractions and I do agree he has, in a large part, been under appreciated but that is all changing. His rise to deserved recognition has been well earned. I think he has shown us only the tip of the iceberg as far as his talents go. Nothing in such a long while has excited me so much as the anticipation of where he'll next take our imaginations on film and stage. I know his body of work when all is said and done will be ranked above all that have come before him. (And if anyone that works for him should happen to read this will you please ask him to do one really romantic role just for the heck of it? - there just isn't enough old fashioned romance in the world anymore.)
