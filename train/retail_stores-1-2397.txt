Farmer Jack's managers think the customers care about the freshness of the food so much so that they're willing to wait forever in line because the store's too cheap to give employees hours to do their jobs. They cast a limit of 28 hours to do a job and if you help a customer who asks a question or wants something when its time to leave the store management write the employee up and docks them for time over. The customers are not number 1 28 hours and that's it not 28 hours and 5 minutes that's number 1. I used to have them page me on the pa system telling me to leave when I went to my locker to get my coat...I was a newcomer making all of 7 bucks an hour so the 5 minutes may have cost them a quarter at most.
