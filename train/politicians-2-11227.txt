She was my senator until I recently moved from Arkansas. She used to go by the name Lambert but changed over to Lincoln later on. It worked well for her. She had lost when she was a Lambert. I wrote her one time about something of real concern to me. She wrote back and referred to me as Ms.________. Since I'm not a woman, it didn't set well being called Ms., but I went ahead and read what she had to say. Her actions later on went totally against what she wrote me. I don't want to give her the lowest rating because that should be reserved for the truly loathesome senators (and there are some much worse than Lincoln) but I wouldn't vote for her if she was running for mayor of Hooterville.
