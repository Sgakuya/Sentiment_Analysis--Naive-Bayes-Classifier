Recently opened an AmSouth account at a nearby branch. All went well, until... we ran into their unusual banking policy. My wife went grocery shopping and she wasn't sure if there was enough money for getting cash back, but she rationalized that if there wasn't enough money the debit request would have been declined (like our Bank of America account does). Transaction went through like butter. When she got home she gave me the reciept to enter into Quicken, that's when I realized she would overdraw the account by $8.23 when the transaction cleared. The next morning I deposited $200 only to find out that I had already incurred $60 in fees. My account balance was positive and the previous night's grocery transaction had not yet been processed by the bank. The bank's explanation was that my available balance (which includes pending transactions) was negative. I asked to see in the AmSouth Customer Agreement where they could charge OD fees on the a negative available balance rather than the actual balance. They couldn't find it, but said that there was no mistake. I asked why the debit authorization was approved and they said that they a customer friendly policy (Ha!) that would allow overdrafts up to $500 - but of course there was a OD fee for each item. In closing, at no time as my actual balance ever been negative, yet I received $60 in overdraft fees! This has got to be illegal.... Is there a class action lawsuit out there I can join?
