Camelot, the developer of the enjoyable Hot Shots Golf for the Sony Playstation, first assisted Nintendo with the original Mario Golf back on the Nintendo 64. Now, the sequel surpasses the original with many features of note. The control mechanic is the easiest that a golf game has. You can go for a simple shot with just two button presses, or go for four if you wish to add backspin or forespin. You can even taunt your opponents with some hilariously scripted lines from the Mario universe. The graphics are just great--smooth, clean, and vibrantly-colored. Animations are smooth and well done--and there are some utterly hilarious celebrations and animations of disappointment, especially from some of the more quirky characters. Numerous game modes pepper the proverbial landscape, including coin golf, ring golf (where you must shoot your ball through the rings) and the challenging Character Match--which is used to unlock an array of secret characters.
