I gave it a 4-star and I really, really fell I need to qualify that. I've been a Brewer's fan since I was 6 years-old. (Born in '73).My baseball hero's? Gantner, Cooper, Molitor, Young, Fingers, Ogilve, Yost, and my favorite whose name was ironed onto a store-bought jersey by my my mom when I was 9, Stormin' Gorman Thompson. Anyway, that said. I popped the champaign along with many other MLB fans when the Brew Crew was sold buy the ****'* daughter that owned the team. C'Mon, did anyone really beleive Wendy was in charge? No, really. No, under penalty of having your butt kicked, did you really beleive she was in charge? I'm giving my team 2 more years. With the greatest farm club in the history of baseball (OK, arguably), there has to be something to work with. If the new owner is serious, with the revenue of Miller Park, of fielding a competetive team, it souldn't take long. Especially considering the huge amount of cap room. Gimme something to work with. I left Wisconsin over 11 years ago. I'll never bail on my Pack, but I need some hope, even a little, to remain a member of the True Blue Brew Crew. I cheered for the Red Sox, but would rather cheer them on against the Yankees than switch loyalties.
