I loved it when I first read it at age 12, and I still love it as an adult. An amazing compilation of European myth and contemporary history into a fantasy epic, unlike anything else, anywhere. A lot of the mythology is from the Nibelungenlied (the ring, the sword, the hero... if you are familiar with Wagner you will see the relation) but Tolkien assembles these universal archetypes in a new and beautiful way. Also interesting to me is that while he claimed that there was no contemporary allegory, he did write the book during the darkest days of WWII: you can see echoes throughout (Saruman--the one with the golden tongue, who could persuade anyone of anything with his voice alone; the gathering darkness over Middle Earth, with only a few islands of light (the Shire, Rivendell); the Orcs of Mordor goose-stepping out into Europe...)
