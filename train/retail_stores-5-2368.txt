Here are a few honest opinions...If you just want to buy a few items go to 7-eleven. They have big baskets to save big $$$$. The company does not cater to the welfare individual, that is the only way that the state has the program set up. The reasoning for not taking debit or credit cards is cost. Banking institutions are raping whoever they can, and Winco will not be one of them.By the way, the next time , if there is a next time because I really don't think you will go back, lucky for them seems that you are a very unhappy person take some cash. Yes Winco is non-union, who really cares..all of the drivers are Teamsters and they understand the companies long term goal. They do take care of their employees, and by the way, the benifits are better than the union, they pay above the union scale, and the only good thing about the union, they protect the jobs of employees that always seem to be getting into trouble or have a lack of work ethic. Winco foods is about working----You work hard you get hours, you slack you get less hours...
