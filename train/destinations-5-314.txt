Adelaide seems to have a reputation for being a boring and dull city, maybe because its alot more relaxed and quieter than the other major Oz cities and its so clean and orderly. In many ways it feels like a giant sized country town, but its still a big enough city with just about everything you could want or expect... Just without the stress, hassles and mayhem. Its laid out beautifully with wide, leafy streets and European style squares, and miles of parks completely surround the CBD. I havent seen any city so meticulously laid out. It does really well when it comes to the arts and culture, has a good nightlife, good sporting calendar, and a truly outstanding culinary scene.
