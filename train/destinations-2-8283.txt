I have to say that the last time I visited Disneyland, I was very displeased with my experience. Sure, I liked the park favorites, like Pirates of the Caribbean, Its a Small World, and Main Street... but the park really is WAY over priced. It's way too spread out for those of us who can only visit for one day. I miss A Visit With Mr. Lincoln the robotically enhanced American History lesson...was my favorite attraction as a kid. I think that Disney Corp should update their employee uniforms, as they all still looked as if they were wearing costumes made in the 60's. I only gave it a mediocre rating, as I'm smitten with love for Knott's anyway. And whats with Cat's rating.. does this person work for Disney Corp? sounds like an ad campaign for tourism... no hard feelings, your info was great and true, but a bit lengthy. If you go, enjoy.
