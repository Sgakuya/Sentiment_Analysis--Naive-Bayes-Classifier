Ohh, the pain. Even in a weak division they crap themselves. Bring me Denny Green's head now. UPDATE: I made that comment a while ago and it still rings true. Another 0-3 start and Warner is hurt. Now they may have to rely on Josh McCown for a bit. It has become comical to me how these guys find new ways to f*** up every year. UPDATE: Every year some jackass says "this could be the year for the Cardinals" and every year that jackass is wrong. Why be the jackass? I will project nothing but contempt for these rejects! UPDATE: Go Rackers, indeed. NUMBAH'S PA ANNOUNCMENT AT A CARDINALS GAME: Would the parents of the 11 children who wandered on to the field come get them? They are beating the Cardinals. ONE MORE FOR YOU: Through five games Marcel Shipp leads the team in rushing. He has 169 yards and is averaging 2.9 yards per carry and 33.8 per game. That is horrible. SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: I have a new weblist on why these guys suck. Feel free to make hash of them. MOVING: They better not move. We just built a stadium (much to my objection) for these clowns. Besides, Bidwell has discovered that he can make money without the whining that will commence in LA when they lose. Why move? THEY DIDN'T LOSE THIS WEEK: They were on their bye week, but I hear they are working on a way to lose that one, too.
