This movie was one of the better horror movies I've seen in quite some time.It did not resort to cheap thrills or gratuitous gore,and instead worked through intrigue,suspense and strange yet subtle & mysterious imagery.The acting was good & it was shot with uncanny artistry that made the familiar seem bizarre.It was a bit convoluted,and was the kind of movie one needs to pay strict attention to,otherwise it would be make no sense at all.Even with attentiveness,it was elusive about certain things.I had chalked this up to those things being cleared up in the sequel-but they weren't.Don't bother with the sequel.It's LAME.
