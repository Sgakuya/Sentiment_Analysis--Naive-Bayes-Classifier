This must have been one of the most stunning places on earth 50 years ago. Green mountains surrounding a spectacular harbor lined with beautiful beaches. Unfortunately the masses of humanity that come here have taken their toll. The pollution gets pretty bad now, especially during holidays, and the town seems to be getting more and more run down. Whatever you do, don't go here during a Mexico long week-end - it is crowded polluted mess. One more thing - the most spectacular hotel that I have ever stayed at is in Acapulco - it's called Las Brisas. The whole place is built into the mountains surrounding the bay, above the town, and each little cabana has it's own private pool. The views are unbelievable, and the service is top notch. Believe me when I tell you that staying at a place like this could make the whole trip.
