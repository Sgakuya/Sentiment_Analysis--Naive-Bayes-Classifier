I have to admit that this thing seemed to hold promise, "a well made car for less than $13,000" what could be wrong. Well thats the base model, No AC, no power steering, with standard transmission, the one I looked at came with the convenience package, which gave you AC, and power windows, along with a few other luxuries. This is a Korean built car meant to be driven only be koreans, my knees were hitting the steering wheel even with the seat pushed all the way back, I could simotaneously hit the brake and gas with one foot, and it took 8 or 9 blocks to get up to the speed limit (60 km hour) all this for only $15,200 plus tax and $1,095 freight. Add in pushy as all hell salesmen and it's not even worth a test drive.
