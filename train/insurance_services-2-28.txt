If there is any dispute on the phone after an accident they will try as hard as they can to get you to just admit it was your fault. I had a lady make a right hand turn from the left hand lane in front of me and I wound up taking the blame for it as far as they are concerned. And they are now trying to drop me because of it! They would call at least once a week take a statement, take another statement, record a statement, have another person call to take a statement and so forth. Also a year or two earlier they tried canceling me because I had 'racing modifications' done to my car! After seeing my agent he realised that they were not and everything was fine until this!
