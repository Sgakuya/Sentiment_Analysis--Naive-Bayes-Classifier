Lived there for over 10 years and still miss some things about it. Great people and food, wonderful beaches (in the south of Thailand) and you can live the lifestyle you want ... cheap for backpackers but also some of the best hotels in the world. Good Thai people are among the best you can imagine. Corruption is bad, pollution is bad but the good far outweighs the bad. Here's a sampling of things to do: 1) Wat Po for massage (real massage done by the blind) - very strong hands and they can sense things you can't imagine 2) Buffet lunches at any of the 4 or 5 star hotels - very reasonable prices 3) Get on any 3 baht red bus and just watch daily life 4) Take the river boat from one end to the other, about 20 baht and very refreshing 5) Wake up early and watch the Thais give alms to the monks 6) Visit Little India and Chinatown, they're almost next to each other 7) Weekend (Chatuchak or JJ) Market 8) Lumpini Park for Tai Chi in the morning ... just to name a few.
