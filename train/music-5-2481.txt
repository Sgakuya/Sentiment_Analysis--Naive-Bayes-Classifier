I think Medgar Evers just said it all. This is an awesome album. Gimme Shelter(how do you spell 'gimme' anyway?) Has some of the best vocals Mick jagger ever did, and blew me away instrumentally. The title song, Let It Bleed , is so underrated it's not even funny. And on one of my favorite tracks of the album, Midnight Rambler , there is a catchy guitar pattern that's been stuck in my head all day before. The album closer, despite being too long, is an inspirational note and a great way to end the album. while not my favorite Stones album, it's a work of art, and has better percussion than certain bands could ever hope to accomplish. Take care, everyone!
