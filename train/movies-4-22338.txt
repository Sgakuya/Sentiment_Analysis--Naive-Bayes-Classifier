Released in 1978, Richard Donner's Superman: The Movie is probably the best of the comics to silver screen films, and the one that seemed to have started that movement. The key to the sucess of the film was the casting, starting with the then unknown Christopher Reeve as the adult Clark Kent and Superman. Reeve seemed to satisfy all generations, namely those who grew up with prior actors in the role as well as the younger generations to whom Reeve is Superman. In addition, Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, Ned Beatty as Luther's incompetent sidekick Otis, Glenn Ford as Superman's human father Jonathan Kent, and Jackie Cooper as the Daily Planet's editor Perry White were all spot on. The only casting failure is Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, as Kidder was just too hard edged for the role in my opinion. The screenwriters do a excellent job giving appropriate time to the three main phases of the film, namely on Krypton, Superman's youth, and the main action scenes as Superman saves the U.S. from Luther's schemes. The film also utilizes comedy to great effect, namely in the form of Hackman and Beatty which develops their characters more than just being evil. However, the film does have so notable and material flaws. The special effects are subpar for such a huge production (even by the standards of the day), and the ending is a bit illogical and contrary to Superman's prime directive (as also noted in another comment). Nevertheless, Superman: The Movie is an extremely effective story and film that set the standard for other comic book movies that has yet to be matched.
