Fresh-faced, leggy actress who always gives a good performance; she has really grown up over the years since Halloween, and taken on a variety of roles. Sha has been a teen scream-queen, an ingenue, an action-star, and a seductress, and she has made them all work. JLC has a unique beauty of the girl-next-door type, and has shown a knack for physical comedy and action. She is in the enviable position in Hollywood to pick and choose her moovies, which is good for her, but bad for her fans, who want to see moore of her work. To the MooCow, JLC will always be Laurie from Halloween, the sweet, snuggly victim of Michael Myers. Her lead days are not over yet, so don't be surprised if she comes up with an-udder block-buster! :=8)
