First of all: STOP RATING MKIII SUPRAS!! This area should be exclusive for mkiv Supras (1993-1998) models. There is no comparison to older Supras. The new Supra is a thing of wonder compared to the old Supras which are merely above average automobiles. Mkiv Supra. This is the best car ever built, in the world. Why? Becuase it was for sale new at $43,000. You got a 320 HP Twin Turbo (STOCK) vehicle that drives SUPER-quiet, powerful, and has the best handling, brakes, and headlights of any car in the world. The only other cars in the world which are better than the Supra (stock) start at 130,000 bucks or so. Styling. The most beautiful car ever conceived of. Hands down. If you think it's ugly, too bad. I think nothing can touch it. Performance. 320 HP stock is very decent. You can get the car to 430 HP spending 500 bucks on a few mods. You can get these cars going 700 - 800 HP for a few thousand bucks. This is more power than a McLaren. You can get a Supra running 10's in the 1/4 mile. Also faster than a McLaren. At that point, It can go 0-60 in 3.5 seconds, about the same as a McLaren. Yet you can achieve this for about $30 - $35,000 dollars with a used mkiv. A McLaren is 1 million dollars. This is why the Supra is the best car ever built. Not only the best looking car, but for the price you pay, you get a car which has the potential to beat cars 5 - 35 times it's price. -solrac- soon 2 b mkiv tt 6spd
