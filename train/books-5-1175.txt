Sure, it's a great strip, but it's been gone for some time, and it's a pity that there's nothing being produced today that even comes close--with the possible exception of Maakies.In many respects, it's the last of the classic comic strips, by which I mean the truly great examples of the genre, many of which have either perished with the demise of their creators or which live on in inferior, watered-down versions: To wit, Herriman's Krazy Kat; Ahern's Major Hoople (aka Our Boarding House); Walt Kelly's Pogo; Elzie Segar's Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye, Gould's Dick Tracy, Gray's Little Orphan Annie, Capp's L'il Abner. Is Calvin and Hobbes as great as any of these? No. But it's the only comic strip produced in the last 20 years which deserves to be regarded as classic.
