I don't smoke and I think if I did smoke Camels would be the last things I'd smoke since they seem to be one of the harsher cigarettes out there but I'm giving them a 4 because they did such a great job of suckering in so many people to buy their cigarettes! Yeah sure they were mostly kids etc. but so what?!? Who do record companies market to? Who do clothing chains market to? Kids are smoking either way Camel just made sure they got more of them to buy their smokes than some competitors. Do I think kids should smoke? No. Do I think it's really any of my business? NO. The tobacco companies certainly aren't (or weren't) as predatory as corporations like Publishers Clearing House who make every attempt to deceive in their presentation of terms and conditions of their sweepstakes. The tobacco companies played by the rules set out by the Gov. (I'm not talking about nicotine content and deception on that level just in terms of warnings, etc.) and they were just too successful at it. There I've said my peace. Viva Joe Camel!!
