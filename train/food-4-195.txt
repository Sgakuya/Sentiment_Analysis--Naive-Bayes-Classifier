As a matter of fact, I had Life for breakfast this morning. Call me a freak, but I've started mixing cereals on a regular basis. My current habit is to put a layer of Life on the bottom of the bowl, then top it off with Total Corn Flakes. The strategy here is that Life, unlike most other cereals, actually tastes better to me after it's been sitting in milk for a while. So if Life is on the bottom, it's good and ready by the time I'm done eating the corn flakes off the top. Also, I think one of the things that makes Life so good is that it has a surprisingly sweet taste. Unlike Cheerios, Rice Krispies, or Total, I can eat Life without drowning it in sugar.
