How do you vote Truman #5 and LBJ #30 something? You are mad at him for Nam, yet he was only following the Truman Doctrine. Yes, I am against Nam, but there was at least precident for this attack and he was following a doctrine. Bush today is engaging in a war without precident and based on his own doctrine. If you justify giving LBJ a 1 or a 2, then you have to do the same for Truman. It was Truman's policy. Also, he had the support of the entire country for a while, especially in getting civil rights and liberties for everyone. He, unlike his namesake Andrew Johnson, had a great relationship with congress. If he wanted something done, he got it. Of course he was flawed, but he at least made his mistakes on precident and a policy our country was following. You might call me a hypocrit as I rated Kennedy low for this same reason, but I found it cowardice that he sent people to their death in a sneak attack backed by lies. LBJ at least did something. Whether it was enough or too much, it hurt him. But he at least stuck with it.
