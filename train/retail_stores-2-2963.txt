We purchased my fiance's any my ring's at Kays in the Valley Plaza in Bakersfield, CA. I have also worked with the Rimrock Mall store in Billings, MT. Every sales person has been nice, but the associate in Bakersfield told me that he was the Assistant Manager when he was only a Sales Associate. I have returned my ring. It was supposed to be shipped overnight to the Bakersfield store, but ut has been 4 days and I have not seen a credit on my account. I was supposed to be on the 12 months no interest plan, but even after I put down 20% at the time of purchase I was not put on this plan. Monthly statements are very difficult to read. They do not have any detail of the transactions, just the final total purchase amount. My fiance is in the military, and when purchasing our rings we were told that there are stores all across the US who can help up. Funny thing is though, that these stores cannot take care of anything themselves, they always have to go back to the store where the purchase was made. I was also told about their great warranty and then asked to purchase the ESP. I haven't figured out why I did this on his ring, since it has engraving and cannot be resized. I now have a much better quality, and much nicer looking ring, for not much more than what I paid at Kay's. My fiance's band from Kay's is beautiful, but I would not reccommend making a large purchase with this company.
