Not nearly as funny as all involved with the movie think it is. Beyond what you see in the previews Orange County has very little to offer. Collin Hanks of the two time academy award winner Tom Hanks does nothing but scream, bitch and moan through the entire film with the same grimace on his face the entire time. Skyler Fisk, who I have heard hails from the loins of Sissy Spacek, did not get her mothers incredibly talented genes and it is hurtfully obvious in Orange County. The saving grace of this film is Jack Black who is seen far too little in Orange County. The guy is hilarious and makes every scene he is in. But, you could save yourself a few bucks and stay home and watch T.V. and see more of him in the promos than you do in the actual movie. See, half of what they show you in the adds isn't even in the actual film! I hate when they do that. However, the film has it's moments and tried really hard to be original. For that I give it a 2.
