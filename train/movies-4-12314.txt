Of the recent barrage of CGI movies, it pales to Toy Story or Shrek, but surpasses recent stinkers Shark Tale or Robots. It's about par to Madagascar. A release from the new Weinstein Company (Bob and Harvey formerly ran Miramax), the animation is a bit cheesier than the high-resolution offerings from Disney and Dream Works. But the story is amusing -- a spin of Little Red Riding Hood meets "The Usual Suspects" (though it lagged in the beginning) -- and I got a few laughs. High powered cast provide theri voices (Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, David Ogden Stiers, among others). Alas, poor Jim Belushi's character (a fat woodsman) did not come up with one funny line, thus keeping Jim's 25 year streak of never saying or doing anything that made me laugh intact.
