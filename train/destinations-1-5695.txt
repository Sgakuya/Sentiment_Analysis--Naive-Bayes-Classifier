I have lived in Fargo, which sits on the Minnesota since August and both Minnesota and North Dakota are crap!! Minnesota is butt ugly, the people are rude. Its very strange how these rural-low lifers who live in Minnesota could be so arrogant. I mean seriously folks, Minnesota is just a both of small towns sitting in the midst of the tundra where they brag it being -50 all winter long. Minneapolis is the most boring middle-sized city I have ever been too, the people of Minneapolis think they are superior to others because they have a high crime rate and tons of poverty (look at the depressed look on peoples faces as you travel up Lyndale Avenue in North Minneapolis). Only the fools in Minnesota believe that they have a quality of life with all the crime, decay and ugliness of this state!
