This is an amazing book. I felt honored to be taken on this journey of Frank McCourt's life. He has a gift..his talent can make you laugh one moment and bring you to tears the next. His First Communion Day was simply hilarious and heart breaking at the same time. His memory of Eugene watching for Oliver out the window tore my heart out. His loyalty and devotion to his family in the face of devastation are incredible and heroic. I waited quite a while to read this book since I heard from so many people that it is depressing. However, it is inspiring and heroic at the same time. One of those experiences that seriously makes you look at your own life, truly appreciate what you have, and possibly feel a bit ashamed for the things you take for granted. This is a book for everyone, and I am now looking forward to reading 'Tis..I just HAVE to know what became of the McCourts!
