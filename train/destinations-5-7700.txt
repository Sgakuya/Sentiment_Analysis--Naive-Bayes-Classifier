This lovely little museum is one of Baltimore's many hidden gems, though few visitors ever see it. It's outside the Inner Harbor area, where most of the tourists hang out, but you can take the water taxi there-and it's worth the trip. There is a lot about Baltimore's fascinating history (once America's second-largest city). The museum is much more wide-ranging though; it could be renamed 'Museum of Industrial Civilization'. The exhibits explain how the systems that make modern life possible (factories, power-generation, food-processing, transportation) were created and how they evolved over time. There are also historical explorations in what might be called the 'social history of technology': the stories of the pioneering businessmen and inventors who created entire industries from humble beginnings, and the skilled craftsmen and laborers who built and mastered the tools that made America the world's great industrial power. In our post-industrial age of white-collar work and computers, this museum is a fascinating reminder of how the material goods we take for granted are made.
