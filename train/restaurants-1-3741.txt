We went to CiCi's in Jonesboro Arkansas tonight Aug 6 2005. First of all, the only thing on the buffet was specialty pizzas. Examples: canadian bacon and pineapple and pizza that had lettuce on it, it looked like a salad. Then there was no ice in the soda machine. The tables were so close that 2 children could not sit back to back with out hitting each other. There is no way 2 adults could sit back to back to each other. We had to move to a different table because when we went to try to find something to eat another family sat down at a table behind us and because the tables were so close we could not sit down.We have ate there several times,this was the worst visit. We will not be back,and will not recommend anyone else to go.
