 Becket's comments are a fine example of liberal hypocrisy and bigotry. Pea-brained sheep like Becket are part of the problem, in that they support crooked politicians like Jesse Jackson based on the color of his skin, or because he tells them what they want to hear. Jesse Jackson is a hypocrite. His behavior indicates that his Christianity is merely a facade designed to give him a modicum of respectability. Godly men do not cheat on their wives. Godly men do not bear false witness in order to achieve their political/financial goals. Godly men do not steal. Godly men work for a living. Godly men do not support abortion.
