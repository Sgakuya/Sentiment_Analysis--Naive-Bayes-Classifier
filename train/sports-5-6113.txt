All you Kansas fans need to get over the fact that McNamara lit your team up in the National Championship game. As far as having a good game, yeah, he did. But you are showing your ignorance, you need to remember that he shared the ball with the best freshman and one of the top players in the country in Carmelo Anthony. If he was able shoot that much all year, he would have averaged about 20 a game. And his intensity and aggressiveness make up for his size, so when you hear his named called during the draft in three years, don't be surprised. And when he out performs Hinrich in the NBA, don't be surprised either. McNamara already did one thing Hinrich never did in his college career... win the big one.
