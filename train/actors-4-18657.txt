Robert Zemeckis has got a lot of talent, and I'd go on to say that he is nearly great. My rating of him is more of a 4.5 than a 4. I've enjoyed most of his films, including Forrest Gump , What Lies Beneath , Contact , and Back to the Future . Of course, I was disappointed with Cast Away , but I still thought that he did a fine directing job with that film, but no matter how good the acting or directing is, I just cannot stay interested in a film that consists of two hours of someone talking to a soccer ball. Perhaps in a few more years when Zemeckis puts out another great film, I'll raise his rating to a five, but for now, he's near great in my book.
