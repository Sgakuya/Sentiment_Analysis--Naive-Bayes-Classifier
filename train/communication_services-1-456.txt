My service was shut-off without any notice at all. As someone who uses the phone only sparingly and for emergencies, I did not know that my phone was not functional until I REALLY NEEDED to use it. When I called customer service, they told me that I needed to fax a copy of my credit card, identification, and utility bill. I was uncomfortable with this, and they said that I could not call the financial department but needed to fax them to get a call back. I did this, and still no call back. When I called customer service again, they told me to refax my request. I purchased a prepaid phone in the first place for convenience. I did not know that it would involve this much work. I asked customer service if I could be refunded the money left on my phone. I was willing to recycle my phone, and get another with another service provider. They said that they could refund $30 of the $45 remaining. This was because they have to refund money in the increments in which they are purchased. Had I purchased a $45 top-up at some point, I could have been refunded $45. I feel ridiculous even writing this, because it sounds so unbelievable, even though it just happened to me. I have a sneaking suspicion that this issue will not be resolved by Friday, which is the next day that I need my phone. The customer service is the most aggregious I have ever received. Had I tried to invent a more fantastic story, I could not have done so. I am disgusted that I chose Virgin Mobile, and would gladly pay twice as much for a better service provider. If you are thinking about choosing Virgin Mobile, don't do it!!!
