Jim Carrey is one of the funniest actors in the business! I have followed him since his In Living Color days and he has blossomed into a very successful actor! I still think that Liar Liar is his funniest movie. The Ace Ventura movies were hilarious, though the second one was better. He's had some misses, especially some stabs at drama, but that's bound to happen. He can turn the dumbest, lamest movies or scripts into some funny stuff. Comedy is what he's best at; it'll be a long time before he branches out to drama or something more serious. Carrey's facial expressions have me laughing too. He will be a face to watch for many years to come!
