Among Ted's long list of accomplishments are six American League batting titles, two Triple Crowns, two MVP's and four homerun titles. Despite missing nearly five seasons of his prime to military, he still ranks tied 11th on baseball's all-time home-run list. In 1941 Williams solidified his greatness when he posted a .406 average with the Redsox and won the first of his 6 batting crowns. Since then no batter has hit .400, and only a couple of players came close to doing it. Ted's career numbers are 2292 games played, 7706 at-bats, 1798 runs, 2654 hits, 525 doubles, 71 triples, 521 homeruns, 1839 rbi's, 2019 walks, 709 strikeouts, and a .344 average. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1965.
