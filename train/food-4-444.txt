Honeycomb is a cereal that has been one of the closest to getting a perfect 5 star rating. The flavor isn't overpowering, but simply sweet. It reminds me of sweetened Kix, though this is corn and oat cereal, not just corn puffs. The only problem I have with Honeycomb is the size of the ..er, combs, I guess you would call them. Don't get me wrong; I love how they come in all different sizes. However, the colossal ones that resemble sponges more than honeycombs get soggy almost instantly in milk and thus are only able to manage a lackluster ..noise, that doesn't really qualify as a crunch anymore. But I like how the normal pieces soften slightly at the edges but still remain crunchy.
