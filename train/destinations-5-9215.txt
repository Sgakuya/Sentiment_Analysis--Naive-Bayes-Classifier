This my friends is really, really cool. Right in the middle of Barcelona stands this enormous Cathedral La Sagrada Familia and it is HUGE. The most incredible part of it is that is still unfinished after over 100 years. They're still working on it you can watch them working. You can also see the changes in the architectural style of the Cathedral over the years. In the meantime they've put an elevator in to the top of one of the spires and the view is awesome. Just take off and start exploring, there are stairways and nooks and cranny's all over the place, little peep holes from little balcony's and tower windows. It'll take at least a couple of hours to explore so be in a mood to walk. The really amazing thing is that they are probably only about 2/3 done, maybe!
