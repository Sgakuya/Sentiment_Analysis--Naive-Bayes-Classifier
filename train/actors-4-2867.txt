This fellow surprised me. Early in his career I sort of wrote him off as a bit of a pretty boy riding on the coattails of his talented (unfortunately deceased) older brother. Boy was I ever wrong! He brings more raw talent and maturity to his roles than most actors twice his age. Just watch 'Return to Paradise'. He gets only a small part of the screen time but manages to outshine everything else, including the unusually good Vince Vaughn and the gorgeous Malaysian landscape. I hope he has a long and illustrious career, because I will continue to watch his films as long as he continues to make them. Hear that, Hollywood? There IS a market for talent after all.
