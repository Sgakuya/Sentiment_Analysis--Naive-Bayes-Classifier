Treated as a typical costa, most people miss out on the interesting history of Majorca and it's important role it played in the Western Mediterranean during the 14th and 15th centuries. Don't miss the huge Cathedral (Gaudi cleaned out the Chora), but that job only made it look larger! Interesting rarely visited parish churches all dating within 50 years of the Conquest of Majorca by Jaimi 1st of Aragon. You can visit the tombs of the Kings in Trinty chapel in the Cathedral. Also, El Temple, the chapel of the former Temple Church (of the Knights Templar). Interesting place to go if you avoid the tourist stuff.
