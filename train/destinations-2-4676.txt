A sad, ruined city. As many of the other commentators pointed out, a place that has suffered lots more white flight and abandonment than most. In fact, St. Louis has lost over 60% of its 1950 population (by contrast, other Rust Belt trouble spots like Cleveland and Buffalo are around 50). No real comeback, except maybe in Central West End- downtown actually lost people in 90s, unlike in most major American cities. But there are positives. Beautiful architecture in the still-inhabited areas - my favorite is St. Louis Hills in south St. Louis, a kind of residential Deco district (if I am getting the architectural terminology right)- lots of houses w/turrets, etc. and still an OK area. Rest of city not great, but not visibly decaying unless you go north of Delmar.
