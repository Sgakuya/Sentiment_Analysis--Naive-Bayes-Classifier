I have to disagree that people have a legitimate case against McDonald's and other fast-food corporations for making people obese. It's just common sense to avoid overindulgence in overly-processed fast-food and I don't like the movement towards excessive warnings that seems to be taking place in this country. (You should know that hot coffee can burn you without a warning on the side of the cup, for example.) That said, I really enjoyed this movie. It's clear how much time and research went into the film, but most impressive was Spurlock's disregard for personal health in his effort to complete the 30-day experiment. I had to hold myself back from cheering when the 30 days was finally up and his vegan girlfriend could start feeding him real food again.
