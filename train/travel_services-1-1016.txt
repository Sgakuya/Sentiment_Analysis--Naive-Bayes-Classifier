THey finally p/u a day late in Kamloops and I am still waiting for my furniture. P/U was July 16th and it is noe August 14th and still no furniture. Unfortunately all I can do is pray that they will come soon. We are missing work to receive our furniture.....They don't care. I know they are priced lower that competitors however be aware that 2 small men with hearts have no HEART period... Me and my family are sleeping on the floor we are using 4 plastic plates we borrowed from a friend and have no table to eat on. This has been going on way to long. I have called and get the same answer Do you think I want your furnture Apparently YES YOU DO.....because I am still without. I have called Toronto, Mississauga Office and they canot help me.
