The 2006 is an excellent re-design with added content (heated seats, telescoping steering wheel etc on LX model). The content exceeds the comparable mid-size sedans, e.g. Accord, Camry, Impala. The quality was at one time suspect but the past few iterations of models have scored near or even at the top of J.D. Powers. I have owned two Hyundais with good experience. My own experience together with recent quality improvements make this an attractive choice in the category. Made in Alabama now - that helps. Minor issues, the audio controls on the steering wheel only include volume and am/fm switches, no channel skip or scan. The front seats are a little small for my 235 pound frame, like most cars.
