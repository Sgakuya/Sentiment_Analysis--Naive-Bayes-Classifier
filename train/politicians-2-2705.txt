We need to remember that this man talks out of both sides of his mouth. Rhetorically speaking, how is Bradley any different than a politician who accepts soft-money contributions to keep his political career going, with some of those monies coming from corporations who dump toxins and cram landfills? Bradley used his superb physical talents to play basketball for Princeton and for the Knicks, and maximized his brainpower to get an Oxford scholarship. Why Bradley is seen as someone with his hands as soft as Dove soap amazes me. He was an above-average politician who excelled at fund-raising throughout New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and with help from the DNC. How did he benefit the people of New Jersey, I ask you? Please remember that just because someone labels themselves a Democrat does not necessarily mean they give a rat's ass about the working people. Bradley's been around well-to-do social circles and academically elite people for most of his life. Is Bradley any better than Florio? Todd Whitman? Torricelli? Corzine? Payne? Roukema? Roe? Pallone? Zimmer? We all need to be careful who we vote for and really question who they are and to whom they are beholden to. Politics does not mean you are above the law.
