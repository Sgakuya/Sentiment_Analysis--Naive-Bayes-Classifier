I HAVE BEEN A HURRICANE FAN THROUGHOUT THE 24 YEARS I HAVE BEEN ALIVE. I WENT THROUGH THE PROBATION PERIOD, AND THAT DOES NOT EVEN COMPARE TO HOW LARRY COKER AND HIS STAFF OF CHILDREN LET DOWN THE HURRICANE NATION. HE HAS ALL THE TALENT IN THE WORLD AND COULD NOT EVEN PUT UP A TOUCHDOWN. I COULD HAVE COACHED A BETTER GAME. HE JUST STOOD THERE AND LET LSU'S 2ND STRING QUARTERBACK AND RUNNINGBACK MAKE US LOOK LIKE A DIVISION 3 TEAM. IF A CHANGE IS NOT MADE AT THE COACHING POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO GET WORSE, JUST LIKE WE HAVE SINCE COKER TOOK THE REINS. HE DESERVES TO BE SODEMIZED BY AN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN IN A DARK ALLEY.
