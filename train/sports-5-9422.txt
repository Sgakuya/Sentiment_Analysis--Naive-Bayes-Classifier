Come on now? WTF? Bobby is in last place. He's incredable. I can't beleive you guys rank him in last place. Okay I'm going to throw an oppinion of mine, that has as good of an argument to it as any. If I'm Rick Adelman I start Bobby over Mike Bibby.Hey I like Bibby, sence the team got rid of Tony Delk, Nick Anderson, Jason Williams, and Brentthe looser Price, there are no Kings I dislike. But still, how do you even justify starting Bibby over B.J. Well atleast Adelman does one thing right. He allows Bobby to play the most important minutes of the game. LOL, Kings rule, while the southern Loosers drule! HAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
