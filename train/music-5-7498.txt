The point of the video is NOT for Michael Stipe to look like a world-class dancer, remy! Although if you think the video is sexy I can't say I completely disagree with that ;-). I love the way the video started, you know, when the glass breaks and then Peter Buck starts playing his mandolin. And I know some of the conservatives are going to object to the fact that Peter Buck was shown giving Michael Stipe a massage. Michael Stipe IS gay, after all, and he has every right to be gay. But Peter Buck giving him a massage does not suggest anything! Christ, out of all the things people could object to, people are picking on that! This was one weird video, but that's one of the things about R.E.M. that everyone has to love...their weirdness. I wish they had more R.E.M/Queen stuff on here...I'd like to rate it! Anyway, keep up the good work R.E.M. and take care, everyone!
