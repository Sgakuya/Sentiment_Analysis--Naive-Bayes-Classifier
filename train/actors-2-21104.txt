Pamela is a terrible actress and I don't like her looks...her boob job was too much, and now her lip implants are overdone. What she wore to the Oscars party showed her unbelievably trashy taste and her cluelessness about what is appropriate and classy. In interviews she comes off as a tramp...it is one thing to be sensual and proud of your sexuality, but another to be throwing in people's faces in an ostentatious manner. BUT that said...I have seen her in some interviews on television where she is very well-spoken and has a nice gentle manner about her. She is a caring mother...I give her one star for that. She does AMAZING work for animal rights and I applaud her stance on that...that's the other star. So because I know these two things about her admirable character, I give her two stars...if I were to rate her on acting, style etc. alone, I'd give her zero stars.
