Cut the guy a break-he's been sick and senile for 15 years and effectively brain-dead the last 5, so you can't really blame him for what a dump Saudi Arabia is. Fahd is the ultimate figurehead, with less power than the king of Lichenstein. Back when he was somewhat healthy, he drank a bottle of scotch a day (in typical Saudi royal style) and took no interest in anything besides bottles and bimbos. A real life 'King Ralph'. Saudi Arabia was never an absolute monarchy or dictatorship; it is run by shifting coalitions of princes (rather like Medieval England). Prince Abdullah runs the reformist faction, and with luck he'll come out on top before the old fart dies.
