We bought our 97 Camry based on experience with our 91 Camry (an excellent car), as well as Toyota's reputation for quality. We have been sorely dissapointed - valve seals failed at 70,000 resulting in blue smoke at startup, a common problem of many Toyota's of this vintage (they hardened the valve seals in 97 and won't assume full responsibility for this design failure). Timing belt replaced at a mere 36,000 miles and looks like it needs it again at 75,000 miles, hope tis isn't a pattern. My Toyota has been plagued by frontend rattles as well. We've also had transmission problems as well as electrical problems. Toyota made great cars in the early 90's, but something has gone terribly wrong, and they won't stand behind their product like they should.
