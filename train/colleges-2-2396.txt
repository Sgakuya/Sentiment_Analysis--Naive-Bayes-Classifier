Two huge, sprawling campuses located in Buffalo and Amherst, NY. Business, medicine and law programs are quite good and are among the best value for its cost in the Northeast. Strong emphasis upon research---this is not a student-friendly institution for undergrads. Grad students are in average class sizes of 28 (larger than most, but definitely smaller than undergrad classes. Look elsewhere if you want one-on-one attention and bonding with your professors - the place is huge. The largest university acre-wise and in student body in the SUNY system. Undergrads are given scant attention by professors who teach in cavernous auditoriums and who are more interested in research and in publishing their findings. A disproportionately high number of TAs who can't speak English very well. Rocky relationship between professors and TA union who argue that professors do less time teaching and more time researching. Racial relations on campus can be tense at times. Most Buffalonians (who are not cosmopolitan by nature) resent the large number of downstaters and exchange students on and off campus. Still, UB is one of the better institutions of higher learning in Western New York.
