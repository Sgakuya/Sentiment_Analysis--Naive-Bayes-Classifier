VOTE FOR NADER IN 2000! VOTE FOR NADER IN 2000! VOTE FOR NADER IN 2000! Screw all the issues. Politics are for ignorant people. Why even vote in the first place? The popular vote doesn't mean a damn thing. The only votes that count are the electoral votes. Anyone not realizing this is simply caught up in the hype, beleiving that their vote actually means something. For those of you that will vote, don't vote for dumbo George Bush or Idiot Al Gore. Vote for Ralph Nader. Actually we needto vote on making an amendment to the constitution, changing how many terms a president can serve. Bill Clinton has probaly been the best president ever, and needs to be in office until he is too old to do his job any longer. But, since this will not happen, VOTE FOR NADER IN 2000!
