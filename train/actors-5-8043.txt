This is what attractive women look like. Not only is she extremely cute and adorable, but she is intelligent and powerful as well. I wish that more actresses of today had that array of natural beauty, but all Hollywood tries to sell the public is cold, angry, upset, fake, actresses. Not all of the actresses of today are bad, just the lame one's like Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nev Campbell, and Courtney Cox. They're all like Irvine women. Phony, shallow, and 'bitchy'. The actresses of today that carry a cute and pretty sensuality to them are; Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd, Halle Berry, and Alyssa Milano. Audrey is the best though.
