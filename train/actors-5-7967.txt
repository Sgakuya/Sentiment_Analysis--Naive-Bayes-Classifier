I think his "action" movies are halarious! How anyone could think so highly of themselves and play it off is pure comedy. He rarely/never gets hit by the bad guy in his movies, he beats up sometimes 20 people at a time, and he can fix anything and play any instrument. There is nothing this guy cannot do or accomplish in films. He can take anything apart, wire anything electrically, make a bomb out of a milk carton. This guy is pure genious because he got filthy rich off of these independent films. I like how the bad guys always talk about how great he is and how tough he is. I love how he has little ego boosters throughout his films like the bad guys screaming "awe my jaw, the sun of a bitch just broke my jaw." Or better yet, he takes a lie detector test and they ask him if he ever climbed Mount Rushmore to test the "No" reply. He says "yes" and the machine shows he is not lieing, he really climbed Mount Rushmore. In one movie, his woman asks "can you play the guitar?" and he nods his head with a cocky look on his face. He never dies in his movies and one movie he gets thrown out of a plane in the beginning with Hallie Barry and he replied on a talk-show that he never died, they never showed him hitting the ground. He said he pulled a parashoot. This guy is so cocky and big-headed it makes it halarious. The bad guys are always total rejects and talk about how great he is. And whats better than watching someone beat up 25 guys at a time?? Best actor for a good laugh.
