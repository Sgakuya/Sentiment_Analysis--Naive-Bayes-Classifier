 Matilda is a modern fairy tale that mesmerizes children from the start. It's the story of a highly intelligent young girl (Matilda) who is dealing with loser parents and problems at school. Realizing that she has magical powers, Matilda takes things into her own hands and changes her life and the life of the kindly schoolteacher who believes in her. The story is filled with fascinating characters, clever surprises, and lots of dark humor, typical of Roald Dahl. It's refreshing to see a girl as the protagonist. When I taught second grade, my students voted Matilda their favorite read-aloud book of the year at least six times. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with anything written by Roald Dahl.
