I would give a better star rating for the Natural Florida but that doesn't exist anymore so...A little advice for those who are thinking of moving to South Florida. Unless you are rich and don't have to work think twice before pitching your tent, because you will be hard pressed to find a high paying job here. The salaries are terrible, yet the cost of living is very high and rising. Even if you do get a decent paying job, you'll never be able to afford a house at the current median price ($325,000 and rising) that is unless you already have a ton of money. Rentals are priced high, a 1 bedroom can cost you $1000/month in a nice area, car insurance is high, murder rate is high, traffic is bad, grid lock on I-95 is a daily routine. People from New York and New Jersey moving here in droves, can I say anymore??? Yes the old people, well there are plenty of those and during season the snowbirds from all over clog the roadways, restaurants and shopping centers. Another motto for Florida should be, A place where everyone has a job, but no-one seems to be working....if you live here you will think that the most of the people here are on vacation, because it looks that way everyday of the week, and these people aren't old either. Another annoying site is the very materialistic people, status and stature is judged by Louis Vuitton, BMW, Bentley and Gucci. Keeping up with the Jones is a daily requirement here. Used to be a nice place to live, now it's becoming a nice place to visit and I can't say how long that will last?
