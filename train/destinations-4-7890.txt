Chicagoans in the know will tell you without hesitation that the Hancock Center (known locally as 'Big John') is a much better view than the one from the top of Sears Tower, which, incidentally has no cute nickname. The fun of the Hancock is that you can actually step outside onto an outdoor deck that's screened in for your protection. SMELL THE FOOD from the sidewalks 94 floors below- yummy! From up here, you can see four states! Big John is also home to the world's highest apartments. Nowhere else on the planet do people live higher than here. The residents of Big John actually call the front desk on cloudy mornings to see what to wear that day! (Hey, Rich Folks! Ever hear of The Weather Channel?) This is a great building, fitting for the City of Big Shoulders. I mean, Big John just SCREAMS manliness . As far as the guy who thought it was the Hancock's fault that he got ripped for a piece of cheesecake: A) The Cheesecake Factory is a chain which pays rent to the Hancock building's owners. They are NOT affiliated. Besides, it's your fault you were in CHICAGO and ate at a CHAIN RESTAURANT...Duh. B) Did the menu at the Cheesey-cake Factory not have prices? How very hoighty-toighty, very Everest of them. You know what they say. If you have to ask... C) Next time you're in our neighborhood, try one of the local bakeries or even Eli's for cheesecake. And don't let me catch you eating in humdrum chain restaurant. I may have to spank you with a deep dish. ;)
