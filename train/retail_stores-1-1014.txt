Ick... need I say more? You go there, the place almost always looks like a tornado hit then you find something you want to try on so you go to the fitting rooms. You stand around for a while until you resort to searching for an employee (a.k.a. an underpaid high school or college aged clothing model that know nothing about good customer service) you find no one so you crawl under one of the fitting room doors only to find about 25 articles of clothing that weren't cleaned out from the previous customer(s) that were trying things on. You try on your article of clothing and decide you kind of like it. Then you look at the price tag... and decide that you didn't really like it that much. As you leave the fitting room, taking the piece of clothing with you, no one is there to see if you liked it, so you heave it onto the couch with the other 200 items already there and leave the store. A nightmare shopping experience? I think so... terrible customer service policy (they don't have one) and overpriced clothes. This store is not on my list of favorite stores.
