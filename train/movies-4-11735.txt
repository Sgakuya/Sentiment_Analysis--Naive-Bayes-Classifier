A simple but sweet and enjoyable romantic film. The standout is Topher Grace. His character was funnier, smarter and had more charm than anybody. Kate Bosworth is fresh and sweet but not too dumb or naieve. Josh Duhmael does a fine job of playing the fine line between the hunky shallow celebrity who when you peel all the layers is actually a nice guy. The only negative thing I would have to say is casting Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes in the rather lame roles as Tad's agent and manager who happen to share the same name. Lane was more appealing than Hayes. We've seen Hayes do this schtick on Will & Grace so it wasn't much of a stretch. Despite that the film is rather enduring.
