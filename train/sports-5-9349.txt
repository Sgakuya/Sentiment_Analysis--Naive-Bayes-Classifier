How soon everyone forgets! It is nauseating how many people who just last year had Lakers flags flying from every car are now ready to wash their hands of one of the most valuable clutch players the Lakers have ever had. The entire team had a rough season. Including Robert. He is one of the most dedicated, motivitated and vital members of the Laker organization. I am sorry, but Samaki can go, Janero Pargo can go, but not Robert Horry. I am afraid though by what I have read that the Lakers will not pick up his option. Which I think is such a slap in the face for someone who was on the cover of every sports magazine last year for the winning shot in game #4 of the finals. I hope and pray Robert will be there next season. But even if he is not, I WILL go to any Laker game that plays whatever team he plays for. Not only a great player, but a kind man as well. Shame on everyone who is ready to dismiss such talent.
