This is quite a sweet little remake, probably better suited to most modern kids than the original, but somehow not nearly as classic...the original version, made in the 1960s and simply known as 'The Incredible Journey', is the superior of the two in terms of quality, a smashing, old-fashioned charmer with silent but skillful animals. The basic storyline hasn't been tampered with here - two dogs and a cat, seperated from their owners, set out on a lengthy journey through the wilderness to find them. The main difference is that the animals talk this time round - Michael J Fox is ace (as always) as the manic dog Chance who gets a face full of porcupine quills, though the rivallry with the snooty feline Sassy does bring this whole empire down a fair bit - the constant bickering and taunting between the animals here prevents them from ever exhibiting the same sense of team spirit and unity that those of the original were swimming in. The cat character, my favourite from the original, is funny here but not all that charming. That said, this film does have its own original ideas and moments of supreme warmth and engagement, coming to a very gripping climax that had some of my friends in tears. As a kid, even though I loved the original more, I couldn't hold it against this version - despite everything, it is still darn good family viewing.
