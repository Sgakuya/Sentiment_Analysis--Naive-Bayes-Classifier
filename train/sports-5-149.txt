For a while at the beginning of the season last year, I didn't know what all the hype about this guy Ichiro was. I then in April saw the now famous clip of Ichiro throwing out that runner at third base from right field. I thought to myself, Wow. This guy is good. Then I saw Ichiro went 4 for 6 or had a myriad multiple-hit games. He was a demon on the bases, stealing the most in the AL. His proficient hitting amazed me. I think he finished his season with a .350 average or thereabouts. He is an amazing player that comes along maybe once in a generation. I didn't see many of his games (I'm a diehard Yankee fan), but the accolades he receives, he deserves.
