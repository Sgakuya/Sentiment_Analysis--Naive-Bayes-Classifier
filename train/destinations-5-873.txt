Having lived, worked and traveled about Spain and related to its people and places for two years, it is my testimony that the country is beautiful, the tourist resources plentiful, the art, music and museums equal to many, the food exquisite and most Spanish congenial. No country has a monopoly on perfection or defects. After all, its people and experiences make a particular perception on visitors (the rudeness of New York City denizens in the 1980s made it unlivable; it is now almost unrecognizable in that regard). Countries in Europe certainly are much more cultured and have deeper traditions. Take in the best of Spain with resaonable expectations. The occasional blowhard cannot be avoided or is no different from those to be found in any country in the world.
