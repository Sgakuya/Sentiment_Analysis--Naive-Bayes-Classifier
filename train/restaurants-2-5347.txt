I have been an employee for Friendly's for about 1 1/2 years. I was planning on staying with company for a long time to come. In the year and half that I have been there, I have seen 3 different general managers brought in. The turn over is horrible. Recently, I gave my two weeks notice due to a supervisor who I could not get along with, sexual misconduct,and I simply could not stand be our new general manager's moral practices. five days later I was fired due to insubordination/slander of the general manager to crew. What is this all about? They are really trying to stick it to me good with no validility of these accusations. They aren't even true. They are just mad that I previously filed a complaint and that I gave my two weeks notice. I am at this time seeking legal action for false reasons upon termination. I have 3 freakin days left! hello????? something isn't right with this picture. They treat us horrible. It's their loss. I was one of the many best damn servers there were there and they are chosing to get rid of the many talented individuals in this exeter, nh store in order to keep the people that the general manager brought along with her. She's really cleaning house, but not the right way. She's even tried and still continues to get rid of our assistant who has been with friendly's for 21 years!!!! She even got written up for the most stupidist reason. In the 21 years she has been there, she has never been written up. Something is seriously wrong with this picture!!!! I agree most friendly's restaurants, the service is so poor. I know, I use to be a guest and happened to be looking for a new job and I said, this restaurant is in desperate need of some serious damn good servers. So I became one of them and do my job whole heartedly. I get so many compliments and a lot of my regulars are so sad to see me go and have made the comment that they will not be back as I gave them the best service ever. Friendly's lost big time.
