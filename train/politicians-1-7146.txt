I have lived in Chicago all of my life which means that I have had the fortunate or unfortunate opportunity to see Rev. Jesse Jackson at his best his worst.How amazing it is to hear that he would have the audacity to father a child out of wedlock WHILE he was counseling President Clinton over the Monica fiasco. 20 month old daughter with his Washington aide.... Geez, Pes Clinton was probably giving him tips but had he really paid attention...she (the aide) would have walked away with a cleaning bill instead of a child. Now people will really be able to see this self promoting idiot for who he really is. His children have worked so hard to make a name for themselves. They studied hard excelled...and NOW they are embarassed by their father. I feel terrible for the wife who the media states is devastated. What could this man have been thinking of? Is his ego really that big? What shame he has placed on the operation that he runs in Chicago. I have always believed in the cause but not necessarily the man...now I'm afriad that some may no longer believe in the cause. I am saddened.
