It's a fair assessment that James Garfield didn't serve long enough to merit a high rating. Still, I'll judge him on the basis of his electoral mandate. Garfield was a brigadier general during the Civil War fighting on the Union side. In 1863, he resigned his commission to join the House of Representatives. There he voted the standard Republican line of the time: hard-liner on Reconstruction policies and against civil service reform. He was chosen in 1880 to head the Republican ticket as a compromise candidate (it took 36 ballots to chose him). Incidentally, the machine politicos did not really support his candidacy. So when he took office, he began clearing up the political graft. He was shot by an assassin only 3 months into his Presidency. He died too soon to determine whether or not he would have followed up with civil service reform, but we know that his successor did. He probably wouldn't have had enough political goodwill to be much of a success.
