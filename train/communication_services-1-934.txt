These are just a few examples of my experiences with AT T: 1st, I upgraded my equipment to the new GSM service and through a series of blunders made by several AT T employees, it took over 5 days to restore my service. 2nd, after being convinced over the phone by an AT T rep that purchasing new equipment at a brick and mortar location would save me having to rely on telephone, shipping and/or internet repairs to the equipment, I went to great lengths and delays to seek out a retail outlet. I was lied to. 3rd, my phone dies after 6 weeks and I travel back to the place where I had made my purchase. I'm standing in the store, on the phone with the warranty center and AT T is unable to help me on the spot. Instead, I'm sent home without a phone and promised that one will arrive at my office in two days - we'll see. Still, if customer's best interests were important to them, they could have sent me home with a replacement phone, restored my service with minimal delay, and replaced the phone for the store - y'know, sorta like any other retail business. My next phone will be from any other service!
