I work for progressive and I have not seen any other insurance company or customer service provider period who assists their customers with better service. their very curteous and prompt. I call my cell phone customer service line and they will hang up on me if they dont know the answers to my questions. They will not make any out going calls to their customers unless its to collect a pass due balance. Progressive is the best and you would be suprised how many customers stay with progressive even if they found a better rate else where just because of the wonderful services that are provided. I know cause i'm even one of the customers and I dont get any type of discount for being a progressive employer/client.
