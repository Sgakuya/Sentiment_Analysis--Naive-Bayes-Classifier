Robert Duvall is one of the only actors I have ever seen that has convinced me that he is crazy in real life. Almost nobody else can get so deep inside such a wide variety of characters. He completely subordinates his own personality to that of the character. Watching some actors you get an idea of what they are like outside of films, because there is a little part of them in every character they play. Duvall is able to completely change his entire persona into that of a maniac colonel in Vietnam(Apocalypse Now), religious weirdos (MASH and the Apostle), a mafia lawyer (the Godfather), or a kindly old grandfather type (the name escapes me). Brilliant, the male Meryl Streep, but better.
