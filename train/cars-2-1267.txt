Purchased an 01 Avalon in October 01; received first of two engine sludge notices 4 months later. Engine oil analyis shows fuel and silicon in oi. Had oil changed 5x in 11K miles; did not stop oil fouling. Negative battery cable terminal end failed causing total electrical system failure. Automatic heater controls malfunction; difficult to set and forget without having to manually reset. Dash reflects onto winshield causing driver's vision obstacle. Blind spot on driver's side; mirrors not designed/placed properly. Ride has deteriorated a lot over 15K miles; rides like an older, cheaper car already. Transmission hangs up and spins and then thuds into gear. Loud squeaking in dash area and in steering column. Automatic door locks operate once in a while. Remote fob range much too short. Seat belts twist up and do not retract when removing. CD changer unloads cds at random. Heated seats controls are either on or off; do not have thermostatic controls.
