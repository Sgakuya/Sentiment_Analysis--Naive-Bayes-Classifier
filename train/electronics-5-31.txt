Bought my Sharp VL-WD450U after evaluating perhaps a dozen other camcorders. As usual, I was looking for value in a model that had all the useful current technology. A few had pretty much everything in my price range ($600-$800), but, funny thing, what seperated the Sharp from the rest was operatablity. Specifically, the Sharp is the only camcorder in its class to have a zoom trigger which actually works well! It's simply positioned correctly. I was shocked to find that other camcorders had clunky triggers. See if this isn't true for you when you handle them. Also, true to its name, the TFT Active Matrix LCD gives a very sharp picture. If battery life is important, just buy another battery. They throw in an extra charger so it's easy to use. I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase. Took it to Hawaii and had a great time.
