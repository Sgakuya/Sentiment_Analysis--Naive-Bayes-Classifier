I own a 2004 Honda Accord, I must say to anyone looking to buy the '05 hey go for it, it rides like a million bucks! when you drive it you feel like you own the streets plus the car has so much power! and it is so comfortable to just sit in, the stock sound system is awesome,with its 6 cd changer plus xm satelite radio. Safety I cant even count how many airbags the car has, I t is so econimical it fills up when empty with just $25. dollars and the six cylynder can take you about 380 miles with one full tank not bad. I have no complaints. If you get the sedan get it with leather, so that you can get the heated seats and the outside temperature digital gauge the Navigation package was a good $2000. extra but It is worh it. I hope this helps anyone interested in this awesome machine. make sure to also get the wing!
