I had 2 HORRIBLE problems with KFC,plus the food was getting worse and worse. I loved Popeye's, but had to drive a long way. Then, I found two that were closer to home. Spend alot of time there now! The chicken is always awesome, fresh, and CONSISTANT ( I told KFC this,too, since they've lost us as customers ). The bisuits are the best (wow!) and the cajun gravy with mashed potatoes- unique and really tasty. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Couldn't say the same about the Colonel!!! Try Popeye's - you will LOVE it!!!!!Crunchy and juicy, cheaper than KFC ( they don't charge extra for white meat! )and so much better!
