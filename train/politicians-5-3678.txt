I think President Elect Bush is going to do just fine. He is such a breath of fresh air after what we have had for the last 8 years. It is our turn. The leftys have had their way for 8 years and its time for us now. I am proud to have a leader who believes in life and protection for the unborn. Too bad their mothers dont. In contrast we had a leader who believed in and signed into congress the right to suck the brains out of babies. Somehow he feels this is humane. I am proud to have a President who is mature, kind, loving, and who upholds the constitution, and the basic principles our great country was founded upon. But of course he had good raising, and his parents deserve a lot of credit. Our country was founded upon Christian principles and that is what made it such a great country. We were given the freedom of religion but I'm afraid that is slowly being taken away. It seems to be politically correct today to say you are jewish, buddhist, or any religion other than Christian. The leftys want anyone in but a Christian. Well there are many Christians and I am proud to be one, and I am proud to have a President who is one.
