Okay so there I am taking the tour of the Old Jewish Cemetery with a random tour group. We're all walking around and the tour guide is telling us all the history of the cemetery etc. and it's all (as you might expect) a very sad story about how they had to bury people stacked up over each other because there was no more room and headstones were moved in from other areas so there is almost no room to walk and they lean in on each other at every angle, and the restrictions put on them during the Nazi occupation. Everyone is being very respectful and paying close attention as we all walk about in utter silence. So.. as you walk about you notice that every headstone has little bits of stuff on top of them like pebbles, or coins, or mostly stones I guess but anyway I'm standing there as she speaking looking at all these pebbles piled along the edge of the headstone and for some reason I just didn't get it and thought what the heck is up with people putting stones on here how disrespectful and so I reach out and brush a couple off. Ooops big mistake. Of course it ends up that the stones are there out of respect and I have just shown an incredible lack of such by flicking these pebbles to the ground. Quite embarrassing I must say, people weren't extending many happy smiles to me as I crouched down to pick them up and place them back on the headstone. I forget exactly but I think the stones were supposed to be symbolic of the people buried in that plot whose name wasn't on the headstone. In any case the cemetery isn't a WOW that was great!! attraction but if you're looking for a very interesting and historical site then this is certainly a good place to visit while in Prague, just keep your hands behind your back and you'll be fine.
