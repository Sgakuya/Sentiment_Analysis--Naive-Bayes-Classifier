Im rating it 1 becuase of what so many foolish people think. Just becuase its a Toyota does not mean you will get good reliability. Just look at some of the comments on here. All vehicles are mechanically made; everything mechanical has problems eventually. Do not be afraid to buy the car you want. Dont give up the hot rod car you want (Impala, Taurus) just because the boring Camry says its more reliable on paper. My entire family has owned domestics for years, with little or no problems. Also, if domestics are so cheap, why does Ford have the best selling vehicle in several categories? Why does Dodge have the best selling minivan? Just becuase your car is a Japanese does not mean its indestructible.
