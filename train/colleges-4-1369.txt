Depaul dosen't get all the praise it deserves b/c Chicago has so many great schools clustered so close toghter. A solid school at a fair price in a great neighborhood. If you're planning a carrer in Law, politics, theater or any of the humanities, this is a great school. I went to DePaul undegrad and am headed there for Law School. Faculty is friendly and fair and there is not much pressure; you set your own pace and lifestyle while getting a good education. Keep in mind, I say this as someone who was accepted with academic scholarships to everywhere I applied. In case I misspeled any of the above, don't blame it on DePaul. :)
