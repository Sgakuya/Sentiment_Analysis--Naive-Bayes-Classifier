I bought a 27 Sony KV Series TV almost exactly a year ago, and I've been very happy with it. The picture quality, like all Sony TVs, is excellent. And the speakers, placed stereo-style on either side of the screen, produce consistently good sound. I have surround sound speakers hooked up to this TV, and sometimes watching a movie at home is a better experience than going to the theater. My only complaint is that the TV I owned before the Sony was a Sharp 27J Series, and that set was almost as good for about $150 less. So in my opinion there's no question you're going to get good quality with the Sony KV Series, but you might be almost as well off buying a less expensive TV.
