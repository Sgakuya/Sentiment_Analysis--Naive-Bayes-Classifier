I am a former employee of Tiffany & Co. Just to answer your question of why Tiffany sterling silver is so expensive, well, yes you're paying for the designer name, but they've earned that name. Honestly, Tiffany has outstanding craftmanship and quality. Just compare it to any other piece of sterling silver jewelery and you will see the difference. You will see this excellent craftsmanship in everything they manufacture...from their sterling silver, to their crystal, to their engagement rings. I hope that one day I will get an engagement ring from Tiffany! And just for your info, Tiffany & Co set the standard for sterling silver (925 parts pure silver and 75 parts copper) that is now used worldwide.
