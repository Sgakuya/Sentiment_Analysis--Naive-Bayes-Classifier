I'm a Marylander myself, so I may be a little biased, but I've been to about 5 different aquariums on the East Coast, and though I like pretty much all aquariums, this one has the neatest layout. This aquarium features a beautiful rainforest section (if you look around, you'll find toads and turtles and birds just roaming the area--it's a lot of fun to look for the animals in the dark), a pretty impressive shark exhibit, an okay dolphin show, a display of habitats that are beautiful and well-constructed, a huge pool with giant rays and little sharks, and a very impressive seahorse exhibit. It's a little frustrating with big crowds, but if you can get in when there's just a moderate crowd, it's much more enjoyable. They have a special for a few months out of the year (not in the sumer) where you can get in on Fridays after 5pm for $5 in admission, a GREAT deal! Please be prepared for a long walk, comfortable shoes are very important; if you don't want to see fish (yes, I've heard that complaint in the aquarium, from adults and children alike), this is probably not the place for you. If you don't like high humidity, you may want to skip the rainforest section. If you like aquariums, this is a good place to stop by if you ever visit Baltimore! Oh, and there are shops and restaurants nearby for beforehand or afterwards; Parking may be troublesome, it may be a good idea if you take the Lightrail to the harbor to save from the parking headache, if you don't mind a bit of a walk, that is.
