HALLE BERRY IS PRETTY BUT NOT THE ONLY PRETTY WOMAN IN THE WORLD AND VERY OVERRATED. HER ACTING SKILLS IS OK. SHE IS DEFINATELY NOT A ROLE MODEL IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY FLASHING HER BREASTS AND HAVING EXOTIC SEX SCEENS ON THE SILVER SCREEN. SHE IS DEFINATLY NOT A LADY OF INTEGRETY AND TO BE MARRIED WHAT TYPE OF MORALS DOES SHE HAVE EXPOSING HER BODY TO THE WORLD THAT IS FOR HER HUSBAND ONLY. ANGELA BASSETT IS MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT TO TURN THAT DISGUESTING DEMORALIZING ROLE IN MONSTERS BALLS DOWN. SOCIETY TRIES TO PROP HER UP BECAUSE OF HER LOOKS SO WHAT IF SHE LOOKS GOOD THAT'S NOT TALENT. THAT'S NOT FAIR TO THE ACTRESSES THAT HAVE REAL TALENT. I AM SO SICK OF SOCIETY TRYING TO PUT OTHER BLACK CELEBRETIES DOWN B/C OF THEIR PERSONAL LIVES AND THEY DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HER WHAT'S UP WITH THAT IS SHE TOO PRETTY TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT. SHE IS NOT MY KIND OF WOMAN SHE IS TOO SHALLOW I HOPE THAT SHE WAKES UP ONE DAY.
