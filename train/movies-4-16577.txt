This movie was adorable and found it's charm it's being totally unrealistic. To think that fate could bring two people together despite such dour circumstances is very sweet and made for a pleasant movie watching experience. It's about two people (John Cusack, yummy..and Kate Beckensale..you know, that chick from Pearl Harbor) who meet rather innocently, that are immediately taken with each other. So much so, in fact, that they have a bunch of tests to see if their being together was fate (which it is, obviously..but too many things stood in their way so they left each other, albeit hesitantly). Then some 7 odd years later, they both decide to find each other and do so after a long trial of mishaps and misdirections. Everytime they almost found each other, my heart skipped a little. It's nice to have little mindless movies like that. This film was very cute..much, much better than most romantic comedy fare. And John Cusack is in it. Grrrowl.
