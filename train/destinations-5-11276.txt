Just returned from Eurodisney with my boyfriend. We stayed for 3 nights and 4 days at hotel Santa Fe. We didnt spend much time at the hotel but the time we was there we both found the facilities to be of a good standard. We only went to breakfast on the first day as it was all a little too manick for my liking! Kids were running about everywhere with their croissants!!!! We didnt know until the last day that we could have paid a little extra and got a cooked breakfast.... My only critisism though! There was a free shuttle running from the hotel to the park but we found it much easier (and quicker) to walk.... i really enjoyed both parks and found the short queues to be quite suprising! and can i say the aerosmith ride - rocking roller coaster was brilliant!!!!! we went on it about 5 times in a row! i do rate Eurodisney as great but perhaps that is because i haven't been to america... i do plan to go there though for my next visit!!!
