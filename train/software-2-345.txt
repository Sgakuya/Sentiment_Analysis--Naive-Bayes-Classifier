Windows. I can't stand the empire that has emerged from perhaps the worst attempt at an operating system platform. I have fallen victim to the Microsoft monoply. Windows XP, despite being better still is the worst choice for computing needs. The sole reason that I gave it a 2 and not a one is solely because of Microsoft's saturation of the software market. It's products mainly Word, Excel, and Powerpoint are great tools, but placed on the unreiable windows platform, there useless. XP still has the Windows Crashing. When XP crashes however, you may have a chance to somewhat survive(unlike 2000 which crashed almost every startup). I unfortunatly have owned windows 95,98, 2000(Millenium) and now XP. After XP I have finally learned my lesson. Apple and Mac's are the next age in true reiable computing. I use them at school, and find them easier, unbeiveably faster, and incredibly reilable-Definatly worth the extra money. The reason XP has become somewhat more reiable is because it's beginning to mirror Mac's. If your here shopping for a new computer, take my advice and stay far away from Microsoft and windows. The list of problems I have with windows are too numerous to list. I'm constantly on the computer and at least 10-15 times a week I find my self cursing out Microsoft and Bill Gates. Too Many bugs, too many problems, and too little customer service. Forget Windows all together.
