Anybody who is stupid enough to hire him after he burned the Dolphins the way he did deserves to lose games, lose money, and lose face. Just watch and you'll see Ronnie Brown be a far more effective running back than him. UPDATE: Ronnie Brown has been a "far more effective" running back than Ricky Williams without being a menace to the team. The Dolphins more than likely plan on keeping Brown, who rushed for over 900 yards despite splitting carries, and tossing Williams into a trade, assuming they can get anything out of him. If they can't get any value out of him, they'll keep Williams on his lowered salary and slowly hand over the reigns more and more to the younger Brown. Both backs average 4.4 yards a carry, and both are similarly styled bruisers. That's why it especially wouldn't make sense to keep them both. Normally you want you're backup or spell back to be a change of pace in terms of running style. If a bruiser is your main back, you probably want a speed oriented shifty kind of back behind him. The only reason Tatum Bell seems as effective is he follows up the power of Mike Anderson with his blazing speed. A Tatum Bell kind of player would compliment Ronnie Brown better than a near clone of himself in Ricky Williams.
