The Molly Brown House is definitely worth a stop when you're in Denver. The house itself is impressive, and you can take a tour (for $6.50) to learn about Molly Brown and her family. Tour guides dressed in period costumes lead you through the house, which is filled with furniture, pictures, and books. I enjoyed seeing the memorabilia from the Titanic, including photographs taken before the ship embarked and a list of the items Molly Brown submitted to the insurance company after the disaster. The most surprising fact I learned on the tour was that Molly Brown went by Maggie or Margaret, not Molly. She's known best as Molly today because of the musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Apparently the name Molly sounded better to the producers of the show, so they changed her name! If you are interested in the Titanic, be sure to stop in the gift shop located in the old carriage house. You'll find an impressive selection of books and other items related to the Titanic and Molly Brown, in addition to Victorian cards, hats, etc. Tours leave every 30 minutes, and reservations are accepted. This is defnitely worth the trip.
