When the world is cold and I'm feeling alone, the one thing I can always turn to is Christina's music. Within her music and in the power of her soul that is echoed through her voice, I find the comfort and solace that I need to move forward. Christina Aguilera and just the strength of her character has had a profound impact on my life and probably the lives of countless others; this is much more than you can say about many other artists today that conform and don't cause any stir or controversy. As a 15 year-old girl, I am proud to say that Christina is my inspiration and my role model, and nothing anyone else will say can change it.
