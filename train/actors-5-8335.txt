Miss Garland was much, much more than The World's Greatest Entertainer. She was a real person with three children to raise, and when she had little to almost no money at all, she still was able to provide things that her children needed. She was also a very kind and generous woman, doing volunteer work during WWII and buying tickets to one of her concerts for little children who couldn't afford them. Though both of her daughters, Liza and Lorna, have never achieved the fame that their mother did, they still are honored and remembered as the spawn of Miss Garland, and many people admire them just for that reason alone. Not many people may know this, but Miss Garland was also a very political person, a straight up Democrat, who made her opinions known. Miss Garland will forever be remembered as the Girl Next Door who dreamed of going Over the Rainbow, but to her fans, who know a lot about her, she will be remembered as the kind, honest, hard-working woman that she was.
