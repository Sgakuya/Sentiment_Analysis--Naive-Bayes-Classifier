I can understand some people having negative experiences. When you are a large institution such as UoP you will not be able to please everyone at all times. I am currently persuing my AA in business at Western International University. I have had nothing but good experiences. The courses continue to be enlightening and become more challenging with each new block of classes. Sometimes the workload is almost more than I can complete. It is certainly NOT a degree mill. Participation in discussions and writing papers is essential. My only complaint is that my first algebra instructor was not as involved as I thought he should have been. I have no other complaints. My advisors contanct me regularly, and have my information ready to discuss when they do. The work is challenging, ever bit as much as when I attended Virginia Tech out of high school 10 years ago. Many of these negative reviews are unwarrented. UoP's admission requirements fulfill themselves when people who are unable to keep up drop out. And yes, they will kick you out if you don't maintain a 2.0 GPA. Currently I have a 3.96 and it came with much effort on my part, as well as a natural writing ability. I recommend this institution, but I fear the social stigma that bad reviews have created for it.
