I LOVE Las Vegas. You've got to be able to take the heat and the eventually annoying sounds of slot machines (at the grocery store, the 7-11, you name it). I'm not big on gambling but I do like the 24 hr. lifestyle that is a byproduct of the gambling industry. NOT A PLACE TO RAISE KIDS, people who are native to Vegas seem to have this warped sense of reality (everything is $$$). NO STATE INCOME TAX. I moved from Virgina to Vegas, taking a cut in pay and actually ended up taking more home. Don't know a lot about Reno (more expensive & exclusive than Vegas). Vegas is a very gritty place. There are street gangs (Bloods, Crips & Girson Park Kingmen (GPK - Black & Green)) in certain ares, be careful. Not a place for gambling addicts. There's always something to do if you want. Cost of living is relatively low for the West Coast, however the growth would disuade me from returning to Vegas. I lived there in the early 90's and recently for a couple of years. It's getting worse not better, congestion higher cost of living. I fear the Vegas that inspired all the growth maybe gone. The older and more mature I become, the less important Vegas' pros become (esp. now that I am in my child rearing years). I will still visit when possible, and dependant on Vegas' future I would definately consider retiring there if possible.
