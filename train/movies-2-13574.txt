I felt that this movie was overrated and should not have been nominated and won an Academy Award. Kevin Spacey was just a middle age and lustful, sick man who was going through a middle age crisis. What's so new and award winning about this? There were better actors who should have won over Spacey in this category. Thank God Annette Bening didn't win for her whining and screaming, psycotic performance. This would have been another wasted award. The best scene in the movie was the McDonald scene where Spacey's character sees his wife with another man. Hopefully, next year the Academy really will pick a best picture.
