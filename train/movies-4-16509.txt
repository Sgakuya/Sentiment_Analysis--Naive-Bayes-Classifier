Yes this movie was disturbing theres no doubt in my mind about it. But how many of us can honestly say that what we saw is not happening? When films like this come along it makes us all think twice. What are teenagers getting up to when their parents backs are turned? Some of the issues covered is a very realistic portrayl of whats happening in our society today and rather point the finger and say we hated it and try and ignore the many issues that were demonstrated we really need to focus on how we can edcuate our children on not falling into bad crowds the use of drugs, the type of friends they choose to have and most importantly more communication and awareness. A big wake-up call for the world.
