It still amazes me when I go to an above average to good restaurant they sometimes only serve Heineken, Amstel Light, Budweiser and maybe one other lager. Heineken is very well marketed to a generally unaware consumer market in the US. However there are so many better beers out there including many US beers. You are taking your chances buying beers served in green bottles. Certain wavelengths of light (including supermarket lights and bottle shop light) pass through the green bottle which often causes that skunky flavor so often associated with Heineken. Brown is a much better color to store beer. The green bottle is once again marketing. People think they are getting a good beer when in fact they are not.
