I have a Toyota Matrix XRS. It is a great car. It's fast, it handles great and I've never been more pleased with a vehicle purchase. It has a 120 volt plug for a laptop, two cigerrete lighter plugs and very stylish gauges. The seats are comfortable and the ride is nice. It does have a little more road noise than I'm used to, but that's only when I get above 80. The sound of the engine is great and a 180 HP gives you some real power when you want to pass. I live in California, so AC is a big deal to me and for such a large cab the AC is unreal. 113 degrees outside and I have to drop it from 4 to 3 or I get too cold. The cup holders are in a nice spot between the seats and is actually built into the molding and will not break like some of the flimsier ones that I've seen. The brakes are almost too good. They stop the car very quickly. The six speed transmission is a lot of fun and the last gear quiets the engine noise quite a bit. The glove compartment is quite large and the seats fold down effortlessly. The back seats have an abundance of leg room and let's not even talk about the headroom. Shaquile O'neal would be hard pressed to touch his head to the roof of this car. The 17 rims give the car a very sporty look and the ground effects kit are not so low that you scrape the ground out of every driveway. I cannot recommend this this car enough.
