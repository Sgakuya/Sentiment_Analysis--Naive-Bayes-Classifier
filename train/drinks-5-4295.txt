This Rum is not for light-weight pansies with no real palate. You'll need 2-3 healthy sips to aclimate your oral cavity. Sure it has a kick to it that sends your tastebuds screaming and ducking for cover, but it is full of subtle and complex flavours. Being aged in oak barrels is quite noticable in the onset. Later the carmel, coffee, and spice mixture will be evident upon your tongue. So much so, you'll find it difficult to curb consumption in your quest to find every nuance of its body until...uhh....oh my god....the bottles empty! I'm sure it will mix well to form a variety of consumable concauctions, though how does one know if any alcohol is good (in ones own opinion) unless it tasted straight.
