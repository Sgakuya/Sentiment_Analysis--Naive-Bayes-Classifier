i am an australian and live in the state of queensland. yes, i am bias, but hey, the reason i STILL live in australia is because i love it. by the way, if you haven't been here, don't judge it!!!! the country varies in landscapes, we have great surfing off of the coast, we have snow down south in victoria, we have the dry desert in northern teritory, we have beautiful rainforests in northern queensland and my favourite....the great barrier reef, the worlds largest reef and it's off of the coast of queensland. sydney is gorgeous, go to darling harbour and circular quay, great cafes and restaurants. melbourne is awesome too, very modern in the main part of the city but still cultural in little italy and china town. there is also a levi's jeans wholesale store in melbourne, i got a pair of levi's for $40au...about $28 US. also, all of our states capital cities are situated on rivers so we make an effort to keep our country beautiful and attractive to visitors, after all, tourism is a huge industry for us.
