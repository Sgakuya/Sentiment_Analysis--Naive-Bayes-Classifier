I wish they had half points because i would really give this a 4.5. tom Hanks is perfect as Josh Baskin a 12 year old boy who makes a wish at a carnival arcade that he wants to be big the next morning he gets his wish and ends up looking like a 30 year old man. The carnival leaves over night. the only person who believes Josh is his best buddy Billy. who gets him to NYC Josh has to hide out until they can seek out the carnival arcade machine that granted the wish. No easy task. so he is stuck on NYC for about 6 weeks. He finds a job at a huge office that markets toys. he quickly gets a huge job playing and rating toys. {the big boss finds Josh playing at a toy store] and gives him the promotion. A real neat story . That shows how this boy manages in an adult world.
