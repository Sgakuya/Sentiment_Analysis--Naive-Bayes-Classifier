Ya know....Duke has pulled off some amazing things. They have the Big 3 of course...Redick, Ewing, and Williams. They're not very deep I have to say, but for as little depth as they have...they're excellent. No doubt about it. They lost in the Sweet 16, but who cares!! They got beat by an awesome Michigan St. team with about as much heart as Duke. Williams has the best defense in the league and no one can argue with that. Redick has one of the best shots, and Ewing brings a little of everything. Melchionni has hit some big shots and Randolph has helped Williams quite a bit. Don't underrate Duke only because they have little depth....they're still an awesome ball club. Hey also, they have the MVP of the McDonald's All-America game coming up next year with some other dude....I cannot remember their names right now...oh well. Anyway, Duke is going to have a little bit more depth next year....he he.
