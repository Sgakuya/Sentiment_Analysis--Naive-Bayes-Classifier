If your expecting to watch a movie thats educational and expecting to be inspired by the save our planet theme your going to be sorely disappointed as this movie is strictly a popcorn movie. As far as disaster movies go The Day After Tomorrow ticked all the right boxes (mawkish romance, hero, someone close to the main character dies, a few survivors and a somewhat happy ever after). My only complaint about this movie was the ATROCIOUS dialogue. The level of the script was that of a school play, even the special effects couldn't cloud how truly awful this was. This movie does make you think about a few things and one of them is what part do we play when it comes to contributing to this world. Good film!
