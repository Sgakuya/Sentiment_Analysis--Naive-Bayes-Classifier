Tommy Bowden is a great offensive coach. He had great offensives when he was the coordinator at Auburn. He walked into a mess at Clemson. The program was in bad shape. He will turn it around. He has to have the time to improve facilities for recruitment and also bring in his style of players. He has had long enough to recruit but he also needs the facilities to get the players to make a commitment and it is my understanding he is upgrading faciliies. He will get Clemson on the right path. He is a great coach. He seems arrogant but it is not arrogance it is confidence. Tommy Bowden is a good coach on his way to being great
