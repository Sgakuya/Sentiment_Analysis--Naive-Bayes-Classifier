I traded a '01 SuperCrew for an '02 1500HD Crew Cab. I like the interior trim level of the GMC over the FORD. The creature comforts are not what I bought the truck for but, I have gotten used to the acoutrements and power everything. I like the power and responsiveness of the GMC 6.0 Vortec over the 5.4 Triton in the FORD. It seems to tow large trailers and boats better than the FORD. The FORD has a much better turning radius. I don't have the Quadrasteer equipped truck. For another few thousand dollars I think I can live with jockeying the truck into a parking space. I did test drive a Quadrasteer equipped truck and it parks like my old Volvo. If you have the means I would reccoment it. I don't know what the turning radius on the my GMC is but I know that the steering radius on the standard cab is 50 feet. The GMC rides a little stiffer that the FORD because of the HD suspension but that is to be expected. Fuel mileage is a toss up between the two. The storage in the FORD under the rear bench seat would have been nice in the GMC. Overall, the creature comforts put the GMC in front of the FORD.
