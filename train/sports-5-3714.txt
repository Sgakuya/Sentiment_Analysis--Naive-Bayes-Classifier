No question he is one of the greatest to ever play the game. Among outfielders, maybe not in the same echelon as Ruth, Cobb, Mays, Williams, and DiMaggio, but ahead of the likes of Clemente, Reggie Jackson, and Tony Gwynn (to name a few). To be honest, it's hard to pigeonhole him because there really has never been a player like Rickey. The closest thing would be Lou Brock with power. He is baseball's most prolific scorer as the all-time leader in runs. Agree that he is the most dangerous leadoff batter ever. He has the record for most homers to lead off a game and he had a very disciplined batting eye, thus allowing him to get on base often by walk. Henderson was supposedly a very zany character who would always talk in the 3rd person (Like Jimmy from Seinfeld). He would say things like, Rickey got a jump on that fastball and Rickey drove it out of the part. Once Henderson was concerned about his contract negotiations. His player rep. told him not to worry because he had tenure. Henderson replied, Tenure! Rickey got fifteen year. He will be in the Hall of Fame if he decides to give up playing ball one of these years.
