If I were rating the restaurant simply on the quality of the pizza, I would give it an average rating. That being said, the food is NOT awful. It tastes pretty good and I dont know of many places that you can feed a family of five for $20. Cicis has a variety of pizzas, pastas, salads and desserts at a price that you cant beat. This is an all-you-can eat restaurant and the food is laid out in buffet style so that you can help yourself. If you are raising a family, you will be hard-pressed to find a more economical kid-friendly restaurant. Of course, each store is different based on location and management, but, on average, this is a great place to take a family while on a strict budget and still have an enjoyable night out.
