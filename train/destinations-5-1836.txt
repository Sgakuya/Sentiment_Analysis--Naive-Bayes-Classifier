* Whine * I have looked over hundreds of sites and reports comparing the US to other nations. The US is by far the finest country in the world. The US has it all. Jealousy is what causes the animosity in most cases. Jealousy or political agendas that cannot be supported by fact. I am proud to be a US citizen. I am not against the world but am offended at the idea the US is behind the rest of the world. The US is THE world leader. It has been for 50 years and it will be until somebody gets stupid and tries to take us out. Being proud of Canada, as DickDirk is, I have no problem with. Blindly bashing the US based on political agendas or jealousy will get you nowhere. Scientific leader, Economic leader, Political leader, Humanitarian leader, Environmental leader, Military leader. Will the decisions made by the US always be right or always be supported? No, but at least the US is leading by example. A fine example is set in most cases. Bush is ONE man. The US is great because there are 280+ MILLION men and women who do more for the world than the world ever did for us. The US will always do more for the world than the world will give back. I can live with that but I won't sit back and listen to nonsense about the US.
