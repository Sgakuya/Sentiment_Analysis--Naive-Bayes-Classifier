I've earned both Bachelors and Masters degrees from a traditional university, and I am currently getting my MBA from the University of Phoenix online. As for their quality, I would rate it very high. The faculty feedback is much better than any University I have ever been to or heard of. At a typical state university, classes are taught by graduate assistants, and the tenured faculty is too busy with their own research to care much about student feedback. At the University of Phoenix, the faculty is all degreed professionals working in their field. The material is the same as any univesity class, if not more relevant and contemporary. At a state university, each faculty creates their own classes and chooses their own textbook on their own whim. At University of Phoenix, they are always updating curriculum and materials to reflect the latest and most relavent research in the field, and they hire people who are working in those fields. The material is solid, and if you don't learn from it, that is your fault. If you need your hand held to learn something, honestly, a college degree is not for you. The faculty are considered facilitators, not lecturers, so you shouldn't expect them to be. They also aren't there to be tutors. If you need a tutor to write your papers, go hire one. No University faculty anywhere is expected to tutor students. Faculty everywhere is expected to present the material then grade your understanding of it. University of Phoenix at least puts you in learning teams right away, to help your learning and collaboration. With most universities, you are on your own! The University of Phoenix is fully accredited, so it is not a diploma mill, and its classes are fully transferable to any other university in the nation. Whoever posts otherwise is either stupid or a liar.
