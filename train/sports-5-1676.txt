i'll admit i was a little turned off by pedro throwing zimmer around like a rag-doll, then actin' like a bad ass for beatin' up the ederly. but nevertheless, any team that can embarrass the yankees from three games back has earned my respect eternally. call me a bandwagon fan, tell me you'll see me in 2091, say whatever you want. but no matter what happens this season, my red sox cap will still be worn to pay homage to the yankee spankers. (on the days my faithful braves cap is not worn). i'll die a braves fan, but there will always be room in my heart for boston, even if it's another 86 years until i can bask in the delight of seeing the yankees get waxed by a bunch of shaggy-haired, grizzly faced boston boys.
