Released in 1956 and directed by Cecil B. DeMille, The Ten Commandments is the epitome of big budget, big production films of that era. Charlton Heston plays Moses in his typical epic manner as only he can and is supported by Yul Brynner as Rameses (Pharaoh), Anne Baxter as Nefertiti, and Edward G. Robinson bringing a little gangster flair to the proceedings. The movie takes us through the life of Moses as the adopted child of Pharaoh, his realization of his Hebrew heritage, his toils with Rameses, and the struggles in Sinai and the wilderness. Everything is big in this picture, including the length (a whopping 220 minutes) and special effects (most notably the parting of the Red Sea). As DeMille's last film, the bottom line is that The Ten Commandments is a campy, yet classic movie that is a must see for fans of big production cinema.
