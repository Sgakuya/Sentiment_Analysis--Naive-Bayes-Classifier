A lot of people call soda pop including the people from my town (rochester, about an hour and a half east) I think buffalo is like many cities in the midwest and western northeast, gets a very undeserved bad rap its not a bad place at all. It is he sunniest city on the east coast durring summer, and yeah it gets a lot of snow durring winter, but even though it sounds like it, 70-90 inches isnt an unamaginable ton. it isnt like there is 90 inches of snow on the ground at one time, that is the total amount, there is a lot of melting that goes on in between the snowfall, it usually stays between 6 inches and 2 feet from late november to late february or very early march, and then you will get an occasional inch or two in mid march. and the roads usually stay clear and everything doesnt shut down like it does when it snows in the south, were i spent the worst 9 years of my life. it is pretty managable, Rochester gets about the same and its really not that bad. HELLO THEY INVENTED TEH BEST FOOD EVER..... BUFFALO WINGS, NO, THEY AREN'T MADE FROM BUFFALO THE ANIMAL ALL YOU STUPID PEOPLE THAT THINK THAT!.........AND THE AMERKS ARE ROCHESTER'S TEAM!
