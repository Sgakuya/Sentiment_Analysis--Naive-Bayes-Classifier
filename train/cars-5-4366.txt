I would like to say, thank god i am a GM man! I have a 1993 GMC SAFARI XT with 183,000 miles that i use on my newspaper delivery motor route everyday. When i was shopping for vehicles, i wanted reliability and durability. My van goes through grueling driving conditions. I knew people that had various vehicles with the 4.3L V6 engine go over 200,000 miles, and still running! I think GM is the Toyota of american vehicles. They made some long lasting engines and transmissions. Dispite understandable problems with age, this van just keeps on running. Contractors use these vans on their fleets. I hope to buy another Astro or Safari in the next 2 years.
