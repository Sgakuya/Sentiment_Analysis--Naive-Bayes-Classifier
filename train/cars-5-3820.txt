We purchased a Used 2002 V6 XLT Escape 3 months ago and we really really like. We have had no problems. We didn't want a big gas hog SUV with an outrageous price to go with it. It handled very good this winter and my husband was so suprised that on our West Virginia slick icy/snow covered windy roads it never once slid anytime. The automatic kick in of 4 wheel drive or manually turning it on is a nice option. Its really is roomy inside, front and back! Plenty of leg room for adults in back I can park this thing anywhere and get out of tight spots too. Handling is superior. It does get it on the road when passing and rides smoothly. So easy for kids to get in and out of. No high step up. Easy to get things in and out of cargo space in the back. The molding on the lower part is a paint saver. No chip marks to show. Easy to wash too Overall a great family SUV for us that saves us gas money as well.
