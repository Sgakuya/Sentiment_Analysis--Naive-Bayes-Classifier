She's without a doubt one of the most attractive and incredibly photogenic women to appear on screen who has not ony proved herself as an extremely versatile actress in a relatively short period of time but is also one of the few actresses who is absolutely mesmerising to watch. My only gripe is that I sometimes feel she has a tendency to come across as a bit cold on screen in order to prove herself as a serious actress, and there's a sense of ruthlessness about her. Almost as if an inner turmoil is driving her ambition. She's had a few memorable solo performance's in her career thus far and there's no denying when she lands the right part, she has an ability to light up the screen like no other actress.
