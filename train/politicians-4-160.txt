Also called The Bastard in reference to the circumstances of his birth, and The Tanner in reference to his mother's family's occupation. After the Conquest he instituted many Norman institutions but also retained many Anglo-Saxon traditions. He mercilessly crushed opposition to his rule. When the north rose against him he left no house standing. So complete was the devastation that Yorkshire was still recovering two generations later. In his age, he gained some girth, and hearing that the equally fat king of France had made a joke at his expense, saying that William was in labour and suggesting that there would be a great churching when he delivered, William went to war again. His reply to France was that he would be churched in Notre Dame, and present so many lights as would give little pleasure to the King of France. He ravaged the Vexin and led his troops into the Ile de France. It was his last campaign. He died as he had lived, in the saddle while taking the town of Mantes. One of England's great soldier kings.
