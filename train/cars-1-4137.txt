GM thinks its being innovative and breaking new ground by introducing dog-ugly vehicles like the Pontiac Aztek. Guess what? The Aztek is nothing more than a reskinned Pontiac Montana minivan with the same old 3.4L pushrod engine. How's that for innovation? Don't fool yourself into thinking that the Aztek is an off-roader, its not. It seems that GM's beancounters are still running the show, presenting the car-buying public with half-baked efforts like this supposed sport recreation vehicle . Maybe GM ought to concentrate on getting the basics right. Like using better quality materials for car interiors and building Toyota smooth engines instead of wasting money on eyesores like the Aztek. Ditto the Chevy Avalanche....
