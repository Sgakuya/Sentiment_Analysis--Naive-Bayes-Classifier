First off, I will say that I agree with everyone who has already commented on this cd! This IS perfect, essential, and heavenly, but here's why...... The River is (like Born in the USA) a great album to play at a working class barbecue, while driving through a working class town, or when you just want to be alone and think about what life has handed you and taken away. Songs like You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) , Crush on You , Sherry Darling , and Cadillac Ranch are fun and bouncy tunes that you can listen to anywhere, anytime, and they will always make you smile (or even laugh!). And songs like the Price You Pay , The Ties that Bind , and Two Hearts have the same effect, but with 'advice' if you will, for the listener. And songs like the River and I wanna Marry You are stories about working class people that are so vivid, you can almost see them, or feel that you know these characters! But what takes the cake for me, is that, along with all of the bouncy, chorus-driven songs that go hand in hand with 4th of July parties, there are some songs that will 'be there for you' during your darkest moments. I've personally been having some horrid family problems lately, but in the song Drive all Night (which has the same soothing effect as a lullaby, if you ask me) when Bruce is insisting that girl you've got my love! I actually felt really comforted! And the song Point Blank , (one of the greatest I have even heard...the mood, the lyrics, it all flows together beautifully!) is not only great when you want to wallow in self-pity, but Bruce's voice comes off as sympathetic and caring! I can't describe just how important this album was to me, to help me through my tough times. I was able to feel like I had a 'hand to hold', like someone, anyone, was there for me. And when I'm happy, songs like Hungry Heart and I'm A Rocker are fun just to let loose and rock out to! Bruce is always superb, but this is one of his very best, in my opinion!
