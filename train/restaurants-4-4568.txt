I do admit that I was negative at first about this place... but I do think it is a good place to go if you are in the mood for homestyle. But, However,my opinion of this place is changed.... UPDATE1: I do remember a good expenice now! I did liek the food at the marietta,ohio location. but i did have chicken strips and they were farily good and thew mashed potatoes were pretty good but a tad lumpy.The service was slow considering it was not too crowded and it was only lunch time. The last time I went there (The location around Pickerington,OH)it was really crowded and it was hectic and it also was really slow and the service was really slow (they did not repay us for the delay like we expected) they did act moderatly and were kinda nice but not as personal as I expected)UPDATE2:I just ate there on new years (Mentor,OH)and it was great! the food came pretty fast and it was really good! I loved my porkchops!!! and they were really nice to my sis in law's baby and they were all playing with her!!!(her name's emmy) and it was great there. The doof took 20 min to get there but they were almost at capacity in the main area. great going!!! you've really improved!!! I have , however remembered some freky things that i've noticed in thier food lately... first of all thier menu is not as wide as ponderosa's (one of my frequents) I do like some of the atmosphere but the menu is too contry like... and I have puked on thier food some..... it is not as good as ponderosa's.... I don't care for it that much and it is too expensive for a little bit they put on your plate!! ;)OVERALL RATING: 4.0 Exact.(NOTE: this is mostly for cost and selection! the service was ok th food tasted mostly good)
