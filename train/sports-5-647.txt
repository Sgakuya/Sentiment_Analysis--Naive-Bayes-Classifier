He's the same as he's always been, and hitters can't adapt to him, even after all these years. His stuff is not overpowering at all, but he puts it where he wants it and how he wants it. His control is pinpoint, especially with the change. He's only 87-89 mph on his fastball, but he'll cut it, sink it, two-seam it, four-seam it. Everybody knows the fastball isn't for anything but setting up the change anyway. He uses a breaking pitch occasionally, but mostly he keeps hitters off-balance better than anyone in baseball. The change-up is scary, and he's very unpredictable with it; he'll throw it in any count. He takes a little off, puts a little on, and it does it's job: the hitters never are comfortable. It's scary how many ground ball outs he induces. He won't strike you out, but he'll get you out.
