Some of the styles in the Gap are just a little tacky (the 70s skirts were a bit hard on the eyes :)), but all in all, I like their store. I don't like the way their jeans fit, though, and I have yet to find anyone else who does. But aside from those few negative comments, they really do have some great conservative clothes I can wear to work. Yes, the clothes are pretty highly priced, but unless you shop at discount or department stores, you're going to overpay...it's a given. I really do like some of the basics in the Gap - khaki pants, ribbed turtlenecks, fitted tees, basic shirts that are just a step above average, nice smelling fragrances, cute kids pajamas (in Gap Kids and Baby Gap), (oh, and I found the cutest sheer cappuchino colored button-down shirt with only 2 buttons), things I have seen at the other stores, too, but somehow the Gap seems just a touch above average.
