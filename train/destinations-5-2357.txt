Budapest is a great travel stop or destination. Prices are still very modest. Food is very good - tasty,varied, usually well-presented, and abundant (portions usually are very large - it's usually a mistake to order an appetizer followed by a main course. It would almost seem that Hungarian grammar does not allow the words small and portion to be linked together!). Likewise, Hungarian wines tend to be underappreciated, The Tocai and Egri Bikaver are on a par with better known French (bah!) and Italian wines. Also, don't miss sampling the national drink (palinka, which is brandy made in various flavors - peach, plum, or pear). As far as sights are concerned, Budapest has an adequate, but not overwhelming, number. Recommended are the Parliament building, the Castle Hill complex including Matthias Church, the military museum, the national museum, and the Fisherman's Bastion (great view of the Pest side of the river from there). Vaci Utca (the pedestrian shopping street) is intersting, but getting more touristy all the time. A great place for getting the feel for local character is the central market (at the far end of Vaci Utca - just keep on walking until you run into it, literally; it has a magnificent glazed tile roof). I think the name in Hungarian is the Vasarcsarnok. At any rate, it has a huge food court (more paprika and Hungarian Pick sausage than you could imagine), and an upstairs gallery with tons of linen, table cloths, craft items, all at very reasonable prices.
