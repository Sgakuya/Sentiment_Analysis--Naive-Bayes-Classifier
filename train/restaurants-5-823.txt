The Jared story (with the guy on the commercials claiming he lost 300 pounds or so by eating Subway sandwiches all the time) is no lie: A local Subway store manager has met him personally as Jared makes stops all over Subway stores across the nation including at this one in my town. Though I'm sure that SOMEONE SOMEWHERE makes gourmet subs that are significantly better than Subway, as far as MAJOR sub chains are concerned, Subway is the best of all the ones I've tried. I have a Subway card which gives you points for each purchase -redeemable for free sandwiches, drinks, etc. which is really cool. I love the variety of sanwiches they offer, their ingredients are high quality and fresh and you can always add whatever toppings you want to whatever bread you want and customize your sandwich in many ways. And Subway is not only good tasting but far more healthy than burger-based fast food chains. Subway isn't perfect but definitely five stars. My only complaint is that I usually end up spending 12 dollars or so for two foot-longers (yes I can eat a LOT) and sometimes only that amount will fill me...barely.
