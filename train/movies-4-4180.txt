I would give this about a 4.5. After over decade of not making very good animated movies, Disney had a hit with this movie. A mermaid named Ariel becomes fasinated with a world outside of the sea.She collects stuff she finds from the bottom of the sea and wishes she could see the outer world. She sees Eric a young man who she instantly likes. after a fire on a ship Arriel rescues Eric she goes to a sea Witch so she can get legs and live on shore. in return she has to give up her beautiful voice. The witch says if Arriel does not kiss Eric within a few days she loses her voice forever. This movie has some great songs. like Part of your world. under the sea, Kiss the Girl. Sebastian the crab is especially good. a very good family movie.
