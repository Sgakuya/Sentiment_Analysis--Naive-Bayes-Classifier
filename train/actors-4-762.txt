Poor Joel McCrea...so popular nobody has a thing to say about him. That really seems sad when you think we're talking about a guy whose film credits span six decades. Fairly impressive list too - especially if you're into the western genre. His films had titles like The Virginian , The Oklahoman , Cattle Empire and Saddle Tramp . They were the kind of movies that you could always catch on a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon when I was growing up. They were no doubt the meat of programming on local television shows with titles like Western Theater . I couldn t personally give you one title that I actually watched - but I would be willing to bet I ve seen many of them. McCrea did depart from Westerns occasionally with films like Sullivan s Travels (1941) a comedy, which may be the one film I remember best of all his work. One of the most impressive points about this guy IMO though had nothing to do with his acting career. He married and remained so to the same woman (Frances Dee) for 57 years. Now, by Hollywood standards that s got to be something of a miracle!
