Good selection, good prices. I have worked in retail for the past 13 years and I have a business degree. It is unreasonable to pay someone $9/hr and expect them to know everything about a product. Look at what big companies pay consultants. They make well over $100/hr. If you are going into Best Buys and you ask someone to recommend the best Video Camera for your family you are asking for consulting services. Granted we're only talking about a video camera, and not hundreds of millions of dollars, there are lots of people who get paid substantial amounts of money for breaking down and comparing products such as the best video cameras for such-and-such people.
