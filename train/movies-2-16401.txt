I listened to The Runaway Jury on tape during a long road trip, and the hours flew by. The plot was a lot of fun, and the character development (especially of the jurors) was thorough and believable. So, I had high hopes for the movie. Unfortunately, the movie bore only a faint resemblance to the book, and nothing that was added or changed was for the better. The original subject matter of the trial (Big Tobacco) was switched to a more PC topic (the gun industry), with disappointing results. Absent was the edge-of-the-seat tension created in the book as the surprises coming from the jury were revealed. Somehow things didn't seem to flow well, and I couldn't lose myself in the story, which is the main reason I go to movies these days. To top it off, the acting was only mediocre, in spite of a great cast including John Cusack, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. If you're interested in the story, read the book or listen to it on tape.
