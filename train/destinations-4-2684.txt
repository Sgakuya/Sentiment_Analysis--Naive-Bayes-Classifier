Hot and humid summers and frigid winters, but plenty to see and do. Love the architecture. World class city with a great big, busy bustling downtown. Check out Marshall Field's at 111 N. State st. Absolutely beautiful. Great museums and galleries. The shops of the Magnificent Mile are magnificent. Bloomingdales, Marshall Field's, Lord & Taylor, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Burberry, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Saks Fifth Avenue and tons more. Great food and fun. Lovely and interesting neighborhoods. Chicago has it all. Great jazz too. Could I live here? No, harsh winters are not for me, but a world class, fantastic, most enjoyable place to visit.
