I just bought the 2002 TL Type-S, an upgrade from a 97 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP (GTP), and so far it has been more fun to drive it. It has 260HP and a Sports Shifter that allows you to manually shift the gears. It handels and takes corners much better than the GTP did. I do miss the heads-up-display and multi-function information panel but the quality, fit and finish of the TL severly outweights the lack of those items. I payed about $6,000 more than the GTP ($32,000) and I feel it was the best near-luxory car for the money. I drove 4 others, Lexus, Infinity, Nissan and Mercedez and dollar for dollar none of the others could match the TL-S! Granted, if I could afford more than $35,000 on a car, I would be driving the top of the line SLK. The one gripe I do have is the doors get dinged quite easily.
