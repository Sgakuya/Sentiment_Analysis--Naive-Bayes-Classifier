i happen to be a kroger employee at a store in dayton ohioas as is my girlfreind . this is the true story. my store is a older version. no pharmacy. no seafood dept. and no specialty depts like a bank or something. ground beef if store made is made of left over fat trimmings old steaks and old burger. some of which is not USDA approved. the produce is fresh when it arrives but it takes days if not a week for it to hit the shelves. bananas are intentionally aged to a slight yellow because noone buys the green ones and complain if there over ripe. i dont deny employees being rude ive been written up on 2 occurences for rudeness. like theyre going to fire me were so starved for workers i could get away with ne thing. but those times werent unprevocted if you respect me i'll do the same to you.we workers talk because customers are the must dull and uninteresting beings on earth. my job is scan groceries not entertain people. i'll say hi if you say hi but dont expect more. if you have to bag your own stuff because a bagger is not available dont feel crapped on its probably because baggers are versatile they can be used for all sorts of tasks like cleaning eggs off the floor that a careless customer has thoughtfully spilled on the ground and walked away without telling(hint eggs are easier to clean if not left on the floor for 4 hrs.)baggers can also go get carts that have been released in a lot . cart corrals are not more than a few feet away. afew feet of pushing can stop your mini van from getting a few dings. and lastly baggers can be called away to clean a mess in side the LADYS room. in the last 3 years baggers have had to clean fecal matter from the floor of a stall atleast 5 times. this is is a disgusting outrage are people this uncapable to aim at a hole in a seat! sorry to ramble like this but it feels good to vent this to the public if after reading this you come to look at ground beef or the ladys room differently then youll see why i shop meijers
