i just caught this on dvd, and it's a lot like the frighteners . aren't they both zemeckis? i don't know. decent effects, but not enough done with the true stars of the movie, the ghosts. who were they? what did they want? how long were they around? again, i don't know. some themes from 'hellraiser' appear here, like the union of mechanics and spiritual power to open the gate to hell. kinda like it was inspired by a trip to detroit, not so much a camping trip. i haven't seen a good ghost story in years. apparently, neither did the people in this film. otherwise, they'd know, if somebody leaves you a haunted house in their will, you DON'T F-ING ACCEPT IT! this movie will populate many dreary uhf sunday afternoons until the dead rise. the daughter is, btw in my opinion as a living guy, quite the fetching lass.
