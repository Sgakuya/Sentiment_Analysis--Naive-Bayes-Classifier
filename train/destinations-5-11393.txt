Taking a trip to this national park is like taking a trip to another universe. You can walk right around the rim of active craters, see lava flow from as recent as 1984 and the once in a lifetime opportunity to see an active volcano. The landscape is something out of a movie, steam is rising from the ground, the smell of sulfur in the air and black lava rock covers the ground for as far as you can see. You can even see lava spewing from Kilauea up close and personal if you want to take a very long hike. This is a strenuous hike over lava and you must hike back in the dark, so be well prepared with water, flashlights and extra batteries. The hike varies in length because the lava is always moving and can be as far as 12 miles away. It is dangerous because there can be caverns that collapse in the lava and you are right along the ocean. Even if you doon't hike out to the lava flow this park is definetly worth the trip.
