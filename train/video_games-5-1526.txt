This is the definite scariest video game ever. I could not stay up for more than 1 hour at night with all the lights off playing it. It scared me shatless. It's a helluva lot better than the PS1 version (If anybody knows the Jill Master of unlocking thing is then they know what i'm talking about). The graphics are really what got me here though. The eeire fog, the mutilated zombies, and the lighting effects mane my jaw drop. And Jill looks very attractive. (Even for a computer generated woman, she has a nice ass.) And i dont' even own the game, I just rented it a few times. That just goes to show you how friggin great this game really is. CAPCOM blew me away.
