I have discussed on numerous occasions the structural disfunctions of contemporary liberalism to which most liberals are only tacitly complicit. Nothing illuminates the intrinsic inconsistencies greater than successful conservative black republicans. The liberal dogma would hold blacks religiously bound to (most are) a paradigm of victimization regardless of individual natural ability to justify social contracts that prioritize rights and subequently quotas etc. Conservative blacks break that mold and are a threat to the dogma itself. The answer: unblack them! Call them oreos, uncle toms or whatever but don't call them black. JC was a stand out congressman and will be a standout presidential candidate someday if he polishes up his debating skills. And he's a proud AMERICAN- regardless of his skin color.
