As the mother of a former associate of Dillard's I have to say I have watched my daughter endure the worst possible work enviroment I have ever heard of. On Feb 13, 2005 my daughter was assulted in the ladies room, she reported this immediately to the manager on duty and to this day no one with in Dillards has ever had a conversation with her regarding this. Not one person we notified the corporate office and they are just as uncaring as the Ogden Utha store management. They took no steps to protect her when she returned to work so she was forced to quite then they lied to the unemployment office blocking her benefits. I will never shop at this store again and wish we could all gang up and protest this monster if anyone is interested in doing that please contact me at email lorfrecker@netscape.com. These people in all management as the worst excuse of human beings I have ever seen, and I want to make Mr. Dillard accountable. Please help me
