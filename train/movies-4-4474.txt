So I had little expectations when going to see The Grinch but I left thinking, what a fun movie. The costumes were colorful and festive and that one song was so darn catchy. I was impressed with how well Ron Howard managed to stick with the book while at the same time using artistic liberty to create an imaginative world and entertaining sub-plots. Max, the dog, was the coolest movie dog ever and you have to give Jim Carrey credit for his great improvisations throughout the movie. I especially like his Ron Howard-esque pep talk to Max on how to portray Rudolph. Great matinee movie, see it with the kids. But watch out, it runs to almost two hours so there are bound to be some slow parts where you'll be wishing it the movie would just hurry up!
