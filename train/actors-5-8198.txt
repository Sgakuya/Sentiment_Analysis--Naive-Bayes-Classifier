Barbara Stanwyck was an amazing woman who left behind an amazing body of work. She was beautiful, gorgeous even, and far more talented than she herself realized, but more importantly, she was a Respectable Lady who never comprimised her standards for anyone. She was a good citizen, a good human and a wonderful friend to whoever needed friendship. She was universally adored by any director, fellow actor and crew member that crossed her path. The extent of her massive charitable work will never be known, because, true to her style, she did good things to help others, not to bring herself publicity. Consider her work in Stella Dallas (1937), then compare it to The Lady Eve (1941), then compare both of those to Double Indemnity, and finally, take a look at The Thorn Birds (1982). You will be amazed at the 4 completely different Stanwycks you find in those performances- and they span 45 years of glorious stardom. I'm proud to say that I adore 'Missy' Stanwyck.
