In 1984, I watched on television as Jesse Jackson gave an impassioned speech at the Democratic National Convention about those who were left behind in America despite the progress and wealth of the nation. It was a great speech, but unfortunately, Jesse Jackson's words are greater than his actions. Over the years, he has shown himself to be a liar and a scoundrel. He goes abroad appearing as a peace maker; in the United States, he is a rabble rouser, fomenting discord and disunity among people, among races. He holds the title of Reverend , a title usually held by men of humility and great character; But his life and his lifestyle are anything but that of a humble man, anything but that of a man of high moral standing. I've often wondered one thing about Jesse Jackson since I heard that magnificent speech in 1984: Would he really stand the test of time and emerge as a leader for our great nation? The answer is quite evident. Despite his talents and abilities, Jesse Jackson has failed miserably and to be quite frank, shamefully. To fall from such a lofty position and be revealed in his true form - as a hypocrite and a liar - how disappointing.
