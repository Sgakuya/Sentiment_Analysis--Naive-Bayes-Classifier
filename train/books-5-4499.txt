I was plodding along without being too interested in this novel. It appeared to be too insubstantial and underwritten for my taste. Then suddenly Mr Greene pulled all the threads of his story together, and the protagonist Scobie was utterly caught in an unbreakable web facing utter damnation. It was an awesome, appalling moment. From that point on, I could only follow Scobie as he continued on his path to self-destruction with pity and love in my heart. Scobie's profound awareness of God's undying love, even as he refuses to turn back to trust and faith in Him is - even to an unbeliever such as myself - utterly heartbreaking. This is one of the most poignant novels I have ever read.
