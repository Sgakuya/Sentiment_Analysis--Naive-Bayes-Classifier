It's probably the best overall game I've ever played. The story is involving, the characters are incredibly fleshed-out and realistic, the dialogue is fantastic, the combat is deep and very challenging, the replay value is through the roof, it's *huge* (with the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal it took me at least 200 hours to finish my first time through), it's open-ended without losing a good sense of narration, and the music is unbelievable (especially in the expansion). It's not perfect -- there's lots of micromanagement of your inventory, there's too many penalties for playing as an evil character, and a lot of the time what you say during conversations doesn't affect a damn thing -- but these flaws are grossly outweighed by the strengths. Baldur's Gate 2 is pretty much everything that makes RPGs fun, and another reason to mourn the demise of Black Isle Studios.
