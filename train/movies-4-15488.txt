Not even Kevin Costner's pathetic and sporadic attempt at a Boston accent could ruin Thirteen Days. I really didn't know much about the Cuban Missile Crisis before seeing this movie, so I was especially interested in the history. Apparently the movie is very accurate, and it's frightening to see just how close we came to a serious military escalation with the USSR. The movie really makes you wonder what it would feel like to be the one making decisions that could potentially impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Don't let Kevin Costner's blandness and bad acting keep you from seeing this movie. The history lesson alone makes it worthwhile.
