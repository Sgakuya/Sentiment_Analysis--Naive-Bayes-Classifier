I made a $50 deposit at a Wells ATM and the machine had a malfunction and cancelled the transaction but kept the envelope. I called the next business day and was belittled and told that I probably pressed the wrong button and didn't know what I was doing. She then proceeded to tell me that it would be posted the next day. It never happened. I called them five times total and it took having to call someone higher up in the chain of command for something to happen. Granted it was only $50 but it should not have to take 5 phone calls to fix it the first time. So to make a long story short I made a $50 deposit and they kept it and never posted it. They stole my money! I have since joined a credit union and will never go back!
