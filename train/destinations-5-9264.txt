Lucy Maud Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables is a Canadian classic, loved by generations of girls in Canada and around the world. Each year, thousands of tourists visit the real Green Gables in Prince Edward Island National Park. This was the home of relatives of the author and the setting for the fictional Green Gables. Here you can visit the Haunted Wood and Lovers Lane, although it does lack the Lake of Shining Waters. Wander through the house and picture young Anne in the various rooms. For those of us who grew up with and loved the Anne books, visiting the site where her story began is a wonderful opportunity to walk into the setting of a well-loved story. It doesn't measure up to the image; there's now a golf course at the bottom of the hill, but it brings the books to life in a new way.
