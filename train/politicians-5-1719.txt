Bill Richardson is a good man who is leading New Mexico in the right direction. Although he has insisted that he will not accept the No. 2 spot on the Kerry ticket, I believe that a Kerry/Richardson ticket would've been quite effective. Richardson is known for his ability to appeal to mainstream voters from varieties of political persuasions and would've been an asset to Kerry's campaign. As far as his governing of New Mexico is concerned, Richardson has done a superb job thus far. He's taken the initiative in implementing real education reform, has protected the gun rights of law-abiding citizens and has cut taxes for middle class families. The income and sales tax cuts have not hurt New Mexico fiscally or socially, as Richardson and the legislature continue to adequately fund vital services. He has governed New Mexico ably over the last year, always looking out for the interests of those he represents, adopting a common sense approach to governing that is ultimately a successful method of getting things done that will improve the long-term prosperity and progress of New Mexico.
