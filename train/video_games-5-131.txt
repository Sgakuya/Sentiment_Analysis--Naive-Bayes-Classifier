Elite Force is an excellent game. It is a first-person shooter set in the Star Trek: Voyager universe, and makes you a member of the massive starship's crew. You play a lowly crewman who becomes part of an elite force of security personnel who defend Voyager from outside forces. When the ship is swept away to another part of the galaxy (not the famous Caretaker scenario, mind you, but another), your skills come into play, as Voyager has been teleported to a starship graveyard where, coincidentally, every major type of enemy has culminated. Because Voyager is basically dead in the water, you and your crew must defend Voyager from attacks, transport to alien vessels, and gain bigger and better weapons. The game works in Voyager's episodic format, and remains very true to the show. The ship has been accurately recreated to a T. All your favorite crewpeople are here to talk to (Janeway, Chakotay, Seven, Tom, Neelix, etc.), and they are all voiced by the actual Voyager cast (except for Jeri Ryan's Seven of Nine, unfortunately, who is voiced by another actress, but there is a patch that fixes that. The games locales and gameplay are quite varied, and because you never have to backtrack (a cheap trick some FPS games employ to extend the length of the game) I never got bored. There are stealth missions, out-and-out blast fests, and some puzzles to add some variety. Plus, it uses the Quake 3 engine, and looks gorgeous. It also has a fun, yet typical, multiplayer mode. The multiplayer is basically a Star Trek makeover of Quake 3, but is still fun (and is even more fun if you get the Virtual Voyager expansion pack). All in all, this is an excellent game which every action gamer owns it to themselves to play, even if they're not Star Trek or Voyager fans.
