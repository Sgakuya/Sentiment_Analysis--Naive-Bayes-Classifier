My boyfriend's roommate works part time for this company and told me that every rumor or negative comment about this company, is 100% true. He went on to say that the company, Two Small Men... hires it's s t a f f from anyone for 10 bucks an hour, cash. He said that most workers are in recovery for drug and alcohol (hardly recovered) and he's very much aware of the kind of crap goes on with these bottom-feeders. He also told me that the owner an Indo-Canadian KNOWS of this and is said to, not give a sh*t. Comments that are posted by those claiming to be pleased with this company are false and are posted by fictitious people. (just another scam) I feel terrible that people get taken by others' greed and ignorance and I have compassion with all those affected by Two Small Men With Big Hearts. .........Name Withheld
