Well what can i say about T.MAC...he is no doubt a geat player but all he care about is money and he s getting that in Orlando and he wanted to be the go to guy and now he is tat guy in Orlando but if u look at him u will see an aerogant and a person who betrayed the toronto fans and the organization by saying that his three years in Toronto were hard, whatever he is today, is becuz of toronto and he say that he was sick f toronto talkin all the good stuff about Vince, well to be honest Vince deserves all that and Macgrady say that he wanted to play for his home town thats all crap..he is nothing but a looser, i would love to see him play in toronto but he is doin no good job in orlando, every close game, he misses a clutch shot and thinks he is da best and trust me when grant hill will be back he will then be playing under grant and he will be crying again...he has a big L written on his forehead.
