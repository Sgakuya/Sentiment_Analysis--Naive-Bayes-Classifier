Xiala and all the rest of you bitter ones- let the 13 year old have her say without making personal attacks on her. Not only do you come accross as bitter and spewing venom, but immature - excellent Jerry Springer material. Obviously you are not a supporter. So, how would others rate you all? Would anyone (honestly) pay you to parade around in a swimsuit? Could anyone bear to watch you have sex? Got to give her credit for finally leaving a wife-beater. You all are so jealous and fascinated with her mammaries and makeup that you stop there - how much do you really know about her? Does anyone know if she's given to any charities? What fundraisers for charities has she participated in? Do you even know, or are the brain cells you haven't washed down with gallons of Miller High Life honed in on her honeys? Go ahead - admit it, if you had money that wasn't being spent on rent to own furniture and cheap cigarettes, you'd be getting something augmented, removed or altered. Or maybe, in your own little mind you truly believe you are so perfect you wouldn't join the millions who have plastic surgery. Bottom line - she is attractive. Her fame and income prove it. Cha-ching, Cha-ching.
