I enrolled in a degree program for a BA in Business Management. This may be the biggest mistake I ever made. I was completely upfront about my intentions to use my employee benefit to pay for the program. Since I only get $8000/yr from my employer, this meant that I needed to stop taking classes in June of 2005. When I sent an email requesting to stop classes my advisor suggested I could be covered by 2 more since I had some personal problems and failed a couple of classes. So I was encouraged to stick through 2 more classes. She failed to disclose you can't simply do 2 classes you obligate to 4 classes... this means I would pay out of pocket for 2 classes at a rate of about $2500. To make matters worse... I was told to apply for FASFA. At first they say this does not obligate you to a student loan. But somehow I ended up with one that got dispersed to them without my knowledge. I am filing credit fraud against the school. They say they have the money so it is theirs... and it's my problem how I resolve it. Any calls that I make to complain are met with the response that I am the sucker. I agree with the above sentiment... RUN AWAY!!
