I thought I had the best insurance when I was with Progressive, since they were rapid to the scene after a fender bender, and cut a check on the spot. But, after moving to a different zip code, Progressive hiked my rates significantly. I did a quick web search, found insweb.com, who in turn proposed Amica. They offered the cheapest rates among all providers, though they are a little more selective (3 years of prior coverage under your belt, for instance). And JD Powers consistently rates them highest in the auto insurance industry. This I discovered after having already signed up with them. They are without a doubt an unheralded gem. Peace out!
