I do like the Pick'n Save I shop at in Fond du Lac, WI but I detest all of the TV commercials I see. One is the father at the bowling alley with his 2 kids. He cannot find bowling ball he likes. The next one is the mother who looks at the picture of apples her little girl brings her from school. It's just not good enough and the last one is the young black man who is now a doctor working at a clinic and meeting his daughter's family for the lst time. The father starts to feel his arms. Obviously the dad is in the meat dept. I fail to see the humor if it is supposed to be funny. Let's try and get some new TV ads. These are simply stupid! Sue Dawson
