I have not visited Japan but it is my dream to do so before I die. I am learning the Japanese language now (I am an American) and would hopefully feel welcome in their country, whenever I decide to go. I read up on a lot of Japanese background and read James Clavell's books, (Shogun, (Tai-pan ect.) because this seemed to be the one country out of all in the world that truly fascinated me. And I don't know why. Yes, I watch anime, or used to anyway (not the Pokemon crap, but the Hellsing, Cowboy Bebop) and looking forward to the visit. The country is supposed to be very clean, and very friendly, at least through what I heard. Then again I also heard that all of their bathrooms are unisex, and I might be a little more uncomfortable about that. They are a healthy, disiplined people with great culture, and I can't wait to go.
