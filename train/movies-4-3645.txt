While one can argue that The Principal is more of a drama than an action film or a thriller, I believe that it fits under both categories, but more under crime/action/thriller. Regardless, The Principal delivers. It revolves around Rick Latimer (Belushi) who takes the job of principal at a crime and drug-ridden inner-city school. The movie aptly captures the aura of an inner-city school. It has some decent fight scenes and makes a solid attempt at bringing drama into the mix. Belushi is backed up with a solid supporting cast including Louis Gosset Jr., Kelly Martin and Michael Wright. Overall, The Principal is certainly a film to see and delivers in providing a realistic view of the environment of inner-city schools.
