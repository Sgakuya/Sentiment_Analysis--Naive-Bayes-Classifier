Bob Stoops is an excellent coach, but not one I'd classify as great. He took over a tradition-rich program that had been down for a few years due to poor caoching, but had plenty of talent on-hand, and has made it a top-tier program once again. What Bob has not done is take over a program that stunk, and lift it to the heights, such as Bill Snyder of Kansas State or Frank Beamer at Virginia Tech. Even Sonny Lubick at Colorado State to some extent. Let Stoops take over the Baylor program, or the SMU program, and if he lifts either of them up to become one of the top-tier programs in the land, then I will kiss his ring.
