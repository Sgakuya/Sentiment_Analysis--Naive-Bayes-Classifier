I got hooked on Chicken soup for the soul books when they first came out. I own about 12 of them now. I like the fact that they are short stories. I have my favorites that I like to read over again. Like most books like these I like some stories more than others. I like the fact that the books are broke down into categories,in each book. and then there are books that have their own theme. Like Chicken soup for the Mothers soul, or pet lovers{ one of my favorites} unsinkable soul. etc. I like feel good books anyway. I would reccomend these books to those who like books that have short stories. or quick reads.
