I enjoyed Galway much more than I enjoyed Dublin, even though Dublin has many more sights and places of interest to offer. It seems that all of the places of interest (such as they are - mainly shopping and a couple of local sights) extend the distance from Eyre Square (as of now, a total mess because of a dispute between the city government and the contractor who is supposed to be modernizing the area - work has stopped midway in the project) down to the quay area/Claddagh. There are any number of nice shops, a great bakery, and an equally great seafood place (MacDonoughs) at the end of the street. It's much cleaner than Dublin, although there seemed to be an inordinate number of street people and drunks around. A nice city to spend a day in, but not much more. It's a convenient place from which to visit the Aran Islands and, if you're a "Quiet Man" movie buff, fairly convenient to Ashford Castle and Cong. I had to rent a car to get out there, but it was worth it. That's a whole other post, but briefly, many of the places in the movie have changed drastically (or, in one case, the Widow Tillane's house, been razed and turned into a parking lot). Some places, on the other hand, are exactly as they were in 1951. Galway was a nice place to end the tour of Ireland from.
