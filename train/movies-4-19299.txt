Yes, this was a very effective and slightly unnerving slasher film. I have heard this film compared to Halloween a billion times and I still must stand with my views. Halloween is much better. Anyway, Black Christmas is a well thought out and intelligent horror film. The title of course might drive alot of people away thinking it was released during that huge explosion of holiday related horror films (Ex. Silent Night, Deadly Night and April Fools) but this did beat out Halloween and was before the rush of calendar holidays, back when horror was made for the story and creepy appeal over the boob shots and splatter count. This is definatly a very underrated horror film and should be regarded much higher than it is. I am waiting for a remastered DVD to be released. Well, this is a very good and well made horror film aimed at the true fan of horror and suspence. Lacks a little in the believablity department and some of the sub plots are not very interesting. But I assure you those are the ONLY down sides to this great little slasher film. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL HORROR FANS.
