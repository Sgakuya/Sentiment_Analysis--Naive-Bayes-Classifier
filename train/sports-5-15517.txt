He should be the poster boy for hard work and patience in the NFL. Holmes only had a lukewarm reception in Baltimore, where he shared time as the RB with several other players. I thought the guy looked like a good player but never in my wildest dreams did I think he would be the FORCE he is now. Some people says his success is due to the offensive line in KC and part of that may be true, but the rest comes from quality coaches on Vermeil's staff. Remember Marshall Faulk? He was considered middle of the road in Indy only to explode in St. Louis. It's not a coincidence that Vermeil was the Rams coach at the time. Still, that only means that Vermeil can recognize talent; the player still has to perform and that's what Holmes does week in and week out. A great football player.
