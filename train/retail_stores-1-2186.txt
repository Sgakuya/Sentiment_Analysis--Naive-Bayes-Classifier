Don't get me wrong, they have an excellent selection of electronics, CD's , computers, etc. But their customer service sucks! When I was looking to buy South Park Season 1 on DVD, I had to go through three employees before I could get someone to help me find it! And even then, the girl that tried to find it kept thinking I was talking about South Park, The Movie! And don't even get me started on their computer repair services! First off, you buy an extended warranty when you purchase your computer. Yet, the warranty doesn't cover a damn thing!! And then when they say they'll keep your computer for two days, it ends up being five days! In my case, they had just gotten around to fixing my computer on the FIFTH day! They were sitting on their asses with absolutely nothing to do when I dropped it off!!
