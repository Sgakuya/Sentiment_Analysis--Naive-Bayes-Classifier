PEOPLE LSITEN UP. ME BEING EMPLYEED BY HOLLYWOOD AND READING ALL YOUR COMPLAINTS IS STUFF I HEAR EVERYDAY. YES MY EMPLOLYEES ARE SOMETIMES RUDE, BNUT MAYBE IF THE CUSTOMERS TREATED US THE WAY THEY WANT US TO TREAT THEM THERE WOULD BE LESS DRAMA AND MORE RENTING. AND AS FOR BLOCKBUSTER BUYGIN US, YES THATS TRUE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUY US. NOTHNG IS FOR SURE YET BUT REGARDLESS NOTHING WILL CHANGE WE WILL STILL DO THE SAME CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CARRY THE SAME NAME. BEING A HOLLYWOOD VIDOE EMPLOYEE AND READING SOME RATINGS HAS MADE ME MORE HAPPY KNOWING THAT PEOPLE REALLY DO APPRECIATE OUR HARD WORK. KEEP RENTING FROM US EVERYONE =o)
