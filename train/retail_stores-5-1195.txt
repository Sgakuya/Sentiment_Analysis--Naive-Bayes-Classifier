I love just about everything about this company. I love that they have a Don't be Evil clause in their corporate goals. I love that they encourage, even force, their engineers to spend 20% of their time on projects completely unrelated to their job (this was where Orkut and Gmail came from). I love that they send an employee into the Webmaster forums to provide informal Google tips. And I love that their pending IPO is being tagged as the savior of the high tech industry. Yes they have gotten very big and very powerful in a hurry - but so far they haven't abused it. If I didn't already have a job that I loved, i would do anything I could to work for these guys.
