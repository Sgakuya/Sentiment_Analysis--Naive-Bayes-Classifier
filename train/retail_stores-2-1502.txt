I have been a loyal customer of Lord and Taylor for many years. Today I shopped in Woodbridge, NJ for a black tie event. I was very pleased that I found a dress that I liked and was on sale. The dress was originally $218.00 and reduced to $129.00. The dress needed some alterations. I was with a friend and she suggested that we look in the Women's Section since sometimes the dresses fit better. We did find the dress in the Women's Section and it did, in fact, fit better, in a smaller size. When I brought the dress to check out, I was told that it was not on sale. Since it was the same dress as the one that I tried on in the Misses department, I could not understand why it was not on sale also. I spoke to two managers and they both told me that the Misses dress was probably older and the Women's dress newer. I then went back to the Misses department and they told me that the dress just came in about two weeks ago. When I explained this to the manager, I was told that there wasn't anything that they could do. The dress detail: Patra Woman RN65518, 9756Black. In view of the above, I feel that I should be reimbursed for the difference
