A few years ago I would've said this album is better than the fourth, just cause the fourth is so popular. but I agree with medgar evers, since I've been such a big fan, I've not only played the hell out of these albums, but I've also grown up a bit since I got into them. There are some appreciable songs like Moby Dick, LLM and Ramble On. But most of the album sounds too much like the 70s-rock roll cliche and it's the reason why people underrate them. So now I'd have to say that the fourth album is definitely their strongest. But I'd also recommend the first album, it really encompasses their thick, dark and unique sound and their improvisation skills.
