What happened to this woman? I never saw this soap until long after she re-joined the cast, but the constant flashbacks they do pointed out the very severe physical changes she s gone through since her early days. She was absolutely gorgeous in the beginning. Now, she looks like a half-plucked chicken just a shadow of her former self. Her acting is decent and seems to work well for her in the soap world. But she really needs to put on a couple of pounds and fill out that skinny face. Oh, and this is not her fault of course, but the DOL writers really need to dump this Princess Gina thing. I hadn t watched in about 3 years and caught it a few times while convalescing this fall I could not believe they were still using that tired old story line!
