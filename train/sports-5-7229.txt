Believe me, this guy was never under rated while he played! Again, until Magic and Bird appeared on the scene, "The Big O" was widely regarded as the best player ever to play the game. He could run, jump, shoot, rebound, play defense, and handle the ball as well as anyone and had more combined tools than any of his peers. Don't be fooled by all of that acrobatic garbage, that is just an adjustment made to a game that started when Julius Erving took off from the free throw line at the half time show during the all star game one year. Basketball players have always been able to run and jump. They just played the game differently in those days. Back then they actually scored points. Shooting is much more skillful and much more fun to watch than slamming a ball through a hoop that is only a foot or so above your reach. The Big O could put the ball through the hoop. He could also take it away from you and pass it to one of his teammates so that they could put it through the hoop.
