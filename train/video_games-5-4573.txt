A classic strategy game, intelligent and involved, it improves on Sid Meier's most famous game Civilization by adding great scope for different styles of play. One can be a cunning capitalist and attain victory by economic means, one can be a ruthless despot and attain victory by military domination, even a peaceful environmentalist gaining a win by clever diplomacy and many other possibilities. Further, the more menial decisions can be delegated to subordinates allowing the player to concentrate on what they desire. The story isn't too bad either (written by Michael Ely, who wrote three novels to accompany the game!). Planetary colonization has never been so much fun!
