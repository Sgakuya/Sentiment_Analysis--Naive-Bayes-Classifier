A 3.5 would be more accurate. The sequel to Meet the Parents had its moments, and some scenes (particularly anything with Mr. Jinx and the crazy chihuahua, Moses) were downright hilarious. But with a cast like that, I expected a little more. Dustin Hoffman was best in show [I cracked up when he performed Capoiera, the half Martial Arts/Half Dance discipline. He stole one of my gags where I, a Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do, tell people if I ever got into a fight, I would need to tell my opponent, Give me a minute, I got to stretch.] I'm wondering if Ben Stiller is a bit overrated and I began to grow annoyed at the downright mean-spiritness of Robert DeNiro's character. Jack Burns is just an outright cruel Father-in-Law from Hell. I guess the biggest joke is the fact that Meet the Parents grossed more than all the Oscar nominated movies this year combined.
