As an American living in Japan and married to a Japanese man, I have learned enough of the language to realize that no matter where you are (on the train or walking down the street), people talk about you. Loud enough so that you hear them. They stare at you as if you are an alien, if you are blonde, some children may be scared of you,they call you gaijin which means foreigner (I tried to find a word for racist or islander) but ofcourse this prejudice language doesn't have an easy way to say it. The older people are so sweet, ofcourse good food (but different than you think)We like the city layout but hate the pollution (but hey, we Americans pollute too) Some days we want to stay, others we want to leave.The best thing is to talk quietly.(that way they can't tell if you are American or European.)
