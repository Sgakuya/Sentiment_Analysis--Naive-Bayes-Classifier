My life has been spent living in three states- Illinois (hometown), Michigan (college), and Missouri (adult life). Of these three, Illinois was by far the best. I lived in the south suburbs of Chicago and so many doors were opened by this experience. The culture abounds in this stirring landscape, where the differences between people can really be appreciated. I spent some time living in the southern part of Illinois as well, and although I would not say it was enchanting or exhilarating, it was definitely aesthetically pleasing in its own way and peaceful as well. [For reference, I lived near big cities in all of these states (Chicago, Lansing, and St. Louis), so the experiences are comparable.]
