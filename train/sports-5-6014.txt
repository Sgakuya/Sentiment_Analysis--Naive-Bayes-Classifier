Rate JJ Redick, huh? Well, where do I start? He's an excellent free throw shooter (he's 95% - 143/150). He's also a great three point shooter. He made 102 three pointers last season.. If he gets an open shot, he's amazing. He averaged 15.9 ppg. That's the best of any Duke player last season. His defense is not bad as you haters think. He can get things done. He's pretty average.. People say he can't drive the lane.. Well, any basketball player should know, you shoot from game situation.. Redick's on the outside most of the time, so he has to learn to perfect that shot.. If he can't get an open shot, he usually goes for an assist.. Of course he can piss you off sometimes by making unnecessary fouls, missing open shots, or driving the lane and gettin the ball stripped.. Oh well, I guess I'm just pissed at the UCONN game.. JJ's still the man, though.. I hope that he and Duke have a great season, even though Deng left early, Duhon graduated, and there's no Livingston..
