After extensive research, I really have come to respect this man even more than his brother. As a Democrat, I would trust this man more in the Oval Office than I do his brother. He has raised standards for education in Florida, increasing school funding by $1.4 Billion, the largest increase EVER! His plan also provides oppurtunity scholarships for students in chronically failing schools. Meanwhile, he also granted over $1.2 billion in tax cuts to Florida's working families and elderly people, benefiting everyone in the long term and helping to stimulate economic growth. He also signed into law a tough initiative punishing violent gun offenders. His budgets in 1999 and 2000 made unprecedented investment in Florida's schools and working families and again provides tax relief to those who need it most. Governor Bush also vetoed bills that he believed to be inappropriate use of taxpayer money, saving over $2 Billion dollars to invest in Florida's schools and social services. His economic program will spend over $3 billion dollars over the next ten years to preserve and protect Florida's environment. I really, really respect this man and to me is the best of all the Bushes. He's probably one of the few Republicans I might consider supporting for the Presidency.
