Vetoed more liberal legislation than any Cal Republican governor since Reagan. Played the demogogue on law and order issues, opposing efforts to reform the 3rd strikes law to limit the strikes to violent crimes. Pushed deregulation that caused an energy crisis in the private sector run portions of California, and refused to seize the grid and run it like the Municipal Utilities Districts in Sacramento and Los Angeles, both of which not only had no "rolling blackouts" but made money for their communities by selling surplus power to the rest of the state. Tried to be something for everybody and consequently inflicted Arnold upon us.
