At first I was reluctant to view any movie which cast Brad Pitt in a starring role. I remember him in Thelma Louise and I thought okay, but what a slutty part in a film. Then I never watched anything else, I had already form a opinion about him. That was sad. Then I finally got the nerve to see a portion of Interview w/the Vampire . Being gay, I wondered about the movie, because then I was instantly smitten. I finally seen A River Runs Through It , the greatest. I seen Meet Joe Black , how could I have allowed myself to follow my own prejudiced opinions on such a talented and marvelous actor. On the other hand, I get to enjoy in all it's splendor each and every movie he has made for the first time. Sometimes patience is a virtue. Brad brings to life all the characters he plays with amazing results. He wins all my votes, and I wish him great success and a long life with a happy death.
