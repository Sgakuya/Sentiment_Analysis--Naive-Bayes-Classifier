Excellent choice for breakfast..you have your bran, and your sugary raisins, unbeatable combination. However, let me share a story with you about young children and their love of these raisins. Do not, I repeat, do not leave your child unattended with a bowl, box, or handful of Kellogg's Raisin Bran. Let's go back a few years to when my oldest son was a healthy and happy 2 year old..then one evening he began to exude an unpleasant odor..this foul scent soon turned into a rank, nasty, appalling stench. When it got to the point that no one wanted to be near this angelic, kind child, we brought him to the doctor, who advised that possibly the young lad was getting the smell on his hands and face from another source (ie: picking his ass)..The smell continued and no butt picking was spotted..finally the source of the eye watering, dry heaving stench was focused on his nose..a few days later a sneeze forced the inflated, phlegm induced rasin to shoot out of this little angel's nose. The smell was gone, the golf ball size raisin was disposed of and the family rejoiced. Raisin Bran was then boycotted.
