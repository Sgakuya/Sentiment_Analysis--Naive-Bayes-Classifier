The Jets are a great team, but they face huge setbacks this season. With Chad's wrist broken, it seems that their season is over before it begins. But not to fear, the Jets have Vinny Testaverde, but serious questions arise again. At 40, will Vinny be able to carry the team? I think so, he's done it in past years, and we have to have faith. The Jets are in the most unstable division in the NFL. I would not doubt that it is the best. The Dolphins, Patriots, and Bills make for a tough schedule this year. Jets fans can only pray that Chad's wrist heals quickly, but other than that, the Jets team looks good for 2003. Curtis Conway was a good addition for wide reciever with some nice catches in the preseason, especially a nice grab in Tokyo. Defense was also updated well during the offseason The Jets looked good in the preseason going 3-2, but only time will tell if they are Super Bowl caliber. Until then, J-E-T-S! JETS! JETS! JETS!
