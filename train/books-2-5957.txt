this book wasn't as good as Red Dragon or the Silence Of The Lambs. I think Harris should have left it alone, but i guess fan demand and the promise of a lot of money made this book happen. It's a little to ambitious, i think, and probably a little better understood by people who understand Italian geography, culture, history and arctitechture, or have been there and have seen those places. I think a lot of the book was greusome for the sake of being greusome, the graphic scenes weren't really necessary or effective. i read this book because i felt a sense of duty, having read the other two. I only ended up bored, confused, disgusted, and a little disappointed.
