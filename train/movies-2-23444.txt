Crop circles are an interesting concept. They pop up a lot and we don't know where they come from. Some do suggest that they are the work of aliens. That may be, and a film about aliens causing them isn't entirely a bad idea. Shamalan just didn't do a very good job with this. The aliens hate water (you may have read about this on Maddox' page), yet 70% of this planet is covered in water. If they're smart enough to develop ways to travel across the galaxy, I'd think they'd be smart enough to know to stay away from the stuff that hurts them. Also, it's overly dramatic at the end. The concept or idea of everything happening for a reason is something that's okay to explore, but please, don't be so inept about it. I wasn't scared at all by this film. I just thought it was a waste of time.
