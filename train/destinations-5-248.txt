I love Sydney. I usually stay at the Grace Hotel which is central to every part of the city. I have always felt welcome at the pubs I visited, and those living Sydney are always willing to give directions, offer suggestions for dinner, etc. (like most large cities in the US, most residents in Sydney were born in other countries and imigrated). My last visit, I went to the Sydney Fish Market to watch the auction. Take the time to chat with the proprietors in the market. I ended up chatting with one propriter (sp?) and asked him for a recommendation for an early lunch. He said he would cook lunch for me! He grabbed a spiny lobster (huge) from his catch that morning, grabbed a handful of large prawns, and other fish I did not recognize. When we got to the oysters, he said 'no' and we went outside to one of the boats at the dock and he took several handfuls of oysters off the boat. We stopped by a lady selling produce and he got a lemon. We went back to his stall, he cooked up the lobster, etc. in a pot over a propane stove, shucked the oysters, put everything on a paper plate and gave it to me. I asked how much, and he said 18 dollars (which was $9 US). It was the best seafood meal I ever had!!!! You have not had raw oysters until you have had them shucked personnally for you 15 minutes after being pulled out of the water! Sydney is magical in the same way NY, London, and Paris is magical. Some rough spots, some rich spots, and always interesting if you are willing to talk to the locals, look beyond the 'toursist traps', and simply enjoy the beauty of the area around you!
