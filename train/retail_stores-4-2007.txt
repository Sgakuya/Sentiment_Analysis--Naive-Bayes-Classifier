my rating is based on their amazing selection of dvd's and cd's, and because they aren't circuit city. i have only bought a couple of electronic items from them, but nothing really expensive. my biggest complaints are not enough sales people when you really need them, never enough registers open, and i hate having my bag checked when i leave the store. in dvd's and cd's alone i probably spend about $7,500 a year there. started shopping online with them because i hated the ordeal of dealing with long lines. their website is ok but slow, and sometimes i have to enter my password more than once which is irritating.
