Bewitched shouldn't have been made in the manner that is was though. The movie just didn't have that perfect resonance that every good movie should have. With a predictable storyline like that, it just didn't impress me. Will Farrell usually impresses me but it just showed a side of him that seemed to be so uncreative. I can agree with Dr. Kryptic on the fact that he does seem very one-dimensional. Nicole Kidman seemed to be too much of a blonde in this movie (no offense to blondes!). She didn't impress me very much and her character was WAY too naive. Face it, the television show tops the movie any day. Michael Caine was SO highly amusing in this movie - especially when he followed Isabella around in the grocery store and we get to see him as the Jolly Green Giant! XD! He totally made the movie! You seriously have to love the lesser characters for making an uninteresting movie hilarious. @ Joshua: Are you asking for it? Well, if you are, here it is! Just because a favorite actor of yours happens to be in a movie that does not automatically make it a good movie just because the said actor is in it! There are elements that make a movie enjoyable, NOT always the actor. The directing, mise en scene, acting, etc are what actually MAKE the movie!
