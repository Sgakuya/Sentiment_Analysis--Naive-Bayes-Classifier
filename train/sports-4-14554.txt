In an era of specialization, L.T., indeed did revolutionalize the game. I never saw him play a single game as a linebacker, but, if the position were to be re-named, "unincumbered backside blitzer", Taylor would most definately rate as the best ever. His job was to line up five yards to the outside of the nearest blocker and run, usually unmolested, at back of the passer and, having accomplished his mission of driving the defenseless opponent to the turf, wax eloquently on about his prowess as a gladiator. L.T. was a great athlete, but he owed his success to a brilliant defensive scheme, and to a team that featured a host of teammates (Harry Carson, Brad Van Pelt etc.) willing to sacrifice personal glory for the common cause of victory.
