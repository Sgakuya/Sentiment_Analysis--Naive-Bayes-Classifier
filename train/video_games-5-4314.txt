If you like strategy, and puzzles, this game is for you. First time I played simcity was on my son's nintendo and that game was so slow and awful you literally had to have it run over-night before the taxes built up high enough to do anymore building to your city.I took it back to the video game rental thinking what in the heck is this junk. Then one day I woke up and I was thinking about it and all of a sudden the addiction hit. I kept thinking all day long what if I did this or that or maybe if I laid my city out this way it might be better... I thought about it for a week and all I could do with my spare time was contemplate how to lay out a perfect city so I could get those tall skyscrapers they show on the package. I rushed all over town looking for this game, and mind you I didn't have a pc back then, only nintendo. I knew my sister had a pc version but she lived quite far from me and I knew her husband would not let me on her pc as long as it takes to play simcity... looking in every toy store, every video store...nobody had it...not enough interest.... finally I did the unimaginable.... I rented it again and stuck in a game that my son had grown way tired of when I returned it.Finally I got my game *evil insane laughter fills the air*.After playing this incredibly slow version, I get a pc...of course it's not JUST for simcity...no way.... it's for... recipes.. yea, recipes...Get this simcity2000 and wow, the speed, but still you don't have to pay attention to it 24/7 just enough to be able to keep an eye on it while you do other things around the house.... come back, lay down some more roads,and areas. I recently got simcity4 but you have to pay too much attention to this game for it to be any good, and also I have to do all those illegal underhanded things in order to make enough money to keep my city out of debt, maybe I just need to play it some more, but to be honest I really like simcity2000 the best.
