I have flown across the Atlantic on most of the major airlines and last year, flying from Manchester (UK) to Minneapolis thru Northwest Airlines we were put on BMI for the Manchester to Chicago leg of the journey. I am not a business traveller so always fly economy and if the level of standard of service we received in economy on BMI is anything to go by I would never want to fly business class with any other airline. The food was fantastic, the legroom was more than ample, the staff were incredibly attentive, the individual tvs whereby you could watch a movie or cameras from the front or underside of the plane were brilliant. Irrespective of cost in the future (and we only flew with them that day because they were the cheapest)we will always try to fly BMI. All the other major carriers should take good notice of how an airline service should be. I even wrote to BMI after we landed and got home thanking them on a first class in economy service and I've never been moved to write to any company about anything before.
