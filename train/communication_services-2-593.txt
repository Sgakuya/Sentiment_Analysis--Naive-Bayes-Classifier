i was very happy with metro until one month i could not pay, and they disconnected my phone which was ok, because its perpaid service. but the following month i called customer service about reconnecting my phone and they said to pay an amount and i asked if they were going to change my number and they said no. i went to the store at 8pm and paid. the following morning my phone had been disconnected. I called and they apologized and said I need to pay the current month because the payment I had made was for the month i did not use the phone. this is prepaid service, why? and I asked to speak to the supervisor and he said sorry its our policy and there is nothing I can do.thankyou for calling metro and cut me off, and the 2nd time I asked to speak with the supervisor he said even if i speak with you for the next hour I can't help you COMPANY POLICY! thank-you for calling metro and hang up agin.................. I was given the wrong information and not even the supervisors have an idea of meaning of good customer service help. why call customer service if they can't help you? I just lost $41.40 because they were not honest with me. I'm not sure I'm angry, but I'm hurt..... because I trusted Metro! PAY BY THE MONTH! PREPAID SERVICE!
