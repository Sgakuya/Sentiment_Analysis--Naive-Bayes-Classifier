Ever since Clean in Apocalypse Now my friends I were anticipating that exciting and talented teenage actor showing up again and though it took too long for me,he did. He has come on really strong since Cornbread, Earl and Me (which is a pretty good golden oldie by the way). For some reason I love him as the teacher, mentor, father or guide but he always shines as men of honour and depth.In School Daze , Boyz in the Hood , Searchin for Bobby Fischer and Higher Learning he has the strength,wisdom and courage that commands attention and makes us want to truly listen to the content of his words. We always respect him whether he's Larry or Laurence on the credits. One of my favorites is philosophizin' Furious Styles in Boyz .Professor Phipps is real unforgettable too.His presence is formidable and you always have to reckon with his characters as men; Tuskegee Airmen , Othello , King of New York he kicks the proverbial butt.Another wonderful leader is the man in Cadence . His thugs are the most authentic of their kind-- I think he even played the famous forties thug Bumpy Johnson twice; once in The Cotton Club and then again in Hoodlum .His mad-dog tootin' Ike(What's love got to do wid' it) was really a frightening abuser dope fiend.With The Matrix it's as if Hollywood finally came up with a vehicle that would take full advantage of Fishburne's amazing presence. He's riveting and it's wonderful to see him have a slam dunk hit.There's kind of a more obscure one people may not have seen Always Outnumbered where he's hero-of-the-hood, ethical hard.He s gentle, he's hard as nails,principled but when called upon a wretched scoundrel or hoodlum, voice like a Coltrane solo and you cannot outfox The Man(Deep Cover).Laurence Fishburne is a ten.
