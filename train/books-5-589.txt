My dad read aloud Little House in the Big Woods and several other Laura Ingalls Wilder books every night at bedtime when I was in early grade school, and the stories made a huge impression on me. I remember how fascinated I was to learn about daily life on the frontier, including how food was obtained and prepared, how the house was maintained, what school was like, what they wore, what they did for fun, etc. It was mind-expanding to see life through the eyes of someone living in a different time- I never got over how thrilled Laura and Mary were to receive an orange and a peppermint stick for Christmas one year, for example. Yet many of the problems Laura and Mary faced were similar to what modern kids deal with today, such as difficulties with peers and problems at school, making the stories more accessible. When I was older, my family took a trip to the Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum in Mansfield, Missouri, and we got to see many of the things mentioned in her books. The highlight was seeing Pa's fiddle, which had been a big part of the Ingalls' lives. I'm glad this bit of history is being preserved for future generations to enjoy.
