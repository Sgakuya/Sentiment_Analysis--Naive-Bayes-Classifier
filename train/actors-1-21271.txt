Hilary came into our TV world as the preppy and popular Lizzie McGuire, and sure, all the mom's would let there 5-10 year old's watch her, because, hey, she has a good image and she's cute. Then, she turns into a singer, and we all think, good grief, another Britney. Frankly, she has a better singing voice than Britney, and her image is definetely cleaner, but what about quality? Her songs have catchy tunes, and some have good messages, but is she really fit to be up against such singer/actresses like Mandy Moore for instance? Her newer movies, ie: Cheaper By THe Dozen, Raise Your Voice, The Perfect Man, etc, lack in quality. Cheaper by the Dozen was a family movie in which she was a secondary character, Raise Your Voice was a tear jerker, and The Perfect Man is a chick flick. Of course, not a bad resume, and granted she is fairly good looking and popular. Because of those looks however, I have to listen to my guy friends that are between the ages of 15-19 go on about how hott she is and what a good personality she has. My one concern is...I DON'T SEE IT!!! I don't get it! She gets so much media hype, and yet, she is no more talented than Mandy or Christina or Lindsay, or even Britney for that matter. I'm not one for teeny bopper actresses that suddenly come on the scene and think they're all that, but overall, I have nothing against Hilary personally, she is just not my type of actress/singer. I'll always have more respect for Mandy. That was an extremely long rant and I don't know how I managed to say all that intelligent stuff, but again, nothing against Hilary personally, just not a favourite.
