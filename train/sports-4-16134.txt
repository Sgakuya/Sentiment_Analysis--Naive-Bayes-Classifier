If you built the best QB from the parts of other QB's it still probably would't equal Michael Vick , at least physically. People forget his first full year he had the lowest interceptions among starters and a great touchdown/INT ratio. He needs some talent and elevate everybody the way Mc Nabb does and he will be one of the best. Besides his feet he has a cannon for an arm and a nice touch on timing patterns. He is actually pretty good at checking off receivers and making reads. Uhrlacker and Brooks usually have his number but they are the only ones. If he studies the game and works hard and gets some talent with him there is no limit.
