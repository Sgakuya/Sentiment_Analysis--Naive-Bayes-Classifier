Of course, all of Ingmar Bergman's films are oddly felt and Ghosty and that is what Bergman's followers expect and appreciate. bergman doesn't fall short here. Faultless acting throughout. Two sisters come together to whatch over their middle sister's death from cancer. It is an agonizing death and after she is dead, the ghosty part happens. The cancer victim speaks to the others in whispers and it upsets her other two sisters. The eldest confronts the dead sister saying, Why aren't you dead?! To satisfy the dead sister, the other two sisters usher the maid into her room and close the doors while the maid and the dead sister engage in a lesbian encounter. Odd but great. Rent Bergman's best, ghostliest and last film, Fanny and Alexander. It is largely Bergman's autobiography when he was a young man of a wealthy Swedish family. You can really experience a rich Swedish Christmas circa 1920 or so. It is his Masterpiece and in great color too!
