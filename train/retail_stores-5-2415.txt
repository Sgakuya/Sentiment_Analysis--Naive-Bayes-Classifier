Harris Teeter is generally a wonderful place to shop. Yes, they tend to be a bit more expensive on some items, but what you get in return is clean, wide aisles, friendly checkers and managers, and more often than not an unsolicited offer to take your order to your car for you. Despite being upscale, great deals are easily obtainable here as well. Being the only chain in Nashville that doubles manufacturers' coupons up to $0.99, and twice a year has triple coupon weekends. Yes, you can spend a fortune here on gourmet items, but I can affordably shop here regularly for the basics for three people on an income south of $20K. Only once, in 4 years so far, did I have a bad customer service experience, and calling them about the incident brought a prompt and more than satisfactory resolution to the issue. Whereas other stores *cough*Kroger*cough* haven't given me more than an automated response to numerous complaints. The only minor complaint now is that they've reduced their hours from 24/7 to 6am-Midnight which doesn't mesh well with my 2nd shift job. But I make the time to drive 4 miles to go there instead of that other store that is directly across the street from me and open 24/7.
