I read these accounts and I'm shocked! Our movers from Oshawa were the upmost best. We had booked an afternoon move,and although the move started later than I had anticpated,it was my fault for not booking a morning move,as suggested by their office staff. My anxiety was relieved by a foreman,who kept calling me thru the day to give me updates. Now,for those of you,who have gone through this before, waiting for movers,is quite stessful. My wife and I, certainly were relieved when we kept getting these calls, as I felt we were not being abandoned. When the men arrived, they quickly went into action, and our move from beginning to end was done in less than 6 hrs. I was told by various Oshawa movers that from what we had(packrats we are),our move would take between 6 to eight hours. The men,especially the one wearing the blue hat, was extremely polite,and even went so far,as to order pizza for all of us,and he paid! He was so informative,and helpful. The other men,took great pains in wrapping our prized possessions, and took extreme care in moving our furniture. The men stopped once in a while for a quick smoke break. I didn't mind,because as the man in the blue hat stated, we are humans too,and not robots. I came to understand a few things about these men,and myself too. Next time, I'll be a bit more prepared,and will have coffee on! Thanks again, Two Small Men With Big Hearts!!
