I'm a retiree, living on SS, and fall in the catagory of the American Poor. Every year my SS benefits will go up a few percentage, but prices goes up at a rate of at least 10 to 100 times that of our SS increase. It becomes harder and harder to even stay alive. I feel like our Free Enterprise System has gotten too far out of hand. Products should be priced according to cost of production and distribution, and not on how much a consumer is willing to pay. The system as it stands allows the rich to become richer and richer while forcing the poor to become poorer and poorer. We are now unable to afford a Home to live in, Food to eat, Medical Care, or Transportation, because of the Economy, of which the Republicans say is in good shape. The commercial I Just watched, John Kerry addressed the above issues, and I Commend Him for that. I believe that it's time for Government to take control of our Economy, and allow all Americans to Live with at least moderate dignity. Thanks.
