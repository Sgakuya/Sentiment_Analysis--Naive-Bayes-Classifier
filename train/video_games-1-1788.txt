Long time vet of the game here! In 2003, the best online game ever. In 2004, Still the best, but needing some work in a few areas In 2005, totally made a bad decision to change the game. In late 2005, worse decision in the history of online gaming to totally make the game into a complete different game. It's so different now, that only way I can describe it is like you go to the store and bought a nice new sports car, take it to the shop for a needed tune up, get it back and it's now complete different brand, color and the performance is not equal to what a sports car should be, but more like a family SUV or Van. The problem with SWG is that Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) did not stay loyal to their fans who made and help build the game to the success it was in early 2005 and they allow the greed of many to overshadow the quality of the game and the wishes of the fans and players of the game. Even though hundreds of thousands of fans and players in the SWG community protested to have the game changed, they not only did it, but they changed the game twice in less than a year. Bottom line, it's not the same game in any sense of the word. It started out as an adventure but turned into a nightmare. Needless to say, I will never play the game or any SOE game every since they even screwed up the matrix online too since they took over it's production. I am also disappointed in Lucas Arts for allowing SOE to do this to one of the greatest stories ever told. First and foremost, star wars is a story, second it is a game. Lucas Arts allowed SOE to flip it around the other way and tarnished what was once a great game based on the movies into a bad game based on...whatever the heck the developers were thinking. As a result, SOE has lost more accounts for this game than the company will ever admit. In fact, they are misleading new buyers and those interested in reviews about the game into believing that their decisions to change the game as not lost them any accounts in any significant amount. Honestly, I was a part of a guild with over 150 active players. About 10 of them had anywhere between 2 - 6 accounts each. However, due to the changes of the game, the guild no longer exist and none, I repeat, NONE of my guild plays SWG anymore. All 150+ accounts closed.....and I've read in their afficial forums of many other guilds and players who've quit also, yeah but SOE will tell you there are no signigicant loses in accounts. Well, I do call that amount of players, which about 20% of them contributed to testing, /bug findings, New ideas and anything you can imagine to improve the game, leaving the game a very significant lose. This game is dead and will not last another year or two if it don't drastically improve it's customer service, communication witht it's communtity and stop totally redesigning the game from the ground up everytime an issue is raised the the current devs are to incompentant to work out a viable solution for. 15 dollars a month is not worth the completely overhall and lack of creativity this game is recieving with each update. EVerything is based on the current movie that is out and when the movies stop coming, they will have nothing left to build a buzz about so that people will buy the expansions.
