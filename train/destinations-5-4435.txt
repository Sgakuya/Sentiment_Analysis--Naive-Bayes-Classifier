One comment I've noticed a lot about towns which are often thought of as top vacation spots (like New Orleans) is that, while the person commenting enjoyed visiting, several of them also stated they would not want to live there. Well, I would say Indianapolis is kind of the opposite a great place to live, but not one I would put at the top of my list as a vacation destination. Don't get me wrong; it's a pleasant enough place to be and there are things to do - shopping, museums, theatre, good dinning, and all that. But when your biggest and only world class tourist attraction is a race track - even if it is THE race track - which actually runs a race only 3 times per year, well I think you could safely say it is not a town dedicated to tourism. Aside from that, we have a relatively low crime rate, the city is well laid out and easy to get around in (try that on the back streets of Honolulu sometime and Lord help you), and our cost of living is not bad. As a hometown, Indianapolis suits me just fine.
