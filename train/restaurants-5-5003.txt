I've been with the Olive Garden for 13 Years. And yes the Olive Garden has done some growing in that time. But I can assure you one thing for sure is that from the managers to the employees they take a true pride and passion to provide everyone that comes in to the restraunt with a great experience. And no?! the food is not pre made. Trust me every day at 8:00 the prep cooks are cooking fresh sauces and preparing fresh salads and yes every day we get fresh Breadsticks. Is it true Italian.....for True Italian food try going to Italy....but for the hour or so you spend in the Olive Garden I Know you will atleast be able to count on consistent pipping hot great food in a comfortable homelike setting surrounded by people who want to make you feel special and (oh yeah a glass of wine can't hurt my personal favorite is the Bertani Lelave (not as oaky as most chardonays but smooth and refreshing) AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IF YOU LEAVE UNSATISFIED YOU HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF (MANAGERS ARE THERE FOR YOU TO HERE THE GOOD AND THE BAD ---ITS OUR JOB ITS OUR PASSION----- SINCERELY A FAN OF SERVICE NOT JUST FOOD
