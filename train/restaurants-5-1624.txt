Yummy! I really like KFC as an alternative to burgers and fries. I usually get the Colonel's Crispy Strips meal- very good! Sometimes the chicken is a bit dry and not very hot but the spices make up for that. The biscuits are awesome- I could eat a whole meal of them alone. They're so flaky and buttery, and I like how they give you honey to put on them. The KFC prices are pretty reasonable and sometimes they have really good deals or coupons. I also really like the Twister sandwich, a rolled pita filled with chicken, tomatoes, lettuce and dressing. Very fresh and good-tasting! Oh- and they have really good sides- their slaw and mashed potatoes are very good!
