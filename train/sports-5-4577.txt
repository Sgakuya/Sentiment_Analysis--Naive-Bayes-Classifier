John Beilein is the best coach that nobody's ever heard of. I've had a chance to see WVU live and on TV three times in the last couple of weeks, and I was absolutely blown away by how well coached this team is. They run more than 100 different offensive sets, which allows them to get high percentage shots against fierce defensive teams like BC, Nova, and Wake. Their offense is a thing of beauty - imagine Pete Carril's Princeton offense of the early 90's, but with better athletes. Back door lay ups, motion jump shots, pick and rolls - they just don't take bad shots. When they routed BC, I thought that they had just had a hot shooting day. I then saw them play an absolutely perfect basketball game against Villanova in the Big East semifinals and thought to myself that wow, this team is playing some good ball. When they took out Wake Forest, it became clear - Beilein really knows what he's doing.
