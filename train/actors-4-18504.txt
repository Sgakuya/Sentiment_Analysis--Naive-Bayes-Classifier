Back in the 70's or even most of the 80's I'd have given him five shining stars without hesitation. And that would be in spite of the fact that Annie Hall was, for me, the biggest collection of gratuitous and pointless yakking ever captured on film - not to mention one of only two movies to inspire me to leave the movie theater early. Then there was Broadway Danny Rose which I found to be one of the funniest and most touching films ever. So, maybe my issues with Allen have more to do with subject matter or writing than his ability to direct. His personal life is none of my business even though the media seems to think it is. Still, the media attention and his own actions, over the last few years, have certainly resulted in casting a pall on the man and, to some degree, his work is now also seen in a darker light. To sum up my thoughts on the guy - when he's good he's very, very good, but when he's bad he's just a self-serving little dolt - apparently on all levels.
