Arby's is awesome. It's a nice alternative when you don't want greasy, heavy fast food. The thin-sliced roast beef is a different flavor and texture. I love the Arby's Sauce and I always enjoy the curly fries- not too spicy. I have yet to try their Freshmarket Sandwiches but they look good. The only drawback of Arby's are its prices- a bit steep! Just a sandwich alone is over $1.50 or more. But I still like having it around when I'm craving something different from a burger of taco or chicken. By the way, where did they come up with the name Arby's? I remeber old TV ads in the late 1970s that said, America's Roast Beef, Yes Sir, does anyone know for sure where the name came from?
