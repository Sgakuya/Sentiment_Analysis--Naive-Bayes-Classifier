President George W. Bush is a leader in the true sense of the word. He is a man who loves the country and is looking for its best interest. President Bush was left with an absolute MESS from the previous administration. He is not obligated to fulfill any of President Clinton's programs because they were anti-American programs. President Bush wants to secure the future of our businesses by creating a favorable climate, economic and otherwise, in which to do business. It is necessary to preserve the initiative and creativity of our historically strong business organizations. It is necessary to grow the economy by planting seeds NOW! President Bush is proving to be a calm, confidant, and strong leader for America. he is gracious and he has good character. I like him. I feel secure with his administration in charge. It reminds me somewhat of the Ronald Reagan Administration. Under Clinton I felt very insecure. Under Bush I see a hopeful tomorrow.
