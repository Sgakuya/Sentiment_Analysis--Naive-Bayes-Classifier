Sharon hasn't delivered for the Israeli state. At first, I was kind of optimistic about him, my view was that Sharon would make peace just like Nixon did with China and the Russians. My verdict is that Sharon is politically impotent. He has gotten caught in the long running debate about Israeli national identity versus Jewish identity. The basic question that needs to be answered is whether Israel wants to remain a Jewish state or does it want to become just an Israeli national state that is not exclusively Jewish. Being that there will be more Arabs than Jews in Israel by 2013, I would say that it would be wise for the Jews to make a negotiated peace with the Palestinians. If they don't, the world will view them as an apartheid state, making relations in the overall region even worse. Sharon is a fossil, he is caught between the extremist elements of the right wing Likud party and the more moderate elements of Israel's political spectrum that wants to make peace. Simply put, building a Berlin Wall around Gaza and the West Bank is not a long term solution. I acknowledge that it has lowered terrorism in Israel proper, but in the long term, it doesn't solve any problems. As opposed, the Palestinians will only become more and more resentful. Their economy and way of life are being destroyed by Israeli policies. Plus the Israeli national economy, once seen as the future Singapore of the Middle East, is now and has been in the doldrums since Sharon took office in 2001. Taxes are high and the investment climate is horrible in Israel, being that political stability is hard to find these days. In the final analysis, we can argue all we want about national identity, but the truth is that the Jews and the Arabs are going to have to live with each other. Most Israelis acknowledge this and they have to wise up and elect leadership that won't have to rely on political support from the fringe elements of public life.
