Has been a nightmare since you know when. Once flew in from Italy in 2002. I estimate that I was queued up for an ID check FIVE times at the International terminal. Then I was made to walk OUTSIDE of the airport to get to my concourse. From there, I had to go through another 5 lines asking for my ID (including being rescreened). You would wait 20 minutes in one line, only to be herded into yet another long line. Though I had a 5 hour layover, I got to my gate just before boarding (Got to sit in a full flight next to a baby). I heard of 7-10 hour delays from other people going through Philly International. I refuse to book U.S. Air as Philly is their major hub.
