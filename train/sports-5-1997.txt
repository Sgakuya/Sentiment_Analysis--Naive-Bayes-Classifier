You know you hear lot of people now claim their Yankee fans and how great they are and that may be true. If you are a real Yankee fan you had to go through the lean years with the likes of Roy White and Clarke and Gene Micheal playing short yes the same super scout we have now. I remember the first time I stepped through the archway to the field and my little knees began to shake when I saw the stadium were Ruth and Gehrig played and was there in 1976 at fourth game of the world series when Bench and Rose and the rest of the big red machine took the Yankees in four to win and when I left the stadium that day I was still a Yankee fan and will aways be one. Not because they win its because of all the great heros that have played and given their all to get this franchise were it is today.
