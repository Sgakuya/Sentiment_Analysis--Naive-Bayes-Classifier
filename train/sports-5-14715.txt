John Elway is the best quarterback i've seen since watching football...qb that can beat a team with his arm as well as his legs...took the broncos to three superbowls with very little help...won two with a running game....terrell davis didn't win the superbowls, it took both of them....was superbowl mvp with the second superbowl...only qb to start five superbowls....winnest qb of all time...some of the great qbs who were playing at the same era....Marino got to one superbowl with no help....Elway made it to three...Montana was on some of the greatest teams of all time with the greatest receiver of all time...Elway would have won more superbowls if he had Rice and Taylor to throw it to
