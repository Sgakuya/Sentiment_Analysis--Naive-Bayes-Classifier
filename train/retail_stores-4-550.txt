I go to Express whenever I want to buy something a little classy but still comfy and not too trendy. I agree that they are trying to win over the younger crowd-but i have no objections to that-because I'm part of the younger crowd. I disagree with the statement that they have the best fitting jeans ever. Maybe they have fitting jeans-but you have to be tall, thin and almost perfect to look good in them! I'm small, but I'm also short-and their pants do not look good on short people.I love their selection of wacky colors, their sweaters and jackets well enough to rate it a 4, but I don't like how some skirts and pants give you the illusion of looking cool and great fitting until you try them on and then-its like: what the heck happened?
