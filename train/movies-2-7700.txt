Everyone told me it was great, I anticipated it, rented it as soon as it went to videotape, but was still almost completely disappointed in the end. Maybe it's due to my overall lack of attraction to the comedy of Mike Myers but I could never get over the feeling that this movie just had a forced feeling about it. The sight gags were obvious to the point they could have been taken directly from a boy's junior high school locker room - where I am sure the film found its most ardent followers, imitators and fans. There were a few moments when I admit I did laugh. Dr. Evil was probably Myer's best character and the name Fat Bastard alone got a chuckle out of me. But Austin himself was just a nasty, repugnant little creature with an over abundance of chest hair. I guess that should be funny, it just wasn't to me.
