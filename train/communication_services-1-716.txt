I was with spring PCS and Long distance 7 years and I can tell you over the years I have learned they have terrible customer service from day one. I only keep the service since my work was paying the bill. There customer service reps lie and say one thing when you are a customer but the change thing as soon as you try and cancel you plan or try and change it. They also changed my plan with out even informing me that my plan was no longer nationwide and was only local. When I called they told me that they would change my plan only if I signed another 2 year contract. NO WAY! There plans are way over priced also and calls about half the time.
