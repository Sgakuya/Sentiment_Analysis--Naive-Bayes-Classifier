I used to work for Winco foods a few years ago. It was a good job as long as you worked hard. I have read many comments on here and tend to laugh at the people who had bad things to say. If I think about it, I could have awful things to say about any and every retail establishment I've been to. I can also have good things to say as well. I had to laugh at one guys comment about his bread molding faster. Last time I checked, bread came from distributors who sell to all of the supermarkets, not just Winco. Oh and if you put your bread in the refrigerator, it tends to last longer. Heat makes it mold faster. As for rude employees, I tend to write letters if it really bothers me. For the people that have issues with the lack of debt/credit access, I suggest spending 1-3 dollars more per item at your local Safeway, Albertsons, etc for that convience, which I don't think is worth it. Yes it does cost the retail merchant each and every time you use that bank card of yours and even more if it's credit! As a person with over 15 years of customer service experiance, I've learned that you can't please everyone and some people will always look for the bad so they can complain. So if you want to save some money and not get raped on mark up, maybe even be able to affoard to fill up that SUV with gas, shop Winco, otherwise go to another store and prepare to pay through the nose.
