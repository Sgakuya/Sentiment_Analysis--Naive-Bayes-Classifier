I never was a die-hard GNR fan. In fact, when this album came out in '87, I was so heavy into Led Zeppelin (ironically at 15 years old). But I have so much respect for this album as I heard it through other friend's stereo sets, so eventually got it myself. A.F.D. was a bullet to the head to all of the glam rock outfits that thought they were the band of all bands. GNR just exploded onto the scene and bascially said, get the f*** off the stage with that makeup and spandex, here we are to kick some a**! This album is to the 80's as Led Zeppelin IV was to the 70s. It was an album that turned rock over on its knee and it holds up well today.
