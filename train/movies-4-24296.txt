The last movie of this trilogy is more action based than it is plot based (except for the very beginning and the end). This format is less of a drain on all audience members alike (Compared to the Archtect scene in Reloaded). As usual, the movie has good action and special effects (although they are not as flashy or in your face as in Reloaded). The downfall of the movie is its ending (to the movie itself and the trilogy). Here's a hint as well as a giveaway. If you can understand what the Architect is trying to explain to Neo in Reloaded, then you already know the ending of the movie and the trilogy. Timeframe wise, the entire story turns out to be nothing more than a neverending wheel of time cycle (history or the story will always repeat itself). Overwhelmingly, many have been left disappointed with the ending over the few that have liked or loved it. The ending is also contradictory to the entire controlling fate aspect that was emphasized in the first movie. Also, one of the main character's roles (Morphious) is hardly influential at all comapred to Trinity and Neo. This is also very different compared to the first two movies. It's worth to see at least one time. Prepared to be let down though plot lovers and Morphius lovers.
