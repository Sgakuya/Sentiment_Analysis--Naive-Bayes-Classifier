What the hell are you talking about? Racist scum. How dare you sit there and criticise a country just because the President doesn't support the moron sitting in the White House. All you criticising France - open your eyes and you'll see that you are bigoted, prejudiced and racist. And really stupid. And, by the way, you didn't 'fight for' France in 1944...you went off to war like good little boys and supported the imperialist warlords that started WW2...a bit like now, for example. You can't just write off French people just like that. It would be like me saying that everyone in America was a stupid, arrogant, ignorant, bigoted redneck.
