I'm not crazy about Wild Oats. I shopped there frequently in the past because I buy a lot of organic food and it was one of my only options. Over time, I had a number of complaints. I don't think they manage the food turnover very well, for example. I bought spoiled chicken there (which was really disgusting), and the produce is often bad. I got tired of arriving home and realizing that the fruit I purchased was inedible. Once I pointed out a display full of moldy berries to an employee, and he completely ignored me. Perhaps most annoying is the rudeness of the check-out clerks. I'm now able to shop at Whole Foods, and it's a completely different experience across the board.
