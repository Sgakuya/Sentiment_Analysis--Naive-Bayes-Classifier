Except if you go in July it will be ungodly hot and humid. Then you'll freeze to death when entering the super air conditioned buildings. But really, though, HK is such a great place to visit. Lots of shopping (of course), and the MTR (subway) is super convenient, efficient, and clean. Great restaurants - but potentially challenging if you are a vegetarian....like when you order some (you think) vegetarian soup and for some reason there are little salty pieces of ham in it.... Also, if you are a woman, and your shoe size is over 8 (in the US) good luck finding shoes. I wear a 10 and I'm 5'10 . I could not find any shoes that would fit me. When I asked, the reaction was usually shock, horror, and laughter. that was frustrating since I like shopping for shoes. But I digress. Go check out the midlevels escalator, Victoria Peak, go wander around Kowloon up and down Nathan Road, check out the opal mine (they are so nice there and have great jewelery and great displays of how opals are mined if you're into that), go to Stanley market and buy really cheap cashmere, ride the Star ferry (if you don't get easily seasick). Spend lots of time in malls if you go in the summer to cool off. there is no shortage of them. I can't wait to go back!
