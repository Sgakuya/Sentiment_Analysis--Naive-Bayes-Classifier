Despite the fact that there are varying intensities & qualities, all in all this is one of the most popular and versatile of the cheeses. It goes with just about anything, from soups to salads to pastas to hot apple pie. And with intensities ranging from mild (not aged for very long) to very sharp (having been aged for upwards of 6 months, some even being aged for 8 years), there is a type for everybody. You can even get it orange (colored with annato) which does not affect the flavor, or white (uncolored). Either way, it is a wonderful cheese that likely wouldn't have any difficulty finding itself as a delicious garnish in a variety of foods. A plus is that many kids love it, and it makes dinner more appealing to them with the added bonus of giving them a shot of calcium.
