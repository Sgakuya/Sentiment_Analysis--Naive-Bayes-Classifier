I believe that many I believe that the problem many blacks have with Dr. Rice is that it is difficult to reconcile the fact that this talented and intelligent black woman can sit back and defend the record of this president particularly in the area of civil rights. True Dr. Rice had a very difficult journey to get where she is today. But the reality is that because of Bush's lack of leadership on civil rights,it will even more difficult for the black women to get to where she is. If she has as much of the President's ear as many claim she does, one would think she could use some of that influence to keep him honest. Based on what I've seen, she's unwilling to do that which is very disappointing from one black man's perspective.
