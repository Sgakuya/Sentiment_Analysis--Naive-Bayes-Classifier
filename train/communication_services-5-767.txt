Sprint PCS beats all of the other mobile phone service providers hands down. I've been using the service for nearly a year now, and never once have I been displeased. I used to use Verizon, and after dealing with their poor customer service and lying sales people, I switched to Sprint. I am on the move a lot from semester to semester, and it's always had service whereever I've needed it. No other service has even come close to the coverage I've needed. The phones used by Sprint are decent, and the plans are excellent. I get 1500 (250 anytime, 1250 W E)minutes a month for less than $30. My calls are clear, and the service has all the features I want, including voice mail, caller ID, call waiting, etc, all inclusive.
