We shop in the Delray Beach stores. They have narrow aisles where the elderly stop often and block traffic. These older stores are small, poorly stocked and dirty. Staff could care less if shopping is a pleasant experience. Why Consumer Reports rates them in the top three, I do not know. I have shopped often at the two rated above Publix (Raley's in N. Calif. and Nevada; and Wegman's in Central NY). THEY ARE BOTH 1ST CLASS OPERATIONS! THE STAFF IS GOES OUT OF THEIR WAY TO INQUIRE IF THEY MAY BE OF ASSISTANCE. THE STORES ARE CLEAN AND WELL ORGANIZED. THE MERCHANDISE IS WELL PRESENTED AND OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY. IF YOU CANNOT FIND SOMETHING THEY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ORDER IT FOR YOU. tHEY ARE EVERYTHING PULBIX ISN'T. We have been told for nine months that they order maple walnut ice cream but it never seem to come in. We have been told that it is a seasonal product. it is now the season and the story is the same. The bottom line comes before customer satisfaction. In my opinion, shopping at Publix is just about as bad as shopping at Winn-Dixie. What a choice!
