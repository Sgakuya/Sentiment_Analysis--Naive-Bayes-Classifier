About as good a running mate as Gore could have picked. With the exception of Bob Kerry, Lieberman is the most thoughtful Democrat in high office. But unfortunately for Gore, I think that Lieberman might complicate his bid more than help it. Lieberman's not as status quo as Gore -- speaking favorably about SS privatization and school choice (stances GWB advocates). Lieberman's in favor of free trade, which will continue to alienate the Dem base and cause further hemorraging toward Nader. Further, to win, Gore is going to have to win Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. I dont know that Lieberman helps nail those down. Tactically, I believe a better pick for Gore would have been Robert Rubin. I'm happy about this pick because 1) its a good sign to see the Dems embracing someone with a moral center after a decade of so much sleeze, 2) its symbolically wonderful for our country to have a Jew running for high office (and to be so widely respected on both sides of the aisle), and 3) as a Republican, I don't think this will stop the Bush/Cheney momentum...
