This was the silliest thing I ever saw...and I must admit I LOVED it! The whole audience was cracking up with the corniness of modern music in such an unlikely setting (1800s Paris) , but that's what made it so much fun! It was a truly gutsy effort for everyone involved...who knew it would work? Who knew that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could sing and dance? This is one of those movies that you either love or you hate, depending on your attitude and how seriously you take it. Don't take it seriously...just sit back and enjoy the sights and sounds...and laugh. PS I guarantee this will be made into a Broadway show soon.
