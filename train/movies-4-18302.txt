A unique premise and scary aura is what puts A Nightmare on Elm Street over the top as a horror film. The senseless number of sequels has unfortunately tarnished the reputation of the original film. Nevertheless, this film is a solid horror flick. Perhaps the most compelling thing about the film is its darkness. The dark aura of the film is its greatest asset, along with a solid performance by Englund, whose dark performance exemplifies the overall darkness of the film itself. Although I found Langenkamp's performance to be terribly contrived, that's certainly nothing new in horror films. Overall A Nightmare on Elm Street is a solid horror flick that is rightfully considered a classic.
