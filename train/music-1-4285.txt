Give me a break. The 3 remaining Beatles had a lot to do with the release of this album as well as the overpriced Anthology book. Maybe Teaseress should get with reality. These guys will do anything to make a buck, even though they certainly don't need it. Why keep releasing the same thing over over again? Because nobody buys their new material. Hence the re-release of the terrible All Things Must Pass album by Harrison. But people still seem to be suckered by this group, the media's sacred cow. If Apple released another CD next year with 2 songs different than this CD, the same, stupid people, will shell out more money for the same crap as this CD has! The Beatles are ancient history, let it go already!
