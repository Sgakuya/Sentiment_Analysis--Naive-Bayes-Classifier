3.5 would be more accurate. But I'll lean to the high side because it had its moments and the entire family was entertained. It's another one of those computer animated films. It's not as good as the Shreks, Toy Story's, and Nemo, but far better than recent stinkers like Shark Tale and Robots. It's on par with the likes of Ice Age. Movie has to do with a zebra in the Central Park zoo who wants to live in the wild and the hijinks that ensue when he gets his wish. The big-star voices, Chris Rock (Zebra), Ben Stiller (Lion), Jada Pinkett Smith (Hippo), and Sasha Baron Cohen (Gay Lemur) are OK. The only one I couldn't take was David Schwimmer as the whiney, qvetchy and annoying giraffe named Melman Mankowitz (sound familiar?).
