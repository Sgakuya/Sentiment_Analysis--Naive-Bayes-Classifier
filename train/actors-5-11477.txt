Cher is one of the Greatest legends to ever walk this planet. Yes she has had some surgical improvements, but what actor/actress in hollywood hasnt? She is a wonderful singer, a fashion icon, and an unforgettable actress. I remember the first time that I saw moonstruck, i was five. when she gets up from bed and looks at the moon, i saw an angel, an angel that has helped me through hard times. I am in love with Cher, and always will be. I went homicidal once, almost killing my parents and myself. I turned on my cd player, and her song Strong Enough stopped me. I knew then that if I stayed strong for just a few more years, I would be out of my house forever. Cherilyn Sarkisian LaPierre is an angel.
