Because of changes which have taken place in my life I do as much shopping as I can during the overnight hours. The all night supermarkets in this area are no longer open 24 hours so I have started going to my local 24 hour Wal-Mart. As others have noted, the prices are better than other stores and with money being a prime consideration that is reason enough to shop there. The nice thing about shopping overnight is not only do I have no problem finding a parking space but the employees have the time to give more personal service and I have made friends with many of the night crew from cashiers to the stock clerks. Perhaps it is this one store, but no one has ever complained about being treated unfairly by Wal-Mart or backed up any of the popular allegations that I have heard. Of course there are the usual complaints that one would hear from any place of employment such as "I'm tried and I want to go home" but the people who work the night shift there seem as satisfied as one can expect to be in their positions. Perhaps things are different because the overnight crew seem to be more of a fraternity than the day shift and I have always been at home with night people. Between the relaxed night time atmosphere, the more personalized service, the easy parking, the better prices, and the friends which I have made, I see no reason why I should go out of my way to find another overnight store which is more expensive and farther away from my house when I have my local Wal-Mart nearby. It works for me and from what I have been able to determine, it works for the night time employees as well.
