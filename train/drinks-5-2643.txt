For my money, this is the best coffee going. I drink coffee black with no sugar and White Castle coffee has just the right flavor, strength and to top it off you can get a large steaming cup for only 72 cents! Not that I m a cheapskate if I felt that Starbucks or another coffee specialty shop had better coffee I m sure I d shell out 3 times as much money and buy theirs. But they don t - so neither do I. One thing I might mention is that I m talking about the coffee brewed in the White Castle restaurant not necessarily the beans you can buy at the grocery store. I don t know what they do that I can t seem to duplicate at home. It s good but I just can t seem to get quite the same flavor in my own kitchen.
