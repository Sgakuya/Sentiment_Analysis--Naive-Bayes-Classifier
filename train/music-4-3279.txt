I don't like this one as much as some others, though it's worth picking up if you find the original vinyl versoin with the real-life zipper design by Andy Warhol. Wild Horses is the standout, but the rest is only so-so. If you really want the best of the Stones, your first three purchases should be Exile on Main Street (super-boozy early 70s record that capture the essense of rock music better than anything else), Big Hits: High Tide Green Grass (a 'best of' that came out in 1966, capturing their amazing early days - each song is awe inspiring), and Beggars Banquet (from 1968, the best of their 'transition' albums, even though Sticky Fingers and Let It Bleed often get written up more favorably). So there you go. Ruby has spoken.
