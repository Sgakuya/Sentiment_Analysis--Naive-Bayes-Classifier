The metro is an ok system. On the floors of the subway trains actually have RUGS how cool is that. At each station it tells you how long it is going to be until a train gets to your station where its going and what line it is on an LED sign. The bad thing is there is only one on each platform. Instead of a boring yellow line I like how they have flasshing lights to tell you to STAY BACK. The system is clean. But they do not allow food or drinks. That's harsh I guess poor innocent people can't have a nice cup of coffee on their way to work. Or a snack after work if you're hungry. Lastly if you don't see LED signs at the stations how are you going to know what color line the trains are all Metro trains are brown but they aren't brown lines. The only way you can tell is by looking at a tiny microscopic sign at the drivers seat that tells you the color of the line.
