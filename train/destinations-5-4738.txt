My wife and I just arrived back in Colorado after 5 days in downtown SLC (we went to a financial workshop). We went to several outstanding restaurants in the downtown area as well as a place called Log Haven in Millcreek Canyon east of the city. Never, never, ever, ever had a problem getting a drink. While we were waiting for our table at Log Haven, the Maitre 'D asked if we wanted a mixed drink or if wed like to sit at the bar while we waited. The weather was warm and beautiful and we dined next to the waterfall. We were treated like guests everywhere we went and nobody looked at us like we had 3 heads or something. I also noticed in every restaurant, MOST people were having wine or mixed drinks. The idea that SLC is dry must be perpetuated by people who hate Mormons or have never been to this town.
