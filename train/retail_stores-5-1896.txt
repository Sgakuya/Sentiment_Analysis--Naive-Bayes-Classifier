Live some distance from any one of three stores available in our area and can only visit on occasions but greatly enjoy those rare shopping trips for myself and my family for the past forty years or more. Have found the service and quality of the products to be above average and that the Dillard's floor staff and management are always very professional and good in dealing with their customers. Especially have enjoyed shopping at the stores in the Houston, TX, Little Rock, Jonesboro, AR, and Springfield, MO areas. Especially enjoy that the different stores feature some different items in clothing especially which are more suitable for their individual store area. Have nothing but praise for this excellent retailer with whom I have shopped since its stores first opened in the central TX area. If one has not had the experience of shopping at Dillard's, one should visit for a different experience.
