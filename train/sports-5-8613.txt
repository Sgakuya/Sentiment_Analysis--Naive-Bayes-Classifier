Kobe Bryant is the WHACKEST player in the NBA although one of the best. Could anyone honestly attribute ANY of his persona to anyone but MJ? What a poser! All of his movements duplicate the G.O.A.T. from his fadeaway jumper, the way he runs back on defense, his facial expressions, the way he sits on the bench and walks off the court, his camoflouged imitation of Jordan's wardrobe, his voice...And if anyone has heard his pathetic attempt at rapping with Nas, he says 'kick in the door, waiving the flow, flow..' To mimic Biggie and come with whack rhymes like that is tantamount to blasphemy to anyone who is raising the bar for human conduct. I hope AI abuses him in the finals this year. Keep this discussion going. I cannot stand watching this pathetic attempt of a 21st century MJ get props. I should start a website: whackcelebrities.com and Kobe would top the list!
