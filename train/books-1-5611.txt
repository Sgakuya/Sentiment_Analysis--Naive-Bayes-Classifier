Whatever higher power posessed me to read this book I'll never know, but what I do know is that it stunk. So bad! I bought this book thinking it would be uplifting and humourus. That the main character would be someone one could relate to. But I was horribly mistaken. This tremendoulsy weak, needy, pathetic shell of a woman was not in any way the least bit endeering. She complained when things weren't going her way, she complained when they were going her way... Her friends were so undeniably boring and her collegaues were even more boring. Nothing interesting happened and it certainly left a bitter taste. Is this how modern women are? Then we're in some deep trouble...
