I'm not one to judge on a company entirely based on just one experience, unless it is extremely serious. I have not been satisfied with Blockbuster's service the last couple of times I have walked in their doors. A couple of months ago, my friend and I went to rent an older VHS movie (hoping to save money since it wasn't a DVD) and when it was rung up the price was the same as a new release dvd. I looked up on their menu and saw that and thought that was alittle stupid. I went in last week to rent Fever Pitch since it just came out and Blockbuster didn't have any more. I talked to the cashier to see if any had been turned in up front and he said no. I asked him if they do the guarantee raincheck thing since this movie just came out. He said not at that particular Blockbuster because this is a franchise! I was not very happy through these experiences, I went to Hollywood Video after and they were so much better. I know where I'll be renting now...
