Hey I like your comment there stonecoldaustin. Sounds like there is alot of wannabe chewers on here that dont know any thing about the great american chew red man. All flavors are good. The regular red man, red man golden blend, red man select, and the new red man silver blend with out sugar is pretty good. I have even tried the red man plugs. And the red man golden blend totem plug. They are all a great chew. Cant imagine what it would be like with out it on those open roads driving my truck at nights. So you wannabes who think you about chew watch out because there is a truck driver out there that loves to spit out the window and you might just wind up with a wad or some juice on your windsheild and when you go by cussing and fussing and giving me the finger all I am going to do is laugh at you with that wad of red man in my mouth.
