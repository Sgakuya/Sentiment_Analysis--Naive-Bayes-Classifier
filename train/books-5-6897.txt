I feel such a deep personal connection with this book, not because I'm secretely a martian or anything, but because it has had so much affect on me. This book explores so many loops and convolutions of the human mind, society, life, innocence.. the list goes on and on. There so much to this book that with the first read one can only grasp some of what is there, perhaps that which is floating on the surface. However, the rest of the iceburg which is revealed with multiple reads astounds all who read it. It is difficult to even really express how amazing and wonderful this book is. Anyone who disagrees obviously doesn't understand the book, or is just to narrow-minded to think. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR... READ THIS BOOK, AND READ THE UNCUT EDITION. IT'S MUCH BETTER.
