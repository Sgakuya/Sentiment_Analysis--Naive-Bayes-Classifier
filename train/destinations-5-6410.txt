Well, living in South carolina my whole life might be making me kind of biased towards the state, but here goes. I love it here. Ive been to a few states in my very short life, but by far South Carolina is my favorite. I dont understand why most of the people I speak to say "I cant wait to get out of here" and "This place is so boring" etc. etc. Yes I do hear that a lot. I would choose no other place to live. The weather is delightfull for the most part. There are exceptions, like the ice storm that kicked the upstates power for 3 days or more, and the hot, humid summers. Every state has its bad points, aint I right? I love it here, you can choose to live in the quiet secluded mountains or if your a socialite you cant live at the beach. Different strokes for different folks, am I right? And it all depends where you live in South Carolina. I live in the upstate, which is the best in my opinion. In my time I havent seen a tornado in my county, even though there are some around it. I really do love it here.
