I hope people will think about how CCA or any of the Friends cast would feel if they saw that you said they were anorexic or didn't look good cuz of skinnyness or not skinnyness or whatever else. Gosh! Why can't people just notice the fact that CCA and all of the other five of them tend to be funny actors in one way or another on the show and that is why they are so good, NOT because of what size jeans they wear or what their hair looks like. to show you little I care about their looks I can't even tell you what any of them were wearing on the last show, but I do remember their acting ability and their funny lines and witty timing. man, I think it will be so cute to see how CCA and Perry portray a serious couple in the show because I think they both are really good on the show (specially perry, sorry cox fans. dont dislike cox just not as much as perry. Maybe this is just an opinion of mine and every else thinks it is ok to call cox anorexic, make every comment under the sun about the other peoples, and tell Perry that he is less than attractive and anything else you think of because he gained weight. Does no one else gain weight? just a thought.
