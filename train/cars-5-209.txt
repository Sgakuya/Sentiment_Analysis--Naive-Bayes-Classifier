Polaris 700 EFI has awsome power. I had the 2002 with carb, and the differece is unreal. Plenty of power. I ride here in Calif. in an area known as StoneyFord Off Road Vehicle Park. Some of the stepest hills I've ever been on. Some of the hills are over two miles long as steep as most sand dunes I've been on. My 700 flys up in 2 wheel drive no problems at all. The main advantage is my friend who has a 660 raptor has no problems either, but he is a lot more tired at the end of the day than I am. The Polaris suspension is so far better for rough riding than the Raptor. Granted, if you race on a moto X track or something to that nature the Raptor has the advantage. But I wouldn't trade my Polaris 700 EFI for another ATV. I can go any where I want as fast or a slow. Also it works great my my 4 weeks of deer hunting.
