I've been through this airport about three times now and have had no problems with it what so ever. This airport is small, clean, pleasant and easy to navigate. The last time I was there (post-911) I noticed a real contrast in getting through the extra security compared to the more irritating experience I had a few days before at my home airport. This may have been due partially to the comparatively smaller size of the terminals but I think it also had something to do with good organizational skills on the part of the staff. All in all, this pleasant little airport helped make my long travel day very bearable.
