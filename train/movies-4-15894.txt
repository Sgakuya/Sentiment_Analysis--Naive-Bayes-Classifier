Didn't quite have the impact of Fellowship of the Ring but I don't know of any other movie that does. Ocean's Eleven is still an enjoyable film. Now tell me; who decided that Julia Roberts is really attractive? She had some decent moments acting in this movie, but if I was casting it, I would not chose Julia for the pretty gal being fought over. In the beginning of the film I think Brad Pitt forgot to even act, but he did better as time went on. The characters are unique and amusing. Matt Damon and George Clooney were good. The plot is full of twists and turns and the movie's full of adventure. Playing Clair de Lune in the background at the end was a nice touch; I don't know why they chose that song, but it worked somehow. This was quite an entertaining movie and I'd say it's definitely worth seeing.
