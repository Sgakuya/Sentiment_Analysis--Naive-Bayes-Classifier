First, there is the news....... then there is what's REALLY going on! The best place to get the real story is from O'Reilly. This book could really teach Americans some lessons. No one that NEEDS to read it, will read it because they are already brainwashed with the PC Police and liberal policy. Face it people!! If you have a problem with this book, you are the reason this country is going to fail! Now I am going to blow off some steam....... 1) If you think Bill is rude to his guests, don't like to hear people disagree with him, or is a "Whiner", then you just don't get the point of "The No Spin Zone". Pay attention to the discussion and not just the raising and lowering of the voices. Bill has a real good team of fact finders at his disposal and the do their jobs well. If Bill gets mad at a guest, it is because he has already put the facts on the table and confronted them with it and they are trying to "spin" the truth so that they don't look bad. 2) Ludacris did not get fired because of O'Reilly. Ludacris got fired by his own actions and words. All Bill did was hold him accountable. 3) Liberal pinheads and Kool-Aid drinkers will never believe that Fox News and O'Reilly are "fair and balanced" because their minds are so warped with lies and deception that they have no sense of balance. 4) I believe in the "Community Brain Cell" theory. I believe that there are millions of people on this planet that share a single brain cell that is suspended over the Earth. there are so many people using it that it reacts like a computer on overload. Sometimes, people lose their connection and have "DUHHHH!" moments. During those moments, they begin writing liberal policies which always sound good to other CBC users. Why? Because all CBC users are liberals!
