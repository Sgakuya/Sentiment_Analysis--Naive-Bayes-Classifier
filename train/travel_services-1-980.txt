NEVER USE THIS COMPANY!!!!! We have had a nightmare with this company. They simply were awful on all counts, several days late from a promised delivery date, trying to extort more money upon delivery inspite of being late, damaged goods, and most recently an on going problem with an un-delivered bike. They now claim (after several weeks of the runaround) that the bike was delivered and likely stolen from our secure undergound garage. I have never, ever, had such an experience as a consumer/customer. I honestly believe they lost my bike or kept it as my wife would cave in while being intimidated for the movers for more money.
