A game that's meant to be played on rainy days or when your great-aunt Bertha (and yes, I do have a great-aunt Bertha) comes over for a weekend visit. This game takes FOREVER to play, unless you play the short version whereby the title deeds are shuffled and the players select a couple from the deck and pay the bank what they cost. My grandmother introduced me to this game when I was about 6 or 7. I used to really enjoy playing it but I grew to dislike it after awhile because my friends and siblings became too cutthroat. Everyone wanted the railroads or Boardwalk, and you'd get razzed if you ended up with a loser property like Baltic Avenue. (Personally, I was always enamored of Ventnor Avenue, though I really can't say why.) If I'm not mistaken, it's been one of the most popular games in the country, if not the world. The Soviet Union banned it because it represented decadent Western capitalism and exploitation of the working proletariat. Today I would be loath to introduce it to any of my children, simply because I feel it promotes unneccessary competition. I don't disapprove of competition per se, but when it exacerbates financial stress (even though IT'S JUST A GAME!), people frankly don't enjoy it any more. I've witnessed my siblings get into fights because one of them is in the hole and the other has fifteen bazillion hotels on all their properties. If Monopoly had (has) any redeeming values, it taught me rudimentary math, such as multiplying the rent times the cost of X houses or X hotels; how to make change, and to be responsible by paying my bills (property rent) whenever I landed on someone's property. I always wanted to be the battleship or the car, and I never knew that the guy with the top hat and walrus moustache actually had a name until a few years ago. (His name is John Q. Public.)
