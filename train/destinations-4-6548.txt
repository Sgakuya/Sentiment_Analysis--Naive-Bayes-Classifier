Positive Attributes:I moved just Northwest of Houston in January 2002 from Kentucky, and I never thought I'd like it here. It turns out that I was most certainly mistaken. I love it here. The school that I attend is the best that I have ever attended, and I have made some great friends along the way. The people are generally friendly. And it is a geographically and culturally diverse state if there ever was one. From the lush forests of Houston to the desert plateaus of the panhandle, this state has it all. And a lot of history in San Antonio and Dallas! Negative Attributes: Nothing really negative about the state itself- but I think that some things need to be changed here in Houston with the damned mess that the Department of Transportation has created.
