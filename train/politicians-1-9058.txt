Can't I give less than a 1???? Clinton was fortunate to inherit a good economy (look it up, it's true). He then proceeded to squander his political power on a litany of left-wing lose-from-the-start initiatives. Gays in the military, socialized medicine, etc. Clinton allowed the export of US supercomputers to the People's Republic of China. The Chinese now have more supercomputers (capable of designing and developing massive weapons systems) than our combined US Department of Defense branches and all US defense contractors COMBINED. Thanks, Bill, for handing a loaded gun to what will be our most bitter enemy in the upcoming two centuries. Perjurer, liar, phony, sell-out and pawn of foreign interests. THAT is Bill Clinton's legacy. To state otherwise is to ignore reality.
