Consistently ranked by sportswriters, players, coaches and NFL employees as one of the top 5 football organizations in the League. Great team, great attitude, great pride and morale, excellent coaching staff, GM and front office, outstanding legacy as a franchise, great city to live in and fans to play for (speaking from experience), easily one of the most respectable and respecTED franchises in the NFL. Sorry that all you naysayers are so obviously misinformed. Don't base your entire opinion on one bad season that was plagued by injuries, few teams have accomplished what they did between 1997 and 2004. They have the foundation necessary to properly re-tool, rebuild, and come back. We hope Coach Fisher will NOT go ANYwhere until he retires in 20 more years or so.
