wow. what can i say, more pissed off teenagers whining about their problems even though their parents are rich and they always got what they wanted. i wonder, has coby dick ever seen a picture of himself? ive seen hundreds of pictures and in everyone of his pictures he looks stupid as sh*t. as for this cd, if your looking for deep lyrics or though provoving songs, RUN. all you'll find here is papa roach's pathetic attempt to mix hip-hop and rock. but if you listen to it, you'll laugh your asses off at its simplicity, therfore making it very entertaining to listen too, and, isn't that what musics all about anyway's?
