To begin with I must say that he is terribly underrated in Hollywood. He is the best actor I have yet seen in any movie - I mean, think about it. He transforms so much from one character to the next, a prime example being Peter Pan where he plays the shy Goerge Darling as well as the extravagent James Hook - and he added another dimension to capt. hook (not being just a silly villain)...the change is amazing. He gives his all into every performance and uplifts silly or unbelievable movies, such as The Patriot, into 4 or 5 star ratings. He is an amazing, blood-chilling villain on screen and a warm and charming person offscreen. I don't know him personally, but when every journalist says the same thing about him you begin to believe it. Also, he is amazingly good-looking and those eyes! *melts* anyway, I say he is SO SEXY but I rate his talents and mind above his looks, even if they are what they are. I think he is a wonderful person. And all you guys obsessed with Sylvester Stallone, you're slightly cooky 'cos if you hate Jason so much get outta this board!!! I personally think Sylvester Stallone is a 1 dimensional action actor but I'm not ratting you about it like you are us! GET A LIFE.
