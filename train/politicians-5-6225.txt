Bill Clinton took this native Floridian from out of obscurity and gave her the freedom to do what she believed to be in the best interests of our society. Perhaps the reason so many people detest her is that she took principled stands for what she believed in, and even though she may have had poor judgement in a few cases, she did not pass the blame or cast the accusing finger, as so many other people in positions of power would do. I really respect and admire her cool, calm demeanor and poise in the face of adversity, from right-wing wackos and Re-smug-licans who could not look past her political appointment by Clinton, to militias and other sundry paranoiacs who vilified her as the Devil incarnate. As an Attorney General, there is no way on God's green earth you are going to be able to escape the scrutiny the public heaps on you, and in light of some poor judgement (Waco) and some tough, but ultimately correct decisions (returning Elian Gonzalez to his father despite pressure from anti-Castro zealots), Janet Reno has done America a tremendous service for her steadfast courage, her ability to admit she was wrong in the past, and her commitment to fairness, decency, and the best interests in the public's safety. Being able to hold fast to your beliefs that may be unpopular to some people despite the environment in which you operate is deserving of my respect any day. Janet Reno will be remembered by this person as being a decent lady who stood tall as detractors took potshots at her.
