I would normally give a 5 to one of Dave's book's but with the nature of this book it isn't a 5. It's horrible the things that happened to him. Dave's books have really turned my life around. I was a victim of abuse and with Dave's help I became a survivor. He helped me see that there is nothing on this earth that we can't resist or Survive with help from God. He gives us strength and power to conquer all as long as we will listen to him. You are only a victim if you allow your situation to win! Stand up and bust through those wall's the devil puts up to hold you back. Fight for your right to survive. Thank you Dave!
