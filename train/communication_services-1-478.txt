This is my first post. I can't locate a rate it forum for Alltel telephone company. On 3rd May 2005, I paid (North Georgia) Alltel $150 via VISA. My residential line was operative the next day. I decided not to buy the house and called Alltel on 6th May 2005 at exactly 12 noon. I requested service termination by no earlier than 5 pm. Service was terminated before 1 pm the same day. I've contacted Alltel customer service several times and sent numerous emails requesting the return of my deposit. Here are some of the responses from their service representatives: The check is in the mail. You will receive your refund no later than 21st of July (which year?). We mailed the refund, please check your mail again tomorrow. Oh, we added $12 more dollars to your refund, so that bumped it up to another pay cyle. You will get a check from us in the amount of $120. Yes ma'am, we are charging you $90 for 3 days of service (that's theft and extortion) Your refund is only for $60 (that's ridiculous). As of today (26 July 2005), I was told by another Alltel rep that I would receive a refund in the amount of $60 no later than August 1st (which year?). I informed the rep that I was filing a complaint with the FCC and contacting my attorney.
