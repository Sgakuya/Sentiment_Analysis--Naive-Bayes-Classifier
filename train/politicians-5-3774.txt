I think that, in Bush, we have found someone that we can all get behind. If you watch the media coverage, if you listen to people talk - Bush grabs attention every time. Why? Because there is something about him you can't ignore - he IS what he appears to be. His supporters admire him and think he wonderful. His critics obviously feel he's too important to ignore. I think it is unfair and unfounded to attack Bush's intelligence. Gore may have a silver tongue - but his words are meaningless to him and to us because they have no foundation. Bush may take some time to think about what he wants to say, fumble for words now and then - but when the words do come out they are to the point, honest, and in earnest. I would rather a president with integrity than one that is quick on his feet. I promise there is not one great document (the Declaration of Independance, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, anything) that was written on the spot!
