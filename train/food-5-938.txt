Why is this so far down on the ratings? The flakes are multicolored and thick, with a pleasant taste when eaten dry on their own. In milk, they stay crunchy and after a minute of soaking, the strawberries soften enough to be edible. Unlike Corn Flakes with Real Bananas, the flakes are still crunchy by the time the berries have been fully hydrated. The milk turns slightly pink and a little sweet afterwards. Special K Red Berries is also lower in sugar than many of the other cereals on the market, though it still boasts a sizable 10 grams. This cereal's fruity flavor is wholesome and natural tasting, and I fully endorse it.
