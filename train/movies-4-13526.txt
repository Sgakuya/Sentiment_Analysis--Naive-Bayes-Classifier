 American Beauty was a very good movie, but considering all the hype that was surrounding its release, it was a bit disappointing. I might have even given it five stars had it not been for the total commercialization of this film and how it was shoved down our throats before it even came on the big screen. It's a great story of life, death and everything in between. I thought that Kevin Spacey was phenominal as Lester, whose character truly evolves in this film. In the beginning it seems that Lester is chained down by some unknown force, and as the film progresses, we see him emerge and celebrate his newfound freedom . I also thought that the insights of Ricky (Wes Bentley) were very inspirational and worded perfectly. Everyone involved made this film great, and it was capitalized with a phenominally emotional ending, which has someone already wrote, successfully punctuates a story of glory rather than demise.
