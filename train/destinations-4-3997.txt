Very nice area, although getting expensive. Just like any other city, with both good and bad areas. Tampa Bay seems to attract either the best society has to offer or the worst. As a city in Florida, transients are an everyday event, and can be divided into to categories' those that come here looking for something better, and those that come here to get away from something at home. The former, once they get used to the lower pay of the north, seem to stay because of the lifestyle. The latter, well they seem to leave within a year after they realize that you take your "baggage" with you when you move. They move on to other Florida towns or other cities to lay low and dodge the bullet with their name on it. As a former New Jerseyite looking for better, its been a great town for me, and did more for my resume than Manhattan ever did. By NJ standards, I live in a resort (my apartment complex with pool, tennis courts, exercise room, etc), and live around the corner from some beautiful beaches. All in all, a great experience, except for one thing...the goddam tailgaters on the roads. There are some dumb-ass rednecks or disturbed yuppies that seem to feel that driving up your ass as 70 mph over a bridge is acceptable behavior. Thanks to my NJ upbringing, I know that a simple handful of change thrown from the roof of my car seems to alleviate that particular problem, though. So, if youre looking for something, Florida is probably a good place for you, and Tampa Bay one of the best places. If youre an asshole on the run, run through and keep going... and don't tailgate on your way out
