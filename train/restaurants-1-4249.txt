My wife, 14-month old twins and I just had a bad experience at Macaroni Grill in Milpitas, CA on Saturday 10/29/2005. We arrived at 5:30 pm and asked for a table. The staff told us that the wait is 20-25 minutes. After 20 minutes, I asked them for an update, but I was told that the wait was still another 25 minutes. The hostess gave me this lame excuse that a reservation did actually check in so now they no longer had a table for us. In the mean time my twins were cranky, hungry and tired of waiting. The staff didn't try to accommodate us at all, or rectify their mistake. They didn't even apologize. We all left in disgust. Extremely poor service.
