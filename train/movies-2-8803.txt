I was extremely disappointed in Best in Show. The plot sounded promising (a group of bizarre people compete in a fancy dog show), but it fell totally flat. The show relied too heavily on the same jokes, few of which were clever or original, and they were repeated over and over again. For example, jokes about promiscuity and homosexuals were incorporated from start to finish, and they weren't funny even the first time around. There wasn't enough of a focus on the dogs, in my opinion, and I didn't enjoy any of the human characters enough to care about what happened to them. Watching the movie, I felt bored and restless, and I found myself looking at my watch. Don't be swayed by the cute previews- Best in Show is a dog!
