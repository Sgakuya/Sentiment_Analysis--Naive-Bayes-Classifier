Hey Geordieboy...BOOO!!!...Ugly American, did I scare you. You re absolutely right; we love our country and ourselves. The land of the free, the home of brave. Our forefathers fought, bled and died on our soil to build this country and soils all over the world to keep it free. Their blood also paid the price for freedom for several other little spots on the map to help keep them free as well. Do we think we are the best, you re dog gone right we do. So a 7 year old gave another kid an inhaler and got in trouble, at least she didn t chop her down with a machine gun to put her out of her misery or get dragged in the street for her crime. We have our problems like anybody else. Just look around this whole site and you ll see people griping and complaining about everything and each other. But you better look at the response you got too, a lot of this stuff is for play and fun, but we are serious when we say Don t Tread On ME. And that s one thing we all agree on.
