This car was a lease. I have really enjoyed drivingit for the past three years. Torque steer is resolved by new tires, i got Kumho Ecstas. No major problems SO FAR. That is why I will turn this car in. I took it to the dealer with 50,412 miles on it for the 50k check up. I said please check out the transmission, it is a little sticky. They said that I needed a new transmission for $4K. The warranty was not valid, I had more than 50K miles on it and I would have to pay for it. PULEEZE!!!! I told them fix it now or fix it in three months. Saab refused to budge. Both Saab and this dealer have lost a customer for life.
