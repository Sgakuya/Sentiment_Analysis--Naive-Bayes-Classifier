Didn't like it. The costuming and make-up were amazing but that, along with Helena Bonham-Carter's performance, was the only thing really notable in this movie. Well, actually, the sets were pretty cool, but the storyline(or lack thereof) and poor performances kinda ruined everything for me. Mark Wahlburg had no defined character whatsoever. He just walked around trying to look macho(and failing.) The blond chick just walked around and looked pissed off. Kris Kristofferson(sp?)has like one line and then dies(not to spoil it for anyone)and Michael Clarke Duncan's character got little screen time(and what screen time he got was wasted with stupid ape screaming). Tim Roth was the most disapointing of them all. I loved this guy in Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and was expecting an electrifying performance. All I got was more of the same angry-ape-screaming. This movie should have a subtitle-Planet of the Apes-Angry ape screaming. (like the Phantom Menace..you know..anyway) Everyone just seems pissed off all of the time. Which In certain circumstances is understandable, but not all the freaking time. The whole monkey-marky-mad chick love triangle was just a mess, too. Does he like the monkey? Does he like the angry girl? Does he not like either of them? All in all, I would not recommend this movie. Go see the campy-yet-fun original. Charlton Heston's deliverance of you damned dirty apes! will give anyone a nice laugh.
