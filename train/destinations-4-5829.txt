A good place to visit or live. Best tourist attractions probably Door County, Wisconsin Dells,Kettle Moraine State Park, Milwaukee Public and Art Museums and Zoo, mitchell domes, Miller Park, State St/ Capitol in Madison, Apple River in N Wisconsin, and the Lake Geneva resort area. Fairly progressive politically, especially in Madison. Milwaukee and the Lake Michigan shore provides lots of activities. North and southwest parts of state has rolling hills and lots of forest. Traffic, pollution and crime are minor problems here, even in the larger cities. Except for the Packers, Green Bay is a nothing. April thru October is the best time to visit.
