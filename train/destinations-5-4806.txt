BEAUTIFUL CITY surrounded by white peaked mountains, is magic and friendly. At the heart of the old district can be found the largest historical center in Latin America, filled with wonderful colonial European Renaissance art treasures miked with the artistic flair of the indigenous and mestizo peoples, and rightly named by UNESCO a World Cultural Heritage site. The new metropolitan district of Quito has large avenues, good entertainment relaxing green areas and first class hotels. The food is very good too. As with any large city in the world you must ecercise good common sense, but the bottom line is that Quito is the best choice to get to know a little bit of Latin America. I'm planning to go back next year.
