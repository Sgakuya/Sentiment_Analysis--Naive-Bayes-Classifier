I bought my '97 JGC Orvis Edition with 55K miles about 4 months ago. I've had a few minor repairs so far (new front brake pads, frozen handbrake, recharge the A/C), but nothing worth carping about. I love the color combination, the silver exterior with the tan/green interior is something that everyone comments on when they see it for the first time. Power from my 5.2L V8 is more than adequate, though gas mileage is between 14 city and 18 highway. (We leased a 1996 JGC Limited with the V8 from '96 to '99 that got 18-20 city and 24-26 highway... Scout's honor!) Interior space is more than enough for us, I love being able to haul anything from an antique desk to 12 bags of refuse on all-city dump day. The best part is that since our other car is a two-seat roadster, we finally have a vehicle to pick up friends from the airport, et cetera. Do yourself a favor, find a lightly-used (MUCH cheaper than new) Grand Cherokee and let the good times roll!
