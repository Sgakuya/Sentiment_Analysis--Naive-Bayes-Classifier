How much do the voters in Massachusettes make from the Kennedy family for voting in this drunk pig term after term. Try to remember, the rest of the country has to live with your decisions at the booth and we haven't forgotten the bridge incident and never will because that says it all as far as his character is concerned! Most Democrates are for raising min. wage and human rights, try voting for a human next time. He is just another example of what dirty money can buy. Next time he drives off a bridge drunk, he should take the rest of the Kennedys with him and lock the doors. The only thing you can say is he has to live with all that he has done, and dude, there is not enough hail marys to get you out of it.
