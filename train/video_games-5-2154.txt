Truly, one of the greatest games ever created. From the brilliant mind of genius Shigeru Miyamoto, Super Mario 64 is a truly mind-blowing experience. The first 3D game that I ever experienced, Mario 64 was innovative in so many ways. It is still the gold standard of 3D platformers, with its flawless camera systems, open-ended level selection, item-collection-and-boss battling fun, and side quests. The graphics were pure nirvana--clean, bright, and smooth as silk. The music was excellent, and the presentation was bar none. With endless replay value, this is a must own classic for anyone who calls themselves a gamer.
