By this time both my friends and detractors know that I reference the Congressional Quarterly when citing bill and vote numbers. I will omit them from this review but if anyone wishes to have the CQ specifics I will be glad to supply them. This post is in regards to a portion of John Edwards voting record. Mr Edwards twice voted against President Bush's Jobs and Growth Reconciliation Tax Act of 2003 and twice against 2001 Bush Tax cut. He also voted twice against implementing a $792 Billion tax cut. He voted 12 times against the Full Marriage Penalty Relief, 8 times against repealing the death tax and twice against making the Estate Tax Repeal permanent. He voted against the Child Tax Credit and in 2000 voted against the temporary suspension of gasoline tax. Sen Edwards opposed and blocked the Bipartisan Energy Bill. He voted twice against the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Package and sponsored a motion to kill a liability exemption for doctors providing pro bono services. In 2002 and 2003 he voted to kill medical malpractice reform. In 2000 he voted against the creation of Tax Free Education Savings Accounts for Children, to be used in payment of public or private school tuition. He has voted against banning partial birth abortions and also voted against the final passage of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. He voted against voluntary background checks for gun purchases and voted to reduce defense spending by $3.1 billion. (He was one of only 16 senators to do so) He voted to strike $110 million in spending for the UH-1H Huey II Helicopters and voted against the $87 Billion Supplemental for postwar Iraq. From 1999-2003 he voted with Senator Kennedy 90% of the time and from 2001-2003 he voted 90% of the time with Senator Clinton. The vice president is always just a heartbeat away from the presidency and serious consideration needs to be given to the person who, in the event of a tragedy, could suddenly become the leader of the United States.
