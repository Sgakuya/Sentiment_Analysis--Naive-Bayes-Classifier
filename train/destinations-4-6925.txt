I am pretty shocked at the people that are rating the southern states..Many of them are saying that it's backwards and uneducated etc..The worst one is when they say that the south, Mississippi in particular are bigoted and racist..They spout this stuff off while not realizing they are being just as bigoted and racist as the people they say are prejudiced. I have lots of family members from Mississippi and Alabama and they enjoy living in these places. The people are nice, the food is awesome, and theres alot of great music. The scenery can be nice too. Now I am not a racist, but I don't care how someone thinks. If your racist, fine, thats your right. It may not be right but it's not everyone elses job to tell you how to think. It seems that in the future based on our crusade against bigots, were going to have thought police. I just think people should care less about that whole thing. It seems stupid. Any way, I give this state four stars because I really like it for the reasons above mentioned, but I've seen prettier states like Wyoming and Maine.
