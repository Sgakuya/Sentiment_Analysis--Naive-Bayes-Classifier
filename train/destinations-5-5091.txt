For so many reasons this is one of the best states in the country. Obviously 3/12 Anonymous hasn't really spent anytime in NY state or else he/she wouldn't have made such a ludicrously sweeping statement about how unremarkable it is Some of the most beautiful Seasons anywhere, wineries, finger lakes, the thousand islands, adirondacks, catskills, Niagara Falls, the Hudson River Valley, Lake George, Lake Erie, Ontario and Champlain (home of Champ), as well as some of the best Universities in the country. Unremarkable? I don't think so, if New York State is unremarkable then you must be supremely remarkable. JMHO
