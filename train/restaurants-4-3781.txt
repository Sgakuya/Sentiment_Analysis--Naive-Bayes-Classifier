Worked at ROund Table back in the late 1970s. Excellent quality ingredients used and I never saw a single employee spit on the pizza; either before or after baking it. RT was my favorite pizza back then, irregardless of my working there. It tasted the way I felt a pizza should taste. Too bad the manager was such a twit. It was great how one of the employees cracked the code to the safe and kept hiding the important documents!!! Ahem..... it WAS good pizza but I don't know if the quality and taste is still there since I moved to a state where RT doesn't have any outlets. Maybe I should see if they would mail me a pizza.
