Nick Nolte is a veteran actor, who, yes has had some unfortunate issues to deal with in his personal life, but he is extremely talented as an actor. Who can forget his awesome performances in 48 Hours and its sequel with Eddie Murphy. He was also good in I Love Trouble with Julia Roberts. However, his best role is probably his least known. He was phenominal as Thomas Jefferson in the love story/historical drama Jefferson in Paris . He had an awesome presence in that film, and I suggest that anyone who is interested in Jefferson watch it. In the final analysis, Nick Nolte is a pretty good actor who could do so much better if he got his personal life in order.
