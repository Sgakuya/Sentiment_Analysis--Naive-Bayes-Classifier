Kansas City struck me as a fun place. Worlds of Fun was exactly as its name describes. Also, the tailgating at Arrowhead Stadium is a sight to behold if you are an NFL fan. I'm not a Chiefs fan, but Chiefs fans are among the NFL's elite tailgaters (up there with Steelers and Packers fans). The radio stations in Kansas City are good too. On the downside, some of the highways in the area seem oddly-designed (too many left-lane exits, as well as a confusing freeway jumble near downtown). Also, when you head out of the city to the south, east or west, there's still plenty of development, but head out of the city to the north (especially past Liberty), it seems like the metro area just suddenly dies. Overall, a nice city, though.
