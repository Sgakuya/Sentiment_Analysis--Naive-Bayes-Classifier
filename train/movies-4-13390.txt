Whatever you think about Robert Zemeckis adaptation of Winston Groom s heartwarming novel elegaic yet subversive vision of the American Dream, or conservative and reactionary American fable Forrest Gump is an extraordinary achievement. The story of a simple man with a complicated destiny, it s anchored by Hanks, who takes to the role like one o them ducks in water , earning his first Oscar among the six-pack awarded to the film. Too bad it didn't deserve Best Picture over The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. By the way watch out for a young Haley Joel Osment as Forrest's son!!! It really is a classic when you think about it. From the jungles of 'Nam to champion table-tennis. From the Black Panthers to a shrimp-boat and running across America, Forrest Gump is an amazing film. Summary: A GREAT FILM THAT DIDN'T DESERVE ALL ITS OSCARS.
