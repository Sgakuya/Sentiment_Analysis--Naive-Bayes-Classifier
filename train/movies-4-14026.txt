All of the women in this movie did such a wonderful job, with the exception of Julia Roberts. I just didn't think she was very convincing. I know alot of people think I pick on her, but she really can't act, and the only time she did moderately do some acting, was in Erin Brockavich. AND...the scene in this movie where Julia Roberts gets a short haircut, this will show you just how truly homely the poor thing really is. She is not pretty by any means. Why she was ever cast in PRETTY WOMAN, is beyond me...ugh! But Shirley McLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Daryl Hannah and Sally Fields probably did the best performances of their careers ! A very touching movie. The only thing that annoyed me was the fake southern accents...and for that it lost one star.....
