Pretty good war movie. Yeah, it's full of all the standard cliches and typical, tactcal gaffes but hey, it's Hollywood. Based on the reviews I expecte the love story to drop the bomb on this movie, a-la Pearl Harbor but I didn't find it getting in the way . . . too much. Again, based on reviews I expected seriously flawed character development, but I was surprised to find that I actually did connect with the main characters. It wasn't a CGI special effects, gore-fest either, which was refreshing. As someone who is a stickler for realism in uniforms, gear, grit and grime, I couldn't find any fatal flaws. It looked period. GI's looked GI. Finally, most importantly, it's a great story of great people doing great things. I recommend the movie and the many books on which it was based.
