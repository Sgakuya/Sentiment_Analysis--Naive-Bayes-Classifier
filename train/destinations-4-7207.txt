I guess that Munich is so nice because it's in Bavaria (as opposed to Germany). Been there a few of times in the 1970's thorough the 1990's. The natives were mildly friendly, food was good, and everything ran on time (to a fault). It's a nice place to relax. I probably mssed a lot by just sticking close to the Rathaus and the marketplace, but even that can be enough to get the flavor of the place (I think!). Hotels were OK, but most of everything tended to be somewhat overpriced. Traffic was very much in ordnung (I had a couple of Germans literally try to ram me because I mistakenly made a turn against a red light). And the rest of Germany says that Bavarians are too easygoing! A good place to visit for a couple of days.
