Her best was Victor Victoria but recently I watched Mary Poppins and she totally nailed that role which would of been damned hard. People said it was NOT acting but that's why she is brilliant in it as she makes it looks so natural ! The Sound Of Music was her 'Opus' in many ways but nodody could have pulled it off like she did (maybe Debbie Reynolds?, maybe NOT?) SOB was an embarrasment as was The Tamarind Seed, 10 and Torn Curtain but none of them were her fault. Still looks good but has had some 'work done' which is OK at 70....Still a class act and one can only wonder at how great she would have been in 'My Fair Lady' for which she ould have also won Best Actress surely.....
