you can say what you want about fords. i will tell you this - i run a shop in which we build show trucks and offroad racing trucks. there is a reason a majority of enthusiasts run gm motors and trannies in their fords during their buildups. f150 frames are as tough as the aluminum sections they run in the rear (a low speed collision from the rear means you taco your frame).. fords can't tow. their trannies fall apart (c4/c6/e40d). you can't buy buildup kits for them, they have to be extensively modified in order to take any kind of abuse. there is no stock ford truck that is faster than any stock chevy. from a mechanic's standpoint, there is no reason to buy ford unless you were simply raised a ford guy and know nothing else. there simply is no comparison between the two unless you have 'ford' engrained in your soul. gm has always been faster, better looking, and more dependable.
