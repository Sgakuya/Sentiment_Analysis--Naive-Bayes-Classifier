I stopped in Honolulu on my way to Australia, so I wasn't considering it a destination spot. In fact, I didn't expect to like it very much because I thought it was going to be very touristy. The minute I arrived, however, I absolutely loved it! Sure, it was touristy, but its spectacular beauty and unbelievably pleasant weather enabled me to overlook that fact. I did the usual tourist activities (Pearl Harbor tour, Dole Pineapple Plantation tour, etc.), and I really enjoyed them. The highlight was snorkeling in Hanauma Bay, where I saw lots of beautiful fish and sea turtles. I'll definitely go back to Honolulu sometime, and I'm thinking that it would be fun to visit some of the other Hawaiian islands as well.
