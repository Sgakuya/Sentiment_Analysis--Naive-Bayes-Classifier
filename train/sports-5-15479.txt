Randy Moss is without a doubt the best receiver in the league. I see all you people say he cant lead them to the Super Bowl. Tell me one receiver who as ever played, who played for a crap team and an iffy quarterback who lead their team to the Super Bowl. Lets see.. Jerry Rice? Wrong, he played for good teams with two of the best quarterbacks that ever played. Marvin Harrison- nope. Terrell Owens? enngghh wrong again. Wow what a surprise. Put Moss on the colts with Manning, or 49ers with garcia, and he Moss would have way better numbers this year. When Randy Moss played with good teams his first two season, he put up staggering numbers, and was one play away from the super bowl(thanks gary anderson aka Mr. Choke.) Lets face it, he has trouble with taking off plays, but what receiver doesn't, they just dont have the balls to say it. Moss is clearly the best receiver in the league with Harrison and Owens in the dust.
