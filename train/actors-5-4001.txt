While it's hard to come up with a new angle to add to the all ready excellent comments about Ralph Fiennes, here goes! For me, Ralph is simply the finest young actor of his generation. Hands down. I cannot say enough about this man's courage in his choice of roles (how many actors peel back the layers and examine the motives/feelings of flawed humans so delicately?), his integrity in pursuing that knowledge, his willingness to risk alienating the audience if it's true to his character, and his amazing success in translating pain and love to us. I have always admired the projects he selects; they bear witness to a man who is concerned with moral issues and historical precedents in the larger world. I will never forget the chill that ran up my spine as he drove into the picture frame in Schindler's List ; I instantly wanted to know more about that character. I would strongly argue that there was no actor better suited to conveying the multifaceted longings of Oscar Hopkins in Oscar and Lucinda . And I'm grateful to the correspondent who mentioned his work in The End of the Affair , that was a wonderfully subtle performance that was unfortunately overlooked. But then subtlety, honesty, integrity, and intensity are hallmarks of all of Ralph's work. To this admiration of his professional abilities I would also add my approbation of his person. In his own time Ralph explores his craft with up-and-coming young thespians and serves as a spokesperson for UNICEF charities. He is the very antithesis of the image of the spoiled, egocentric Hollywood-type (and kudos to him for avoiding the typecasting trap that has brought down many a less-talented actor). A closing thought - if you've not seen Ralph perform in a Shakespeare play, don't miss it! His love for the works, his amazing ability to translate and deliver the poetry, and the wonderful modulations he can make with that incredible voice, are best experienced LIVE.
