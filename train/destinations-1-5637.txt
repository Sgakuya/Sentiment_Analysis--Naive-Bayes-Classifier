Only left wing liberal elitist a$$holes think Massachusetts is a good place to live. The only state in the union losing population! The Commonwealth is an economic basket case. Companies are leaving or closing every day. Two dollar a gallon heating oil has doomed Massachusetts to oblivion. U-Mass conducted a study on how Mass residents cope with the high cost of living here. 45% of the respondents say they are leaving or planning on permanently leaving Mass. 45%! Attend any Florida Lifestyle Expo. They're packed with people desperate to get outta Mass. I have relatives who've left the state and they don't even visit when they have vacation they're so ecstatic to be free of this communist utopia! Households are paying up to $500.00 a month to keep warm this winter! Massachusetts has had serious economic problems since 1991. The high cost of heating oil will doom any chance the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may have had to inprove it's economic condition - corporations just aren't going to pay these costs when they have so many other choices. The best thing the United States can do with ALL of New England is to cede the area to Canada where it can become part of the Maritime provinces and be supported by Canadian welfare. I can't leave soon enough!!!!!
