When I first heard of this film, I dreaded the idea of Jim Carrey playing The Grinch . However, after finally seeing it, I not only enjoyed the film, but I thought that Jim Carrey did a pretty good job at playing the not-so-jolly green fellow. I really plan on watching this movie every year around the holiday because beneath all the humor lies a lesson in the real meaning of Christmas, and I think that espescially now we need to be reminded of that. A lot of slapstick, sarcastic, and silly comedy which makes for a very entertaining holiday flick. It loses a point for going a little too far away from the origional story, but it's still highly reccomended.
