Along with being one of the most attractive current actors out there, this man is able to play several different types of characters without any hardship. One only needs to watch Sunshine to realize his abilities. Playing a madman in Schindler's List, an intelligent rich son in Quiz Show, a deranged serial killer in Red Dragon. Casting him as the lead/main squeeze in a movie with J-Lo was both an insult and the most horrible thing that anyone has done. Making such an actor 'dumb down' to create a doomed flick is seriously wrong. If the movie does in fact turn out to be good, it is his part alone that does it. As a hater of 'chick flicks', the way he played in English Patient made me like it immensly. That is quite hard to do since most chick flicks make me want to hurl.
