This game is one of my favorites for the Dreamcast, although not so much now that I've played Sonic Adventure 2. The graphics at great, although at times the camera can be frusteration. I've always liked Sonic games more than Mario games because of the faster pace that the games set. I wish they had left Big out though, as he serves no real purpose in the game other than another play mode. Also, this game had a deep and intricate storyline that amazed me. True, the English voices were downright awful most of the time, but I usually listen to the Japanese dialogue with the English subtitles on, anyway. In my opinion, this game remains one of the best Dreanmcast games.
