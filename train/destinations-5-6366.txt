I'll be the first to admit that Tennessee has it's problems, but if we research any state in the country, we can dig up as much dirt on them to make ourselves feel a bit more surperior. One thing that really bugs me about the poster below me. You rag on Tennessee for being backward and having too many fast food resturants, then you label the poster as being a stuck up yuppie for frequenting some of the finer establishments the area has to offer. And then you practically accuse an entire football team of being date-rapers and thugs...and without evidence to support your statements. You label us as racists, but your comments are very judgemental and certainly without merit. Your fact finding mission is both outdated and inaccurate. But of course you would have known that if you bothered to read about the state wide city to city drug task enforcement currently in place to wipe out the meth epidemic, which by the way is gaining more ground by the day in your beloved northeast. Your findings would have rendered another interesting fact -Tennessee just approved a $23billion dollar budget increase specifically designed for educational improvements for the entire state, and Tennessee is currently undergoing radical changes to implement more astringent divorce laws, mandatory waiting periods for divorce, mandatory pre-marital counseling, and an abolition of the no-fault divorce law. Memphis is the only city from TN that ranked as one of the top fattest cities in the US, coming in at number four. Philadelphia came in #2 and New York came in as #8. Both of those cities are in the Northeast if my memory serves me correctly. As for racisim? We don't have the corner on that one either. I've been to the Northeast...and let me tell you... the N word did not originate in Tennessee. Considering Tennessee's efforts to improve, along with it's friendly people, gorgeous scenery and plethora of things to do, depsite your opinion, I'll give it a five.
