Cingular Wireless is the bomb! You get a bunch of services with a good price, and not only that but you also get good reception. I have been with Cingular for at least 6 months now and I wish I have been there longer. If you need to change your plan, they'll do it for no charge (unlike T-Mobile-a 1 year mistake). They have rollover minutes which are cool. If you don't use them all, you can use them later. I have had all my problems solved by calling or going inside a store, but other than that, every cell phone providers have their problems. I have had problems with my phone (Motorola v551) and I have no problem getting replacements. However, I just received a Motorola Razr v3 and I can't get insurance on it, but at least I have a warranty. The reception is always at 5 bars on my phone (maybe if I'm in a remote area, I get fewer, but that's expected) and I have had fewer dropped calls than with any service provider. I have done a little research since I got ripped off by T-Mobile for a year with no service 9/10ths of the time and customer service didn't help. No cellular phone company is going to promise the best reception, but when my 2 years are up, I'm renewing with Cingular!
