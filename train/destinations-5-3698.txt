Denver is a good one. It's an All American City for the most part. Of all the late model Western cities Denver sets the best example of urban planning and has the brightest future (as opposed to Phoenix or Salt Lake City). This area has a very progressive environment. The metro area is expanding it's light rail and commuter rail lines throughout the entire area which will drasticly improve quality of life here and bring more people into downtown. Brilliant! The LoDo area of downtown is pretty cool with restored buildings from the late 1800's and turn of the 1900's and it definately has an eclectic atmouspher. Coors field where the Rockies play is also in this part of town. The people here are really nice and energetic. I admire that it is among the fittest if not THE fittest city in America that other cities should pay attention to. I can't say the city is very visually stimulating and feels rather ordinary but I suppose it's worth a look around as there is enough to do for a day or two but all around I would rate it great for living and just OK to visit. Denver's biggest asset is that it's in Colorado and has easy access to some of the worlds best skiing/snowboarding, Rocky mountain splendor and an agreeable climate with lots of sunshine.
