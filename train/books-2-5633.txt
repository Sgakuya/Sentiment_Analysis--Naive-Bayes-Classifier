Basically this story is about two women, each of them going through a rough patch in their lives that decide to switch houses for the summer. Maeve Binchy has always been one of my fave authors, because her character and environmental developments are remarkable. Unfortunantly sometimes, it makes the story suffer. This is what has happened here. Everything that is written is brilliant and clever, but it never really evolves into a deep novel, instead it seems to float around on the surface. There was always something unfullfilling about this book. It lacked her usually charming and endearing characters and instead you were left with stereotypical, one-note characters. The weak women were REALLY weak, the strong women were bitches - there were no inbetween. Ria was so delusional and codependent that there were a lot of times I wished I could slap her... hard. Gertie was so insistent on seeing the good in people that it made me want to shake her and try to get her to face facts. Of course neither of them did. This isn't up to the ordinary Binchy standard and I honestly can't say that I'm any wiser from having read it. So all in all... if you don't have anything else to do, and am a Binchy fan, this'll pass the time.
