As a person, a jackass. Although I have to admit he is extremely intelligent and I appreciate the way he respected his father and godfather (Willie Mays). As a player, he is off the charts incredible. His stats from 2001 to today are something out of a science fiction book. They look like numbers from the best player in a coed slo-pitch softball league. He has the all-time single season HR record, with 73. He gets on base so often that even if you took away all his hits from 2004, his on-base percentage was still better than the NL's hits leader, Juan Pierre. He has 7 MVPs, 4 more than anyone else. The downside: never won a world series (neither did Cobb or Williams); actually was mediocre in his first 4 seasons; and BALCO.
