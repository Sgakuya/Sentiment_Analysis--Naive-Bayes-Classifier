Simply stated, one of Roger's greatest, and worst acheivements all rolled up into one great album. He was able to create his most intricate and complex album, but sadly his personal relationship with the rest of the band was severely damaged in the process. All that aside, I LOVE this album. I have both the studio album and the new Is There Anybody Out There live album. My preference right now is the live version, and if you haven't got it yet, check it out. You won't be disappointed. The album, tells the tale of Syd and Roger's lives combined into one. How many people out there were able to write an album that had a definite story line (even if it is somewhat hard to follow in places), let alone take two separate story lines and combine them into one fictious rocker with some serious issues? In the end The Wall was probably Roger's finest hour, though there is much to be said of the other albums as well.
