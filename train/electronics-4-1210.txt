BowChikaWowWow , you are an attention seeking rater hater. Hate to be rude, but you are. These are very good machines, and loading songs onto itunes only takes a couple of minutes for say, 20 songs. Loading them onto the ipod takes about 5 seconds! The have great graphics, cool games, and are very easy to use. The are quite heavy duty, and generally really cool! The small disagvantege is that it is quite heavy, and the silver back gets grubby. However, this aside it really is nice. BowChikaWowWow , why did you use something with a cracked screen? It is not Apples fault if you are irresponsible and use a broken machine. I bet the story isn't true, and if it is, you probably stupidly dropped it, by not being careful enough. Your chatspeak also incriminates you. Bridget888, don't be discouraged. Sometimes things just break, as ipods are like mobile phones...they don't live forever. A cool product.
