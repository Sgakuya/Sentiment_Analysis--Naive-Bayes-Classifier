I think of George W. Bush as The Executioner . Since he became Govenor of Texas there have been more executions in Texas than in all of America's states put together. He is responsible for the Texas rating of Number One in smog filled air (selling out the people of Texas for his oil buddies). As Govenor, he is responsible for more hungry children than any other State. And his claim of higher test scores of the schools under the accountability testing - sure because in order to test high, the teachers are teaching how to pass the tests and the same kids that look good on the tests cannot read or write. We all know about his previous cocaine arrest and his alcoholism. Do you also know that his regime has replaced first time possession arrests with stiffer sentences and eliminated rehabiltation of drug adicts. If The Executioner become President - what will he do to ruin our environment, women's rights, social security and the economy???
