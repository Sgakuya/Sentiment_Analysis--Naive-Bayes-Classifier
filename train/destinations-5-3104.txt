Culturally diverse, architecturally beautiful and fascinating, surrounded by fantastic natural settings, San Francisco is a one-of-kind city. People are very friendly and it's not at all difficult to navigate. Fisherman's Wharf is more like a theme park than a real slice of San Francisco, but even here there are some bits of history and magnificent Bay views. The neighborhoods are where it's at: full of local color, friendly small businesses, beautiful old Victorian houses, a good mix of ethnicities and language. And they have first-rate restaurants out the wazoo! Tends toward the expensive side, but a little hunting will track down good bargains on places to stay and eat. Breathtaking coastlines and redwood forests within minutes of downtown. This city is a must-see for people who enjoy travelling.
