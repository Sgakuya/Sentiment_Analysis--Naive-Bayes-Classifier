She is AMAZING! Just listen to the vocals on this record and you'll tottaly fall in love with her. I did anyway. If you think she is a bad singer.... take a look in the REAL world... you had nothing better to do then slag off Christina's CD, then you must be sum ugly person who has no friends...who cant listen or look properly! Every single song is a great tune, from Ballads, to Up-Tempo songs...Personal highlights go to Genie In A Bottle , I Turn To You , When You Put You're Hands On Me , Reflection and Blessed ! TOTTALY amazing. Who wouldn't want this CD? Loosers... I know! Great.....Inspirational.....THE BEST!
