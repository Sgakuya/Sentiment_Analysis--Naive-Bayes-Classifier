I was watching the NBA Hall of Fame induction ceremonies this past weekend and it reminded me of how special of a ballplayer he was. This guy could handle the basketball better than anyone since Bob Cousy. And, he was an incredible clutch player. Some of his biggest games came in the playoffs including scoring 16 or so points in the final minute and a half against the Knicks and blowing up against the Lakers in the Finals with a badly sprained ankle. But, what I think may be most impressive was how great of a leader he was. He won on every level and always backed up his teammates. This was most evident back when the Pistons were still making a name for themselves and a young Dennis Rodman made a ridiculous comment about how Larry Bird wouldn't get as much recognition if he weren't white. Instead of ignoring the situation or blasting him, Isiah (even if he didn't agree with Rodman) spoke out about how Rodman had made a good point and that took all of the focus off of Rodman and put the heat squarely on Isiah's shoulders. Of course, Rodman would not learn from that mistake, but I digress... I think Isiah will do some good things as an NBA coach.
