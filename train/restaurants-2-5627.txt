I have been to the Furr's restaurant on NW 63rd Street for years. The food has always been good and the service usually pretty good until tonight. Tonight, all was good until I went to the cash register line to pay for my meal. The cashier, Terri, was being very rude to the couple in line in front of me. I thought to myself, How rude; however, I thought perhaps they had said or done something rude to her. Then when the the person I was with approached her to pay for our meal, she mumbled the amount which he misheard. He ended up writing the check for $1.00 less than the amount. I corrected him and said, It's ok, I'll give you this $1.00 bill to take care of the difference to avoid him having to write another check. Terri yelled, You have to write the check for the exact amount! Very rude to us in front of the customers behind us. The person I was with wrote a new check. I asked for her name and she ignored me. I asked again and she said, That's our policy sir. I replied, I don't have a problem with your policy, I have a problem with your attitude. I again asked for her name. This time she told me. When I called back later in the evening to speak with the manager, I learned Terri also had the accountability of answering the phone. Needless to say, it took me forever to get through to a manager after she told me they had all gone home, then disconnected me once, then put me on hold and hung up on me again. Terrible, terrible service. The food is good, but it's not worth the abuse.
