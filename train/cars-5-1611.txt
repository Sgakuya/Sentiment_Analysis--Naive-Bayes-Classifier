I have had 2 nissan sentra's, both 1983 models. They are tanks, I have but them through the crapper and back. I have delivered pizza, not doine any maintenance, crashed them, and they keep going strong. I rev the snot out of it, and it doesnt do anything but go. Also, I must comment, someone buys a new car, and doesn't like the seats, so this makes a car/maker something to watch out for??? There are PLENTY of aftermarket seats you can buy, PLUS this amazing invention, seat covers/inserts which give you lower back support. Also, don't always believe what a mechanic says :). Sentra's are tough little machines, I would not hesitate to buy another sentra.
