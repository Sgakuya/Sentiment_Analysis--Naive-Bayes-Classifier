Beijing is easily one of top 5 filthiest cities on earth. . .it is so crowded it takes 50 minutes to go anywhere b/c it's so big and crowded. . .you will run into an occasional taxi driver who might rip you off. If you can live with these things, you must go to Beijing. . .I felt it had some of the friendliest people I have ever met. Incredible sightseeing (Summer Palace, Forbidden City, Tianemmen Square, etc.) Good food, affordable shopping if you invest the effort. This is one of those cities where it might better to go by yourself- Beijing simply doesn't work if you have four different people with a map who want to see different things. 4 or 5 days in Beijing is enough to have a memorable time without getting bored by yourself. Also, go to SIMATAI (Great Wall) not BADALING. Badaling (Great Wall) is a tourist trap whereas Simatai is less crowded because the Wall is much steeper.
