Cant give any Politician a perfect rating butI like this guy. Mr Bush so far has been the most direct and honest President to come along in years. I think His sudden down turn in Popularity is because of this. He doesn't want to accept all the bullshi;; that Terrorists like Saddam hand out because he knows what kind of tyrants they are. All these bleeding hearts that think there is any other way but force to deal with these people are misguided. The 'bully' on the block never backed off just because you asked him to...He had to be bested by a better guy, and then sometimes he did turn inot a friend. Saddam is the same. Bush is not at fault for the economy, I dont think any president could have been prepared for 9/11 and I believe it is still the biggest factor when considering the bad economy today. I do want him to quit preaching and do this thing.(War) Its been too long and I want some results. Quit talking and go take this guy out!
