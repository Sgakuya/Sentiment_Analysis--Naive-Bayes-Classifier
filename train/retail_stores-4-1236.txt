Despite my leftist tendencies and the fact that I live in San Francisco, I am a big believer in capitalism. I have no problem with big companies just because they're big. If a company can consistently offer a quality product or service, they deserve to be big - and they deserve to make lots of money. I have never been in a Starbucks that wasn't clean and well run. The coffee always tastes the same, and always tastes good. They displace some smaller coffee shops because they are very good at what they do. In terms of corporate responsibility, Starbucks seems to be doing all the right things - they adhere to green policies and have great benefits for their employees that extend to domestic partners. I know they're big, and I know they're everywhere - but that by itself doesn't make them evil.
