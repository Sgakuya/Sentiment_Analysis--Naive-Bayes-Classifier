Since seeing Jason Isaacs as Col. Tavington in the Patriot, I have made it a point to follow as many of his past roles as possible. He has played such a vast spectrum of characters, from villains to priests with the kind of talent that draws you into his role. His use of subtle expressions and his ability to adapt to any type role or accent lend credibility to his handsome good looks. Look for Mr. Isaacs in Sweet November. Go back and see Armageddon, Soldier, and Dragonheart. Jason Isaacs is one of those rare actors who can make you actually empathize with even the most evil villains. He is on his way to the top!
