We saved the National Zoo until the last day of our vacation. Seeing several zoos, I was very disappointed during our visit in October 2005. Many exhibits were being renovated or signs stating temporarily upgrading exhibits. The male panda was outside sleeping, the female and newborn were viewed via closed circuit television; the lion and lioness were sleeping; the newborn cheetahs,as well as all the cheetahs, were also sleeping. We read the signs were it states the "cats" sleep 20 hours a day but 80% the animals from 9:30-2pm. I was surprisedto see some animals alone without other interaction of same specied animals. There is one tiger, one zebra, one ape. They looked bored and unhealthy. The best part of the zoo happened in the first twenty minutes of arriving at the zoo. We watched the elephants bathe and the hippo get fed. Most animals were lounging and inactive. I would not recommend this as a stopping place on things to see in Washington DC.
