It's not the best store in the world but where I live there's not that much choice. In my local wal- mart there is a grocery section and their prices are much lower than the other grocery in town. They have great prices on things like cereal, juice, ice cream, salsa, frozen fish fillets, and those Healthy Choice frozen dinners. Their meat isn't the best in the world, though, and sometimes the produce section is kind of nasty. They have avocados marked up to a dollar and a half EACH and hardly ever mark them down. They just let them sit there and rot. And at $ 1.50 each, believe me there are many rotten avocados, almost the entire stock! Also what I don't like is they are too cheap to hire cashiers. There will be twelve lanes and only 3 are open. The employees are not too friendly and not too helpful, the quality of a lot of their merchandise stinks, and they have a poor CD selection. If it wasn't for prices I would give them a zero. ( Note: I don't do much shopping at Wal- mart except for groceries).
