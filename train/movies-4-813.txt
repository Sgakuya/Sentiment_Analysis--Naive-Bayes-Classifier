I have to agree with some of the reviewers here about the holes in the plotline specifically involving Bruce Willis's off camera actions: When did he eat? When did he sleep? When did he shower? Etc,etc, etc. However, this is one of the most riveting and dramatic explorations into what happens when we pass on and don't know it. What I found so moving was not that the ghosts were there, it was that they were frightening someone so vunerable and young. This little boy is literally living out everyone's childhood fears about the Boogyman in the closet! Haley Joel Osment was outstanding in this film; he really conveyed all the fear, confusion, and sadness that the character experienced and helped the viewer to feel, rather than observe, these things as well. The subplots helped to make the film as a whole so fulfilling and because of them the film played more like a book than a movie. I was so impressed with the scene of Osment and Toni Collette in the car: a heartwrenching and joyful scene where Mom finally begins to understand her son through the ghost of her own mother. And Bruce Willis has never been more pleasantly surprising as he was in his portrayal of the logical and compassionate Dr. Crowe. This film is a rare gem with an engrossing plot, intelligent dialogue, and damn near perfect acting. I do have to give it four stars for the previously mentioned holes! But to be fair, this film has sold itself to be horror film without the cheesy gimmicks of Scream or The Blair Witch Project and still managed to find its way into the minds and hearts of those who can't stand horror movies!
