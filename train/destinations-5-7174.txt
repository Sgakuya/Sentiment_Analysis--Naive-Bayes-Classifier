Venice is one of the most unique cities in the world. It is built on a string of low lying islands at the end of the Adriatic Sea. When you first enter the city, you wonder why the sea hasn't swept up the place. Venice is right at sea level, just a few steps above water. Start out with the sights in St. Marks Square like the Basilica with lots of interesting mosaics dating to the 13th Century I think and the Palace Ducale. After that, it should be your perogative to get lost in the city. Go as far away from the touristy areas as possible; that's where you find the real and far more interesting Venice, lots of nice buildings, narrow canals plus good and cheap restaurants. It's best to explore the city in the early morning before the hoards of tourists arrive at Midday. Go to the out islands like Murano or Burano for a get a better feel for the city. Just going to Venice and seeing St. Marks isn't enough, there are many sides to this large city which was once the capital of a vast Meditteranean Empire. It's one of the most expensive cities in the world, but it's definitely well worth it.
