Obviously, 9 our of 11 of the people here don't know dick about Iran. A friend of mine who frequently travels to the Middle East returned recently and had nothing but good things to say about Iran-things that would surprise 99% of Americans. First of all, most Iranians are irreligous-after putting up with religious propaganda for 25 years, they are sick and tired of it all and don't believe a word of it. Iranians pay lip service to religion but unlike elsewhere in the Middle East, there are few fanatics left in Iran (most of the population is under 40, and the 1970s are ancient history to them). While the government is tyranical and corrupt, it is also increasingly weak, and there is more freedom in Iran than the rest of the Middle East (excepting only Turkey and Israel, maybe little Bahrain and Lebanon). The country is large and thanks to its post-revolution isolation, less ruined by over-development and commercial tourist crap than most places. Isfahan is one of the loveliest cities on earth, with more 17th century architecture preserved than any other city in the ME outside Istambul. And believe it or not, Iran is one of the few countries in the ME where Americans are NOT hated; many people have relatives in LA or NYC and are obsessed with American popular culture. Outside the big cities, Iran's isolation has preserved more of the local traditions than elsewhere (you can get amazing crafts-hand-made rugs, ceramics, abstract paintings-all kinds of things, for pennies!), a true living museum. It is stupid to judge Iranians by the events of 25 years ago; however despicable its current government, this is a creative and fascinating country that deserves to be judged on its own terms.
