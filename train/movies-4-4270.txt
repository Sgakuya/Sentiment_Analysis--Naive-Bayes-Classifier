Walt Disneys first full length animated film. Still holds up today. A fairy tale about a pretty girl who must run away to escape a jealous witch. she ends up at a house where seven dwarfs live. They become friends,and they let her live with them. Snow White is a sweet girl who is loved by all the animals. the jealous witch who hates Snow White finds out she is still alive and makes a poisoned apple to give to her. Snow white eats it and dies the handsome prince finds her kisses her and she comes to life and there is a happy ending. A Good movie that was the springboard for other full length animated movies. Not my personnal favorite but well done.
