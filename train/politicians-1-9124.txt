He is the worst President we have ever had. There was no war to show his talents as Commander in Chief so he cant be judged on that. He cheated the American people by lying under oath, lying about his many female lovers, he raped one, the only one who has admitted to it that is, he has humiliated our country, his wife has humiliated our country, and the list goes on and on. What made him a great President? Was it the economy? He can thank Greespan for that. Was it his intelligence? He couldnt even keep his zipper zipped. Was he truthful? Not at all. What did he do? I cannot think of one thing. Just thought of one. The first President to visit Ireland in many years. But we all know how he loved to travel. He gave us nothing but controversy. That is the legacy he has left with us. Am I better off than 8 years ago? Yes I am, but I do not owe this to Bill Clinton. I owe it to myself for working hard. He did not do it for me. I pay more taxes than ever thanks to this man. He is at the bottom of the list as a president in my opinion. According to the polls I dont understand this man getting such a high rating. Look at his rating here. Do they only poll democrats?
