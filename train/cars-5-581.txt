I have a 1999 Yamaha Royal Star Tour Deluxe and couldn't be happier with it. I can ride all day and afterwards I feel the same as if I had driven a car. Pluses: 1) Ride comfort. 2) A real head turner. 3) Reliability. 4) 5 year warranty. 5) Liquid cooled. 6) Adjustable windshield. Minuses: 1)Could use a little extra power for up hill climbs. On the h/way or around town, it's fine. 2)Would love to see fuel injection. 3)High price. Mine was $16,200 4) No dipstick. The oil level is checked through a window and the bike needs to be level in order to read it. Final notes: For the life of me I don't know why Yamaha discontinued this great bike. They still make the Royal Star Venture (full dresser) but not only is the seat height one inch higher but the saet is wider too. For those of us with average to small inseams, it's to much seat height. Because the R/S Tour Deluxe is now discontinued, it's only available as a used bike. They didn't make to many of them so if you see a good one around, highly consider buying it.
