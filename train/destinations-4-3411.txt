Easily our most European City. . .Impossible to navigate with a car but this is part of its charm. Locals and tourists bitch about the traffic but I like it- it scares away the meek and weak. . .besides, DC has the only subway system in the country that I consider functional. Locals aren't dismissive of tourists, either. Excellent museums and historical sites. Underrated theater, good bars. Bad stuff- going out costs a lot of $. Locals can only talk about their jobs. Weird fact- I've never seen a city with so many beautiful women with ugly guys. (Money? Power?) A local woman told me that working women in DC sometimes come to the initial conclusion that an attractive guy in this town is probably gay. Take from that what you will. . . The women can be tough to approach but they are usually classy. Overall, a great place to go to school, visit, or spend a few years while working. I've lived in other parts of America and DC isn't really America to me. DC is DC. Everything else is really 'America' But I digress, I like it here.
