A human highlight reel everytime he touched the ball. You didn't know what to expect, you held your breathe cause he might do something you will never see again. The most electrifying running back ever. No one ever had his ability to change directions like he did, to stop on a dime like he did, and to make people look silly like he did. If he was playing today, he would probably be at about 20,000 yards right now. Emmitt was one of the best but Barry was in another class above him. His inability to run over somebody is what lowers him from my all time rankings. He's still top 5 in my book just not the greatest simply cause of small size and inability to get that tough 1 yard on 3rd and 1. And to be the greatest, you should be able to do it all.
