London has to be one of the the most over-rated cities in the world. I've lived most of my life here but have been fortunate enough to live and work in some parts of Europe and New York, aswell as the West Coast, L.A and Vancouver, and in comparision, England is a mess beyond belief at times and it seems to be getting worse every year. Privatization is the buzz word here, the country is run by a bunch of bureaucrats who absolutely have no interest whatsover in the welfare of their people while the gap between the rich and poor is increasing at an alarming rate. Of course if your a tourist you will no doubt love what you see in a short period of time, plenty of shops, a bustling environment and a variety of places to visit and I've noticed most of the positive reviews seem to be coming from tourists. However, underneath all the hustle and bustle lies a filthy rotten city with a growing rat infestation problem, a third world transport system, hospitals that are prone to bugs and fatalaties due to a lack of personal hygene and then there's the deteriorating standard of education. Overall, a crumbling infrastructure. My advice; Don't bring your kids up here or ruin your health in one of the most polluted cities in the world and in a city where not a passer by would come to your aid should you happen to be mugged in broad daylight or even fall over. It's all part of the ever so formal but yet decidedly polite British culture you see. Don't let that you fool you, alot of people here can be uptight, xenophobic and extremely cold.
