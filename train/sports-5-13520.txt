Jon Gruden is not only the youngest head coach ever in the NFL at 39 years, 8 months, and 9 days (as of today, april 26) but he is the best coach ever in the NFL...He led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to their first ever Super Bowl Appearance (and victory, obviously) as his first year as a 'Buccaneer.' His team deserved that Lombardi trophy, as did he. If it were not for Jon Gruden, I am not sure if the Buccaneers could have made the excellent Super Bowl event this year. I know they would have made it VERY soon because i am the biggest buccaneer fan and have all the faith in the world in them, but i am positive his contributions to this already outstanding football team helped them win the Super Bowl...I am only a 14 year old girl, but i have attended Buccaneer games At Raymond James, and Houlihan's Stadium every season since 1995. The Buccaneers and Jon Gruden deserved that victory because of their blood sweat and more sweat! Jon Gruden deserves to also be the Sexiest man alive. The hell with Ben Affleck...WE WANT CHUCKY!
