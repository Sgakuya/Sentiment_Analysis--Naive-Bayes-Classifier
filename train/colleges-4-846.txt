My experience has been very positive, for the most part. Before my last class, I would have rated Phoenix with five stars, but I ran into a very bad instructor who expected WAY to much, but gave almost no feedback. This is my third Master's Degree (I have two other traditional Master's Degrees) and I would say that the quality was much better than one and almost on par with the other. UoP is no different than traditional schools in the fact that you have some good, some mediocre, and some bad instructors. My bottom line is that UoP is a good learning experince, but if you are not a self-starter, or very self-diciplined, I'm not sure you will like the on-line experience much. But I found the entire experience to be rather rewarding. As with the previous poster, I want to clear up what looks like some rather deliberate misleading statements on this site. First there is absolutely no way that UoP is ANY kind of 'degree mill'. If it was, it would not be accredited. Second, if any one thinks they can get a degree from UoP in two to four weeks, it simply is not going to happen. I have been in the CIS program for almost 20 months, and will graduate next month. So it has not been easy. In fact, I would say that it has almost been too challenging (which is why I personally liked it, however). We had three people in my office start in the MSCIS program at about the same time. I am the only one to finish online - the others dropped into a more traditional 'brick and mortar' Master's program, because they could not keep up with the demands of the online MSCIS program.
