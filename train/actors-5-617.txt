As an actor, James Dean was a true phenomenon. How many people could do only three films and continue to be remembered with a sense of awe after almost 46 years? Most actors could probably work 46 years and be forgotten three years after their death. James Dean represented the frustration and repression of the youth of post war America and, through his personality and works, you can hear the rumblings of the rebellion to come. In spite of the sometimes-tedious method acting school he became a part of, he developed a natural, realistic and unaffected personal style. He was inspired by Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando and was undeniably very similar to both. But he also managed to always be an original, to always draw you into his character, and to forever inspire others in the craft of acting. As a currently running commercial says; James Dean was just cool!
