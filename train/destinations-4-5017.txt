I have lived in this state all my life (I have visited tons of others in almost every other region) and I believe its diversity deserves a 5. On the one hand you have the city, which although a bit dirty, is really wonderful in its efficiency and convenience. It is slightly expensive, but if you know where to go then you can be as frugal as you want. Crime really is not that bad as its cracked up to be (statistics rank it along the lines of San Fran). Upstate New York on the other hand is gorgeous (in certain areas of course). The mountains are rather feeble compared to other regions of the country, but are very beautiful in there own right (and provide excellent skiing in the winter). Niagra Falls is also pretty nice. Some of the smaller cities are nice, but others are miserable. All in all, New York caters to many different requirements.
