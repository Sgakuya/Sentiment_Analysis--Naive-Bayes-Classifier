Apparently JFK was the best of a criminal family who bought their way to power and celebrity status. His father was a bootlegger with mafia connections who sympathized with the Nazis in the early days of WWII. His domineering mother went on a shopping trip instead of going to the funeral of her own daughter. Bobby was apparently not much better, while everyone knows how his buffoon of a little brother turned out. I could go on and on but my main point is that the Kennedy's should be relegated to history's dust bin. In the distant future they will be nothing more that minor historical footnotes in books that few read.
