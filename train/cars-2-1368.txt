please do not waste your $$$. i saved up 5 grand for a down payment to buy my first adult car. i was so excited when i finally purchased it. i bought a brand new 99 with all the options right when they came out with the new body style. needless to say within the first few months both my window motors had been replaced 3 times on driver and 2 times on passenger. it just went downhill from there. (no more warranty due to the highway miles i had put on since i traveled for my company everyday) my a/c accumulator went out (only about $600 to repair OUCH) then the transmission started to slip. finally it became apparant it was time to trade the car in. i must say i was depressed sicne it was such a cute car with so many neat features that i still miss but loosing $5000 in cash really put that sour taste in my mouth since i was then upside down on the car and had to get a cheaper car to stay within my monthly payment range. 2 cars later i now own a camary and have not had any problem what so ever (knock on wood)
