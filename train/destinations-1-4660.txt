If I could rate this place zero stars I would, one star is not worthy. I will start by saying the people of this metro area are some of the most uptight, uneducated and quite frankly rudest individuals I have ever come across. I lived in Clayton for a year before leaving for Chicago (thank god) and I swear to you not a week would pass where some old crusty jew from the are would go to the grocery store and actually open up a bag of bagels and take one out to taste it then put it back on the shelf...gross! Not a day it seemed would pass when someone would ask me where the fcuk I attended high school. Are you kidding me? it seems as if this question is meant to qulify your economic staus to deem it worthy to chat with you or not. I would lie and say Soldan some city ghetto high schoool. Bottom line is this, if your old toothless fat or just bored this is the perfect place for you. Otherwise run or resign if your asked to move there. This place has absooutly nothing to offer trust me! Place is on dialysis, way to many negros to.
