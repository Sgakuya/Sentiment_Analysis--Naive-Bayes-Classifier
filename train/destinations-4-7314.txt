Ah Bella Napoli. What sailor worth his salt has not been to Naples. I made it there twice, in 1995 and 2002. From a distance, Naples is a pretty looking town. But when you get right into the city, it is absoultely true what they say about the city's cleanliness (or lack thereof). Trash is strewn everywhere. But who cares about that. I've been to several towns in Italy, but I would have to say the best Italian food was Naples hands down. A real Italian pizza is nothing like you see in America. Too bad, because it is so delicious. The weather is also very nice. It kind of reminded me of San Diego weather. I'm not a sightseer, but I did spend a day at the ruins of Pompeii. It was one of the neatest things I ever saw. I was amazed at how evolved civilization was, even at 79 AD. The homes had a rudimentary plumbing system and the town had both an arena and a place that must have been like a Fort Lauderdale Nightclub at Spring Break. The Pompeiians knew how to party. The only other thing I remember doing there was golfing at a local course. I'm a bad golfer to start with and the rental clubs were too short for me. I started with 16 golf balls, but lost them all by the time I got to the 13th hole.
