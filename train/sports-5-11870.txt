for all you stupid people out there that still think amnning should have gotten the hiesman back in the 97-98 season, get your heads out of your asses. i saw woodson play live for 3 years, and i have seen some other great hiesman trophy winners play too, but none were like woodson. he shut down one side of the feild on defence, and when he did come out on offence, he always put that thought of a big play in everyones head. people have to remember that the hiesman goes to the MVP of that year, and is not awarded to a guy who had a great carrer. oh yeah woodson helped lead his team to a national championship, something payton could never do!!!!!
