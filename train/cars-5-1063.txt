I leased my 2001 Maxima SE on 2/11/01, and I am very impressed with the excellence of this vehicle. Fit and finish is above reproach, the ride is firm with great handling, and the interior is well thought out and comfortable. The 3.0 6-cylinder engine has won many accolades, and rightfully so. I ordered all options available, and so equipped, I think it is nicer than some cars priced thousands more. The 200-watt Bose audio system has incredible sound, well worth the cost. If you looking for a 4-door sports sedan, this is the one. To top it off, Nissan dealers are willing to negotiate terrific deals. I negotiated a $4,500.00 discount off of MSRP, and the dealer threw in a Nissan 6-disc Autochanger at no cost to me. Drive it and I bet you will buy it.
