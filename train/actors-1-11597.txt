Meg Ryan has now reached the point where she has perfected a caricature of Meg Ryan, messy blonde hair, ditsy, rolling eyes, scarecrow floppiness, stomp-stomp, I'm so dumb and cute and confused, but everyone loves me, so point me in the right direction. Ryan could be an excellent actress if she dropped this; yet, I think she is smart enough to know what sells. Her early roles showed real promise, but somewhere along the line, she shifted into cruise control. But, hey, it pays, and she is saved from putting thought, technique, and soul into her acting. Maybe some of Crowe's committment to fine acting will rub off on her.
