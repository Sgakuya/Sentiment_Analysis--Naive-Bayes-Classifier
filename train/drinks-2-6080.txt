Wow... I can remember when Slice and Sprite were in major competition with one another. You could tell just looking at how similar the cans used to be--Sprite cans were green, and Slice cans were greenish-blue (similar to today's Sprite cans). Both soft drinks had the name written diagonally, going toward the top right of the can. And both soft drinks had a fruit replacing the dot of the i --Sprite had a lemon and lime to replace the dot (which they still use), and Slice had an orange to replace the dot. And, when I was really young, I often didn't know which one was which just looking at the cans--I had to taste them. Sprite, however, was always the one I had loved... Slice I didn't care for much. Eventually (through whining) I got my parents weaned off of Slice and onto Sprite permanently. And who's doing better today? Sprite's like the fourth most bought soft drink today, and Slice is... it's easy to forget Slice is even still around! Heck, you can tell by their can evolution which has had more success--the Sprite can, since the days with the pure green can, has had only two minor changes to it since the 80s. Slice has changed a lot more drastically though... changing the font several times, writing the word Slice vertically for a while, changing the dot on the i to a regular dot, and what we have now is a can that looks like it was approved by the National Tai Dye association. And why has Slice changed it's image so much? Why were it's attempts at beating out Sprite a failure? Simply, it doesn't taste very good.
