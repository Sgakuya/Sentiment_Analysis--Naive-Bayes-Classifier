I remember a review that Dave Marsh wrote about a great punk record by the band, X-Ray Spex. He said nobody listens to this stuff for enjoyment, suggesting that the band's fans could only appreciate the music as a cultural statement. Marsh was wrong on that one -- there were pop pleasures underneath the crazed arty punk rock on that X-Ray Spex record -- but his comment sure applies to this movie. For all the talent on exhibition -- from the director and (especially) Steve Buscemi as well as other players in the film -- there's no pleasure in watching this unless you're looking for vindication of a horribly pessimistic worldview: Oh yes, humanity IS pathetic, isn't it! The director's first film was a well-reviewed documentary called Crumb about a comic book artist that's fixated on everything gross within our world. She (the director, sorry I cant recall the name) is obviously sympathetic to Crumb's aesthetic , so in Ghost World we get a parade of lonely losers picking their ears and stuff like that. There's some dark humor here that works, and Buscemi's performance really is touching at times, but I sure hope that the people who like this film don't think of this as an important comment on society -- rather they're indulging an unhealthy fetish by focusing on the least appealing characteristics of people. If we've learned anything in the three weeks since the terrorist attack, it's that mainstream U.S.A. is made of heroic and compassionate folks. Ghost World is one of those hip-by-being-cynical goofs on our society, which now seems very very dated.
