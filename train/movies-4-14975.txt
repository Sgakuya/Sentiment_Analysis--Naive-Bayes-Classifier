I wanted to give this movie a 5-star rating, because I firmly believe its topic - the founding of the United States - is history's greatest moment... one that's been unfairly neglected by Hollywood. But this isn't the movie I would have made about the Revolution. THE PATRIOT is a classic avenge my family action story with the real gritty give me liberty or give me death stuff faded into the background. Still, it is compelling: any movie that convincingly pulls you into the horror of musket-to-musket-at-20-feet standoffs is going to grab your attention. And the movie is nicely filmed and features some great performances. Still, its too long, spends too much time reconciling the heroism of 1776 with the post-Civil Rights vibe of our own era, and the romance plots seem tacked on. Nevertheless, its refreshing to see Hollywood approaching the subject of the U.S. founding. There's a scene about recruiting for the local militia that I'm sure lots of post-mod's will find absolutely corny. But why? This is REAL history. If it seems corny, it only underscores how removed we are from the heroic sacrifices that birthed the most noble experiment in human history: self-rule with a respect for natural rights of individual men. THE PATRIOT is imperfect, but you and your family should see it.
