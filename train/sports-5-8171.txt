Vince Carete is not only a dunker but he is also a superb player who can beyond the three point arc, and not to mention he is a cool guy who doesn't mind if people make comments about him, he si in toronto to play the game of basketbball and a lot of people dont want Carter toplay out of States and are jellous of why should a great player play in a team which is not American.. Carter was and is unstopable and people think that Kobe is better but think about this, Kobe has Shaq with him and when other teams ty tostop shaq then Kobe is open so tats why everybody thinks that he is a great player but if u look at Carter e is the only playe in Toronto who is a consistent scorer and other players are not really good shooters and when other teams double team Carter then he can't score a lot but he still scores 25+ points in almost every game...Now u be the jugde about who is better? Carter or Kobe.. and the question remains that is Vince Carter the next M.J but the truth is he is not cuz he si da first Carter.....he is Damn Good
