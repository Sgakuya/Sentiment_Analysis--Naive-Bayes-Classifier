Simply by posting on this board one has to have an ego to believe one has something worthwhile to say. I don't see any egoless shrinking violets here and I daresay that anyone who has the courage to run for president has an overabundance of ego and confidence. Ralph is no exception, nor should he be. In the case of the 2000 election, let me ask you Einsteins . . . without Nader, do you truly believe that 90,000 disenfranchised, felon-labeled voters, a poorly designed ballot using defective chads, clueless election judges who refused to give replacement ballots to those who made mistakes and discovered they had punched Buchanan's chad, and a Sec'y of State who simultaneously ran a candidate's state campaign-- all these made NO difference at all? It was all Ralph? I don't buy it. I think you guys were, and are still, mad at yourselves for having been suckered and looked for an actual person you could attack as a tar-baby. There stood the no-nonsense Nader exuding a character admittedly deficient in charm and used-car-salesmanship. Target acquired, commence firing. And Bruce dear, it's amazing that you criticize him for the very two subjects that Dems always excoriate him for- his past problems with his own labor force and his remarks about choice issues being gonadal politics. You guys can't have it both ways, you know. In his latest book, out just this week, I think he's basically answering your challenge with, American people, SAVE YOURSELVES.
