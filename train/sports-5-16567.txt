In a league full of prima donna running backs, Duce Staley is quietly going about the task of becomming a superstar. Last season Duce accounted for nearly 42% of the Eagles total offense! In the previous two seasons, Duce has surpassed 1000 yards and has been a positive influence on budding star quarterback Donovan Mcnabb. This season, DS is currently tied with Marshall Faulk for the league lead in total yards from scrimmage. No player in the league means as much to his teams success as Duce. All the pressure put on this remarkable young man by the jaded fans of Philadelphia has served as fuel for the competitive fire that burns deep within the heart of this true competitor. Duce also loves the ladies.
