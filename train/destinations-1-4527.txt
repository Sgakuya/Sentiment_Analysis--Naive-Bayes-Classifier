I lived in Phoenix for about eight years. I moved there from Detroit and I hated every bit of it. It has no culture, it's way too right wing, you have never seen smog until you have seen smog at 120 degrees AND forget star gazing, way too much crime, Sheriff Joe Arpaio is the devil (look up Tent City), the schools suck, there are no black people and only mistreated hispanics, your skin gets so dry from being in Air Conditioning all day, there is nothing for your kids to do in the summer besides hang out in malls, the rain has mud in it!, if you go for bike ride in the summer and pass out.. you will bake to death in the heat, you can bake cookies in your car (maybe that's an asset?), the houses are too expensive for how much it sucks and don't build equity for the most part, all the produce and fish is awful because it has to be shipped in, the architecture is bland, etc. So I moved to San Diego, and I love it here!!! What a load off, sitting around hating where you live takes a lot of energy.
