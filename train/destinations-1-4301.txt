Los Angeles is a pit. I cant wait to get out. I am so dissapointed of ever coming here. No jobs, Smog, traffic is crazy, . Most expensive place to live, . The rent are so costly to live in a rundown neigborhood. Having a degree in Los Angeles means nothing. The only thing these people look here for , PLease speak the Spanish Language and the job is yours. I had so many bad experiences here, that I will not waste my energy or time to wrrite them.I am advising everyone please Pray, use wisdom and caution before coming here. This place is dirty, lots of people that are so rude. They will judge you by the way you dresses, lived , or what you drive. If you don't have a car , they will laugh at you and think you are poor. Give me a break, some people prefer not to drive in this hell hole traffic so they will ride the bus. Another thing the endless hit and run accidents. Los Angeles is boring and a place that is starving. Please also beware of lots of scam artists, they will rob you in a second. (BEWARE).
