There aren't too many franchises that I tune in for...just to see how they are going to lose. In 2004, it was simply inept management that's unfolded for all their fans to witness. Last year, this team traded a Yankee-killing, .300 hitting 1B/3B in Shea Hillenbrand for nothing (and no visible reason). This year, they show how future their brain-trust actually is -- by hiring Francona because he's their new pitcher's friend (Schilling), abuse/alienate their franchise player (in Nomar) long before ever getting his replacement (and butchering the A-Rod deal). Like the NY Mets, they are held down by poor off-field decisions. Their owner and management team is where the games are lost (this year). Oh yeah, and one more thing: 1918.
