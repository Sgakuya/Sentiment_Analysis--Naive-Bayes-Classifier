Morgan Freeman's greatest asset is his awesome screen presence. When he is on the screen, the audience has no choice but to be focused on HIM because of his sheer brilliance as an actor. It took Freeman nearly two decades to catch a break in Hollywood, and it finally came in 1989 when he got a substantial part in the Civil War film Glory. Freeman's performance was riveting, as he perfectly reflected the thoughts and passions of the African American soldier who was fighting for the freedom of his fellow man in the Civil War. A string of provocative thrillers (Kiss the Girls, Seven, and Along Came a Spider) are only part of an amazing resume. Freeman did a fantastic job in Amistad and Deep Impact. In the latter, he played the President of the United States, which I must say he did quite well. While having an African American president in a film would distract viewers in most cases, Freeman's brilliant acting ability and awesome screen presence makes us all color blind. More recently, Freeman has tried his hand at comedy, playing God in the 2003 comedy Bruce Almighty. Freeman did an exceptional job, but it is quite clear that Freeman's forte' is drama. In the final analysis, Morgan Freeman is a good actor who obviously chooses his roles carefully and executes them with passion and devotion.
