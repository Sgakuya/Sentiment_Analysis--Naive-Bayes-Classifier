AT&T Wireless really has horrific customer service by far the worst I have ever experienced anywhere. It is difficult for an outsider reader to properly comprehend how bad it actually is and before anyone considers obtaining a cell phone with AT&T, they should carefully read the many negative comments on this and other web sites. I went to an AT&T store, spent an hour with the salesman choosing a phone, a plan and trying to get it activated. Their computers were down that day and he said he couldnt activate it, so I asked them to ship me the phone. A week later it arrived. When I tried to get my new phone activated, I made four separate calls to customer service and waited a total of three hours and forty minutes on hold without success. Then, when I decided to cancel my contract and return the phone, I made seven calls totaling four hours and ten minutes to AT&Ts customer service department over a six week period before they actually sent the return paperwork. In comparison, I went to the Verizon store, chose my phone, chose my plan, had everything activated and was out the door in 15 minutes. When I called Verizon's customer service line with a technical question I had my answer in 5 minutes. Enough said?
