The University of Michigan is an institution of anti-white racism and anti-male sexism. The school engages in an unusually high amount of discrimination against whites in hiring and promotions, and they give large amounts of money to certain groups for their racist and sexist agendas. In the classroom, racism is a part of nearly every classroom lecture. Professors have thorough and comprehensive ways of making white people think less of themselves. Every part of the educational experience: readings, lectures, tests, small group discussions, are neatly dovetailed into a matrix of racist and sexist themes. Students are required to bring information from all these sources together, making the same arguments in long essay-type midterms and final exams. It is a very effective form of indoctrination. The University of Michigan allocates large amounts of money to programs which are off-limits to whites. The Comprehensive Studies Program is one example. This is a program of special courses, mentoring, and academic advising which is almost entirely for blacks. University of Michigan professors engage in egregious research strategies and racial bias, depicting whites and males in the worst ways possible, and dispensing their bias to the larger society by every means possible. The ways in which professors re-write history are limitless and the abuses are extreme. There is no oversight over their actions and virtually no academic accountability whatsoever. Professors promote their agendas in classroom lectures with impassioned authority and self-righteousness. Students are graded unfairly if they dont present themselves as liberals and embrace left-wing topics and viewpoints in their papers. The University of Michigan is a degenerate institution in which academic professionalism and scholarship are ignored to advance a racist and sexist agenda.
