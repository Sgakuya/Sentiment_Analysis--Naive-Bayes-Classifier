I agree with Talena's assesment of Mutter and Rammstein entirely. One point I wish to add is that Rammstein is a breath of fresh air in terms of American interests. With the disposable popstars that MTV and the radio produces, in an environment full of one hit wonders and a general stagnant state of affairs in music an import like Rammstein is a blessing. All too often in American bands and musicians sound too much alike. Ever since the days of Pearl Jam it seems everyone wants to mimic Vedder's voice. Metal may be in America but it is alive and well in Germany. And Rammstein is at the top of the mountain in my opinion. Mutter represents their best release so far. It was my first taste of this excellent band and spurred me to seek out their previous releases and I've been very pleased. Talena's description of the band describes them far better than I could. But let me say that even if you do not speak German this band can appeal to you. To me that is the mark of a truly exceptional band- the ability to transcend language barriers on the merit of the music alone. Besides, you gotta love the German language...it's just so scary!
