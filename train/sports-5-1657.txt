The Chisox are the best team in the history of the world. They have been lying low for the past 85 years, but the day will come when they will win so many consecutive World Series' that they won't be allowed to compete anymore. Also, even though it happened a long long time ago, the Black Sox scandal was a total setup. The players had no choice but to jump at chance to make more money than that cheap bastard Comiskey would ever pay them. Also, Shoeless Joe was an illiterate hick who just happened to be an incredibly talented hitter. Their day will come, people. They are the most kickass team and will one day dominate everyone.
