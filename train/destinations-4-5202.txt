ah yes- the golden state-much loved and disliked. The positives of California are climate- especially along the coast- and diverse recreational opportunities- but the downsides are indeed enormous- soaring housing costs- poor schools, and too wide a gap berween the haves and have nots- too dismiss Calfornia's high costs as 'OK' is silly. You are either rich or poor here- with decreasing in betweens- that degrades the overall quality of life. And as an 'ignorant easterner' in New England- who has been to California nearly a dozen times- and am not impressed with its mostly shallow and empty culture- I find caphillsea77 opinies typical of the golden state. I really wonder if California's wonderful climate and superaltive physical envirionment are worth working 3 jobs just to live in less then favorable circumstances....the choice is yours.
