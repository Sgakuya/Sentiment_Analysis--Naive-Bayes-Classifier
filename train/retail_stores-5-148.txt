The best poetry bookstore in the world. With an abundance of charm and service, they provide assistance obtaining hard-to-find poetry books. Poetry books are stacked up a high ceiling, along the aisle and on the four walls and table that make up a small bookstore run by a staff dedicated to poetry. Grolier's sponsors poetry events and attend to customers' needs like no other. This is a must for any poetry lover visting or living in the Boston and Cambridge area. The store is just across the street from Harvard, not a far walk from the transit and bus stop on the red line and just around the corner from Harvard Book Store: If you're visting one store, be sure to stop in at the other. The best selection of foreign poets and foreign language poetry I've ever seen in the United States. If they don't have it, best of luck finding it. The great poets have walked these floors, purchased their books here and you'll be sharing the experience with them, in spirit, if not while you're enjoying the antique atmosphere.
