Gray Davis is doing a helluva job with the fallout from the de-regulation of the energy companies...considering that it was Pete Wilson and the rest of the Re-smug-licans who de-regulated them in the first place! Davis is doing what he has to do regarding the rolling blackouts, given the fact that when Dubya went to Sacramento, he refused to give Californians federal assistance! Remember that the companies that supply California with the energy are from Texas, and these companies, most likely, have Dubya in their back pocket! Now, how can a consummate politician like Dubya disappoint his fellow Texan Re-smug-lican-big-business-oil-baron-anti-trust-busting comrades? By dissing Gray, that's why. Gray, keep up the good work. You're doing what you have to do.
