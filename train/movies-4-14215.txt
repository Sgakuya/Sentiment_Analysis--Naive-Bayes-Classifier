Good movie with impressive performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. Pardon my intrusion, but I honestly believe Crowe should have won Best Actor for this over Denzel Washington, but then I believe Denzel should have won over Russell the year before. Maybe a little correction after the fact? Not a movie I would recommend for the entire family, as it would be rather intense for youngsters, but for teens and up, an all around well-made movie addressing an issue (mental illness) that doesn't receive much attention in film. Unfortunately it didn't remain entirely true to the story, but that's a forgivable oversight.
