This is practically a cult favorite as with all of the fantasy films of the 80's. This didn't receive any critical acclaim but I have known some diehard fans. It features a very young Tom Cruise and Mia Sara who definitely show their age in their stilted acting. Tim Curry is absolutely chilling as the monstrous Lord of Darkness. This is your typical flight of fancy film with unicorns, fairies and dwarves but it also has a very dark feel at times. Having said all this, I will admit to really enjoying this movie. Sure, it's effects are very 1980's and the acting isn't spectacular but it's fun and full of imagination.
