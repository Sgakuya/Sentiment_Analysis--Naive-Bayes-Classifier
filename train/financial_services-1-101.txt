I hate Wells Fargo! They are absolutely incompetent. They bought our home loan and we've had nothing but grief since. They keep telling us we don't have enough flood insurance. FEMA (another bunch of incompetents), just sent us a check for overpayment of $500. Two weeks later, Wells Fargo writes us stating they are increasing our house payment by around $90 to pay for additional flood insurance. A couple of years ago they even sent us a letter stating that we were no longer in a flood zone, then started writing us letters threatening to add flood insurance to our policy. When I got on the phone with them, they denied having sent such a letter (about the flood zone) until my husband retrieved the letter and we read it to them over the phone! Is there any way besides refinancing that we can make them sell our account to someone who is competent? We can't afford to refinance or pay an extra $90 per month. Do we even have a leg to stand on? I feel like the big greedy corporations have all the leverage and the consumers are getting it without the vaseline.
