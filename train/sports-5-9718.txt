As a Sixer fan for most of my life, I hve lived with the good, the bad, and the ugly. That being said, I have never respected a Philly team more than I respect this one (including the 82-83 championship team). They play hard every night, they play defense every night, and they are high energy. I am going to make the call today, May 5, 2000. They will sweep the Pacers, defeat the Knicks, and get crushed by whatever team comes out of the West in the finals. UPDATE: OK so maybe I was a year early in my predictions - so, i am going to make the call today on December 19, 2000 - the Sixers will roll on to the NBA finals and lose in six to whoever comes out of the West.
