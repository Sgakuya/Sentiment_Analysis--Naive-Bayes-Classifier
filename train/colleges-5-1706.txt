I haven;t studied in NYU, I studied in a public school. Very good public school, one of the best in US, but still a public school. I am an extrovert person. I find parties and party places. I know people. I really don't care if NYU if in the center of goddamned New York or my university is in a blue collar undustrial city. That's in terms of nightlife, girls, etc. I've had more girls that I can afford anyway. NYU, however, has one advantage, about which even most of ivy league schools can be jealous about- it's connection with employers. I'm talking about economics/business/etc related jobs. I read it's the same about law. Sorry, you can't beat that. NYU has the best connections. and if you know your purpose for going to college (which is finding a job), you'd choose NYU.
