Al Franken impressed me here. I'm not a big fan of his (I didn't like his others books, and generally haven't thought much of him since his original skits on SNL). But his research and writing in this book is first-rate. Franken does a fantastic job of exposing right-wing fools and buffoons in the book as the blowhards and outright liars they are. The misleading slanders of Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter are dealt with especially well here. I don't care for books on political humor that much-they tend to be boring and repetitive, for one thing. Franken's earlier book, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot-though the title fits-was just a long, running gag that got boring very fast. But this one is worth reading; much, much better than anything by Mike Moore or Franken's earlier work.
