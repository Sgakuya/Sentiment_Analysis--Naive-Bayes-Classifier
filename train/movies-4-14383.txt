I really don't know how to give this movie a rating. I don't know if I should give it a high rating because it effected me so, or a low one because of how disturbing it was. I saw Requiem without knowing what it was about. I knew the director was the same director of a movie called Pie which is a crazy movie. So, this movie was crazy. It started out really good. Good little stories, then the stories got connected and it was still good. The craziness started about half way through. I like crazy movies and can handle disturbing movies to an extent but this became over the top. The climax of the movie had me sitting there with my eyes shut and my fingers in my ears. It was so disturbing I felt like I was going to throw up. I don't know if I can really recommend this movie or not. I suggest that if you see Requiem, be prepared for a really disturbing, crazy, bizzare, twisted, sad movie. It took me like an hour after the movie to calm down.
