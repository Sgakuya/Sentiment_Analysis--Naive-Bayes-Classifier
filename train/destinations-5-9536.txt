I was equally impressed with my tour through this dizzying place. It is a still-functioning abbey and the ashes of approximately 3300 people are kept here, including: Geoffrey Chaucer, Edmund Spenser, John Dryden, Dr Samuel Johnson, Charles Dickens, Robert Browning, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Rudyard Kipling, John Masefield, Sir Isaac Newton, Thomas Telford, Charles Darwin, Lord Kelvin, Ernest Rutherford, Sir J.J.Thomson, George Frederic Handel, Henry Purcell, John Blow, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Laurence Olivier, David Livingstone, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, Field Marshal George Wade, Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell, Admiral Thomas Cochrane, Lord Trenchard, Lord Dowding. Surprisingly, Henry the VIII was not. It's hard not to be amazed as you walk through The Abbey and see all of these name plaques and missing insignias that indicate different invasions. Of note is a man named Thomas Parr, who lived to the ripe old age of 152 years, 9 months and lived through 10 monarchs. His plaque reads: THO: PARR OF YE COUNTY OF SALLOP. BORNE IN AD: 1483. HE LIVED IN YE REIGNES OF TEN PRINCES VIZ: K.EDW.4. K.ED.5. K.RICH.3. K.HEN.7. K.HEN.8. K.EDW.6. Q.MA. Q.ELIZ. K.JA. & K.CHARLES. AGED 152 YEARES. & WAS BURYED HERE NOVEMB. 15. 1635. Simply dizzying...
