I enjoyed this movie very much, but I can't give it five stars. First of all, if I really love a movie I'll keep thinking about it for hours, and this one was out of my mind within minutes. Also, I thought several scenes should have been either cut altogether or at least trimmed--the main one being the scene with the squid-like creature. It didn't even look real, and this is in a movie where the special effects were spared no expense. Another thing is the sort of ending. It stopped in a very strange part of the story, and it had a lot of people griping about it including me. It still rates four stars because of the incredible (mostly) effects, the actors, the sets, and the incredible cinematography.
