Ah, Clemente. Died too young, that's for sure, and like anyone you died young, he is remembered for being slightly greater than he actually was. Clemente amassed a high batting average, but only boasted an average secondary average. His plate patience was poor, but he had some speed. His power was probably hampered by playing in Forbes Field, which restricted offense. Clemente was an outstanding defensive outfielder with that rocket arm, but his assists and various defensive runs saved do not make up for a low on-base %. In other words, not to detract from Clemente (who by the way was a great man and terrific humanitarian), he was obviously not the greatest right fielder ever. Sorry.
