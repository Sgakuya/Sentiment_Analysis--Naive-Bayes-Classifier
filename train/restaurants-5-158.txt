I don't eat fast food very often, but ChickFilA is a real treat - I love it! If you don't like fried chicken, then don't bother trying it cuz that's all it is (on a buttery bun), but MAN IS IT GOOD! A note to the person who said you won't get fat eating this - THINK AGAIN! These are LOADED with fat and cholesterol since they're fried in vegetable oil and then generously bathed in a buttery seasoning. The chicken sandwich that they're famous for has 32g of fat (49% of DV) and 8g staurated fat (40% DV). That's pretty bad for lunch! The only good news is that these figures include the french fries, so if you can manage to skip those, then you'll be a little better off. My advice, eat it once or twice a month at most if you're worried about becoming/staying obese!
