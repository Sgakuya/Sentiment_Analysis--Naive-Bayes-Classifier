Seth Green is sooooo hot! He is the second most gorgeous guy in the world (next to Fred Durst of course). He was so funny in Austin Powers 1 2...Scott Evil is my hero. He was hilarious in Can't Hardly Wait...I wish I was the girl who got locked in the bathroom with him! Idol Hands was okay, even though the plot was really, REALLY horrible, but Seth made the movie tolerable. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is my favorite show. Seth played Oz wonderfully, and it saddened me greatly when he left. He was an essential part of the show that can never be replaced. I just saw Josie and the Pssycats yesterday. Seth played a member of an NSYNC like boy-band. The only reason I went to go see the movie was to see him, but I got ripped off because he was in it for less than five minutes...oh well. Anyways, Seth is a hilarious guy with a lot of talent. I think he deserves more credit. I can't wait until he comes out with more movies...hopefully in the not-so-distant future.
