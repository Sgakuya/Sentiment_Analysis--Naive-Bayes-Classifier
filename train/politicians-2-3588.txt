A generally overrated president. He appointed some good people to his cabinet and other offices, but he also appointed incredibly corrupt people like Ashcroft, Hutchinson, and Walters (which I refer to as the unholy trinity of the 21st century). That alone made me decide never to vote for him. I also don't agree with everything he's doing to handle this conflict with Afghanistan now, although I can say he hasn't seriously messed up. The few good things: 1. No draft yet. 2. No internment of racial/religious groups. 3. The US is still in existence. So overall, he's generally a weak president with poor morals in many areas, but not completely corrupt.
