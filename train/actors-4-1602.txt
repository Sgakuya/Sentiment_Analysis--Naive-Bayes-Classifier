I have to remove a star because Hackman suffers from Sean Connery Disease : an excellent character actor with a nice range on top of it, but a tendency to appear in too many films that waste his talents. I wish Hackman would be more selective in the projects he takes on. He has a remarkable work ethic with a proven track record of being one of the hardest working men in Hollywood. If his energies were focused on one film per year, Hackman would turn out masterpiece after masterpiece instead of dozens of films which are mostly no better than above-average. In dramatic roles, Hackman is mostly convincing and captures the viewer's attention like few others can. When he does a comedic role, he still commands attention, yet in a loose and daring way; by daring I mean that he will do just about anything to make the audience laugh with him. His only flaw is getting stuck in films that feature his talent yet fail in other aspects. If you were stuck in a room with Hackman-only films to watch for the rest of your life, you'd not only have a LOT of films at your disposal, but you would be consistently entertained by a true professional at work on the screen before you.
