A pretty good movie. It takes place in 1957. In the beginning of the movie we are introduced to a family a mom, dad and two children. they look to be the ideal family of the fifties they even have a magazine article done on them as the perfect family type. It turns out things are not as they appear. Cathy the wife walks in on her husbands office to see him with another man in a passionate embrace. He goes to a psychiatrist to cure him .{yeah right} meanwhile she becomes friends with a kind intelligent black man who does the gardening for them. This is the 1950s and so being friends with an african american was frowned onespecially if they are the opposite sex.the towns people are quick to gossip about this friendship.Now this perfect family is quickly falling apart. A good movie that shows how vicious prejudice can be. makes people think that the 1950s was not such an ideal time to live in. If you are looking for a movie with a happy ending, this is not it. yet it is a good movie.Julianne Moore was great as the sweet ideal 50s housewife. so was Dennis Quaid.
