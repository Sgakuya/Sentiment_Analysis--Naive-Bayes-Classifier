Originally published in 1937, The Hobbit is Tolkien's more innocent, lite and playful prelude to The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. In fact, this book is geared towards children (though enjoyable by adults) while the trilogy is a more mature work of literature. For the uninitiated, the story revolves around the reserved and quiet Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, who finds himself in an expected adventure with twelve eccentric dwarves and the wizard Gandalf. Along the way, Bilbo must fight off evil orcs, trolls and wolves, deal with magical elves, tangle with a firing breathing dragon, and finds a mysterious ring. The bottom line is that The Hobbit is a story of exciting events and a reluctant hero who finds that the unexpected is often the best part of life.
