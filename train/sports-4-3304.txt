Well I've been a Nolan Ryan fan since I got my first pack of baseball cards in little league '81 and the first card I got was yep...Nolan Ryan. Yes I know there are better pitchers.. His Strikeouts are overrated.. he walked a lot of people.. lost a lot of games. I'll tell you though his last few seasons I've never seen anybody pitch so many games that were near no hitters.. It seemed like every other game he was a least flirting with one, and he of course got nos 6 and 7 at that time. He was rather unlucky with his teammates too.. He would have games like.. 8IP 1H 1ER Loss followed by 7IP 2H 0ER No decision etc. he would then have games where he seemed to lose it and give up 6 or 7 Earned runs in one inning which just about ruined his ERA for the whole season. But hey, he was 45 years old for pete's sake.. no pitcher was as exciting or intimidating.. and I wish I had had the opportunity to face the Ryan Express myself...
