This was sent via e-mail 09/15/00. Is it true??Forgotten Facts ?? (Conveniently) >Back in 1969 a group of Black Panthers decided that a fellow black panther >named Alex Rackley needed to die. Rackley was suspected of disloyalty. >Rackley was first tied to a chair. Once safely immobilized, his friends >tortured him for hours by, among other things, pouring boiling water on him. >When they got tired of torturing Rackley, Black Panther member Warren Kimbo took Rackley outside and put a bullet in his head. Rackley's body was laterfound floating in a river about 25 miles north of New Haven, Conn. Perhaps >at this point you're curious as to what happened to these Black Panthers. >In 1977, that's only eight years later, only one of he killers was still in >jail. The shooter, Warren Kimbro, managed to get a scholarship to Harvard. >He later became an assistant dean at Eastern Connecticut State College.Isn't >that something? As a '60s radical you can pump a bullet into someone's head, >and a few years later, in the same state, you can become an assistant >college dean! Only in America! Erica Huggins was the lady who served the >Panthers by boiling the water for Mr. Rackley's torture. Some years later >Ms. Huggins was elected to a California School Board. How in the world do >you think these killers got off so easy? Maybe it was in some part due to >the efforts of two people who came to the defense of the Panthers. These >two people actually went so far as to shut down Yale University with >demonstrations in defense of the accused Black Panthers during their trial. >One of these people was none other than Bill Lan Lee. Mr. Lee, or Mr. Lan >Lee, as the case may be, isn't a college dean. He isn't a member of a >California School Board. He is now head of the US Justice Department's >Civil Rights Division. O.K., so who was the other Panther defender? Is this >other notable Panther defender now a school board member? Is this other >Panther apologist now an assistant college dean? No, Neither! The other >Panther defender was, like Lee, a radical law student at Yale University at >the time. She is now known as The smartest woman in the world. She is >none other than the Democratic candidate for the US Senate from the State of >New York----our lovely First Lady, the incredible Hillary Rodham Clinton. >And now; as Paul Harvey says; you know (the rest of the story).Pass this on! > She deserves the press
