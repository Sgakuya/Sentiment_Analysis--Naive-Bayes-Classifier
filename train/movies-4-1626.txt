Looking for realism in a martial arts movie is an adventure that is doomed to futility and is something that should be a given up from the start. Master Lee (Bruce) had a difficult time trying to convince the producers of "The Green Hornet" television series (in which he played the part of Kato in the late 60's) that when he kicked or punched an opponent, they normally lost consciousness very quickly on their way to the floor. The producers, knowing that it was their job to give the viewers of a campy, action hero series a reason to watch (That being goofy, long-winded, action packed bouts where good inevitably triumphs, againt overwhelming odds, against evil.) told Lee to keep his mouth shut if he liked cashing his generous paychecks. Lee took this lesson into his own career and gave the genre it's first and greatest international superstar by arranging the bouts in his films along much the same lines. Later we saw Jackie Chan add heavy doses of slapstick and ever more death defying stunts that have continued to amaze and satisfy audiences to this day. The point being; This stuff ain't supposed to stay strickly within the laws of phyics, so can your skeptical, intellectual, innervisions and pass the popcorn. With Ang Lee's visually soaring epic "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", you get action, adventure, scenic panorama, and a touching tale of love and betrayal. It's far more an art film than it is fodder for the lovers of shoot em' ups and car chases. Maybe some of you guys should have taken your girlfriends to see this picture instead of those guys you go out skateboarding with. If you're still not convinced in I can tell you what did it for me; The opportunity to gaze upon the strikingly beautiful countenance of the lovely Ziyi Zhang (who was billed as Zhang Ziyi in those days) for the better part of two hours. If that doesn't get your heart rate up you may be due for a check-up.
