I was a sailor aboard the USS Kearsarge in 1947. Our ship was anchored near the Forth Bridge. I remember hearing the sound of bagpipes floating across the water from a little town on the south shore. It was a sound I will never forget. We were give pound notes when we left the ship to go into Edinburgh. We had no change, so the bus driver just let us go into Edinburgh free. This was just after World War II and I think food was still scarce. I remember seeing a broken egg on the sidewalk and a lady saying what a shame that was. That was 53 years ago and it seem just like yesterday. I guess love doesn,t have anything to do with time.
