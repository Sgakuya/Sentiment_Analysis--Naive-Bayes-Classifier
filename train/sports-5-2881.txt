Without doubt the greatest baseball player who ever lived and is also without peer throughout the annals of sport. The most dominate player of his era and, had he continued to pitch, would almost certainly have made the Hall-of-Fame on the strength of his left arm. Swatting tape measure homeruns (a term invented early in his career to describe his mighty clouts) with a bat that could hardly be lifetd by mere mortals, The Babe put baseball on the map to stay. How much would a player of his impact be worth today? With his talent and marketability, he could possibly have become the first billionaire athlete. His staggering exploits are far too numerous to detail. The "Sultan of Swat" stands so high above the heads of his fellow baseball brethren that any list open to discussion of the game's greatest players can only realistically begin at number two. One of the quotes mentioned in Ken Burns' 10 part documentary on the history of baseball said that Babe Ruth stood above baseball like "an Everest in Kansas." This rather accurately describes the impact of and scope Ruth. He was simply the greatest of all time and the standard by things, both inside and outside of the world of sport, are still judged to this day.
