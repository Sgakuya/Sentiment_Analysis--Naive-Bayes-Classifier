Let's talk about the delayed flag (2003 Fiesta bowl). As the ball is thrown to Chris Gamble, if you slow down the tape replay, we see that Gamble' jersey is almost ripped off him, that can be either holding or pass interference, then as the ball drops, you see the miami defenders hand go not just on, but inside Gamble's helemet, guess what? That is a penalty, (face mask for you Oklahoma, Canes, USC, and IOWA fans!) it would put the ball on the goal line. Next point, Miami had 5 shots from goal to get the ball in. They couldn't. They lost. This team may not pull it off this year, but remember, Clarett has to stay around for another year, and the talent is just getting better, and they don't have Coop around dissing everything that Ohio State football stands for. My final argument about the '02 national chamionship involves a play at the end of the 4th quarter. Mr. gamble has the ball thrown to him, he is not only held, he is ruled out of bounds. Even Keith Jackson and the other Moron in the both said that is was two missed calls. Maybe had the people calling the game for ABC not been so biased against the Buckeyes, I wouldn't have to read this garbage about how Ohio State did not win fair and square. They won a lot close games, that's how it works.
