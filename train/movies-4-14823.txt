I really enjoyed Trainspotting in fact I saw it twice in the span of about 10 days. I thought it did a great job of portraying a sense of emotion that you could feel in scene after scene. For instance it was like one of those films where you see everyone smoking cigarettes and something about the way they do it or the looks of pleasure on their faces or whatever but you're sitting there thinking man I could go for a cigarette right about now and I don't even smoke! Trainspotting was kind of like that with the heroin scenes, not that I was thinking man I gotta score some heroin but in that they portrayed so vividly the experience that somehow you could relate. Of course having never tried heroin I can't really say how accurate that assessment is but I thought it was very expressive and very poignant.
