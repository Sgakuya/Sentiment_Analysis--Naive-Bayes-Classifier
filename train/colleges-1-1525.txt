The MSU School of Social Work is a program of administrative corruption, unethical teaching practices, and mistreatment of students. Administrators, professors, and practicum coordinators engage in all kinds of wrong-doing, much of which is done with deliberate interference against students such as making personal attacks against their character. Students have their chances of success crushed by administrators who mismanage their curriculum and engage in character assassination. Minority students come under attack simply for being minorities. Administrators blacklist students by making statements that lead internship supervisors to question their competence. Professors are arrogant and unresponsive to student needs and classroom instruction is terrible. Professors push political agendas that are both anti-male and anti-family. Students who dont embrace their unfair administrative practices or mean-spirited political viewpoints in the classroom are graded unfairly and washed out of the program. Social work administrators engage in a variety of underhanded techniques in which Michigan State University money is used wrongly. Each year, professors and administrators use MSU money to take expensive vacations to various places in the United States and through-out the world. Administrators and professors engage in all kinds of indiscretions and abuses. Their marketing techniques find students experiencing all kinds of deception and chicanery. Students are mislead in numerous ways, such as being duped into enrolling in the program without knowing its a teleconference course, or being led to believe they will get a certain practicum only to discover upon entering that program that the practicum they were promised is unavailable.
