So far, so good. Like millions of other people, I'm very curious and optimistic about Powell's upcoming tenure as Secretary of State. Right now he apparently has an approval rating of something ridiculous like 80%. One or two controversial decisions and I'm sure that rating will drop, but at the moment it's testimony to the enormous amount of goodwill this man has accumulated over his years of public service, especially his leadership during the Gulf War. Powell strikes me as a thoughtful, intelligent, politically savvy individual, and I feel much better about George W. Bush's lack of international experience now that Powell is taking over State. It's reassuring to know at least one voice is going to consistently demand a realistic exit strategy before any commitment of American troops to overseas trouble spots. At the same time, I hope Powell won't err too far on the other side and move the U.S. towards an overly-isolationist stance that leads to humanitarian disasters that could have been avoided by judicious use of military forces. It's a tricky line to walk, but I think Powell has the experience and intelligence to make the right decisions.
