Went to capella for my masters in general psych and am attending now for my ph.d in the same program. I plan to get my license (in California) to practice psychology. I find the process challenging, the teachers good, and the courses expensive. My only gripe about the program is that it's not APA approved, a process that takes any school a few years to accomplish. I know personally that Capella is rapidly attempting to gain APA accreditation. The APA approval won't affect me (most states do not require APA approval for licenser) but I'd still rather have it for credibility. Then again, I plan to open a private practice and have blue cross send me most of my paitients. Most pt's don't care where you went to school, so long as it's accredited and you have your license. I seem to have the personality that really matches online courses (self-discipline, ability to manage time, basic computing skills, rather introverted). If you're considering Capella (or any online institution) do yourself a favor and take an online course at your local community college. If you seem to do well in that format, you'll know that online learning might be for you. What I like about capella is that they are rapidly working to increase their prestige. Mark my words, in a few years, haveing a masters will be as important as having a bachelors, and many people who don't want to commute or already have roots in a small town not close to a major U will opt for the online route. At that point, Capella will become much, much more selective, which will then increase its prestige. Might just make it the ivy of the online format. Those interested in Capella might also want to check out Walden and Fielding. Do not look to the U. of Pheonix or devry-- which have horrible reputations. The site www.capellauniversitysucks.us/ is written by one disgruntled ex-student kicked out for making abusive comments during an online course. Take the whole site with a massive grain of salt.
