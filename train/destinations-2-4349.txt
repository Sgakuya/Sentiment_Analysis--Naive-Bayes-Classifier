I've lived in this city for three years, and I can say that it pretty much meets every sterotype you've ever heard about it: sprawling suburb, plastic women, uneducated people, superficial people, and cars, cars, cars, everywhere! The traffic has got to be one of the worst things in any American city, and the fact that there is no public transportation doesn't help either. It's also one of the most segregated communities I've ever seen in my life. White people on the west side, black and latino people on the south and east sides, and pockets of Asian people in various areas. If you're into pop culture and commercialism, come to LA. If you want to have an intelligent conversation with someone, you'll probably find yourself disappointed.
