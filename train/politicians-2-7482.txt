One of the last unreconstructed Jacksonians in the US Senate, Jesse Helms was a force to be reckoned with. His politics exemplified the old Southern way of thinking; combine religion with nationalism and strong on traditional values which could mean a lot of things depending on the person. He chaired the Senate Foreign Relations committee during part of the 1980's and from 1995-2002. There he kept up the fight against communism in Cuba, free trade agreements and anything remotely 20th Century. Some on this board wonder why he was re-elected so many times down there in North Carolina. He always appealed strongest to older white male voters of both political parties. He was an economic and social populist. Helms retired last year from the Senate, and about time as well.
