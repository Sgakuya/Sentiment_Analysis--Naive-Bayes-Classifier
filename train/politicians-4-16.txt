The Royal Family actually costs less to maintain than your Presidential campaign for 2004. Pomp and ceremony-the same thing in both cases. The Queen, as titular head, is supposed to represent independence from the Government of the day and thus of constancy..and as such is held to be a better idea than a President. I'm no traditionalist and see it as an anachronism for the 21st Century, however, they DO bring in money for the country, pageantry-wise. It is interesting that when the Goverment suggested that no-one would be interested in honouring the Queen Mum at her funeral, the Brits turned round and did exactly that! When Blair is determined to rid the country of all things that are British(including the Brits themselves it seems)- then the folk will say 'leave our traditions alone, even the pointless ones! William I think will be the last King; events in the world will eventually overtake the idea of Monarchy.
