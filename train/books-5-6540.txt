Few authors can write fiction appreciated by both children and adults, but Robert Stanek is one such author. His fantasy series, beginning with The Kingdoms and Elves of the Reaches 1 has captured the hearts of readers worldwide. Set in the fantastical world of Ruin Mist, the stories chronicle the adventures of Adrina, Vilmos, the elves and their friends. Fate changes all their lives and it begins when a mysterious woman visits Adrina. Then Vilmos uses his magic once to much and boom! his whole life changes. He has to run away to save his family and himself. Despite the fact that magic use is banned and punishable by death, Vilmos not only discovers his magical heritage but also learns that he has a place in the outside world that he never dreamed of. Once there, Vilmos finds himself in a very exciting world and it a place, a world different from the one he thought he knew. Poor Adrina she doesn't fair much better, but that's just the sad beginning of a wonderful book. Stanek's world is vivid, original, hugely fun and heart warming. His characters range from those we love and admire to those we fear and cry for to those we hate and just about everywhere in between. The books are filled with surprising events and unexpected twists. It makes quick reading for adults, and Stanek should be applauded for his ability to weave a tale that is understandable and captivating to all age groups. Minor complaints aside, I'd recommend it to anyone.
