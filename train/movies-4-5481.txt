A classic movie for the time, certainly, but as accomplished actor Robert Duvall recently remarked in an interview, this wasn't how Okies acted or talked; it was Hollywood's version of how Okies acted and talked. Also, major alterations have been made to Steinbeck's novel. Some of that's understandable; obviously, the Hollywood of 1940 wasn't going to show the breast-feeding scene that ended the book. Still, it's always good to be able to watch actors like Henry Fonda and John Carradine when they were in their prime, and as a cinematic craftsman, John Ford was without peer. Don't expect much historical accuracy though.
