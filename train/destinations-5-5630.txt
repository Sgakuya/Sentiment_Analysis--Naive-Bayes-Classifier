I must say it makes me laugh when I hear people say that only a 'left wing elitist' would like Massachusetts. Who would like low rated red states here LIKE Miss. Kansas, Utah Wyoming or Texas- right wing reactionary scape goating bigots that think its ok to commit hate crimes and have a narrow mind? I guess being an American nowdays is not standing for freedom of choice, AGAINST separation of church and state and spreading hate and ignorance- makes me glad I live near Massachusetts. I am tired of the hate and name calling and just plain igorance that seemingly has a place in this country now Away from the tolerant coasts. In Nazi Germany, the 'regime' blamed all of Germany's problems on 'intellectuals' and 'elitists'. Homosexuals where routinely prosecuted and lastly the Jews where subjected to extermination- perhaps the majority of the republican party outside of the Northeast has taken a cue of scapegoating by another right wing regime of the past. IF this makes me an 'elitist' that so it be- better then the obvious alternative.
