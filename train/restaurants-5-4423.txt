Outback is the greatest restaraunt ever. Let me tell you just a few of the things I know about Outback. They only use USDA Choice beef - meaning it is the BEST possible beef on the market, no exceptions. Yes they are not open for lunch, but that's because dozens and dozens of their foods are being home-made each and every morning. The Aussie chips and Bloomin' Onions are cut fresh every morning, not taken out of a freezer like Applebee's. The soups are homemade, chocolate, croutons, cinnamon pecans - you name it, it's home made starting from scratch. These people put more effort and quality into their foods than any other restaraunt i've ever been to. The chicken and fish are always fresh, never frozen like other restaraunts. For those who are complaining about the price, for the quality and freshness of the foods you are eating it is WELL worth it. Another thing - Outback has smaller section sizes than most restaraunts so that each and every customer will receive quality, attentive service. All I ask is that before you judge such a quality place such as Outback, you should at least know SOMETHING about what you're talking about. This is the best restaraunt I've ever been to, No Rules Just Right Mate! P.S. If you don't like the wait there is CALL AHEAD SEATING - meaning your name is near the top of the wait sheet when you arrive.. Come on people you can wait 15 mintues without starving to death can't you?
