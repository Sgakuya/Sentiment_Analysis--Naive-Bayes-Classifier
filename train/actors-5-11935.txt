Ah, Angelina Jolie. What can I say? Her roles never cease to amaze me, not to mention what she does with them. For those of you who say She plays the same role over and over again, whats up with that? Let me hand you some helpful information. Here is just a few of her film appearences: Foxfire; Gia; Girl Interrupted ;Bone Collector; Hackers; and Playing by Heart. Thats just a sample of the films she has starred and co-starred in. If you have not seen half of these flicks, i suggest you not make such an assumption without something to back it up. Another thing i noticed in a couple of these reviews, are remarks made about her brother. How can you rate someone by something you read in a magazine, or by something you heard on tv? The National Enquirer just loves people like you. Yea you..the brain dead prick who judges people by common rumour, instead of by talent like should be. You give human nature a worse name. I am not a HUGE angelina jolie fan, but i do admire her work and her personality. and many other actors and actresses that get judged by national enquirer bs as well. start judging people on stuff you know is true, not by what you think you know. Rock on AJ.
