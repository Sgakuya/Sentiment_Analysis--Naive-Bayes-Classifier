My wife and I bought a used 1998 Saturn SL last September and absolutley love the car. I like the safetly features on it (dual air bags and such) and find it to be rather roomy (important being a 6' tall, 300 pound lineback of a guy). We have only had two problems with it so far. One is that our inside light shorted out. A minor problem. The other was that the car, somehow, flooded one day. We brought it in for service and have not had a problem since. We've used the car for long trips and have gotten very good gas mileage out of it. Sure, a Lexus would probably blow this away, but this is an economy car and I find it suits me very nicely.
