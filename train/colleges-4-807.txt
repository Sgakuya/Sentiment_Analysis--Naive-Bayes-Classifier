UOP is a good school either online or going to the ground campus. Of course it is not as good as NorthWestern or Harvard but this is a different kind of school. This is a college desgined to help adults who are already employed full-time who do not have the time to go to a traditional school. The classes are tailored so these students can still learn and earn their degrees. The class material is just as indepth and challenging as I have taken at the University of Illinois and far more challenging than my local community college. The majority of the complaints have been about counselors or financial aid as well as strong selling tactics. This is all true but the goal of students is to get a good education an to earn a degree. If you go out to eat and have bad service or if you buy a car and hate the hassel the salesman does that mean that your food was bad or that the car you bought was bad? No, it means parts of the process were not desireable but the end product was good. UOP has instructors who are all working in their field right now, they are in the mix everyday and pass along this information to students. The material is not week nor is the work load requirements from the students. I am almost finished with my degree and I feel that the education I have earned has been just as good as when I went to U of I. Dont let people tell you it is a degree mill, it is not! These people have not taken classes at UOP and are making blanket statements about UOP just because it is not a traditional school.
