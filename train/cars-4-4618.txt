You Chevy guys crack me up. Don't get me wrong..I love chevy's..as long as it's a corvette or a camaro. Trucks are a different matter all together. I never feel like I am in a truck when I'm in a chevy.Especially older models....You can jack em'up,trick it out...put your 48 inch super sick swampers on it...whatever...and I bet you money if I drive behind it...it will smell like it's running rich. It as if it was trying to be something it's not. Have you seen the new Chevy trucks?...they look like something only my granpa would get exited about. But let's get real... when it comes to track record reliability,looks etc. Ford has always led the way. Anyone who complains about what a piece of crap their rig was, could of had the same problem with Dodge,chevy,Ford, porsche,Aston martin, Kia, Mercedes or Bently. SORRY FOR YOUR LUCK!
