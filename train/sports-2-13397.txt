A very over-rated coach. His brilliance really came when he chose his offensive coordinator (Charlie Weis) and defensive coordinator (Romeo Crennel). However, both of those men who really were the driving force for this team, are gone (Weis went to Notre Dame, Crennel went to Cleveland), and in the same season even. That's virtually impossible to make up for. Now, Belichick is acting as his own offensive coordinator, and that can only end in disaster because he's a defensive minded coach. Would you ever hand your offense's reigns to Gunther Cunningham or Larry Coyer? Hell, I wouldn't give my offense over to successful head coaches like Marty Schottenheimer or Bill Cowher. Why would you do it with Belichick? Besides, the Pats have lost so much of their talent and leadership it's not even funny. Ty Law went to the Jets. Tedi Bruschi is probably done for his career after that stroke. Roman Phifer is gone. Keith Traylor is gone. David Patten is gone. It's probably going to be really ugly for them this year.
