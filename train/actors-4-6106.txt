This guys was such a perfect pick for his role in 'Swingers'. He was cocky, hilarious and a great friend all at the same time. I thought he did a really good job in 'Clay Pigeons' where he played a pretty weird serial killer (I wonder if there are any serial killers out there that are not weird at all). I did not like the movie 'Return to Paradise' too much, but still think his performance wAS solid. Have not heard a heck of a lot from him in the past uear or so, but I am sure he has some projects that are in the wokrs. He is one of those actors that when I see his name associated with a movie, I will more than likely make the effort to go out and catch that film.
