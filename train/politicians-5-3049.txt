Former President Clinton was one of our greatest Presidents. During his entire Presidency we enjoyed peace, prosperity in spite of his political enemies endless efforts to derail his presidency. The facts speak for themselves, Pres. Clinton kept America safe by keeping a strong military as we saw right after 9/11/01. Because if the military was as bad as his haters tried say, they could not have performed so superbly in Afganistan. He could work with republicans as well as democrats to get things accomplished. He didn't blame other people when things went wrong as his political enemies often do. You can always tell the people who unfairly hated this great president because they refused to give him credit for all the good things that happen under his watch. All they wanted to talk about was his sex life. At least our young men & women weren't dying in a war similar to Vietnam while he was in office. But, while they are seething with hatred, this great President continues to grow in popularity and is loved by millions all over the world as evidenced by the thru the roof book sells of his book My Life. I'm sure all those sells did'nt result from his dripping with hatred critics who thinks he should never have been president. They can't understand that if former President Clinton could run again for President he would be re-elected and thats a fact. So stop with the hate it just makes you feel bad right?
