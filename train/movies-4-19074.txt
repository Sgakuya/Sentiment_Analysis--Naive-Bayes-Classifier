Clever! Final Destination was better than I expected. Where I thought I'd be seeing another movie with some crazed killer wearing a ghost mask or a hook for a hand, Final Destination sets itself apart with an interesting premise. Devon Sawa is one of a handful of teenage students who manages to escape a horrific plane explosion which he envisioned in a dream. However - and this is the twist - death comes back to finish off those who escaped the crash. One by one, each plane crash survivor meets their end in a variety of ways. The tension and anxiety builds as you know who's going to die next but you don't know how. That's what makes Final Destination better than Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer where each character is killed pretty much in the same way a la knife or hand hook. I definitely recommend you see this movie if you already haven't. As for those who give Final Destination a bad rating, just what the heck were you expecting? Masterpiece Theatre?
