If there's one school that is worth every dime you may spend on it to go there it's Harvard. The name and reputation that goes with being a Harvard alum is , as they say in the Mastercard commercials....Priceless. Harvard is considered the VERY BEST academic school in the nation and it's name and rep is known by even the ordinary guy on the street, working stiff who knows little to nothing about higher education. The network of alumni and the students you'll go to school with are also just the type of associates that you'd want to have as you move into the working, professional world. Get a degree from Harvard and you've already won half the battle. Simply the best !
