i actually found this movie quite funny. i'm trying not to feel guilty about it. sure, once again we have Ben Stiller playing the same role as he always does: the napoleonesque manic, but for me, this time it actually works. i found his parody of a self-loving gym owner, White Goodman, hysterical and quotable in terms of humorous lines. Vince Vaughn walks through the film(something he seems to have made a small niche out of doing), but unlike some other roles the act is quite endearing in this. the rest of the cast offer hyserical support. now, did i seek Dodgeball out. actually last summer i saw previews and thought it looked dumb. but they were playing the movie on the return flight i was on from San Francisco. I had a book i wanted to read, but thanks to a couple of screaming children, i was persuaded to rent the headphones and watch the film. i wouldn't have paid $10 bucks for it in the theatre, but when i need a cheap laugh i'll consider this film. Dodge, Duck, Dive, Dip and....Dodge.
