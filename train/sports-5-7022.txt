To say Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time is an understatement. He was undoubtly the greatest sportsperson of all time. His statistics may be great however the fact that he pulled so many admirers to his games both home and away is possibly the greatest statistic that proves my opinion. For many seasons (nearly all) the games he played in were sold out. The fact that demonstrating sensational skills and entertainment, is what made about his fame. Saying that many might disagree, however his success really attests to the fact the he must have trained very hard. In Australia the only time we ever got to see the NBA on free TV is when Jordan was playing, alot has changed. I could crap on forever but this will do.
