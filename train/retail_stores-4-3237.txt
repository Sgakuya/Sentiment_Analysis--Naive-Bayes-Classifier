How about all you whining little crack babies get a life and join the real world. If you keep a movie past its due date, guess what, you just rented it again. So if it was a 2 day rental and you're gonna be late, keep it another 2 days. Same thing for the week long rentals. It costs you the same price whether it is 2 hours or 2 days late, so just hold onto it. The reason you pay the rental price for each period you keep it out, is because now someone else can't rent it. Life isn't fair, but if you call yourself an adult, then act like it. Take responsibility for yourself. If your movie is late, take it inside, pay the balance, and you won't be hassled as some of you whiners like to say. And if you have a problem with a company, don't post it on some message board, e-mail them over and over with your complaint, they actually will help you.
