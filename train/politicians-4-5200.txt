I THINK AL GORE SHOULD BE OUR NEW/NEXT PRESIDENT. EVEN THOUGH HE SUPPORTS THE ABORTION RIGHT, I BELIEVE HE DONE IT FOR GOOD REASONS.. I THINK HE FEELS THAT THE WOMAN HAS THE RIGHT TO DECIDE IF THAT'S WHAT SHE WANST TO DO. FOR INSTANCE, IF SHE'S RAPED, AND BECOMES PREGNANT, SHE MIGHT NOT WANT THE BABY. SO THAT'S HER ONLY WAY OF DISCARDING IT. I PERSONALLY DON'T CONDONE ABORTION, BUT I DO FEEL IT'S THE WOMAN'S DECISION TO MAKE. LIKE WE ALL DO, SHE'LL HAVE TO ANSWER TO G-O-D FOR WHAT SHE HAS DONE......ME PERSONALLY, IF WERE IN THAT TYPE OF SITUATION, MAY GOD FORBID, I'LL CARRY THE CHILD TO TERM, THAT WILL GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME TO SEE IF I WANT TO KEEP IT, AFTER ALL, IT IS A PART OF ME..IF I DECIDE OTHERWISE, I'LL DO WHAT I KNOW IS THE RIGHT THING....GIVE IT UP FOR ADOPTION......FORTUNATELY, I HAVE TWO KIDS WHOM I LOVE DEARLY, AND WON'T GIVE THEM UP FOR THE WORLD..IF I WERE IN THAT KIND OF SITUATION, BEING THE PERSON I AM, I'LL KEEP THE CHILD AND LOVE IT AS IF HE/SHE WAS CONCIEVED OUT OF LOVE.THAT'S A FACT.....
