It's a matter of basically generations. People of my generation remember jordan, the earlier generation remembers bird and magic, the generations before remember chamberlin and robertson, etc. Is Jordan the best ever? Thats debateable ofcourse, is he the best I ever saw? without a doubt. Robertson may have been a better all around player and chamberlin is an unfair comparison cause of his size. The leadership ability sets him apart from many though, his biggest advantage was the multi billion dollar industry sports has become and as a self promoter he is only second to muhhamed ali. But jordan was the most astehically pleasant player to watch, he was graceful and in the clutch was always there to drain an amazing shot.The only problem I have is really ignorant statements by people in this poll saying if he was so great then why didnt he play great in washington?.... well genius maybe cause he was 40 YEARS OLD!!!! yet he still managed to avg close to 20 points a game and secure himself as the all time ppg avg leader.
