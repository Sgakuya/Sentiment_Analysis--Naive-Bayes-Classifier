I liked it. The movie brought back fond memories of being absolutely enthralled with the book when I was a kid, and it seemed to stay pretty true to the original story. I thought the dynamics between the kids worked pretty well - Peter was the clear leader, and did a good job in the older brother role. As actors, they weren't too bad either. Narnia itself was fantastic, and it was hard to tell where the special effects ended and real animals began. Aslan's voice just didn't work for me - I found it to be too prissy or something - but other than that, if you liked the book, you should definitely shell out to see this movie at the theater.
