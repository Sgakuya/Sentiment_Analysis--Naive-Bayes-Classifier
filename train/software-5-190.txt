*** Update*** So today is Opera's tenth anniversary and they're giving away the browser for free. Here's what you do: Go here: http://my.opera.com/community/party/reg.dml Type in your email address, and get a registration key. Copy the registration key. Then download the browser, register it, and paste your registration key. Presto, you have an ad free Opera browser - widely regarded as the best browser in the business. A $39 value. You can thank me later *** I'm not inclined to pay for a browser - not with so many good free options out there. Yes, Opera offers a free version, but it's plastered with ads. While Opera is by all accounts a fast, feature rich browser, until they can provide the ad free version at no charge, i see no reason to switch from Camino.
