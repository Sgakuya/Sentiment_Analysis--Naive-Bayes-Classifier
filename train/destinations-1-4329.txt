This lice-infested city deserves NO stars at all! I have lived in Lost Angeles for four years, and was shocked when I first got here. I thought I had to adjust myself to the environment. But my conscience was right. THe people are jerks, fake, a$$holes, freaks, weird and are out to get you. LA, though cosmopolitan, is segregated. I have never encountered so much racist people in my life. The smog...oh so gross. Then there's traffic. LIfe in hell-A is basically waiting, waiting, waiting. You wait in long lines at the airport, DMV, traffic, emergency room, restaurants, theaters, drive LONG distances to get home...waiting waiting waiting. Life in hell-A is basically giving people stress and loving it. I think the people of LA are sick upstairs. I've had it with this poophole, and moved out. I am warning you guys who want to come to LA, to NOT go there...NEVER!!!
