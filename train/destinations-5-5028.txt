I'm a Southern girl and have lived in Tennessee all my life, but I've traveled enough to add my ratings with confidence, and can easily say that New York is the most divese, beautiful, and magical state I've visited. NYC is a dream in itself, but it only scratches the surface of this magnificent state. The sheer majesty of the Adirondacks and Catskills is incredible. Niagra Falls and the Finger Lake Regions are equally beautiful in their own rite. The Hudson Valley is a backdrop for a Currier and Ives Christmas Card. The Lake Erie region that borders one of the most breathtaking and intimidating bodies of water next to the Great Atlantic Ocean is an unforgettable experience, and Long Island Sound offers a fun place to visit even though I may never afford to live there (I can still appreciate it.) The entertainment, culture, shopping, arts, history in New York City is second to none. The people -fast paced and clipped accents - are a bit guarded, but in a city of this size, this is to be expected. Get to know them and you'll find some of the nicest and most down to earth people anywhere. Travel north for an hour or so and you'll find the hometown USA experience many of us grew up with and wish we still had. From a southern girl who hails from a region unfairly labeled as yankee haters -you'll see by this post -that mindset is not as true as one might think.
