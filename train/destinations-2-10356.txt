Uh, I got a buddy of mine to give my girl money to buy these, cause I wanted to try them, and i wasn't about to pay for them. I was really annoyed, not even at how bad they were, at how they werent slim at all, they were just as wide as my Luckies, i wanted to walk around with one as a joke, looking like a queer i wanted to see people reactions, but they look like a regular longs, very dissapointing lol. Anyways, the taste was terrible, it was almost like not tasting anything, or just pure rolling paper, AND having it leave a pretty bad aftertaste. Definately not recommended, I only gave it a 2 because i prefer them to that "ammonia" taste of alot of generic brands, etc.
