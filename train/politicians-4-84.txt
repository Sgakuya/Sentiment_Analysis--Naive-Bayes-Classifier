I beleive it is a mistake for T.R.H. The Earl and Countess of Wessex not to style their daughter H.R.H. Princess Louise of Wessex. The child is a royal princess by right and by birth. To try to obscure her rank for whatever reason only causes unneccesary confusion and breaks with the tradition and continuity of the monarchy. There are never too many royal pinces and princesses in Great Britain. George V clearly decreed who is to be a royal prince of his royal house when he proclaimed the Royal House of Windsor in 1917. I certainly hope that other members of the royal family title and stlye their children according to Geoge V's edit.
