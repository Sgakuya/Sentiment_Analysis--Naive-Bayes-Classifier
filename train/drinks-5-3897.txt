This is direct-dialing drinking that can be quite elegant. People who don't like martinis probably didn't mix them properly or used crappy ingredients. Mix the martinis in a pitcher rather than shaking them. Pour the high-quality dry vermouth in the iced pitcher and stir vigorously. Then pour all the liquid out of the pitcher, so that only the hint of vermouth remains on the ice cubes and glass. Add high-quality vodka and stir, strain into a chilled glass. Olives, pearl onions, a lemon twist, whatever you like to garnish it. This will do the trick effacaciously, believe me. You know the old adage: Martinis are like breasts: one's not enough and three's too many.
