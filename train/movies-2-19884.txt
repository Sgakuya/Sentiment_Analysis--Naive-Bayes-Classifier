I was torn on whether or not I wanted to go see this--I really liked the creepy haunting images in The Ring, though, and the previews seemed to promise a similar style, so I figured I'd give it a shot. The similarities in style are no coincidence: like The Ring, The Grudge is also a remake of a Japanese film (Ju-on: The Grudge; Takashi Shimizu, who directed the Japanese version also directed this American version) But, whether it was because I was used to such imagery from watching The Ring or they just didn't have the same oomph, this didn't do it for me. The setting is Japan: An American student named Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) gets a gig caring for a pretty much catatonic elderly woman in this nice but creepy house. Thing is, the place is tainted by a violent past which ends up destroying everything that comes through its doors. Even though Gellar admittedly didn't do a bad job as far as acting goes, and the imagery was kind of spooky, it still didn't deliver. A little predictable, not enough mystery. Kind of disappointing.
