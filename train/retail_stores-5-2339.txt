WinCo Foods is by far the best company to work for! I work for the store in Roseville, CA and we have the best customers, and team of employees that really work hard to make the store look the way it does! It's an amazing grocery store with the best prices, and that are unbeatable, and the best selection to chose from. For those who are not impressed with the store, thats fine, but you really do not need to be excessively rude, or rude at all about it on here when you leave comments. I don't understand why one would be dissatisfied with such an awesome store like WinCo Foods. There is absolutely nothing to complain about, and those of you complaining have nothing better to do but moan and groan! The stores in California however are completely different than those in all of the other states that WinCo services, we have the newest stores, and they feel completely different than most up north. But overall, everyone should be thankful to have such a great grocery store that meets all of ones grocery needs plus more! For those of you who already shop WinCo, Thank you for shopping at WinCo Foods, the supermarket low price leader! ps. For those of you who work with me at the Roseville store, you might recognize the phrase above since I say this on the loud speaker when making announcements!! HAHA!
