As a student currently attending Vanderbilt University, I am consistently blown away by the talents of my peers, faculty, and the university's administration. The multitude and diversity of events that occur on campus are enough to keep any student entertained. Although Vanderbilt has been a highly conservative campus in yesteryear, a recent influx of liberalism has brought on a movement to reverse the trend. Vanderbilt's location just minutes from downtown Nashville gives students the flexibilty to spend a night on the town or remain on the campus we affectionately call the Vanderbubble. What other school boasts being ranked a Top 20 Academic, Top 25 Party, highly competitive in the SEC in most sports, with both men's and women's basketball teams making it to the Sweet Sixteen?
