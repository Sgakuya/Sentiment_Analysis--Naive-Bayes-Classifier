I bought my 2002 Frontier XE V-6 Kingcab in Oct 2003. It had 37000 miles and was used lightly. Since that time, I have had no problems whatsoever. Gas mileage averages between 18-22mpg. It accelerates well and brakes smoothly. I've had it up to 105mph with no problems. It cruises at 85-95mph with no trouble at all. Off-road, it performs admirably, with good traction; in the snow it is a little light in the rear end, sometimes gets a little squirrelly. The interior is pristine, and well-appointed. The CD player and sound system are more than adequate. I'm very pleased with the performance and durability of this vehicle so far. My only critique, on a personal note, is that I wish I had bought the Crew Cab, as it would have given me more storage room. The Supercharged version of this truck is also very nice, with more power and acceleration. Bottom line: For the money, this vehicle performs as well as or better than the Tacoma, which is more expensive. I don't buy domestic vehicles-- simply put, they break and cease to function within months of my purchasing them, whereas this vehicle keeps going-- so the Nissan Frontier continues to exceed my expectations.
