I go there about 4 days a week. The food is good, and it's good for you, and they wear gloves and prepare your sandwiches while you watch (so you don't have to worry about being a victim of one of those fast-food workers that get caught on videotape doing weird things). But there's one big drawback - they give you two very small napkins for a foot-long sub. This is crazy. When you've got sweet onion sauce oozing out onto your hands, you need more napkins than that. They keep them under glass so customers can't get to them. If you ask for more, they still only give you one or two more. They told me that they are required not to hand out many. Are these napkins made out of gold or something? I'm considering walking in with a roll of paper towels under my arm after this.
