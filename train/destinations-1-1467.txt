Gotta save my victriol for this culturally anemic, spiritually deficient, morally relative, squeamish, virulent anti-American traitorous NATO nation and washed up has-been in the face of modern world affairs. When will these hopeless wanna-be players realize that Jean Lafitte and Charles de Gaulle are in the past? Their esteemed haute couture pales in the face of good ol' fashioned AMERICAN steak, eggs and potatoes, whole milk, hamburgers, hot dogs slathered with ketchup. Putting ketchup on everything is the AMERICAN way---and, the ONLY way!!! The only thing that was worthy to be French was the French fry! A bunch of swarthy grape-stomping pansies with berets who cling to memories of their former North American empire. What's left? A few departments? Oh, yeah, like I'm gonna go visit ST. PIERRE ET MIQUELON in my lifetime. Napoleon was actually Italian, dude. Whoa-HO! Gerard Depardieu---can you say Academy Award? And what kind of nonsense is it when you have French bread?!? Uh-uh---AMERICAN BREAD! Wonder is #1! Man, Paris is the city of Light-up! Paris is NOWHERE near the haute couture as good ol' fashioned American Upper Midwest suburbia! France is a silly nation bereft of decent language---who wants to spray saliva all over someone when they speak French? Absolutely unacceptable! They need to speak like in AMERICA, BAY-BEE!
