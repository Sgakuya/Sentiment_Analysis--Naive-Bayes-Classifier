There were a few criteria that helped me to choose Vonage, versus other providers. Criteria: 1. ** Mobility ** When I travel with family, we'd like a system we can travel with. Vonage allows us to carry the small router, plugging in to a broadband connection in a hotel or friend's home, and to a telephone (fixed/portable phone), and make a call as if we were back in North America. That's a big plus. 2. ** Laptop Calls ** If I chose not to bring my router, but want to make a call from my laptop, that I had the option to do it. Vonage offers a softphone, that I can install on my laptop, along with a Virtual Number, to call out and receive calls via my headset. 3. ** Full Featured Services ** Its real handy to have all the services that a local telephone provider offers, ie. call waiting, call forwarding, caller id etc, and not be punished just because its new technology. Vonage offers all regular features plus other advanced ones. I do like the SimulRIng feature, that rings to my cell phone and home phone, when someone calls my Vonage number. This allows me to pick up the call even when I'm out of home. 4. ** Easy to install, User-friendly, ** Other VOIP systems require you to be a rocket scientist to make the system work. With Vonage, I installed the CD, plugged in the router and the telephone line, and made calls within 20 minutes. I really like that! Plus the web control panel for administering my features and options was very user-friendly. 5. ** Price ** I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg to take advantage of this technology. I wanted it to provide convenience, while saving money. Vonage offered me an unlimited call plan for $25, waiving the setup fee and first month fee. That's reasonable. I've since added a local virtual number that routes to my main vonage number, for an extra $4.95/month. In summary, Vonage offered me flexibility, functionality, and a service that meets my needs. Plus I'm excited to know they will be launching a mobile VOIP phone (and video phone) that will allow me to make N. American calls when I'm a hotspot via WIFI. This takes it to the next level. I can just imagine a bunch of people on their WIFI phones at the local Starbucks, calling away without a care in the world {grin}. If you want to enjoy a free month on Vonage, send me an email to vonage@shermanhu.com, with your email address, and I'll send you a refer-a-friend referral notice through email via Vonage. I do benefit also. Vonage also offers me 2 free months of service, when a referral subscribes. Its a win-win. Plus you can offer that to friends and family, and we can all benefit from paying-it-forward. UPDATED REVIEW (SEPT 22,2005): Reading all the reviews in this section, it really looks like there are more Cons to using Vonage, than Pros. Actually quite shocking, as I haven't had these major issues that the others have experienced. I have the occasional drop call when I pick up the line, or it just simply drops after a long conversation with a client/friend, but its not a common occurence. Bottom line, its VOIP. I understand that I'm using VOIP technology, and give it some grace. I just checked my last bill, and I used 1131 minutes this last month, on the $25/m plan. If I had used this much time from Canada to my US clients or friends, I would've paid an arm and a leg to my local provider for it. So you know I'm not sold on Vonage, I also do use Skype, SkypeOut, MSN, Yahoo, Google Talk too. I do use alot of Skype also, but Vonage also comes in very handy when I need it. Cheers, and I hope you enjoy your Vonage service like I do. Sherman
