I'm glad to see that he has hung in there since the election. Some of the Democrats are bullies and i'm glad to see that George Bush and other Republicans are finally giving them a taste of their own medicine I'm sure he'll bring the same strength and conviction to the White House. He is handling this electon crisis with dignity,class and respect. I'm glad to see that he's making the transition arrangements. Unfortunatly he has a lot of work ahead in order to overcome this election nonsense. It may take a long time to overcome but I have no doubt that he will do it with grace and dignity something which this country hasn't seen in a president in eight years. Way to go president-elect Bush!
