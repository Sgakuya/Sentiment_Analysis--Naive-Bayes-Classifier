Barnett's a good coach who's gotten mixed results with some noted accomplishments and noteworthy failures. On the one hand, Barnett ressurected Northwestern, a major achievement in it's own right. Look at NU now and you see a competitive program and a pretty good football school. Barnett at CU has had 4 winning seasons out of six and three Big XII North Titles in four years. Barnett is 3-3 vs CU arch rival Nebraska. Big XII Coach of the Year in 2004. Good stuff. Still, he's 41-32 overall at CU , is 1-2 in Bowls and had that embarassing scandal to go thru. In sum, a good coach who will do a solid job at CU. Expect the occasional down year and the occasional big year. CU will win, go to a decent Bowl and be comepetitive in the Big XII.
