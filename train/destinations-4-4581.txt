Houston gets a bad rap and I think a good bit of it is unjustified. True, it lacks the character of New Orleans, the neatness of Austin and its really big but for some strange reason I don't mind H-Town (I've been to 30 states and I don't currently live there BTW). As a place to visit it ain't too much but as a place to live, you can do far worse. Jobs are plentiful, Homes are affordable, nice neighborhoods abound and there are many shopping opportunities. The city is multicultural and I think this is more of an asset than a detriment. Houston women are good looking and the nightlife is pretty good. The people can be pretentious but are basically friendly and easy to get along with. The weather is basically no worse than any other Southern city (that humidity will keep your skin from aging, you know) and it seldom gets really cold. If you like the outdoors, there's lots of opportunities around Houston although you may have to drive out a bit.
