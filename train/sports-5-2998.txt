I PERSONALLY THINK THAT BABE RUTH IS THE GREATEST HITTER EVER, BECAUSE HE COULD HIT FOR MORE POWER, WITH JUST AS HIGH AN AVG, AND WHEN AN RBI WAS NEEDED, RUTH WOULD SLIGHTLY EXPAND HIS ZONE. HOWEVER, IF ANYONE PUTS UP AN ARGUMENT, WILLIAMS MOST CERTAINLY DOES. HIS ATBAT PER STRIKE OUT RATIO IS JUST INCREDIBLE, AS IS HIS STRIKEOUT TO HOME RUN RATIO. WHILE HE WAS NO RICKEY HENDERSON ON THE BASEPATHS, HE WASNT EXACTLY MO VAUGHN EITHER. HE SCORED 125+ RUNS IN SEVERAL SEASONS. ITS TOO BAD HE MISSED ROUGHLY 5 YEARS TO THE WAR, OR HE COULD HAVE 700 HRS, A .350+ CAREER AVG, 3000 HITS, 2500 RUNS, 2500 WALKS, 625 DOUBLES, ETC. THE ONE KNOCK ON WILLIAMS WAS HIS MEDIOCRE FIELDING, BUT HE WASNT THE WORST, AND, HIS HITTING MORE THAN MADE UP FOR HIS FIELDING. WILLIAMS WAS GREAT
