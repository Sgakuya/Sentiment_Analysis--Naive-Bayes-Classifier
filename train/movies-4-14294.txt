an interesting movie. i wish i could have given it five stars, but its direction and storyline are so smart sometimes, that it's a little choppy. it's fast-paced, dark, exciting, and intriguing. it will generate many, many fans. the good guys in this movie are men from essentially all walks of life, who come together to carve out of gore an identity for themselves be it triumphant or tragic, in secretive, underground, boxing arenas. when the intensive self-degradation and desensitization flower into a secret nationwide franchise and take on the characteristics of a revolutionary coup (uh, exactly who are we stealing the power back from again; the women? oh right, i forgot, questions aren't allowed, sorry) you almost pray the good guys never win. helena bonham carter's character, the ultimate filthy tramp, is accused by norton's narrator of wrecking everything early in the film, presumably by coming between him and pitt's guy, the group's leader, but ironically, later, it's norton's love for her that gives him a more compelling option, and convinces him to bring pitt down. this all makes it seem that the novel, and the screenplay, to keep up with it, was written kind of manically, recklessly, in order to keep the hateful and angry drive going that fueled the story's more imaginitive parts. definitely a movie chock full of extremes, and little of that boring ol sanity stuff. interesting.
