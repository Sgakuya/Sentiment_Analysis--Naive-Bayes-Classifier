Jaco' is a touristy town full of gringos and also many European visitors. The discos are full of hookers, especially the Beatle Bar where prices are high for both drinks and ladies of the night. Prostitution is legal in Costa Rica, so that is to be expected. There are a few excellent hotels, as long as you don't have to have tv, a/c, and all the comforts of home... after all, this is Central America. And everyone does not speak English here. But the main attraction, the beach, is magnificent. It is nearly 300 yards wide, of dark brown (not black) sand, and the waves are stupendous. The water is warm, and temperatures on the coast tend to be higher than inland in the mountains. It is the nearest beach to San Jose, so it attracts most of the tourists. There are two banks, discos, a supermarket, liquor stores, many shops and restaurants, surf schools, and travel agents for trips to national parks and volcanoes. I spent a week here and loved it, but later found the Guanacaste beaches, especially Playa del Coco and Ocotal less crowded and nicer, but they are a 5 hour bus ride from San Jose, only a half hour from the new airport at Liberia. I recommend Jaco' as long as you realize it is not Miami Beach or Laguna.
