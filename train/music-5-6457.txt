I have always had a great respect for Alice Cooper. The man is a legend and some of his 70's work is unbelievable. While he was always a little out there for some of the mainstream, the man is a legend with his trademark theatrics,vocal style, etc. However, that was a long time ago. I knew that Alice had continued recording and still toured annually. However, I have been snakebitten before. Many great acts form the 70's and 80's are now mere shells of themselves. I figured Alice was much older now and knew that he was now an avid golfer and businessman. That just had to mean he had lost his chops, right? I decided to take a chance on the Dragontown album. I had heard his last CD from last year called Brutal Planet. I was surprised at how good BP was, but I still wasn't sure Alice still had it. Well after about two or three listens of Dragontown, I am hear to tell you that Cooper is the exception to the rule. This thing is as good as his classic stuff. I can't believe how powerful Alice still is, and fans of the louder side of rock would be advised to buy this masterpiece. Hope you are around for a few more Alice, because you still have got it!
