I think he seems like a nice enough man, but he is so inarticulate, and that concerns me. He probably is a nicer man than Gore, but that doesn't make him presidential material. I do agree with him on abortion personally, but his educationsl plan is a farce, his enviormental plan, and so on. I agree with im on very little and he keeps touting how big Texas is. Gore has been accused of exaggerating, well Bush does too. Texas has one of the five weakest governorships in the Union. It isn't anything personal against Bush, but that is how their state is set up. The guy doesn't know the issues. You may not like Gore but he is more qualified, and you must look at the bigger picture.Even if you disagree with abortin, it must all go through the Senate and House,so worry about who is winning those elections ven more. Bush is not a good choice.
