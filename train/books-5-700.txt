This is definitely the best book yet. I have thoroughly enjoyed every addition to the series..Rowling just gets better every time. The Goblet of Fire is entertaining, moralistic and fascinating. I enjoyed meeting the students from the other wizarding schools as well as learning even more about the characters that we already know and love. Rowling further develops the characters as well as their friendships..we also get a look into the past..She uses foreshadowing effectively and her descriptive style brings me right into the story. I find myself literally laughing out loud at times, gasping in suspense at others and crying along with or for Harry. Again, the ending more than satisfied me, yet left me wanting more. I cant wait until Year 5. Long Live Harry Potter!
