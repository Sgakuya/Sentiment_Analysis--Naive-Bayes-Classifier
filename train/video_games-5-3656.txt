I am a horror enthusiast. I have always looked for a way to beclome as close as I possibly could to the genre I hold so dear. Resident Evil 2 is the ultimate horror RPG ever crafted. Better game play and graphics than the first and less annoying and frustrating than the third, this truely is one of the coolest and fun to play games it has ever been my delite to play. I am by no means a big video game fan. In fact this has been the only game to grab my attention since the old Super Nintendo. I have not found a game sice Resident Evil 2 that has ever entertained and held my interest as much as this. Resident Evil 2 is a video game all horror fans should play. Filled with the living dead, genetically mutated monsters, gore galore, great backdrops, intresting characters, cool plot and storyline. Very reminicent of George Romero's zonbie films and Dan O Bannon's classic Return of the Living Dead. A true horror fan ought to absolutly adore this great game. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
