Crack that whip Elvira! Woowiee,guess you reallly hated that last film of Stanleys,eh?It was an awfull film,why it lends a whole new level of meaning to vacuous don't ya' think?Kubrick based Eyes Wide Shut on a novel written by Alfred Schnitzler.I doubt there is,or ever will be, any director-film maker who can possibly translate Schnitzlers work into cinema.Kidman did what she could with the script.Tom was too busy trying to be intense,hogging up the film and looking constipated the whole time. Nicole Kidman is a very talented actress.So she sounded Australian,big deal! Why not whale on Paltrow who keeps making movies with British accents? Bet them Brits have a cow everytime an American tries to sound British! So,as an American,it's logical you'd have a cow over an Australian one!
