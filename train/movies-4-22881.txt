The only reason this movie does not get a five is because of the several details from the comics that were left missing to this storyline, characters, etc. There are too many to mention on this site. So, I'll spare you. However, the history of the X-men series has a forty year history of numerous and detailed storylines,and characters that it would be impossible, in my view, to make a X-men movie in perfect harmony with the comic book series. For that to happen, they would have to start at the beginning, and that will never happen. Otherwise, the movie was great. The plot flowed fluently throughout the movie. There was more emphasis on the actual abilities of the mutants (especially Wolverine and Storn). Solid non-stop action, and impressive digital and camera effects (the 1st scene with Nightcrawler emphasizes this point). You will walk out of the theater with the feeling that you've spent your money wisely.
