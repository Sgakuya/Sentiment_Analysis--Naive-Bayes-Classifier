Boston Market is too classy to be labeled as fast food. I once went through their drive-thru and when I got home, I discovered they had made a mistake on my order. I called to complain and within 5 minutes had a manager return my phone call with an offer to bring my correct order to my HOME at no charge. This is unheard of customer service!!! I told him I lived over 5 miles away, and he assured me that was no problem. I was so impressed. I declined to make him deliver our order that night, so he sent a coupon for 2 free meals. I was extremely pleased and they have the best food. Their mashed potatoes and fried apples are the best around.
