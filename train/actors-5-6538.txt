i read most of the reviews about richard gere. when i first saw richard gere in pretty women i thought what every one else thought here is someone thats vain.i donot agree with that.espesially what i have been learning about the humane causes he put his time into witch are aids awareness and also human rights and how he said that in 9/11 what the fireman did for other people was heroic because they didnt care about who the people were they were humans beings. that bacisly that what he belives is that we are on the the planet to help each other no matter what religion or race. thats why i like richerd gere now! and thats why we cant jugged on someone apperence or the parts they take! and that is not the who they are as a person. he is a different person than the rolls he picks. i think he has aged gracefuly because he is at a spiritual time in his life witch makes him more attractive! and that whats makes him better as he ages hes using his wisdom instead of his apperence!
