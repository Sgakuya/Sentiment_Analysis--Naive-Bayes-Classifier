A paean to K All you British expats, who can only lay their hands on the little bottles, you have my eternal sympathy. To paraphrase Dr Johnson - beer is for boys; wine for men; but if you aspire to be a hero, you must drink K! For the last month or so, I've been drinking four cans of K cider a night. A around 4.2 units a can, that works out at about 120 units a week. I just can't get enough of the stuff. It's my friend, my lover, my confidant. I wake up each morning with its taste on my gummy lips. When I'm awake I count the hours until 6 o'clock, when I can crack open a can in front of the tv and let the bittersweet nectar trickle down my gullet. Different types of alcohol can have different effects on the body: whisky makes me aggressive; gin depressed; homebrew makes me dreamy. K, on the other hand, hugs me, rocking me slowly back and forth, whispering in my ear: It's alright, lover, it's alright. Everything is alright.
