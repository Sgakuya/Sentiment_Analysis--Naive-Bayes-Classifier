I have a 1992 F-150 4x4 with 149k on her and she still runs and drives every bit as good as the day she was built. (Still looks nice too!) In fact, just a few weeks ago I used this truck to pull 8'-12' trees out of my yard right by the roots. I Broke a 10,000 lb. tow strap in the process, had to buy a 17,000 lb strap to complete the job. Not bad for a 14 year old truck! Ford "F Series" trucks have been the best selling vehicle for the last 28 straight years for a reason. They are tough and are built to last a long... long time. Sold my last F-150 with 278,000 original miles on it (still ran like a champ). That truck spent it's life as a logging truck in northern Wisconsin. A life of punishment and the ford never skipped a beat. When you buy a Ford F-Series truck, you drive it intil you want to sell it, not until you have to sell it. If you want to drive it until it quits, I hope you're not in any hurry.
