Alan Keyes is both intelligent and straight-forward, both rare qualities in a non-third-party politician. I am fed up with the meandering, ambiguous politicking of every candidate the Democrats or Republicans nominate. Keyes' candor has earned my full support if he runs for the Republican nomination in 2004 (he would've had it this time also, but I am only sixteen). Unfortunately, the United States has long abandoned Keyes' platform, and because of this abandonment, our once-great nation has suffered. It's good to see that someone is willing to fight the uphill battle to get this country back on the right moral track. Liberals call him a theocrat and a demagogue, and they accuse him of social bigotry. But then, it seems liberals are only satisfied when someone somewhere is indulging in deviant (or, as they say, alternate ) behavior.
