My beautiful homestate, love it here, will stay here my whole life. The cold doesn't bother me and the scenery and people of upstate would make up for it even if it did. NYC is where all of the negative stereotypes of new yorkers come from (generaly made by ignorant people in uneducated areas of the country) First off, everyone in NYC isnt mean, and second of all, EVERYONE IN NEW YORK STATE IS NOT LIKE THOSE IN NYC!!! Even some of you people that gave new york very high ratings on here, i just have to tell you, YOU DON'T GET IT. New York state goes will beyond NYC and the Hudson river. We also have the wine country in the central part of the state, the breathtaking adirondac and catskill national forests, the thousand islands in the St. Lawrence seaway, and half of Lake Champlain.
