All the 5's and 1's make me chuckle. In the context of all the excellent and all the incompetent leaders of the British Empire, it's hard to accord Tony Blair status as the most anything leader they've ever had. He stuck with his ally (the United States) when two other long-time, but historically unreliable, allies (France and Germany) abandoned the US, and so he's Bush's butt-boy. Right. Riveting comments, yawn. He was buddies with Clinton and has stuck to his commitments, is a funny and witty international politician in a very difficult time in world history. Do Schroeder and Chirac enjoy worldwide respect today, in all corners? Nobody has all the answers, certainly not in advance. History will treat him kindly, particularly if the European Union pans out. I appreciate his courage under fire for remaining steadfast to what he thinks is right, that is all you can ask of someone in his position.
