I was just introduced to this beer about a year ago. I am not claiming it to be great beer by any means but it definitely has something about it. Not everywhere has it either. Only certain bars carry it. It is best when from a tap because I feel pretty ghetto getting a can of PBR. It is so cheap and it just fits certain bars. There is one bar in San Francisco and I have to get a PBR everytime I go there. They have it on tap, it is $2. The bar is called Docs Clock. It is a smoking bar (in SF you aren't allowed to smoke but some bars are known for allowing you to smoke in and this is one of them) and it has shuffle puck. It is a great bar and PBR just tastes good there.
