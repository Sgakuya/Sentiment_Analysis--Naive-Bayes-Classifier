As a Subway Franchisee, I'll let you in on a secret to finding a "GOOD" Subway restaurant. You have to find one where the owner [or owners] actually work there. They will personally care if you're satisfied with their service, food quality and cleanliness. Most Subways restaurants that I have visited, [and I visit other stores often], are usually quite nasty, with poor food quality and possibly the worst service I've ever encountered. It's easy to blame the employees, but it's the owners responsibility to see that their business is run properly. When you visit any Subway restaurant and find anything lacking, you would be doing the owners and "yourself" a great favor if you would report it to headquarters in Milford Ct. at www.Subway.com . Again, if you aren't satisfied with the Subway restaurants you've visited, keep looking until you find a good one. Thanks.
