UPDATE: Oh no, there is much more to insult about you. You came on here with your mistaken superiority and insulted every state and the people who live there. I suggest you enroll yourself in the nearest remedial reading group and at least you may sound halfway intelligent. No one heres gives a rats rear end what you think. UPDATE: celtic, I have read all about Einstein and believe me, you are no Einstein! You're not even a Jethro Bodine!!!......O.C.This is my home state and I love it here. UPDATE:...celticprince, there are ignorant people everywhere. You are one of them!!! I may be from Georgia, but I do know the simple difference in using 'then' and 'than'. They have completely different meanings. You used the word 'then' in two places in your comment calling southerners dumb, where most educated people know the correct word to use here is 'than'. We learned that rule in elementary school. What planet are you from?
