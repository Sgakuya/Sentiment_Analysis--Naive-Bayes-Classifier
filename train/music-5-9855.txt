Middle of Nowhere sold over 8 million copies and was awesome! They were such a young age when they recorded the album. They also wrote all the songs for it too. I think they deserve a lot of respect. They are unlike any other boyband out there. I don't even think you can put them in the same category as Nsync And BSB. Hanson writes their OWN music and doesn't steal it from other people. If your excuse for not listening to Hanson is MMMBOP sucks then you need to get a life because most people think that it doesn't mean anything but it does if you have enough brains to listen to the lyrics. People need to get past the they look like girls stage and listen to the music. The music is what really counts in the first place! And by the way they don't look like girls, at least not anymore if you've been watching MTV this past year.Hanson is the best band out there and will always be #1 in my heart!
