I guess the best way to put it would be interesting. It is a very different approach to movie-making and is quite confusing until you reach the end (which is actually the beginning). See what I mean. Nethertheless, it is very intriguing and keeps you glued in, and you can't walk away becuse you have to see what happens. Guy Pearce is tremendous, also his co-star Carrie-Anne Moss. The DVD has a feature that allows you to play the movie forward to back as well as it's original back to forward. This could prove more understandable for the movie. I'm still confused by the end (I admit) and I am still wondering what others will think of the ending (whether it happened this way or that way-what the real story is...) You'll see what I mean. Anyhoo, good for anyone who's sick of seeing the same old, boring style movies and feels like a change. Also, thriller fans will be caught up in the confusing story.
