Ever since my parents divorced, I have been living most of my year in Kentucky. Only thing I really dislike about it is how self-absorbed some of the people are. They seem to think the world revolves around Kentucky. Oh, and they need to drop the freakin' CATS test. That is a really stupid test students have to take at the end of the school year that turns math questions into essays (e.g. Give a step-by-step explanation of how to divide 1/7 by 5/8). But really, Kentucky is a pretty nice place, and the Kentucky Derby is pretty exciting. I enjoy living here, but the overall personality could improve. Four stars is what it gets from me. Take care, everyone!
