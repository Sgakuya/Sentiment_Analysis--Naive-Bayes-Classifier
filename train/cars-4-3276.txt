I've been shopping around for mini-mid SUV's for a few months now. Looked at Rav4, CRV, Chevy ($$), and the Ford Escape. I'm specifcally looking for something w/ 4 doors for family and freinds as well as something that can tow and haul things for camping and recreation in the mountains. The Liberty (Cherokee replacment) seems to have it all at a resonable price (loaded around 26K). The interior is roomy, styly, and the motor is the biggest I've seen in this class (3.7L, 210hp) and can tow more than any other as well. The 2nd day they were out I ran into people at the Jeep Store who had been looking at the same vehicles I have and they were ALL picking up a Liberty. The only common grip is the window controls are on the center console instead of the door (only reson a 4 vice 5 star rating). It has been a dillema btwn the Escape and the Liberty for me, but after numerous cold shoulders, lack for my concern, desire for my money from the Ford people, I think I'm taking my business to the Jeep folks and picking one of these Liberty's up.
