Brown University is a joke. I totally regret coming here. We are a doormat ivy and our academic reputation in the real world is terrible. I think a lot of that has to do with our president. She really needs to go. Providence is a boring and dangerous town-- there are stabbings, muggings, and beatings which happen on campus on a regular basis. There was even a drive by shooting right next to New Dorm a few years back in 1997-98. Lastly, the students at Brown are unhappy, especially once they graduate and realize that a Brown degree does not mean much in academic circles or in business. Student unhappiness is further manifested by our endowment-- nobody gives back to Brown. Lastly, Brown lets in WAY too many unqualified Rhode Island residents; Brown is supposed to be a private school, not a state school, dammit.
