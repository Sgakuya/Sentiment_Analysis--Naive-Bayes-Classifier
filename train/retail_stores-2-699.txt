I bought a few things from Old Navy, the clothes don't really fit all that well. I know with the new style of today, the girls like the bell bottom pants with the tight fit around their butt, which is fine, I wish they didn't have that kind of thinking with the Mens clothes as well. I like something comfortable, something that may even be a little baggy. Leave the tight fitting cutting off your circalation pants for attention grabbers (females). The clothes to me all look the same at Old Navy and I had a pair of pants washed them 3 times and they were falling apart. I will never shop again at Old Navy. My girlfriend talked me into going onetime. Imagine that. She won't talk me into going again.
