A true surprise of a movie -- just when you think you'd had enough of these lazy superhero movies where bad writing, dialogue, production, editing, acting is disguised in "it's a comic book" excuses... Bam! Wham! Pow! Here comes a thoughtful, inspection of the beginnings that will impress Batman fans and movie fans. You get lost in the beginning. The Gotham scenes are more ordinary. But, this IS the best Batman film by a longshot. In fact, if Jack played the Joker here... and was incorporated into the last 30-minutes -- over the weaker stretched plot of tainted 'crazy water'... you would have had the BEST superhero film of all time.
