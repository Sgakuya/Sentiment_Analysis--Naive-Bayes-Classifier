There are many wonderful places to visit in New Mexico, and Santa Fe isn't one of them. Fully half the city's population consists of tax exiles from NYC, pretentious would-be artists, obnoxious showbiz types from LA, and a host of burned-out hippies in their 50s and 60s. The downtown is a depressing tourist trap and the city proper is an endless sprawl (fake adobe houses for the yuppies, run-down mobile homes for the Indians, Mexicans and poor whites). Stay away from Santa Fe and visit charming, not-yet-yuppified Taos instead. And don't miss the pueblos, Los Alamos and the many natural attractions New Mexico has to offer.
