Most people seem to have rated the book on its title, it may help to read the book before you post. The title is relevant as the book refers to stupid men who are white. A book on stupid men of Chinese origin would require a different title. Generally this book is well researched and enjoyable. Isn t it a shame, that the world s oldest democracy has become an arena for two corrupt, competing elite groups? That the winner had to resort to unlawful means to gain power? That the rights of people who have been to prison are ignored? Calls for reform in the democratic process are long overdue in the popular press, and this is probably the best example. Unfortunately Moore does have a tendency to oversimplify complicated issues, his suggestion for peace in Northern Ireland by encouraging Catholics to breed is absurd. This has already happened and it has not brought peace. Now that the Catholics represent the majority the Protestants will never accept autonomous rule, as they would loose their power in an election. Besides, this issue is small on the global stage and reflects his own bias towards the problems of white people over the other races. Although lots of other criticisms can be made of this work, to do so here would be to miss the point. The simple fact is that Americans desire to appear patriotic has stifled debate on their own democracy, this book has killed the taboo and thrown the issue wide open. That achievement is why I m giving this book a five star rating.
