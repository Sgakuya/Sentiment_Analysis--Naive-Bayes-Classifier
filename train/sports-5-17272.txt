I've been watching my ESPN lately, and for some reason everyone thinks the Eagles are going to the Super Bowl, a fair assumption. But lets wait just a damn minute here. I've seen the Eagles play, and I tell ya, they're good, but moving into the 4th game of 16 and we're assuming that they'll stay as healthy as they are by Super Bowl Kick Off? That's childish. It's childish to think that a team is going to the Super Bowl because of how good they play early in the season. Anything could happen guys, lets face it. P.S. I mean it when I say it's a fair assumption. Keep playing like you are, stay healthy, and you definately have a shot at the Super Bowl.
