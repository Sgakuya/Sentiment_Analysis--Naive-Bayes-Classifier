I visited Chichen Itza from Cancun, and it was a great day trip. The disadvantage is that the bus ride is long (not on a chicken bus but rather a modern chartered bus), but one does get to see a lot of the countryside (good and bad). Both the pyramid and the sports arena is well preserved (as I understand Mayan ruins go), but due to time restraints, our guide required a choice between going inside the pyramid or climbing (but not both). If you climb, make sure that you are in decent physical shape as the descent especially is taxing given the slope of the sides (though there is, or at least was a rope part of the way to help). Also as someone said, bring your own water.
