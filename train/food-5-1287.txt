I don't always pick up Starburst at the store, and then when I do, I wonder why I don't get them more often. I just love these fruit chews. I really enjoy the originals but have been known to be quite a risk taker and purchase the tropical assortment from time to time. My favorite? Red..then orange, pink is very tasty...I will eat yellow, but have been known to skip over it. A tasty fruity treat..sure it is sweet but not sickening and too sugary. What is this I hear about them adding Apple flavor? I don't know about that addition to an already perfect assortment of teeth rotting pleasures. Stick with the originals
