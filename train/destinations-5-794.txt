Evidently, according to Americans, we need more history. I can't believe this, I am so amazed, an American actually trying to learn about a country's history that isn't their own. Well, I guess they failed, because saying that we have no history is pretty ignorant. Maybe our country is relatively young, but our lands hold the stories of civilizations older then most. We may not have a large Armed Forces, but if I had to choice between a small armed forces with no enemies, and a large Armed Forces with half the world hating us, I would go with the small force. But, America goes the other way, suit yourself. And, if you look at our history of our military, each time we are called opon, we have made an impact. Both WW1 and even WW2, a larger proportion of our population wore a military uniform then even America. Sorry if we stayed out of Iraq, but we fight wars that are morally valuble to our own people, not economically valuble to our government. We fight wars, we don't go looking for them. If that makes us a country with little value, then I am glad to be worthless. But just remember, the relative quality of individual Canadian soldiers is greater then the relative quality of an America infantryman.
