but most importantly why I think Al Gore should make a good president is he offers substance over style. Gore admittedly has little style. If you want to vote for a president on style go ahead. Personally, I don't think the job should be taken so lightly. There has been a swing in recent decades of style of substances in everything. Electing Gore would show a reversal in this trend. I think that is why Gore now is banking on the issues. Gore is not slick like Bill or George. He is a nerd. We all know it. But thats what kind of person we need to lead our country today. We are deep in the information age. Gore was misquoted as saying he invented the internet. What he did do is help pass legislation to bring it about. The internet as we all know began in the military and then was applied to civilian use.
