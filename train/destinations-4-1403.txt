I can easily find people who write here, that ever benn in France. I'm sorry for my english, may be is more GB english than american, because I'm spending one year in UK, to study your language, and international business management, like many other french, chinese, spanich, german.... I don't know why, why you see french people like that, what you see in your TV, where you stay 2 times more than french people a day, about us, you'd better fiond relevant information about us that YOUR famous CIA provide see ( http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/fr.html). By the way, I see for example, "that I don't know why people are surprised that France would not help us get Saddam out of Iraq. After all, France wouldn't help us get the Germans out of France." I don't know what you learn at school, please, go here ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_French, or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_resistance)...... Well, my country is not perfect, I know it, my government make mistake sometimes.... But you ? you see what happen in YOUR country, before bullshitting on another ? I hope that you'll see french as they are, and not as TV, or anything else show it to you. You can contact me if you want. I'll answer. And if you want more links, no problem, all links I'll give to you are certified.... Thank's for reading this.
