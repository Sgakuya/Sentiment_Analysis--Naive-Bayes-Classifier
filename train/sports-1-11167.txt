I wouldn't care too much if we hadn't started ranked No. 3 then following that with our typical second game of the season loss (no matter if it's ND or ND High School). I'm a '76 Grad and also attended the Alamo Bowl, Rose Bowl, and Alamo Bowl agst A&M (all losses) and I certainly didn't see any intensity as the players strolled on and off the field. Obviously, not mentally prepared or motivated except the last four minutes of the game. At this age emotion is lot of the game and we certainly had none this season. Our QB does not look his recievers away and locks onto them so the defense just follows his eyes. At least last year he had BEdwards and he could just toss up the ball and he'd come down with it, not this year. LCarr needs to retire and let some new blood take over, please.
