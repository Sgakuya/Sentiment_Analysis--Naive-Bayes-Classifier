George Orwell is able to come up with some interesting concepts and attach several political and social messages with them. His main flaw however is at storywriting itself. Pertaining to this book, some of the characters come off very strange and engaging in some peculiar acts (Winston especially). Granted, that is part of the theme of the book. However, it's not in an appealing fashion. It makes the reader think, Thses people are idiots. Where I could once connect with their struggle, they leave me behind with their many quirks that would seem insane even in a society such as this one. The story tends to drag in slow motion all throughout the book maikng the story less appealing and intersting to the reader. Each chapter is presented as random events that happen day by day with nothing ever being accomplished by anyone. Unfortunately, this book reads more of a social science textbook than it does a fiction novel when it's suppose to become a hybrid of both (social science fiction novel....NOT TEXTBOOK!!). One may learm something from this book, but it will not be an exciting process.
