This guy shows more guts than a World War 1 soldier after being hit by a shell. This guy has more heart than a Valentines Day card. If you don't like this guy, you don't like basketball. And if you don't understand what I mean by that, you don't understand basketball. AI is an alomost extinct breed. And the Detroit fans should be ashamed of themselves for cheering his injury. That's sick. That's beyond classless. Especially after he showed so much class after that quarter throwing incident. AI is a champion, ring or not. Also, I say all this as a guy who was pulling for Detroit. I just respect him. And if you don't, you're a prick, believe me.
