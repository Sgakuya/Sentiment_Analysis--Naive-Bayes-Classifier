lets get one thing stright. Making lists and rating actors as the 'BEST', is in a sense kind stupid considering the diversity of actors all over the world, and some whom we have yet to see. Basically then, the times are constantly changing and new actors will be brought into the light and given greater praise than the previous. Having said this though, there can be no doubt that Edward Norton is by far one of the greatest actors to come out of America in long time. I feel the way he has adapted to all his diverse roles shows the quality, integrirty, brains, and of course acting ability this guy has got. Like fellow greats Hoffman and De niro, Norton has this nack of being able to sniff, twitch; the things that may seem irrelivant, at the correct time. His presence when on screen is almost wasp like, showing his cunning and ability of subtlty, instead of jumping around and over emphisising every line. I saw Norton first in 'Fight Club', which despite being one of his more latter films, gave me a buzz to investigate his previous work. My friend reccomended 'American History X', and it just blew me away. The intensity of Norton portrayl of a skin head, and a reformed skinhead(as the film involved many flash backs)left me speachless. When I watched all his other movies, I found it hard to believe it was the same guy who I had seen in 'AHX' compared with his again twisted dimensia of Erin in 'Primal Fear' It has to be said, I would see any film this guy is in, even when the new box office wonders keep cropping up. Edward Norton is an Actor of today and the future, simply because of his intelligence, diversity, and great taste in choosing cutting edge movies.
