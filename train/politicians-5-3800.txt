GW -- You've stood before a population of people who have spat in your face, called you ignorant, a drunkard, and all of the insulting names they can muster... But, throughout it all, you have stood tall, proud of your moral convictions, full of integrity, and consistent to the goal of unity in the UNITED States of America. You have been honest and sincere, more that we as a nation have ever been able to expect from any of our leaders. What you're experiencing is characteristic of the end times ... for all of the liberals who cite racial discrimination at the drop of every hat, of party discrimination at the punch of every straight-forward voting ballot ... You stand facing people filled with immorality, lacking of integrity and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Christians in America are uniting and praying for you, your cause, and the continued cause of Jesus in this time of Satanic influence in our country. God Bless and Keep You ... and God Save Us from the clearly demonic influence in our country!!!
