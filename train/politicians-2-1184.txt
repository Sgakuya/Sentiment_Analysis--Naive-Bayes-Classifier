Like Ariel Sharon, Yasser Arafat's time has passed. He is the head the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which is by and large controls Palestinian affairs although recently there has been competition from Hamas, a religious organization. From the 1960's to the 1980's, Arafat headed up operations against Israel from his base in first Jordan and then Lebanon. After Israel invaded Lebanon in 1983, he was forced to move to Tunisia by the victorious Israelis. After the First Intifada in 1988, Arafat denounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist. So begins the grindingly slow and politically fractuous prospect of peace negotiations. The 1993 Oslo Agreements granted the Palestinians limited self-government with Arafat heading it up. Arafat in 1995 called for self-rule of all Palestinian cities in the West Bank. The problem has been the establishment of borders and Jerusalem are major issues which have stopped the peace process. A combination of events have caused Arafat to lose a lot of influence over the past 3 years. He has failed to put a stop to terrorist attacks against the Israelis. He always denies involvement in the bombings, but Arafat always explicitly approves of the actions. Arafat has fallen down the central divide of Palestinian politics, thus weakening the hand he has in negotiating a truce with the Israelis. Much can be said as well against the Israelis, who continue to deal heavyhandedly with the Palestinians, denying them basic rights. Neither Sharon or Arafat are willing to budge, so nothing is going to happen until these two fossils pass the scene.
