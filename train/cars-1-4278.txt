I have a 1999 V70. I am SOOOOO disappointed in this car. I have never spent this much(about 30k) on a car before but thought that it was a higher end car and the extra money would make pay off in the long run. I have averaged a trip to the dealer every 7 weeks for warrantly work in the past 1.5 years. Examples include door lock broke, heated seat didn't heat, wiring harness for light went bad, lights burning out prematurely, etc. I think that very cheap parts have been used. I called my dealer because I wanted to speak with the Volvo representative and was told that would do no good. Basically tough luck . I will not recommend this car to anyone. BTW my 1994 Toyota Camry has had ZERO visits for warranty work.
