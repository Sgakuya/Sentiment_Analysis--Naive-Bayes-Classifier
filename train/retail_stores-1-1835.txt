Wal-Mart has the lowest prices for one reason and one reason only: sweatshops. They make billions in profit selling nice clothes to American consumers on products made in Honduran sweatshop factories. This is the truth. How else could Wal-Mart sell sweaters and turtlenecks for $10? In 1999, Wal-Mart executives refused to disclose where their products were coming from for competitive reasons. Right. I think it had a little more to do with the twelve and a half cents per hour they were paying their employees. Sure Wal-Mart brings low prices. But I can't support a company that does not include ethics in its business practices.
