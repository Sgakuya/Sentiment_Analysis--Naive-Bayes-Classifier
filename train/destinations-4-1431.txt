If it wasn't for the fact that the French are willing to stand up to Yank inilateralism you wouldn't be criticising them half as much. Not that French politics is corruption free by any means. They can be either charming and sophisticated or completely mad, and French society does have a disturbing racist undercurrent, but at least they've got a damn sight more common sense than the average yank (which isn't particularly hard). Which again, is probably why they objected to the war in Iraq (or should that be eyerak). As a country it's more picturesque and not as overcrowded as the UK, and the public transport system works (unlike the UK). Would have given it 5 just to polarise the argument a bit more, but I really can't condone the racist thing.
