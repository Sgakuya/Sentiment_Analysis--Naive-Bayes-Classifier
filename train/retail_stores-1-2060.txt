Worst experience I have ever had at a large electronics store. First, I bought a cellular phone and they sold me a service contract by totally misleading me in what was and was not covered (batteries - always make sure to get a copy of the service agreement no matter what the salesperson said - I learned the hard way). Then when I had a problem with the phone, it was like pulling teeth getting the help I needed. On the same visit I purchased a TV which was very scratched up. When I took it back the sales clerk gave a real hard time about exchanging it. This all happened in Mentor, Ohio and I advise everyone to steer clear of that store, some of my friends have had problems there also.
