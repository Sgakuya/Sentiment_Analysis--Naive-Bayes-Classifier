jesse jackson is good at what he does. he is a christian preacher and like most christian preachers he is a supporter of capitalism and patriotism. again, as in the cases of jim baker,jimmy swaggard,and gary bauer, he is a hypocrit -- pimps, preachers and politicians have in common a contempt for and exploitation of women. jesus was 'the good shephard' who protected his 'flock'of sheep from the wolves not so that they might live to die an natural death, but so that he could shear and eat them himself. the church 'pastors' make a living by fleecing their flocks and go about humping the pretty young women of their 'flocks'. jesse, along with jerry falwell, is but better at the game than most, excpt the cardinals,popes, who are first rate parasites
