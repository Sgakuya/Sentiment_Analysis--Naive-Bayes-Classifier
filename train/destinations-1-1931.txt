USA and the Americans deserve ZERO. Unpolite, americans think they're the best, the unique, they must save the world. USA don't respect other cultures, USA don't sign the Kyoto Treaty... Shame on you. There are almost 6 billion people around you americans, stop looking for your own stomach. It's horrible that instead of using a language created to the world, Esperanto, we have to speak in english to communicate with people around the world. ADDED AFTER SOME COMPLAINTS: Okay, English is a easy language, practical, I just think it's too easy for Americans, Britishes, Australians, South Africans, etc, not having to learn any language. And I never meant to say anything bad about the country USA. USA is beautiful, charming, rich, etc, but the population is extremely arrogant and has a awful patriotism, ridiculous in fact (land of brave, freedom!!! - Yuck)
