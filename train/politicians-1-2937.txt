I watched this guy on Hardball with Chris Mathews last night and I nearly puked on the TV screen! First, Chris played a sound segment of a statement Condolezza Rice made in October 2000 in which she said, We don't want to wake up one morning and learn that Osama bin Laden has been sucessful in our own country. After which Chris pointed out to Dick that he recently made a statement Condi Rice said or acted like she'd never heard of Al Qaeda prior to 9/11. When Chris pressed Dick on why he contradicted himself he said Well, I'm sure she knew who bin Laden was but all I said is that she didn't know about Al Qaeda. Okay, who out there is stupid enough to believe that Osama bin Laden is or ever was a 1 man operation? They were and are 1 and the same. Were Hitler and Lennin 1 man operations? Even if she wasn't familiar with the term Al Qaeda it only makes sense to think that bin Laden has an army or a following or whatever. But I don't buy Dick's story that she was unfamiliar with Al Qaeda. Remember, Condi Rice made her statement about bin Laden in October of 2000. If Dick Clark is so bent on the Bush administration not taking the Al Qaeda threat seriously then why didn't he jump down their throats immediately after 9/11 instead of wating 3 years to do it during an election year? Because he wants Kerry in the White house. Also, his new book Against All Enemies is B.S.
