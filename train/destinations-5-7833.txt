For me a trip to Chicago isnt complete without visiting The Second City Comedy Club. This is improv at its finest... and funniest. I am not a fan of stand up comedy, but I love watching shows like Mad TV, SNL, SCTV, and Whose Line is it, Anyway? If you enjoy any of these shows you will love the real thing up close and personal. The troupes involve their audience members, but not to embarass them like most stand up comedians do. They ask you to shout out words that they then fold into thier routine. It is amazing what they come up with in such a short time. There is more than 1 location of the Second City Comedy Club, but I have only been to the one in Chicago. From what I understand many famous comedians have gotten their starts there. I read a book at B N which gives bios on them, and I remember many SCTV characters were there. I definately recommend that you go there. You can order drinks and appetizers while you are there and it is best if you go in a small group. Downstairs there is a gift shop, so you can buy some souvenirs if you end up loving it.
