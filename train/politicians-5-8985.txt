Bill Clinton did nothing but give us 8 years of peace and prosperity, without any help from the opposition party. The house mismanagers and teh hanging judge, Ken Starr, wasted years of Americas time and all for nothing. Bush has been a disastor since taking office, he has undone all the good that he inherited. After the 2000 election, a poll was taken that asked, if Bill Clinton had been allowed to run for a third term, who would you have voted for Clinton or Geore W. Bush? The results were that 64% sadi Clinton. Sort of says it all I think. bush has proven beyoond any doubt that he is a weak leader. Bush for expresident in 04.
