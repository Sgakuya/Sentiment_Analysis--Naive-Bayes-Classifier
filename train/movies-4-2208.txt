Pleasant in a dark sort of way. It takes a while for the movie to get started- for those who didn't know the story like me, a good chunk of the film will keep you wondering why it has the title that it does. Guy Pearce was wonderfully cocky as Fernand, and James Caviezel did well with his role as Edmond Dantes, a character that changes drastically throughout the film. I read a review that said that there was homosexual sub-text between the two characters but I don't know what they were writing about. Anyway, this is an entertaining flick that really pulls you in- you feel the desire for vengeance along with Edmond. Nice action, nice acting. I'm inspired to read the book and see some of the myriad older versions of the movie. Oh- and look out for Richard Harris (I think that was him as Priest )-he was fun to watch and lightened the mood up a bit.
