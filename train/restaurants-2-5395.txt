Welcome to the Golden corral rating!! me an my family wanted to try this place out when we went to gallipolis,OH and it looked fairly good. As we walked in the place seemed really nice and the layout of the place was great! But the atmosphere was pretty hectic and everyone seemed to be in a rush (what for I do not know ;) ) but anyway we just sat down to eat and I got to the buffet and it has a pretty good selection when we did sit back down to eat the food was not as good as we intended ( Probably cause I was in a picky mood) oh well... I did enjoy the conversations that we had there. but the food was ok I guess.... I really liked the chicken and the mushrooms though!! they were excellent! This place was ok for me but some members of my family did not agree since everyone in my family has different tastes!! . this place gets a 2.0/5. they do have a decent website.
