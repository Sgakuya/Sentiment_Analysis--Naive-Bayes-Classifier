welcome to the LAND OF HEARTACHE!!! and do not by any means let the cleanliness and neatness of the illinois countryside convince you. i live here, politics are terrible here, worse than georgia, a lot worse than florida. society is cold and cruel in this burned out land, (in fact, in 2004, illinois was the 7th richest state and yet ranked 47th out of 50 for services for people with disabilities), from 1995 to 2002, illinois had a governor (george h ryan) who was 30 times worse than george w bush. all he ever did was cut funding to all agencies for people with disabilities, even closing many agencies down and putting people that ran those agencies out of work, corrupted schools, and kept all the money to himself and his friends. the only thing illinois residents know how to do is give the mean eye look to each other and treat each other like trash and hurt your feelings, wreck/destroy your ego, and could care less if you fell into a volcano! basically, 98 percent of illinoisans care about absolutely nobody but themselves and themselves only!!! they always "have to jet immediately" all the time. life is so fast paced here that it even causes time to feel shorter. and this is BY NO MEANS confined to chicago; this is all over the ENTIRE STATE!!! includes rockford, dekalb, sycamore, utica, peoria, springfield, any town you can name in illinois. and chances are, no, that violent tornado that hit utica that one summer did not make uticans any nicer, in fact i would not be surprised if it even made some uticans worse. and neither did the tornado that hit plainfield in 1990 make plainfield residents any nicer. illinois does not feel like the "land of lincoln" anymore. it feels more like the "land of darth vader" or even "land of satan". although my title "land of satan" actually would go to new york city, where people get arrested and thrown in jail for trying to be nice and strike up a conversation with someone.
