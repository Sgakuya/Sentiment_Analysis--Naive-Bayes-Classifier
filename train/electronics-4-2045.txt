The n-gage is a great little piece of equipment however it does have some problems.The main one is changing the game which aint as bad as you think.Thats where the QD comes in it has fixed all the quirks of the first one.However the games are fun to play it takes some time to learn but once you do it is smooth.Plus its a cell phone so you can call people and after that you can play some games.Its not for kids but thats why they have the gameboy sp.For myself the n-gage is so much better cause it has some kool fps.So if you dont have one try it before you put it down or at least try the QD cause it is more for gamers.
