My favorite comic, period! (Kevin Kell, also by Bill Holbrook, is my favorite online comic.) Like the strip, For Better or For Worse , the characters age in real time. I've followed SAFE HAVENS since it's inception back around 1990 and always save it as the last comic I read. Like saving the frosting for last. Bill's whimsical style is unique, with only Berke Breathed's Bloom County even coming close. We watch the the life and times of Samantha, the main character, as she's passed from toddler to high school student, and the journey is delightful. A terrific blend of silly, outrageous and thoughtful, SAFE HAVENS is one of the few comics I've read that can address everyday issues and NEVER forget it's a comic stip with the primary goal of delivering a daily chuckle. - Tweener
