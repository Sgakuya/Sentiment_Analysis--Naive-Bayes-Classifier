He is really not that bad of a guy. Sure he has made some mistakes and that, but he really is a good leader. Although he may make stupid desicions, don't you feel safe with him in office? Basically, those who disagree with him obviously don't really listen to what goes on. I agree it is about time we got our troops home, but I disagree with the fact that this war is for oil. I believe it is for the best of our country. You can't just leave people like Saddam Hussein alone. People have this mentology that if we leave them alone, they'll leave us alone. This is not true. We needed to stop Saddam before he turned into a Hitler. I support Bush's decision to go to war and I, as I have said, do believe it is time to pull out. But, we can't just leave. War is a precious matter and needs to be dealt with carefully. In the end, all you Bush-bashers will realize that he ain't that bad. This happens to every president. You cannot please everyone. Do you really think that Bush is pissing everyone off on purpose? He is doing the best he can, and that is all he can do. I am glad he got elected again.
