It is definitely true that Netflix service becomes worse the more you use it. We keep a long running queue of movies, including those that have not yet been released, new releases and older classics. Lately, all the new releases have VERY LONG WAIT, LONG WAIT, AND SHORT WAIT notations, though the DVDs have been out for more than a month, and they went into our queue well before release. We phoned Netflix to complain, and were told they had an inadequate supply. To see if this was true, we asked our neighbor to take a 2-week trial and request the same DVDs (Lost in Translation, Mona Lisa Smile, Cold Creek Manor), and...you guessed it. All three were available NOW and shipped the next day. Meanwhile, LONG WAIT still appears on our request list, and we continue to receive movies from the 1990's and 1980's, which seem to be the only ones available to seasoned subscribers. Netflix clearly hooks you with good service, then leaves you flat. I do not appreciate dishonesty like this, and will seek an alternate service or return to Blockbuster.
