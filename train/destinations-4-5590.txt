Charlottesville was recently decreed to be the best city in America and Roanoke and Lynchburg didn't do too badly on the survey either, and while I don't fully believe those sorts of things there is a grain of truth there. Central and Southwest Virginia are wonderful places to live (though there are some economic troubles here in Southwest). The scenery is some fo the most beautiful in the country, the cost of living is low, there're all sorts of historical cites, and we've one of the best public university systems in the U.S. Despite our reputation for conservatism the political climate is probably better described as moderate, especially by Southern standards. The only wart is Northern Virginia, and it's a big one. NoVa is a hole in my opinion, though if you like strip malls and traffic it's highly recommended. Also, home to the worst specimens of suburbanites I've come across. Entitled kids, parents who are absolutely terrified at the thought of living in the city, and the worst drivers I've ever encountered (and this from two years of living in Chicago).
