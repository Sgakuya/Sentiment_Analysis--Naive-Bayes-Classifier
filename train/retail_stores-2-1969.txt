The service is terrible you have a hard time getting any one to help you on the floor and when you get to the check out it is even worse. Their staff training must be terrible because most of the cashiers have no clue. They have a good selection but never buy a computer from them, it took me from Friday night until Sunday afternoon to just order a computer. Returns take for ever because they never have enough staff or they disappear. I have complained about the service and nothing happens, I think it is safe to say that management is to blame. Update: I recently purchase a car alarm from Best Buy and installation was free. When I got to the check out you would have thought that they had never sold one of these rare items. The register told the cashier exactly what to do but he had to call over a supervisor to help him out. The supervisor had to look at it for a few minutes before he agreed that the best course of action was to follow the directions on the screen. I need to apply for a job at Best Buy I could be running the place in a month.
