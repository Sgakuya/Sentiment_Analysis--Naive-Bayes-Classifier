Can't believe how many people actually believe that he is a credible person, He is a hypocrite. I can't fathom how you say that Jesus is your mentor, yet can't even quote his teachings correctly. He bribed the country with a tax cut plan, that he can't pay for, and you still think that he is gonna restore the prominence of the white house? He was a drunkard, cheated on his wife, abused drugs, has played the race card when he needed to and yet he is allowed to get away with it. He still hasn't shown one ounce of leadership and yet America (mostly the Angry White Male) thinks he is a great leader. I just hope that he surrounds himself with srong advisors that will try to unite this country before he can screw it up further.
