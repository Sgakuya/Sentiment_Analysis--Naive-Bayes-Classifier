Last years Phil:great This years Phil:good The reason for this is Mr.Jacksons inability to understand the nature of the rift between Shaq and Kobe. While i am no pshycolagist,i do have a gift for seeing into the hearts of people and knowing that sometimes the heart speaks different from the mouth. The problem comes down to Shaqs freethrow shooting.Try to see it from Kobe's shoes,how fair is it? that while i am good enough to have the ball go through me on every possesion with five minutes remaining and we're down by ten,but when things are not going so bad i'm the second guy. Besides there's no more Glen Rice,so there's even more reason for me to get more shots.almost seems right huh?But have no fear Laker lovers,this can be solved if the right advise is used. Operation Sleeping giant part one:Shaq's freethrow shooting can be solved very easily for one such as myself.Its a simple matter of switching,instead of leading with the right foot lead with the left,instead of shooting with the right,shoot with the left.You see Shaq's problem is the same that i have with my right hand,it doesnt drop like the left does.Now other than that he should do exactly like hes been doing,as far as shooting it with one hand and all. next up, operation sleeping giant part two.
