At the end of the day, anyone considering Capella (or any other school, for that matter) will have to make his or her own choice. I chose Capella and have no regrets whatsoever. I am now in my sixth quarter in the O consider as many well-respected, objective sources of opinions as you can gets your hands on, and THEN form your own opinion. Examples include regional accrediting bodies such as North Central ( http://www.ncahigherlearningcommission.org/), the Sloan Consortium ( http://www.sloan-c.org/), or Noel-Levitz ( http://www.noellevitz.com/). I don't know why this site seems to attract people who have sour grapes with respect to Capella, and I don't know what motivates them to pretend they are a better judge of academic excellence than those who make their living assessing the academic quality of insitutes of higher learning. My advice is that you consider that they are entitled to their opinion, but that you do your homework in order to make an informed choice.
