Released in 1985 and directed by Michael Ritchie, Fletch is one of those relentlessly quoted films and probably Chevy Chase's best effort. Chase plays investigative newspaper reporter Irwin M. Fletcher who is tracking down the drug source on Venice Beach when not avoiding his ex-wife's attorney, fighting with his editor (Richard Libertini), dreaming about playing for the Lakers, or chasing the ladies (Geena Davis and Dana Wheeler-Nicholson). Fletch gets drawn into a related plot which allows him to fully utilize his disguises and quick improvision. What makes the movie work is the dialogue is perfect for Chase's style of delivery and still remains funny today.
