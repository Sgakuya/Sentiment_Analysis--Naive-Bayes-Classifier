Gap makes good quality clothing, but the retail prices are generally a bit pricey. Always check the sale rack and you might find something, especially when they put their seasonal stuff on clearance... Unfortunately their best jeans (for men anyway) rarely go on sale so you're stuck paying $50 if you really like them. They carry a huge selection of different fits for men and women, and the racks are logically organized and well labeled so you know exactly how the jeans will fit. Generally the trendier fits, like the low-rise boot fit, have better washes and colors, and look better on men who are skinny, but like I said Gap carries a good selection for just about all body types, and you can get extended sizes online.
