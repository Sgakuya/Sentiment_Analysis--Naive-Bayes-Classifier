When the question comes up concerning who was the greatest NFL quarterback ever, the two most prominent names mentioned are Johnny Unitas and Joe Montana (and deservedly so). But to say one is better than the other often sparks heated debate. But if Johnny Unitas was arguably known for his toughness and athleticism, Joe Montana was quite possibly the most intelligent quarterback to cross the gridiron- and definitely the greatest quarterback both in the big games and their greatest moments. Moreover, Montana was simply the greatest at the clutch, as few others could match his ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Yes, the legendary Johnny U is one of the great icons in professional football lore. However, Joe Montana is professional football's greatest winner.
