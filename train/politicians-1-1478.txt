The biggest problem with this man is that he still today causes divition in our country. Only mentioning his name brings up fear, sadness and hate to many, shameless pride and respect to others. Personally, I hate to know I live in a country were a lot of people think that the economic prosperity he brought justifies all the murders, tortures and violation to human rights he carried along for 17 years. Savior of Chile? Doubtfull. As bad as Allende was, his government was legitimate, and it would have ended the day he fulfilled his period, not forcing anyone to years of a dictatorial regime. Pinochet took over the power and stayed there for years with no respect for what the people wanted. The truth is that as a country we will never get to an agreement in this matter, so I just hope he keeps away from our lives.
