The University of Colorado belongs in the upper tier of this ranking of colleges and universities. To back up this statement, I quote the following announcement from the Office of News Services at CU Boulder: "CU-BOULDER RANKED 11th BEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD, ACCORDING TO SURVEY: A new survey of the world's top universities cited in the Sept. 8 issue of The Economist ranks the University of Colorado at Boulder as the 11th best public university. A total of 500 international institutions were ranked in the 2005 survey, undertaken by the Institute for Higher Education at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China. The survey ranked Harvard University first, followed by Stanford University, the University of Cambridge, the University of California-Berkely and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology among all universities, both public and private. The criteria used in the rankings included Nobel Prizes or Fields Medals (the highest scientific award for mathematicians) received by faculty and alumni and the number of highly cited researchers in several broad categories. Other criteria included the number of articles published in Nature and Science -- widely considered the world's top two research journals -- as well as the total number of research paper citations and the academic performance of faculty with respect to institution size.

So, especially if you are inclined toward the sciences, you can't do much better than the University of Colorado at Boulder. Do your homework on this school and you'll find out just how many presigious honors have been won by its faculty and students, how many CU graduates have gone on to become NASA astronauts and scientists of international repute, and how CU's commitment to excellence in teaching and research makes it one of the world's best public universities.
