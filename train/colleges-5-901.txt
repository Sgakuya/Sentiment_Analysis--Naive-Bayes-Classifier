You know, I still say it is about what you put into it. You can go to any school and complain about something, but for the time I have and what I am learning it is a great school. I am a Business major, with a emphasis in Information Systems. As far as going to a community college which most of them are full of students who don't know what they want to do, that is why they are their. I am working 40 hours a week and I am finishing my degree and it is not easy. Devry has the same teachers and professors that teach at Pepperdine and other well known schools. So if you are a lazy person with no ambition don't bother going to school anywhere just get a job at mcdonalds and call it a career. The ones that are complaining about financial aid and other stuff are stupid. I have been to two other regular colleges and you get the same runaround. So it does not matter what school you go to, it matters who you are! Sincerely, A satisfied student. P.S. Since attending Devry I have gotten the highest paying job and position that I have ever had.
