I suppose just about everyone rating on this topic considers themselves something of a baseball expert. Well I'm here to tell you that many of you have diminished your own credibility by wildly speculating on that you really don't know (rapest [sic]), or injecting personality in a consideration of the on-field impact of a player. Barry Bonds is unquestionably the greatest player of his generation and certainly ranks in the top five all-time. Don't believe me. Ask a contemporary ballplayer. Even those that consider Bonds a jerk, fully and readily appreciate his skills, freely admitting he's the best. A 650 on-base average! 200 walks, including more intentional passes than any other TEAM!... Get real, people.
