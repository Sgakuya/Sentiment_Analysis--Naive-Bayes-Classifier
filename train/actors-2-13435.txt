She is not a talented actress at all. Though she plays different roles, she ruins the movie because she does not change her character all that much. She still talks in the same, self-conscious way that she used in What's Eating Gilbert Grape.You find yourself remembering her past roles when her character should be drawing you into the plot of the story. A few more acting classes and perhaps, someday she will make it to my okay list. As a side-not, just so everybody knows, she has a wacky-looking chin and the scariest smile because her cheeks contort to look like the mask used for the Scream killer in Scary Movie. But as a consolation to those I've offended, Jennifer Lopez's performance in Enough was enough to off set Juliette's poor skill so I do like a film she appears in! Never thought that would happen.
