Wal Mart is a mixed bag. I think it definitely serves a purpose, especially for those people who live paycheck to paycheck. But I think to a certain extent it helps keep them living paycheck to paycheck since the quality of a lot of the merchandise is pretty questionable. To this end, the clothing department is by far my biggest complaint. Almost every clothing item I've purchased there has faded quickly, distorted or shrunk, even with proper care, or come unraveled in a short time. Shoes have worn quickly, fallen apart quickly, and figuring frequency of replacement in, most clothing items probably cost as much as or more than name brand items. Depends on the item. For some basic stuff, they're okay. Good prices on detergent, hygeine products, etc. The stores are noisy and chaotic. Buy consumables there, but durable goods elsewhere, because you pretty much get what you pay for.
