Arby's food is downright gross. I have been there exactly three times in my entire life. The first time I puked after eating their sandwiches, the second time I only had french fries, and the third time I ordered some sandwiches and they tasted revolting. I am never going back. And these are different locations spread over a fifteen year time frame, so it's not as if there's just one location I have gone to. The disgustingness seems to be systemwide over at Arby's. And as for their 'Market Fresh' sandwiches, what's stopping me from buying my own coldcuts and lettuce at the Safeway? I'll be there sometime anyway to buy the rest of the foods that I like to eat, and it takes about as much time to prepare a simple sandwich myself as it does to wait for those yokels to throw it together. I wouldn't care if the company went bankrupt and threw everyone out of work. There'll be other positions in the fast food industry, and it's not as if you can't transfer company loyalty over to, say, Taco Bell, where the customers will actually be semi-satisfied with their meal.
