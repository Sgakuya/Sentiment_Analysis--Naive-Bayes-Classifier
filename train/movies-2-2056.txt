Do not go see this movie! Do not rent this movie, don't even bother watching it when it is the Sunday Night Movie of the Week on some network station and the only other options you have are 'Martha Stewart's Special on Making Jams and Preserves' (that would probably be scarier than 'What Lies Beneath') and 'Caddyshack 2'. This movie was so bad. So hard to follow. Plot lines that begin and go nowhere. The 'chemistry' between Harrison Frod's character and Michelle Pfeiffer's cgaracter is non-existent yet forced down your throat way too much. Ridiculous ebding. The bathtub scenes are too reminiscent of 'Fatal Attraction'. Too bad these 2 good actors wasted a lot of their time making this plotless and not-scary movie.
