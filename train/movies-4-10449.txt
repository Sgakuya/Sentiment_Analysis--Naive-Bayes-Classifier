First, I must say that I nearly wet my pants laughing at the part where his daughter comes home. That and the section in the bathroom. It was truly hillarious!!!!! Best laugh I had had in a while. I, myself would have liked to have seen Mel a little more. Why is it that we women always get to see our own sex in the buff and not the ones we want to see that way? Not that I wanted to see it all, but then if you were to really ask what women want I feel some of us would want equal rights in films. In that aspect - was it truly what women wanted? WEll, maybe men helped write it. They like chicks. But, all aside the film did have a great message. In the end the gift he was given did prove to meet an important goal. Not to read peoples minds, but to save a fellow soul. I would recommend this film to adults, but not to families with young children. It is a good comedy with a wholesome message, but there are some adult scenes. Also. the ending left me wondering - will there be a sequel? Perhaps What Men Want? That should be interesting - hmmmmm. Wonder what topic it will focus on? :)
