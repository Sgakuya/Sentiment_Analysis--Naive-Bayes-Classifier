Years ago I heard Kathleen Turner being interviewed on television and she talked with quite a bit of obvious pride about her deep voice - which had already become a trademark of sorts for her. She said something to the effect that most actors don't utilize and develop their voices to their own advantage. I thought that was probably true but that she still sounded like she was trying really hard to do an impression of Tallulah Bankhead. Okay, when you're doing a character that's one thing. But when you're being interviewed, you may sound a bit more sincere if you could manage to come out of character for a while. I do feel that her acting ability is above average and she generally puts in a good performance. This is particularly true of her in edgy black comedy films like The War of the Roses and Serial Mom . Maybe it's just that those characters were so over the top they worked really well with the Tallulah voice , I don't know. Like most actresses, the roles thinned out and she started disappearing around the age of 40. It surprised me to see her show up on Friends last night but I was more surprised that she had changed so much it took me about five minutes, voice and all, to realize who in the world she was. Egad! I know she's no ing nue but this was once a person whose great beauty I truly envied and I know she could still do better than this. Somebody help her find the number of her plastic surgeon or, at least, the directions to the spa!
