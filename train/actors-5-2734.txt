I haven t always liked every movie I ve seen him in but regardless of that he was undeniably excellent in each and every one. The first time I became aware of Kevin Spacey as an actor was through his portrayal of the ill-fated Jim Williams in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil . His soft southern drawl and genteel mannerisms were absolutely convincing because he knew just how much to put in and how much to leave out. So much so that the next time I saw him (being interviewed on Letterman) I was almost surprised not to hear that touch of the Deep South in his speech. His role in American Beauty (one of my least favorite films of all time) was so diametrically opposed to the Midnight role that he even looked physically different. He accomplished another complete morph in Pay it Forward as the scarred teacher. I m convinced that Spacey is simply one of those rare talented actors who like Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman, has the ability to completely become his part. As actors go we tend to see a lot of personalities, ex-sports figures and models, and very mediocre one-dimensional players come and go. But rarely are we treated to performances with this man s subtle depth and range.
