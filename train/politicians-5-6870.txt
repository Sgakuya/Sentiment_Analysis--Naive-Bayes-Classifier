Trent Lott is indeed agreat American. A true patriot that puts the nation and it's time honored traditions above all. Sure it would be easier to show the white feather of cowardice in the face the we diddled ourselves and it's your fault crowd. Not Trent, he is thunder-bolt while other politicians look like a midget breaking wind with a bic lighter! It's high time to restore the rule of absolute constitutional law and let the meet you by the mood swings goofy government die on the vine! Remove the mill stone of shiftless slack jawed losers from the American peoples' back and let pure freedom ring! Our creed is liberty not dreaming of a loser utopia. Restore the original Bill of Rights and let nature take it's obvious a just coarse! Chase the pointy head intellectuals out of our institutions for higher learning. They have failed the next generation and basterdized their mission. Restore the promise of work and reward! Expect citizenship from every man and woman, not just the ones who make a dollar more than you do. Chase the liberals from our courts, who remove the american ideas of swift and just punishment! Every generation of Americans own the right to shape our current government. We the people will not be shackled to the failed ideas of government worshippers. God bless Trent Lott and God bless Dixie! Randy R. Riddle
