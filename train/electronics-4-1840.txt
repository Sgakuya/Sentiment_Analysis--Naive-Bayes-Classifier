The PS2 is a fairly good system, featuring an insane amount of games (it can play PS One games as well), decent graphics (depending on the game, typically), fair loading times, simply-designed controllers, and a slim console design. They also feature the ability to play DVDs (it's not perfect--the few that I've used tend to have the voices out of sync with the movements in the movies when played on the PS2, but hey, it'll get the job done). Its downfalls include having only 2 controller ports (good for most games, but there are a lot of great 4 player games out there), a slower loading time than most of its competitors, and a decrease in the number of games designed for the PS2 console (I haven't seen a lot of new PS2 games lately). Not my absolute favorite, but definately worth considering when choosing a console system.
