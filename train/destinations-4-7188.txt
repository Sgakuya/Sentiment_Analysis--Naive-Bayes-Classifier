Brussels is not as dynamic as other capitals such as London or Rome, but it does have quite a bit to offer. Comments are based on several visits in the 1970's to late 1990's.The Grand Place is magnificent, especially when there is a flower show or a beer festival. I'm not a beer drinker, but could learn to become one if I stayed long enough in Brussels or Belgium. About the only other tourist attraction I can think of is the Mannekin Pis (close to the Grand Place). Food is very good; the Belgian waffles with chocolate sauce are sinfully good as dessert or a snack. Hotels I've stayed at have all been good. People are friendly enough, and service is good. Brussels, as for Belgium as a whole, can have some really dreary weather, however.
