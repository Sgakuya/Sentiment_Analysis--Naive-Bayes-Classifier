I am just old enough to remember America in the 70s - the Soviet Union and its allies gaining country after county, the US and the inflation rate exceeding 15% per year, high tax rates, and talk of our Golden Years being behind us. Then Reagan came and changed the nations' attitude, prioritized what we needed to do (end the Cold War), reinvigorated the private sector, reminded us we were founded on personal responsibility versus government support, and reinvigorated a great America to retake its place as a driver of freedom and peace. Today my children don't know what it is like to worry about expanding Soviet tyranny, or hyper-inflation, or what it was like to be pushed around by small/rogue nations like Iran, or even what is was like to believe the government was the solution to all problems. I thank Reagan for that blessing. People can debate the Reagan Presidency all they want - but people on both sides of the debate should understand just how fortunate we were to select Reagan as our leader versus Carter. Truly - what do you think - if we had chosen Carter, where would we be today?
