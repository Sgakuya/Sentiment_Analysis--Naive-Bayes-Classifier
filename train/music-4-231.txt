A very efficient first album showing the built-up potential that was eventually going to find its way out of the band. Took a while to grow on me, though - it's an outstanding collection of songs that seems to have no real fit as an album (Except for Alive and Once which are prequel and sequel in a three-song trio). However, I loved Black and Jeremy from the moment I first heard them, and Evenflow gets stuck in my head so much that there was a time for a while when I tried to hate the song (it didn't work, though). I think they've done better albums, but keeping in mind that this is a first album...it's great.
