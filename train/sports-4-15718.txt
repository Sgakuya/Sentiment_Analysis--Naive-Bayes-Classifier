What Trotter can do is blow up a running game. Single-handedly. He hits like a lineman, has good instincts, and brings a recklessness that only Dawkins can match on the Eagles defense. That's why his getting kicked out hurt so much against the Falcons. Because the Falcons could run the ball, they were able to give Vick time to throw, time to scramble, time to make decisions. Trotter would have stuffed the run, allowed the Eagles to gear up on Vick, and it would have been a whole different game. Still not sure why Trotter got kicked out... a scrub from the other team runs up to him in warm up, punches him, Trotter grabs him, and they both get kicked out? Sounds like pretty good pre-game strategy to me by the Falcons.
