I live in San Diego and got the Sti vi5225 free after rebate. It came with a case and car charger plus a $10 phonecard of which $4.95 is deducted for activation. Works great and you can buy instant recharge cards from cheapphonecards.com you also earn points toward free cards. I bought one $25 card (for about $21) and still have over $14 of talk time left after two+ months! Great phone plan for those who just need a phone for quick conversations. 12 cents per minute day 10 cents night. No other chargers apply (roaming, monthly etc.). The only annoyance was getting odd text messages but I called Sti and turned off text messaging, so now all is perfect. Bought one for my mom and a co-worker got one. Beats paying over $45 per month for regular cell service. Sti Rocks!
