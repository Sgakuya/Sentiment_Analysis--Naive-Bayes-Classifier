I have been buying AE clothes for several years, and I definitley prefer AE over Abercrombie. I occassionally do buy a graphic tee or underwear at A F, but that's it. I find that the quality of their clothing is not a great as AE's clothes. The graphic tees tend to fade real fast, and the few pairs of pants that I bought there lasted only a few months with great care before they started to fade and tear. While some people like that vintage look, it's not really my style. The AE clothes are more more durable and look great. Also, the past couple of times that I was in A F, I got absolutely no service. All of the employees were busy talking to each other, and didn't really even pay much attention to the customers that were in there. At AE, I ALWAYS get the nicest greeting ever, and I am always asked if I need help finding anything. I think that is great. The prices at AE are much more reasonable as well. You can buy two graphic tees for the cost of one at A F! Plus AE always has coupons for 15% off. While I like A F for some things, I really prefer AE.
