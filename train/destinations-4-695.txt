Sure, its stinky. Sure, the crime it has makes you want to pray for your own safety. Sure, its f###ing polluted. But Mexico City is the most diverse, biggest and strange city to visit or live in. I lived there for 20 years (I was also born there by the way) and there is never a dull moment. Its a pity that most tourists just focus on the famous spots, once you dig in there are quite a few things to see. The nightlife is amazing and cheap, with clubs that beat even the european ones in design and music. Its full with awesome places to eat (could be, after New York, the place where you can eat better in the world). And the nice zones where all the rich people live are spectacular. So take my advice, before accepting to take the oh so boring tourist route go, rent a car, befriend a mexican (we are, as you should know by now, very friendly) and ask them to take you to the cool places. Youll be surprised. Hey, and watch that wallet of yours.
