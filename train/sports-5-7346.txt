Magic was my idol when I was a teenager. He truly was magic. His behind-the-back passes, no-look passes and his behind the midcourt shots at buzzers were so awesome. His enthusiasm for the game was unrivaled and he put his teammates first -an art that is all but lost in today's era of selfish one-on-one basketball playing and stupid decision-making. The very best ever? No, Michael Jordan is, but Magic is in the top 5, without doubt. He was a true winner that played his best in the clutch in championship series. He never was exceptionally quick or athletic but at 6'9 he could not only play the point guard position but about any position. And how can one forget the Lakers 5 championship rings, which Magic was primarily responsible for? Truly magical in every way and a class act.
