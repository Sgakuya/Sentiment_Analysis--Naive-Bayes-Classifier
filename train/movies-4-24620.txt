I think this film was quite good for a variety of reasons: 1. This was a very creative re-imagining of the original story. I give director Tim Burton credit for going beyond the traditional manner in which re-makes are made, and putting a new spin on the tale. 2. The cast was excellent, especially Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Roth glowered like the best of villians, and Carter added plenty of nuance to her character. 3. The make-up was Oscar-winning, allowing for subtle facial expressions which increased the dramatic impact of the actors. 4. There was plenty of action, allot of very humorous moments, and it was thought provoking. Contrary to some opinion, there was a plot, a beginning, middle and end, and the points connected fine for the most part. You could quibble with a few *details* within the plot but, I take those with a grain of salt. I wanted to be entertained by this movie. If I want serious, I'll watch a documentary. I've already preordered the DVD, it might even be more enjoyable because it will have so many details about how this film was made. I'm particularly interested in all the behind-the-scenes details. So yes, I'd recommend this movie, its imaginative, good all-around fun. Look for Charlton Heston, you'll get a good laugh.
