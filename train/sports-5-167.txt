Guerrero is truly a special player. In relative anonymity with the Expos, he is arguably the best all around player in the game. Not only is he a great hitter (and not just a power hitter, he hits for a high average and doesn't strike out often), but he is a superb fielder with a tremendous arm. He barely speaks any English and while that is not a problem in French-speaking Montreal, it has kept him from achieving greater fame. But, that doesn't seem to both Guerrero who only wants to play baseball. I know people mention Junior and ARod and Pudge, but if I was starting a team, I think I would begin with this guy.
