As much as I looked forward to the new CDs recently released by REM, U2, and Radiohead, I find myself listening to Essence by Lucinda Williams much more than any of them - maybe more than all three together. I picked up Car Wheels on a Gravel Road on the recommendation of a friend, and - to my surprise - really enjoyed it. I don't generally like music that leans towards country, but there's something addictive about Williams' songs and voice. She has a sparse, straightforward style that conveys emotion with deceptively powerful simplicity. And Essence is every bit as good as Car Wheels - highly recommended, even if you don't like country.
