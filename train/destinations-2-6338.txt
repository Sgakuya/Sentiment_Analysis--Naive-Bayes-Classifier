Positive Attributes: A great vacation spot to take the kids with Cedar Point and Kings Island. Negative Attributes: Rude state troops who will pull you over for anything- espescially if you are from out of state. My mother had a tractor truck accident on I-70 in which she hit a patch of black ice and landed herself in the ditch without harming any cars (and there were several in front of her)- and the State Trooper gave her a ticket for failing to control her vehicle (even though she beat that ticket in court). I rarely run into friendly people in Ohio. And to top it off they have some sort of historic grudge against Kentuckians. The roads are getting bad too.
