Anyone who thinks this album is about man-hating obviously have not heard the whole thing. Alanis has created a beautiful, introspective, and enjoyable album. Songs like Head Over Feet and Mary Jane are evidence of Alanis's gentler side while songs like You Oughta Know and Right Through You are certainly demonstrative of a wiser, jaded Alanis. But has anyone who continues to label Morissette as a Man-Hater have the intelligence to realize that her songs may be biographical and, if so, then she has every reason to be angry? Anyway, this is one of the most impressive debuts I have ever heard and I can only hope that Alanis can once again be on top without ever losing her edge or her insight.
