I was born here, so yeah, I am probably biased. But I have traveled all over the world and lived in other countries. I can tell you honestly: I didn't realize how high the quality of life in Canada was until I realized how hard the life was everywhere else. You can't really tell the difference on a weekend visit, but if you live here, you will realize how easy life is. That being said, other places still have alot to brag about but we just don't seem to have the intense elements of violence, racism and other obstacles that seem to hinder lives around the world. Once you can secure the right job, trust me, this is the easy life. For the record, samsung: Most canadians kids do not necessarily ascribe to the notion that hip hop clothing is necesarily 'gangster'. As a former NYC/NJ resident, I can tell you neither do many American kids who growing tired of being stereotyped. Many who wear this clothes in Canada listen to more independent hip-hop, caribbean reggae, calypso and even skater thrash where much of the variants of this so-called 'gangster' clothing finds it's real origins. You'd be surprised by how many of these so-called 'American' styles actually originate from Toronto where plenty of popular hip-hop videos and clothing advertisments are actually shot.
