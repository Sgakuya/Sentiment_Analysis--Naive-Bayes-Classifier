Inheriting great domestic prosperity and tranquility and generally peaceful relations with neighboring nations from his predacessor, James II had a profound opportunity to serve the greater good and expand harmony and tranquility in England. However, he lacked his brother's good nature and good sense. Foolishly, he tried (and failed) to restore absolute royal authority and turn England back to the Catholic faith by systematically persecuting and converting Protestants. In the end, he served only three years and lived out the rest of his life in shame. He was wholly a failure as King, as he was too concerned with religious matters that were better off left alone, and was largely ignorant of the real problems facing English society.
