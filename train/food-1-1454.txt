They'd sell a lot more of these bloated little monsters if they moved them from the candy aisle to the hardware department and marketed them as tire patches, drainage rocks for plants, caulking, wood filler, and other useful things. Whatever you do with gummy bears, don't eat them! They were obviously developed by an evil dentist trying to drum up business. Even when fresh, these rubbery little devils do everything to resist your most sincere efforts to chew them, and you're doomed to the dentist's chair for life if you get a stale package. The flavor (if you can call it that) is reminiscent of watered-down Lifesavers- BLAH! The larger cinnamon bear, a distant cousin, is not quite as bad, but that's not saying much. For me, the terms gummy and edible simply don't go together.
