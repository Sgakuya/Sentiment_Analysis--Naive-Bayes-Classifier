Like the carnival game in which groundhogs repeatedly pop up, and are smacked back down with a mallet, I fear that we have not seen the last of this man on the national scene. Had some real accomplishments, but, due to his vanity and self-righteousness, believes he is entitled to do as he pleases even if his actions violate the rules, and damn the consequences to anyone else. If he could ever see a difference between the two, would choose his interest over the public interest every time. Bill Clinton would have made a good third-world dictator, except for the fact that he never served in the military. And, also, except for the fact even some third-world dictators feel shame.
