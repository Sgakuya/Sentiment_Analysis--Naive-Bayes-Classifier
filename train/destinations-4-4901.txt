I had a really nice time in medellin. It was a little hairy getting there because I came alone by bus from the Ecuadorian border and at that time most guide books were saying don't go this way especially at night, so of course that's exactly how I ended up going. Not by choice so much there were just delays and it ended up being night time. Looking back though I'm sure most of that uneasiness was in my mind. However, I did always say I was Canadian when someone asked and ask they did, at almost every rest stop are you American? no, no Canadian, eh So Medellin was a lot of fun, pretty city for the most part, but of course lots of really bad areas as well. I wouldn't say it was one of the prettiest but there was also a very lively nightlife and a very wealthy element there as well. The most interesting thing (in a kind of disturbing way) was how the city became a tour of things Pablo Escobar had blown up, or places he had had people killed. Everywhere I went my friends (colombians) were pointing these things out, that's the bridge Pablo blew up several times after soccer matches,- that's the bar where he had that World Cup soccer player who scored against his own team (colombia), killed, this is where he was held in prison etc. etc. All in all a good stop. Oh one thing to remember when you order a Coke say the full name coca cola not just una coca as is done in most other South American countries, it means something different in Colombia I got many quizzical looks asking for it that way.
