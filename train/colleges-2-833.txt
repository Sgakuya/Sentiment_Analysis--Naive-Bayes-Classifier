I am a current UoP student in a graduate program. I am roughly 4 courses from finishing my 2 year program. The promise of the UoP was a great motivator into enrolling at UoP. I tried attending a traditional university in the past, for my second degree, and it was too difficult given my work schedule. What the UoP offers to career adults, with the promise of flexible education, is great. The execution has been less so. The deliver technology is good and has gotten better since I started in the program, especially with some of the materials and research resources. I have the following issues: 1. Quality of students. I had student in my class who could not communicate and had little understanding of English. Some students could not understand the material and had such poor spelling and grammar, that I could not believe they were graduate students. They also did not work at the level of a graduate student 2. Instructors. Some instructors were quite poor, and do not supply lectures or proper feedback on work. 3. High costs. Twice, I have experienced tuition increases. Although this happens at traditional universities as well, the program is relatively quite expensive compared to a traditional university, which requires physical facilities. 4. Poor quality overall. Too easy to get an A. You can slide your way to an A with little effort. I purposely did not submit work, with the expectation that I would not get an A, only to be surprised. Overall, I would not recommend the UoP for anyone at this time, unless the program and way it is managed changes. The goals marketed to the public are correct (flexible, adult education), but the corporate goals of the Apollo Group conflict with the goals of an educational institution. It is possible to get some knowledge from the program, but this requires the student to read all the materials. Otherwise, a student can obtain a high grade with little effort.
