Almost everyone has heard about Red Bull and Vodka, I was very suprised to discover how well it mixes with Jagermeister (also known as a Jager Bomb ). Red Bull drink mixes are good, but more than a couple too close together isn't such a great idea. There have been studies on it's effect nervous system, and it seems that while the alcohol is a downer, the caffine in Red Bull is an upper. These two don't cancel each other out, but pulls in different directions at once (i.e. you get more and more drunk and at the same time your body gets more and more awake...leading to potential medical problems). Moderation is an understatement.
