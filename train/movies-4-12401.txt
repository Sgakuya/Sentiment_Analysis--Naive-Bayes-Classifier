This is what Batman should have been all along. Batman Begins abandoned its cheesy, campy predecessors (like any of the ones that had Robin in it, and the crappy one-liners, and seriously, why did they put nipples on the Bat costume? Really . . . ) and goes for the darker, brooding Batman that fans actually LIKE. (Well, some at least; Ive read a few reviews here and there that complain that the movie isnt fun, and that you dont get to see him as Batman until halfway through the movie . . . well, I could only assume that they didnt read the TITLE of the film before entering the theater). Christian Bale is an excellent choice for a young Bruce Wayne and a new Batman, who is trying to figure out himself (while clumsily trying to figure out how to go about balancing his new hobby and playing a multi-millionaire playboy at the same time.) Haunted by the tragedy that brought him into his new line of work, Batman Begins sets Wayne off, lost, angry and confused, until he finds a mentor (played by Liam Neeson). He later returns to Gotham to face his first challenge as Batman. Butler Alfred and Lucius Fox (Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman) both provide some lightheartedness without drowning out the mood. And they dont draw out any sappy love stories, either, which is always a plus. I think I speak for a lot of Batman fans when I say this: It's about freaking time they did this right!
