I have been watching Nebraska football as a season ticket holder evidently a lot longer than most of the posters here. Most probably do no not remember when the entire state was calling for TO's head on a platter. He was not thought of as the "God" of NE football until the 1990's. Everyone said that he couldn't win the big ones. Have you all forgotten that it was TO who hand picked Frank for the head coaching position? Most of you probably don't know that there has been more of Solich's recruits that have gone to the NFL than any other coach at NE. Know the facts before you open your mouth. I think Frank got a raw deal from our AD who had a bone to pick with him. Most of you probably don't know Mr. "Lisping" Pedersen either. I say bring back Frank and bring back the option!!! Get rid of the "Worst Coast Offense"
