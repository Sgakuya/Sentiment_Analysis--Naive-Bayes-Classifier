Generally speaking, FL is a very livable place. Prices are skyrocketing, especially with regards to real estate prices. But there's still plenty of room for growth here overall, however the cost of living seems to be highest along the coasts. Good climate overall, especially from October through May, when temperature average out in the mid-70's, with the exception of the far north around Tallahassee, which is much cooler; they actually have 4 seasons! Summer can be very hot and especially humid. Generally speaking, it rains daily at that time of year; hurricanes are also major consideration. Crime is a n issue in many of the larger cities like Miami; the public school system also faces overcrowding. Lots of people have been moving into the state, from the rest of the country and from Latin America, that has placed an immense burden on the infrastructure. Traffic is a problem, especially in South Florida and Orlando. The topography isn't very diverse either, some rolling hills in the central part of the state around Ocala are the only peaks you'll find around here. But that doesn't mean it lacks natural beauty necessarily. FL is home to one of the largest areas of unspoiled wetlands in the world. The beaches can't be beat; the NE coast isn't as good, but South Florida and the Gulf Coast have the best beaches in the nation. You may have to deal with these factors, but FL is an interesting place. Lots of amenties, interesting cities (except Jacksonville), and lots of cultural and natural sites. Very accessable to the rest of the country as well. Overall, I would say that Florida is probably one of the best states to live in, once you get around the heat and mosquitos.
