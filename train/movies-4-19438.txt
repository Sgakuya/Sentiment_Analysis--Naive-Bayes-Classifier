Well, basically I saw and I liked. I am not much of a long review writer but hey, hope this helps: Overall it was a very cool movie, but it didn't make much of any sense at all. In most movies this would make me change the channel, hit stop, or just walk out but in this one it don't really matter how much sense it makes. It left an atmosphere with me that few movies can do, I loved the shiny silver ball with the razors (Read review 1 for more info /\ ).. It didn't scare me but on the other hand there has been only 1 movie out of the 100's that I have seen that did... It was overall a cool movie and I would watch it again.
