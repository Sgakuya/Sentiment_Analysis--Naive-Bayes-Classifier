I was a fan of Virtua Fighter, and this game is very similar. I love the graphics and the way the characters move and flow in this game. You can see the footprints in the snow and sand! You can see the strands of hair blowing in the wind, it's quite incredible. The backgrounds where they fight are fabulous, I especially like the aquarium where the fish beneath the floor swim away when someone hits the ground. The controls are simple and if you don't like the way they're set up, you can change them for the controller you are using. There's a practice mode for those who really want to figure out all the combinations which is helpful for anyone who wants to do more than punch and kick. There are ways to unlock one character, and several costumes for your players which is also very cool. If you play solo against the machine, and reach the end by defeating the creature, you unlock a mini-movie of the character you just played with. Tina's the most interesting one of all the mini-movies. This is one of the more enjoyable games. I recommend it.
