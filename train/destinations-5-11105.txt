One of the best beach vacations I've ever spent, and I love beach vacations! This place is so scenic and special, I've gone maybe 5 times now. The great thing about it is that below Nags Head, the entire coastline is National Seashore, meaning free of development on the beach and freedom to go up and down as far as you like without running into hotels and private property. Great for shell hunting, especially in off season. I do recommend staying below Nags Head to avoid the crowds unless you like lots of people around. Lots of fascinating history around here too: Kitty Hawk, historic lighthouses, ghost stories and folk tales. Fishing is wonderful. Not a nightlife kind of place, but relaxing beyond compare. Folks are really friendly here. Bring mosquito repellant if you want to stay bite-free.
