I thought that this movie, like quite a few people have said, is cute and charming. Nothing more nothing less. It's certainly not groundbreaking stuff, it's just a sweet romantic comedy boosted by, in my opinion, one of the best actresses of her generation. I am certain, that without Reese Witherspoon this movie would not have done so well and I'm pretty certain a lesser actrees would have made this movie unbearable. So, having said that, the 4 star rating is mostly due to Reese. I can't lie, I'm absolutely fascinated by this actress, she is just a phenomenal talent. She can turn a cliched romantic comedy into box office gold. With Reese being in practically every scene it's hard to take your eye away from the screen. She's got amazing screen presence. I also thought she has great chemistry with Josh Lucas, who played her redneck husband. They played off each other rather well. I haven't talked much about the other actors, but really this movie is all about Reese and that basically is the best thing about this movie and the best reason to watch this been-there-done-that romantic comedy.
