Perhaps the negative comments in this category come from folks who don't appreciate ethnic diversity, a strong and varied curriculum and a beautiful urban campus setting but I could not disagree more with the comments made by a couple of these folks about SF State. I earned my BA in the Cinema department there and can't imagine that another institution would have had more to offer. As far as the instructors not speaking English, I am not sure which instructors you speak of but I did not run into this problem in any of my General Ed. courses or in my specialized coursework. I found the ethnic diversity to be very helpful in exposing me to different ways of thinking and I appreciated the chance to learn about different cultures while attending SFSU. Coming to school in such a diverse city as San Francisco you would think that these folks would expect such a level of diversity at SF State but it looks like they did not. PC bickering , as one of the reviewers put it, is what led to the civil rights movement in America. PC bickering is what calls into question the status quo and can lead to real change in society, so I say -BRING IT ON! If you want a diverse learning experience, if you value the exposure to many wonderful people from many different cultures, if you appreciate people who ask the hard questions about the way this society is constructed, and if you want a really good education at a very resonable price then you will love SFSU. I did.
