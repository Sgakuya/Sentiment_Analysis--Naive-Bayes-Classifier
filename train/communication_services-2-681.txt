I have only had Cingular Wirless service for two days and I'm already switching back. I was previously with another carrier and disatisfied with their horrendous customer service. I thought Cingular was a sure bet. I was wrong. They claim that the area where I live (Northern Washington State) got full coverage. To my dissapointment, I cannot place calls or receive calls in most of the town where I live. The calls drop and the reception goes ini and out. I can't get more than 2 bars of signal. With my previous carrier, I got full dovereage in the area where I live. Their customer service is okay. I don't necessarily like Sprint, but in Washington State, they blow Cingular Wireless out of the water in terms of coverage.
