Argueably the best mens/womens college basketball program in the country over the past several years. The mens football program has also taken great strides and a new stadium was built in East Hartford. Now that we're past that, I can't say I'd recommend UCONN. I've been there many times and there frankly isn't much to do. You are in Storrs, which is made up solely of the campus, a Blimpie's, 3 bars, and a Store 24. You are 20 minutes away from any area of human contact (Manchester and Willimantic) and even those towns are pretty lifeless. With that said, if you are going to UCONN make sure you get involved in clubs, sports, or Greek Life - otherwise you will be transferring after 1 semester.
