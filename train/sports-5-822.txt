Jimmy is one of the strongest batters in baseball. There is no ball park in the world that he cannot hit the ball out of. He is a decent first base man, but his real strength is with a bat. He should hit around fifty home runs this year, with well over one hundred RBI's and a batting average about .300. The only bad side is this, like many homerun hitters, he tends to strike out alot. When he gets in a slump he is prone to chase the ball outside, and he still has a little trouble with the left hand pitchers. Personality wise, the man is one of the nicest in baseball. He has never lost his temper or gotten any bad press. I was happy when he broke Albert Belle's record and became the top home run hitter for the Indians.
