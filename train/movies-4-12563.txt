A really good film should stay with you for longer than the 1 1/2 to 2 hours that you are entertained by it in a darkened theatre. The Constant Gardener meets and exceeds this criteria. The casting of Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz as the two leads is inspired. The intensity they bring to the screen is electric. I won't go into the plot - you can read about it in your local paper or on numerous internet sites. What I will say is that the story, although sometimes inspirational, is also disturbing. You will leave the cineplex with an unsettling suspicion that the thin veneer of civilization that separates us from the lower life forms is even thinner than you might have suspected.
