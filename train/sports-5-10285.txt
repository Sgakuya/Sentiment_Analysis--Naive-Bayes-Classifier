It's been quite an amazing career for Stoops, who is the top defensive genius in America. Utilizing his defensive IQ well, he became an incredible defensive coordinator at Kansas State (the Wildcats led the nation in total defense in 1995, Stoops' last year in Manhattan) and at Florida (is it a coincidence that in Stoops' first year in Gainesville, pairing his defensive mastermind with Spurrier's offensive genius, the Gators took the national title?) He brought up players like Jevon Kearse, Fred Weary, Teako Brown, and others to NFL-level status at Florida. Then he takes a fading Oklahoma program that always seemed to finish under .500 and at the bottom of the Big 8 and then Big 12 to national prominence, culminating in a title in 2000. He showed that for all his defensive exploits, he wasn't afraid to air it out, by making Josh Heupel the best QB in America in his senior year. Now the Sooners are back in the national hunt annually, and Stoops is only now recieving due credit for his awesome work as first a coordinator, and then a head coach.
