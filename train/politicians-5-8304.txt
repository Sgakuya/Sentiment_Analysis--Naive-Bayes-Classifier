Well, there you go again you liberal dirty rats! Reagan should be number one on this list. This site reminds me of the Bush/Kerry debate online polls where the stinking Democrats voted many times to deceive the public who won the debates. Same thing going on here. Kind of funny that Discovery Channel collaborating with left leaning AOL had Ronald Reagan the "greatest American" all-time a few months ago from votes via phone and online. It tells a lot about the intellectual dishonesty of Democrats and liberals. Thank God Jimmy Carter was not president 1981-1985 during the Cold War and Al Gore and John Kerry during our war on terror. Now you liberal rats- go to Starbucks with your Birkenstocks and smell the coffee.
