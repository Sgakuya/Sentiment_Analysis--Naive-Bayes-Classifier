EXTREMELY inconsistent quality and employees based on location. Do NOT chance it in a large metro area. [2 stars] Some are corporate and some are franchised. The franchised location near me in Grand Prairie is one of the worst I've ever visited, both on scummy car hops and rude managers and sloppy food. English is a second language among the car hops and store workers there now and their lack of concern shows. Small Texas towns are the best locations by far. [THREE stars] Burgers come in foil bags and by the time they reach you, they are "steamed"..not a good way to serve a burger with fresh vegetables on it. Comes out tasting like you took an entire burger, veges and all, and stuck it in your microwave oven.
