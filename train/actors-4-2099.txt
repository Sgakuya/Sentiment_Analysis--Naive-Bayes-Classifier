What can I say about this guy...I have only seen three of his movies which are Silence of the Lambs, Instinct, The Edge. All of mr Hopkinse's performances are stunning espicially Silence. Though you know as great of an actor Mr Hopkins is, I must say this guy scares the bejeezes out of me with those stone cold blue eyes. Anyone see the commercial for Hannibal? well in one seen you see Mr Hopkins come out of some shadow to say HELLO CLARICE ...now if you dont think thats terrifying, well you must not know what fear is. To quote TV GUIDE when Mr Hopkins was the main story the interviewer stated SITTING HERE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISMISS THE FEELING THAT LECTOR-AND NOT HOPKINS-COULD TURN ANY MOMENT AND STRIKE..THAT FEELING IS A TRIBUTE TO HOPKINS'S VAST SKILLS AS AN ACTOR. and that is so damn true. Mr Hopkinks is definatley one of the forces to be reckeoned with when it comes to acting.
