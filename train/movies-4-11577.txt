I couldn't bring myself to give Jackass a 5, because it seemed too contrived, especially when held up to Bam Margera's pre-Jackass skate/prank video series, CKY (Camp Kill Yourself). CKY was better because it was nothing more than a bunch of kids with cameras f*cking with everyone in their town, and without all the flashy eMpTyV production. Good skating sequences, too. But I also gave Jackass a 4 because honestly, it's a guilty pleasure. I liked the fact that they didn't pull any punches. Sh!t, if you actually spent money on this movie and had no idea what to expect, how the hell do you get dressed every morning? Oh my god! I voted for Clinton only to find out he's a liar! I don't believe it! It's like the time I saw Friday the 13th because I thought it was a musical. Hey, ClassicTVFan47, didn't you know that you're not cool unless you use profanity? F*ck, sh!t, c*ck, p*ssy, c*nt, Barbara Streisand! Whoo-hoo!!!
