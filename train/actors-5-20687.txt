Ellen is talented and obviously loves what she does. On her talk show, she makes her audience comfortable and although the monologue does not last long, it it funny! If she was an awful comedian as many people critique her, her standup shows would not sell, her DVD would not sell, her books would not sell, etc. People like her material, and as she keeps it up she will only be more successful! People who complain about her coming out publicly or simply being a lesbian- think about it! She is in the public eye, it had to happen sometime! She could either 1- Do what she did, get it done and over with by coming out nationally; or 2- hide her sexuality forever, being miserable because she was afraid of what people think. I believe that she made the right choice.
