Madrid is a very pleasant city. Comments based on one visit in 1992. Food was excellent; the evening tapa hopping is a real treat. Best filet mignon I ever had was in Madrid - they really do a great job with steak. Wines (reds) were very good. I wasn't too impressed with individual sights in general, although the city is beautiful in its own right. The people were very friendly (but English wasn't spoken an awful lot). Hotel I stayed at was top-notch; elegant with all of the creature comforts (much better than comparable Italian hotels, if that conveys the idea). Even though there are other places that edge Madrid out in my estimation, it's still a very desirable travel destination.
