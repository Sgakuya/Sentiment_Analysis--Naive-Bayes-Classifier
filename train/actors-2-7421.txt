He made Rocky at the right time...a picture of optimism and hope in the midst of the Anti-Hero era. It seemed refreshing at the time, but Stallone was a mediocre actor with delusions of grandeur. Each Rocky sequel got progressively more ridiculous and grandiose. Stallone got his hands on the Rambo character and changed it from a deranged psychopath (as it was in the original novel) into a comic-book hero. Over the years, it seems his ego got as bloated as the budget for his movies. Cobra was pitiful. I would agree that his role in Copland wasn't bad, but it was too little too late. It would appear his career is essentially over and I, for one, can't say as I'm sorry about that.
