This vehicle could be put together with Elmer's Glue and it would still have better workmanship than it has now. Typical American engineering post 1970s. Just market the thing as the ultra-conservative freedom mobile. Flag humpers across middle america will come out in droves to buy them. I don't know what's worse, that they waste their money giving to the GOP or that they waste it on this cheap piece of crap SUV. I've never owned one, but I can imagine at least 4 or 5 maintenance jobs a year with the cheap parts and laughable engineering. These things should be banned from the roads based on their size alone. SUVs were not meant to be any bigger than a Jeep Cherokee, which is the only size of a true SUV. Expeditions are merely humungous trucks and are never used for off-road activity.
