Awful sequel to Get Shorty. Someone obviously watched Get Shorty, decided to break down what made the movie tick and wanted to make a roughly similar movie with roughly the same character types yet with the Music Industry instead of the Movie Industry as the backdrop. What a great opportunity to make a satirical , funny commentary on the Music Industry while again looking at the quirky nature of celebrity and the LA lifestyle. Opportunity Lost. The movie also was too cute - making some cute ironic references in the beginning and throughout. Vince Vaughn was awful and Christina Milian was was OK. Andre 3000 was just stupid.
