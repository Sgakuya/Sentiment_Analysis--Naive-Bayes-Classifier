This game is unbelievable. I am a Final Fantasy nut, and I bought the Playstation 2 just for this game. The graphics of this RPG are fantastic, the gameplay is well done, and the story is pretty enthralling. Enough gushing now...here are the important parts. I have not yet finished the game, but I have played 60+ hours already. The story has been very well done and there are cool surprises along the way. At first, it was hard to get used to the voice acting, but now I like it a lot. (Except for the voice of Cid. He sounds like a hillbilly!) There aren't really any annoying characters like there have been in past Final Fantasy games either. Square breaks out of the traditional leveling up system by introducing the Sphere Grid, which allows you to customize your characters' stats by beating enemies and earning spheres. It's quite complex and it's up to you how you want to develop your characters. Also, you can switch your characters in battle _during_ the battle, which is a very nice feature. Weapons and armor are all customizable and you can improve the monsters you summon (aeons) almost any way you want too. The game is also challenging. You could probably play straight through and beat the game without a problem, but if you want to get your character's ultimate weapons, there are _very_ challenging tasks to undertake (Argh! chocobo race!), plus very difficult battles in the Monster arena. The side quests and mini games are fun and well done. Blitzball could be a whole other game in itself, it's that complex. This game deserves 10 stars. SquareSoft has once again produced a worthy addition to the already outstanding Final Fantasy series.
