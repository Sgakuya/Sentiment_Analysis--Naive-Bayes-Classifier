'Munich' is a boring, three-hour propaganda film whose sole point seems to be that Palestinians and Israelis are all humans so can't we just work it out peacefully. Well, no, some individuals and some cultures are in fact more immoral than others, this is a biblical proposition and one evidenced thru history. 'Munich' offers worse than complacency, but myopia, Jewish self-delusion, and a denial of reality that equates the Palestinian's plight with that of Israel's, but there is no moral equivalence. In one scene there's a tally of violence-beget-violence incidents: letter-bombs, hijackings, etc., yet nowhere is there a tally of failed peace initiatives, internationally agreed upon yet not complied with, or those outright rejected. This film displays the great failure of the world, including many Jews to understand Islam and the Palestinian mindset and goal of total annihilation of Israel. As fiction or not, the characters are not compelling, nor are their relationships. The characters, unlike the "inspired by real events" events, seem contrived and do not ring true based on the Israelis and Palestinians I know. The movie is totally secular with no hint in even one, just one, character having faith in God's providential plan for Israel. Nor does any sense of deep love that many sabras have come through. Oddly, though, there is a speech by a Palestinian terrorist about love for the land, yet for those of us who have lived (I studied there) in Israel and know Palestinians, it is not land-love but hatred for Israel that dominates their conversations. People are perishing for lack of knowledge; we'd do well to see what God has to say about this situation. But even if only looked at it from secular eyes, when, world, will you wake up to the record and fact that the Palestinians and other Arabs, plus nonArab Muslims do not want peace, but to wipe Israel off the map.
