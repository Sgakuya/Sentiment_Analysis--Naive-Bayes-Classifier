Once you open a pack of Nat Sherman Classic Mints, you know you are in for a treat. Just one smell of a freshly open box, and you know this isn't any ordinary cigarette you buy at your local gas station. The smooth taste last til the very end. As one of my good friends say, these are the only ones I smoke to the filter!. However, its very important that you purchase them where other consumers also buy them. It must be fresh. A lot of places just keep them on the counter throughout the months or years, causing it to lose the taste. But once you get your hands on a new pack, sit back and enjoy the almost orgasmic experience.
