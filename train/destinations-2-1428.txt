Michelin Guide#Un-Madame Rosa(Fraunce;Lay Miserob)One of the best movies France produced in the last thirty years,Madame Rosa is about the relationship between an Aushwitz survivor and an Arab boy. Michelin Guide #Du(France;Less Miserables;)Madame Rosa is a film from another planet(planay)because of the current level of Jew-hatred in France.From Alfred Dreyfus who was sent to Devil's Island after being framed for treason to current reports of Jews being victimized by thugs from Arab countries,France is a country run by an elementary school principal who runs things from an ongoing wine-and-cheese orgy.One Jewish exception was Ira Einhorn, who hacked up his girlfriend in Philadelphia,went on the lam and hid out forever in France. The French finally returned him to the US with the agreement that he wouldn't receive the death penalty(Maybe the US can pull an April fools joke and revert to Plan A). If Madame Rosa were made today,it could actually be a better movie.Obviously,she'd have Benya Krik-Isaac Babel's great Jewish gangster burn down the police station.
