Spain is not only one of Europe's most fascinating countries, but is home to some of the world's greatest treasures of history, culture, charm, and beauty. I lived in Spain for 3 years and during that time I had a chance to explore the many historical gems and diverse regions that the Iberian Peninsula has to offer. (Portugal is pretty cool too ya know) For one, you won't find any other country in Europe that is as rich in cultural influences as Spain is. The Romans and the Moors left a signigicant mark on Spanish society with their language, culture and architecture. Incredible Roman ruins can still be found throughout the country, the best being in Merida, Segovia and Tarragona. Fascinating Moorish palaces and mosques, such as the Alhambra of Granada and La Mezquita of Cordoba, are two incredible must see places for anyone traveling through Andalusia. Cathedrals...WOW! Some of the finest in the world. Medival, Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance-era...it's all here. Enchanting castles can be found in nearly every part of the country. The geography is quite diverse, with the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains in the south, only a few hours drive from the amazing beaches of the Costa Del Sol. From the deserts of Almeria, to the lush green Ireland-like Asturias in the north, Spain has the climate and geography to satisfy anyone's desires. The people of Spain share one very common virtue in life...eat well, drink well, and enjoy every day as if it were your last. They are notorious for their never-ending festive spirits and many celebrations throughout the year. The running of the bulls in Pamplona , the April Fair of Sevilla, and Holy Week are just a few of the more famous of these Spanish traditions. Great food, wonderful people, awesome nightlife, enchanting cities, historical treasures...what more could you ask for? Spain is truly a place like no other.
