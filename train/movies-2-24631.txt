To be fair, this movie deserves probably slightly higher than two stars, but does not deserve three. I was annoyed by the obvious holes in the plot (especially the endings), and thought the 2001 remake lacked much of the sophistication of the original. While the special effects were excellent, I would have gladly traded them for some decent acting and more compelling dialogue. I got the feeling that there were some really ambitious intentions that went into this movie, that somehow - either through bad acting, Hollywood pressures, or some combination of the two - gave in to becoming just another crappy movie with great special effects.
