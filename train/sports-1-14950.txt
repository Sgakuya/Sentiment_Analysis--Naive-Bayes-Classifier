Not even in the top 20 for QBs alone. All players all-time? Shouldn't even be listed really. He has almost 50 more interceptions than TDs thrown. barely over 50% passing career. Compares well with Archie Manning but manning had a better completion percentage and much better rushing stats. Aside from those two items they are very similar. Namath is all smoke and mirrors. To this day many think he is the greatest and he made a career out of one season and really just one game. understood marketing before almost any sports personality. Perhaps defined modern athlete marketing but that doesn't make him an all-time SPORTS best.
