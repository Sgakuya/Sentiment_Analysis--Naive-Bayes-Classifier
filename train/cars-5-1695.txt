THE FORD FOCUS IS A GREAT AUTOMOBILE! Believe me when I tell you that there's no way the Ford Focus deserves all this phony criticism! I am 73 and my first car was a 1938 Plymouth, and I have had countless number of cars since then. I now have a 2003 Focus and it's without equivocation the very best car I've ever driven in all my years! Its also my 2d Ford in all of those said 57 years; and, no I have never worked for Ford, nor am I a dealer or a seller. The FORD FOCUS ease of handling, comfortable riding qualities (especially for the small clss), its looks and economical to operate makes it second to none in my book! That includes all the power it needs for such a small car... If it had a bigger engine, one wouldn't have the MPG it currently has; you cannot have it both ways! I can't help but believe that all of these bad reports are from people working for the other small car makers and/or dealers that are endeavoring to sway you from purchasing a FORD FOCUS to buying their less than equivalent small, fuel efficent cars. Therefore, by all means... If you want a small car with all the above said features... RUN DO NOT WALK to your private seller, previously owned car lots or your nearest Ford dealer! Gene R. Seattle
