Because of them I was stuck in vancouver for 2 days. I travel alot and usually I have ID, but on this occasion I didn't have it. The only thing I had was my aeroplan card. So when I get to the airport I realize that I don't have ID, but since I've travled with Canadien before with just my canadien card it should be OK. When buying my ticket the Air Canada sales women was rude and after I told her to check my file to prove my identity she reluctenly did and after making a smartass remark I was on my way. On my way back they would't even try to use my Aeroplan card to verify my ID. So I explained to the manager and sales woman that I have no ID. Their smartass remark was to go get an ID or pay $480 for a ticket. Even though they knew I couldn't get ID since you need some ID to get a new one. I endded up taking westjet home. I wanted to call Air Canada to complain, but they don't have a complaint line...how convinient.
