All soundtrack lists start with Saturday Night Fever (released in 1977). No other soundtrack affected popular culture as much as this one, as the music and the film brought the disco subculture out of the gay underworld and into the mainstream, and the tracks are still played today. Whether you hate disco, love it, or are indifferent, no one can deny that this release was a landmark in music history. Of course, the soundtrack starts with the contributions by the Bee Gees. The group had already written the core songs (eg Stayin' Alive, How Deep Is Your Love, and Night Fever) as well as some that were eventually recorded by other artists for the film (eg If I Can't Have You and More Than A Woman) when the movie's producer Robert Stigwood asked the trio to contribute the songs to the film. Throw in a few pre-recorded Bee Gees' classics (eg Jive Talking), add some additional immortals tracks (eg the Trammps' Disco Inferno), and finally mix in a few period songs and instrumentals (eg Walter Murphey's A Fifth Of Beethoven) and one has a perfect snapshot of the disco era and the biggest selling soundtrack in history (though The Bodyguard passed it at one time, at least in terms of revenue).
