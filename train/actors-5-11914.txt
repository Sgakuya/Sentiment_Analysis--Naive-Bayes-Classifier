The first movie I saw her in was the Bone Collector, and even though I didn't know who she was, her stage presence really caught my eye. When the movie came out on VHS and I saw it again I was like wow, she really is someone special. In my opinion, I admire her because she's not plastic and fake like a lot of other hollywood stars. She's real. Most of the movies I've seen her in were excellent, and even the ones that weren't, she still played her part as if the film would win all the awards possible. I admire her strength, her passion, and her originality.She should keep up the good work and not let anyone get her down for being different.
