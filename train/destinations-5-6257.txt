Georgia is a great state. It has fantastic weather, friendly people, a rich cultural history, and awesome natural beauty. What is all of this talk about rednecks in Georgia? What a stereotype. Friends, there are rednecks in all 50 states they just have different accents. Savannah is one of the prettiest and most charming little cities in the world, not just the United States. Atlanta is big, happening, and modern. It had many historical gems. General Sherman didn't seem to care for them, so all of Atlanta was built post 1865. Northern people migrate to Atlanta and try to turn it into New Jersey South. I've never quite figured that one out. Georgia is fantastic! It's not my home, but it's great.
