this is THE best browser! kicks the ---- outta IE!!! it does take a few tricks to get flash to work right but it has alot of helpful thingss like loading new links in tabs rather than seprate windows conserving cpu/ram resources. it also loads pages much faster and its auto complete is better and implements it on all forms on all sites instead of simalar coded or on simalar database type websites unlike IE. It also has better site login features and is only 4 meg to download and it installs very quickly (zipped file) and it does not require you to be connected to the internet to install unlike IE where you have to sit thrrough an approx 15-20 min(56kpbs) active type setup. How to install: just create MozillaFirebird in the program files directory, then make wizip unzip the files to that directory and you're done! great browser!!!! Love it!!
