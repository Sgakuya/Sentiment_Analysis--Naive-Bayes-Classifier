Sitting through this movie was more like trying to endure a transatlantic flight. I mean when you re your leg starts to go numb and people around you keep glancing at their watches well, that might be the first indication that your entertainment experience isn t turning out quite the way you originally planned. Sadly, this movie had all the elements of a classic suspenseful tale; creepy old house in the middle of the woods wrapped in mystery, secretive and weird town folk, and a nice little family of empathetic victims. The problem was, with all it had going for it, it also had a very predictable plotline that drug on like 5 hour lecture on hygiene by a terminally monotone teacher. I don t fault the actors, who did what they could with what they had. But there was absolutely nothing in that script that hasn t been done a thousand times before - and better. You MIGHT want to rent this one sometime during the cold, bleak winter that is if you have nothing else to do apart from watching flies die in the window sill.
