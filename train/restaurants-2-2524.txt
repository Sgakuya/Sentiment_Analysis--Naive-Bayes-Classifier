McDonald's used to be good when I was younger, but now, it's going down. Just about every fast food restaurant has now surpassed McDonald's in taste and quality. Even worse, McDonald's is now at the mercy of the public, as it will change any little aspect of itself for any group that complains. Their PR department is in overdrive. The fries have gone down because they have switched from beef oil to vegetable, or so I'm told. This was because of a Hindu group that sued. Their burgers are hopelessly tasteless and fake. Even the cheapo fast food place down the street offers real beef in their burgers. McDonald's also has the worst ads in the business...what's up with the urban hipster ads? Do they realize that these ads also run outside of New York City? I wouldn't connect with McDonald's product if I lived in Kansas City and saw a weird ad with hipster trendies bouncing about. Their black ads are shameless and pandering. As a black man myself, they insult my intelligence. Until McDonald's stops being a global corporate sellout, it will never come out of its tailspin. You run a restaurant, not a non-governmental organization.
