Oh my gosh – Hooked on Phonics! I love it. I went to U of P and yes I have to mumble it. Someone posted they treat you like a client and not a student – that is correct. Like companies, the bottom line is MONEY! It is the money they are making not the education you are receiving. Although I went to U of P for my Bachelor’s, I would never consider it for a MBA. They hook you in by guiding you through the financial aid process and before you know it, if you quit you pay back all your loans right away with no degree. I had one professor who spent two hours describing his life story and the reason he had a second child, I had another professor who spent a half hour showing us how to make a table tent (so our names could be displayed), I had another professor spent two hours talking about his web site. I had one class that consisted of watching videos the entire three hours and another that involved ‘quiet time’ where we could study. I haven’t had quiet time since elementary school!!! I felt like this was a business – everyone was after money – the professors were in it for the money and often seemed too tired from their full time jobs to put in any effort; the advisors were after the commission they received for signing students up. My papers rarely had feedback and I often felt they weren’t even read but check marked. If you want to go to a school for a piece of paper without any effort and no relevance in the real world, than U of P is great. But if you want something reputable with a solid background and an actual curriculum, U of P is not for you.
