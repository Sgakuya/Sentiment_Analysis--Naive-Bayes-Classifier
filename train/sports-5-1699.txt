** How sweet it is to win the World Series and HUMILIATE the Yankees in the process. Dreams do come true. ** * One last step to make them one of the best and most deserving World Series champions ever. A historic turn of events for the pennant needs a proper finish. I hope and expect they will deliver. * This is the year. Solid on offense and only needs some good pitching. Evidence of a curse is strong and made more so after last season but I am not superstitious. A showdown with the Yankees on route to the World Series title would bring unimaginable joy to many who have suffered. Many may have sworn they would just die (and go to heaven) if Boston won the world series. The morgues need to get ready.
