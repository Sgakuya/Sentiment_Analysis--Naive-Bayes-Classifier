I've been a customer for a long time... but not for much more. Customer service is very poor. I've been complaining for ages about how their portfolio tracking tools are almost useless. Now I find out they have new tools that would probably meet my needs. At the same time they are refusing to allow me access to the tools they are advertising them on TV and giving them to new customers. So if you open an account expect that the level of support they give you after you're a customer will be pretty bad. In talking to customer service I've gotten nothing but run around and conflicting info with excuses like oh, if only you had spoken to the right people a few days ago we could have helped you but now you've missed the deadline. This is after calling repeatedly about this problem for a month or two. Also, they charge $30 transaction fee on most mutual fund orders... while other brokers have started refunding part of the 12b1 fees.
