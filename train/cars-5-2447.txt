Of course I have no practical knowledge of this car, considering that I have never driven one and have only ridden in one once, but I must say that the Impreza WRX is one of the most impressive mass-market sedans available today. Again, I only say this because I'm a big fan of the World Rally Championship, where the Subaru team usually fares reasonably well. And then there's also the fact that you can buy the WRX and get a car that performs like a BMW M3 for one third of the price. And the fact that I love the Gran Turismo series of games for Playstation and Playstation 2 only further fuels my passion for this car. I just can't wait for the STi to come stateside.
