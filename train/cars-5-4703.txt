I bought a 1999 S-10 Xtreme from my buddy, From the day I drove it back, I knew I would have it forever. The truck drives beautifully, smoothly. At high speeds, it dives a little in corners mostly due to the three link swaybar I Fabricated to get flex, while still functioning.The gas mileage is good @ 6-8mpg Drag/10-12mpg street/14mpg HWY: Considering that between custom, and cams/va;ves/pulleys/ceramic pistons/headers/race-cat/drop/1/2valves.5/8 lines.5/8-1/2 SlamSpecialties Airbags,9"Rear Drop, 2"Drop Spindles, Removed front shocks,Bucket Seats 5 Point Harnesses,Full Sub-Frame,$" Drop Blocks Rear,Ported/POlished, 10 Ove Honed/Sleeved, Air Intake 37 Dg, 45mm Mass air flow sensor, Straight-bore intake Mnfld, Spacer, Chipped, Mapped, Tuned, 3.73 10 Bolt rearend, Aluminum Driveshaft, Regear MUNCIE 5-Speed, Aluminum/Bllet Throughout motor steering/suspension,High Flow oil pump/Fuel pump/Radiator/water pump/trans/oil cooler.I remember one time my buddy asked to me to pull him "real quick" It ended up being an hour drive to the house, there I saw a 1969 Camaro Bracket Car, I hooked up and had it back at his house in 45 minutes, and I was at my house in an hour. There was never hesitation, overweighted feelings, nothing. I Love my D-10 and thats all ther is to it. Without going deep It's got 39,000 in it after Msrp. But it is also one of the most fun, useable, reliable, workhorse trucks I've ever owned, or driven....Beasy2k4@hotmail.com
