I am not quite sure when my attraction to Robert Downey Jr. began..I guess when I was in Junior High School and first saw Less Than Zero. He was riveting, in Chances Are, ..well he made that movie which wouldn't have been much without him. Soap Dish was another great showcase for his comedic acting. Wonder Boys is probably my favorite, he was hilarious as Douglas' flamboyant literary agent. For some reason, I have not yet seen Chaplin. His range is truly amazing. Not to mention his appearance..I am drawn to him, something about his eyes..ok, I don't want to gush here, I am no longer a teenage girl with his picture plastered on my wall..but I am still a bit smitten. That new Elton John video with him ..man, I just can't turn it off (and I am not a big MTV or VH1 watcher, but I have found myself flipping it on, hoping to see that video). Hopefully, he will overcome his personal demons so that we can enjoy his acting for years to come. One more testament to his acting; I actually started watching Ally McBeal again when he came on the show.
