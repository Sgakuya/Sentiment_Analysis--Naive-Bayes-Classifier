* I repent. Thanks to the tv show Book of Daniel, I now realize the danger of creating visual images of someone purporting to be God or even not identified as God, as in this movie, yet implying it, if the image is accompanied by words that are not straight out of the Bible (like the word-for-word Gospel of John movie, which also is a very well-made movie, by the way, just long.). Must minus 2 stars, at least this movie doesn't say Freeman is God and allows for him being a hallucination. * (10/23/05) I liked the part where Jim Carey's driving and asking for "a sign," oblivious to the pickup in front full of signs, some neon...stop, warning, etc. (I don't remember exactly, but it's just so like that in real life.)
