As a transfer student to Texas Tech I can honestly say its been a great experience. The campus although large in size (2nd largest in the nation, second to the air force which counts its run ways, as the people like to boast) is easy to get around. The people on campus are friendly and are eager to help you out when all you have to do is ask. The city of Lubbock is great. Granted some seem to think that it stinks in comparison to something like Austin, I seem to like it more. The people are some of the most friendly people you will ever meet in your life. They love Tech Students. Something else that seems to detour alot of people from coming to Tech is that Lubbock is a dry county. Although this may be true (for now anyways), let me tell you its not scarce. Now for the somewhat biast view of the education obtained at Tech. I myself am an electrical engineer major, and have so far been challenged to my extent. The engineering department at tech is exceptional. The teaching staff is diversified, eager to make sure you understand what they are trying to teach you, and are always making you think. Something else I like about the department is the innovative junior and senior project labs, for example, this past year they had the seniors convert a chevy suburban from a combustion engine to a hydrogen powered vehicle. One final thing I would like to touch on is the math departments excellent teaching ability. They always find new ways of making you understand a certain thing, and they make sure you know not just what you need to know to survive out there, but they make you know that you understand. I could rant on about my great experiences at Tech all day, but I should give others a chance to rate it as well so you dont just get my own biast opinion. I hope this helps you in making your choice for a University. Wreck'em Tech
