Low-key and introspective with great on-screen presence. A fine speaking voice and a real Regular Joe kind of appeal. Physically impressive. Did a great job in The Story of G.I. Joe, Out of the Past, Cape Fear, The Night of the Hunter, and fine comeback job in Ryan's Daughter. He also did quite a few B-films after his marijuana bust that weren't anything to write home about because the studios didn't know if he would be bankable at that point, but his performances were solid; a couple noirish numbers he did early in his career are mostly forgotten, but he showed talent early on. Also, the guy didn't take himself so seriously, which is very endearing when it comes from one of those Hollywood types.
