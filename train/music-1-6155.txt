 What happened? A year ago it was Nine Inch Nails,Radiohead and Tool.Music that inspires has deptha nd explores new territory. A year later and look how far we have come. Rape rock. Self deluded meaningless middle school mentality poppy post alternative ki some gay ass go fu*k some bi*ches and pass me a beer hip hop rock. They sell records because the Mandy Moore crowd like them. If you are an MTV teeny bopper TRL supporter you will sell albums no matter how devoid of meaning and out and out slop your album really is. I'm tired of non talent getting the spotlight. A P erfect Circle and Radiohead both produced incredible albums and didn't get jack. But then again this industry has turned into product instead of depth. If you have any self respect and are a thinking and non woman hating human being who likes to think rather than watch Beavis and Butt Head, tune this crap out. Life is too short to be a dumb ass.
