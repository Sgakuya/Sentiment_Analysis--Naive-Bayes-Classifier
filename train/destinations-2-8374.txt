The most disappointing thing about my trip to Sun Studio was finding out that the microphone in the tour is not the original microphone Elvis used; as the studio advertises so frequently. In fact, Elvis Presley has never sang one note through that microphone. This is common knowledge amongst their employees apparently. The only real thing about the tour memorabilia is that the building is original and the Jerry Lee Lewis HAS played the studio piano before. Although, the piano is not original either. If you are a history buff you will enjoy this tour but don't believe the hype regarding the memorabilia. The microphone is a big lie.
