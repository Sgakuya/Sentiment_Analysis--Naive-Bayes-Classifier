Phenomenal! One of the top three PJ albums, definitely, up there with Vitalogy and Riot Act. Wishlist struck a nerve for me from the moment i firts heard it...if not for Nothingman, it would be my favorite song by the band. Do wish Mike McCready would do some more songwriting, after blessing us with Faithfull and Given To Fly. When I saw them live recently, Do The Evolution was performed...great song, great lyrics. Probably the most thoroughly enjoyable Pearl Jam album out there (as opposed to brilliant-but-screwed-up Vitalogy, dark Riot Act, and hostile-toned Vs.) and I love it. (And yeah, Wiggum, I knew the Mookie Blaylock story...Stone Gossard's obsessed with him, apparently...)
