This movie, based on the book by Stephen King, was in its own way a good movie. People who have read the book will say of course the book was better. But the fact is, the writers had to cut some things out or cut them down. There are a few parts where I think that the writers just wanted to get that part done with, but overall they were good in writing the script. Also, Damian Lewis, in my opinion, made a large part of the movie. He did an awesome job as Jonesy...and I have lots of respect and admiration for him. Throughout the movie he had to talk to himself in his normal English voice (though he made it sound a little crazy seeing as that voice was the voice of evil), and in his American-accented voice. The other actors also helped to make this movie entertaining for the public and the special effects were also good.
