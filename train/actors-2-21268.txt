Hilary Duff was okay when she did Lizzie McGuire and Lizzie McGuire only. I've seen the show, it was okay at best. It doesn't really deserve all those ripoff shows trying to copy it, though. The supporting actors should get the credit, though. They were far better actors and had more interesting characters than Duff. Lizzie McGuire became a big hit, and Hilary was swept up into the world of fame. So she started singing. That, I believe, is her biggest mistake. She doesn't write her own songs, nor do any of her songs have any variety. They're basically the same thing just with different words and to different music. Always about some crush and a boy. Once you've heard one, you've heard them all, and even then, you're likely to forget it in a day if you're not a Duff fan. Duff's later acting jobs have been substandard and forgettable. (I can barely recall the titles of the movies she's been in) Her movies have been cheesy or just plain silly, her acting has not improved since Lizzie McGuire. Hilary Duff's career relies too much, if not completely, on the success of Lizzie McGuire. If it wasn't for that one show, she would have no career at all. Her current one is flailing at best now, with competetors like Lindsay Lohan and as her current fanbase grows older and moves on to bigger and better things. Hilary Duff was a one-hit wonder. Lizzie McGuire was a hit, (but only because of the preteen appeal) and now she's fizzled out. Her time has passed. If she had just stuck to acting TV shows, she could've done better. But she tried to take on too much. Just because you're popular, doesn't mean you can sing, girl. And to the rest of you, stop this silly blamming of each other. We are here to give our own personal opinions, not berate those of others.
