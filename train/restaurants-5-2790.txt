As far as service goes, pretty much like all fast-food places: quick when the vererans are working, slow when you get trainee-night. But Hardees new $6 burger (that's just the name, not the price) is the BEST fast food burger, bar none. I've never eaten much Hardees because we have so many BK's Mc's around closer to my home. But I now drive several minutes further to get this new $6 burger! A REAL hamburger, with REAL fixings. Yum. I hope its not a limited-time thing, because its my favorite fast food stop. Oh, and I wish they'd bring back that pork chop sandwich. I liked it sans tomato, and sometimes ate them for lunch 3-4 times in one week!
