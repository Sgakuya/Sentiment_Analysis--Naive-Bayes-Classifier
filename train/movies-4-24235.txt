I would actually give it 3 and a half stars. First of all, my views are coming from someone who was/is a huge fan of the TV series and not a fan of the comic books. It wasn't quite what I expected. Some of it was better than I thought, some was worse. It was kind of the opposite of what I had been hearing it would be like. Some said that the CGI wasn't very good, not realistic - it was very realistic IMO; some said that the genesis story (origin) would be good, and it was (up to a point) it certainly was necessary but it was just too much! The movie was about 30 min. too long. It would be different if I was watching it at home but in a theater packed full of people... everyone was restless until the Hulk finally arrived. Hopefully the sequel will be less talk and more action but will people be willing to take that risk? I especially thought Nick Nolte's acting was too over-the-top. That would have been fine if only they had made it shorter. I thought that Eric Bana did a yery good job, and Jennifer Connelly was a perfect choice for Betty Ross (though I was disappointed to find out that the instance of nudity was not of her). Seriously though, one thing that I was really disappointed about was that Lou Ferrigno's cameo was too brief, and no lines! It was probably longer originally but they cut it. Also, according to the script, there were two times they had in mind for Bruce to say, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry but the only time that he says it in the movie is in Spanish. So it looks like, as far as I'm concerned, they cut out what they shouldn't have and didn't cut out what they should have. The scenes with the creature alone (except for the very last one) is worth seeing the movie but, I would recommend waiting to see it on DVD.
