I've only been to the one store in Elk Grove, CA. That store is big, immaculate, easily accessible and the employees are more than happy to approach and ask if you need help. I shopped monthly for a family of four and spent only $250 to $300 a month and stocked up. That is two overloaded carts of groceries. The produce was fresh, the deli food was great and there were items that not a lot of the more posh store carried. With everyone around us raising prices WinCo stayed low and the only thing I noticed was one time when the homeless people that the union paid to protest out front were sleeping on the walk. As I said I can't speak for all of the stores but if you're on HWY 99 around Sheldon road, definately go there to shop.
