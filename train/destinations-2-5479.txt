As somebody who has lived here their entire life, I have to say that Connecticut is a truly awful place to live. The taxes are insane, as are the gas prices. The state is also very overpriced to live in as well, with overexorbitant prices for a house that should've been demolished long ago. Most of the mid-sized and larger cities are cess-pools with numerous ghettos. The traffic is crazy no matter of what area or road you drive. The newscasters here are very high on this state too, I have no idea why, but I want what they're smoking. The weather here is crappy to, too much snow and cold in the winter, too much heat and humidity during the summer. The cost to own a car here are very high as well. Not only in gas prices, but also the car tax we have to pay year after year (based on falsified car values by the city), as well as high registration costs. Also the annoyance of UConn basketball fanatisism is quite tiring after a while. I live in the central part of the state which is very overcrowded, but the eastern part of the state is pretty nice, aside from the larger cities such as Willimantic and Norwich, and the casinos are a good daytrip, especially Foxwoods. These are CT's only saving graces, but otherwise the state is as lame as it gets. People who rate the state highly must never have lived (or even visited) here and are going on an idealized image of what they think Connecticut is like, when it is the total opposite. Cannot wait to get out of here.
