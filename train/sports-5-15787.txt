There are a few sure things in life. Death... Taxes... and Will Shields. Shields is a future Hall of Famer that has appeared in 10 consecutive Pro Bowls and played in 193 straight games (192 starts) at the time that I'm writing this. That's my definition of a sure thing. Shields is arguably the finest player at his position in the league today and is regarded by many as the NFLs finest offensive lineman, period (personally I like Willie Roaf just a shade more, but that's me). He's also a high-caliber person. He won the 2003 NFL Man of the Year award, an award that goes to players who are amazing on and off the field for charity work. This is usually an award given to surefire Hall of Famers. For example the three other Chiefs players to recieve this award are either in the Hall of Fame (Len Dawson, Willie Lanier) or will be (9-time Pro Bowler Derrick Thomas). Undeniably Shields is a terrefic pass blocker. However, he is most known for his ability as a pulling guard. With Shields as a lead blocker, counter plays and screens have become amongst the most devastating plays in the Chiefs offensive arsenal, one that has ranked amongst the top in the league for much of his career. He is one big reason why the Chiefs lead the NFL in total offense last season averaging over 400 yards a game.
