I drove a no frills '98 4x4. Its strengths included reliability (in my case): no major mechanical problems. It also had good acceleration, and well proportioned, usable storage space. On the other hand, it was a noisy, slightly uncomfortable vehicle for long rides, and it tended to have a disturbing fishtail effect around some turns. However, the price was so much lower than comparable vehicles, so I took the bad with the good, and in the end, I'm quite satisfied with the Cherokee... I'll also say this for it-- I had it out in 30 inches of snow, and it was plowing through and keeping up just fine with two other trucks, both raised two feet higher than the little Jeep.
