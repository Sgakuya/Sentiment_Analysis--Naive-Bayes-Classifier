Based on Maxwell Anderson's acclaimed Broadway stage play, this film features Patty McCormack, as Rhoda, and Nancy Kelly as her mother. Rhoda is a seemingly charming, fair-haired child, who manages to fool everyone. Well, almost! A poor employee at her home is not so easily fooled. The man teases Rhoda regarding his suspicions. He lets her know that there are electric chairs for child murderers. Blue ones for boys, and pink ones for girls. Rhoda registers this information without giving herself away. But clearly, the man has to be dealth with; and Rhoda has a solution. As her anguished mother gets closer to the truth regarding the first murder, Rhoda turns up the charm, considerably. And she has the firm support of a close relative, who is obviously under her spell. I won't reveal anymore. The fun is in finding out for yourself. Patty McCormack and Eileen Heckart were oscar-nominated in the supporting actress category;(They lost to Dorothy Malone, for "Written in the Wind"); and Nancy Kelly won a Best Actress nomination. (She lost to Ingrid Bergman,) for "Anastasia".
