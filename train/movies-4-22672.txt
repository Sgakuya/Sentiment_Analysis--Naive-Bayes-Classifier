personally the movie was good. but there was a few areas that were weak. being a big fan of the comic book and the cartoon i think they could of done a better job on doing some of the castng. i mean come on if u look at the cartoon and read the comic u'll see that storm is tough, she even beat scott with out her powers. the only thing shes afraid of is inclosed areas. and in the movie sabertooth. you do the thinking. then the part on how toad beat her like that. now if ur second in comand aren't u suppost to be strong and tough or is that my imagination. gee um aint she suppose to fly. i know why rogue didn't she hasn.t found out her fully power yet. i mean rogue hasn't taken ms. marvel's powers yet. WOLVERINE AND PROF.X was GREAT!magneto was good but please he needs to be in shape. so all in all the movie again was ok. WORK ON STORM HALLE!!! or geat some one else to play storm.but if u please PUT THEM BACK IN THEIR ORIGINAL COSTUMES.
