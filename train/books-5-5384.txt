This is a book rightly deserving of its colossal fame. It is both fast paced and educational, an unusual combination. Although some have complained that the writing style isn't of a particularly poetic and wordy nature I say: Ultimately which is more important, something that is 'literary' or something that makes damn good and compulsive reading? A novel's purpose is to entertain, and this book does that spectacularly. Also, for those who have read this book, but none of Dan Brown's less well-known works I can highly recommend the others. In fact 'Angels and Demons' may even be superior to 'The Da Vinci Code' - it's tough to separate them.
