This movie was just bad. Hell, they couldn't even make their own songs and the love story was just sooooo lame. Man they should have sent the money they used to make the movie to poor children in Laos or Kenya or whatever. And I'm talking the neckless Nicole Kidman wore: dude it didn't have to be real diamonds, no one would notice. No just after I watched it I got so pissed off because the songs were ripped off, the jokes weren't even a bit funny, the love story was really lame yet, (just a little comment about the story) Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregors characters were being really selfish. I mean go on and date, but don't ask duke for money then! They didn't have to lie like that. The only person I felt sorry for ( rligt talat ) was the Duke, cuz he was the jackass and they were using him. Oh my! When Satine was dying it was just like yawn! , you know. What can I say? The story was ripped off, the music was ripped off and oh... did I mention the story being ripped off? Jeesh! Two words: SUX BIGTIME! And for those of you who hasn't watched it yet, a little piece of advice: DON'T!!!
