Just in the last week, I had one friend who had a flight substantially delayed in perfect weather with no explanation from America West, and my wife had her America West flight cancelled -- again with no explanation and in perfect weather. On top of that, the America West representatives were rude and acted with no sense of urgency in trying to find my wife an alternative flight. The America West brain trust of desk personnel suggested an alternative flight arriving 2 hours after her America West flight, but, fortunately, my wife knew of another airline offering a flight that arrived 1 hour BEFORE her cancelled America West flight and she was able to suggest that flight to the brain trust and get on it. A third-rate airline all around.
