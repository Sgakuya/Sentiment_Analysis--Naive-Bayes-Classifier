Plain and simple, along with Pete's, Pyramid, SIerra Nevada, and Anchor Steam, this is America at its best. Complex, hoppy, malty balance brings out the best in Sam. Just when you think you are finished, your complex palate makes you go back to the fridge to grab another one. Bud and Coors fans, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE. Your palate will make you run out into the street. Leave this tantalizing malt and hops to us professionals. This is my favorite brewer of all time. Sam Adams has failed to make a bad beer in all of the recipes I have tried. Well, maybe the Cherry Wheat is aggressive, but it is STILL drinkable.
