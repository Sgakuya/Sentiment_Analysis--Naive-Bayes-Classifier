I have been recently very disappointed in Tim Hortons. I have been a very avid Tim Hortons consumer for many years. I would get a coffee and a muffin every morning until recently when the muffins have been tasting like they were freezer burned, not to mention the decrease in size. They now taste like they are frozen muffins purchased at a local grocery store. I have since quit going to Tim Hortons and have started going to a coffee shop that has very fresh baked goods. It is very disappointing to see Tim Hortons make a descision to pre-make all their muffins and doughnuts in Brantford Ontario then freeze them. They arrive at the store location where they are un-frozen and served. This goes against there slogan of many years. They have advertised ALWAYS FRESH which is no longer the case. It is too bad to see a company with such a good reputation take a turn for worst with a bad descision like this.
