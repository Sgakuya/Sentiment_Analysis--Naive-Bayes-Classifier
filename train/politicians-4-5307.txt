Al Gore and George W.Bush. Deciding the lesser of two evils is not easy. It seems to me as an 18 year old high school student that not only is voter apathy and the lack of knowledge of the presidential canidates disgusting, but is sad. I personally would like to see Al Gore become President because his opponent is a moron. I am sorry but George W. Bush is inadequate. You cannot slide through life on daddy's name, exhibiting poor performances in the military, school and a questionable performance in the business world, trading Sammy Sosa, and to top it all off create insidious untruths about your current political career. I live in Texas and the TAAS (State Test) scores, low drop-out rate and high-achool performance rates he tries to claim credit for have NOTHING to do with him. We are drilled for TAAS more than being taught the cirriculum needed for a good education. Furthermore, unlike other people my age I was in the two hour line to vote on November 7, not only did I vote for Al Gore, but I hung Vote Gore posters along the walls at my high school. EVERYONE in Texas says that Al Gore sucks, personally I trust the government of the greatest country in the world to a person who has not only been senator, but has been Vice-President for 8 years. George W. Bush may have charisma that Al Gore lacks on, but charisma does not run the economy or keep you out of war.Plain and Simple: he does not have the knowledge or the experience to lead this country on a steady track. The Clinton-Gore Administration may not have been great, but in I would rather have more of the peace time prosperity we've experienced in the past 8 years than the prosperity we had with Republican rule of Reagan and Bush.
