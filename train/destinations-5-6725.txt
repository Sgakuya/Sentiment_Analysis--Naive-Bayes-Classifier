There isn't a place on earth with Utah's varied geography and natural splendor. In some areas, within a 50 mile radius, one can visit a heavily pine tree-forest mountain with an elevation of 10,000 feet above sea level, travel to no less than two National Parks with canyons that are no less majestic than the Grand Canyon, visit a vast sand dunes area, and visit a Joshua Tree forest, then head out into open desert buttes and mesas some of which have miles of red rock and sand reminiscent of Martian landscapes. There is so much varied geography, within such a little diameter of miles, that it's pathetic. There may not be big cities in Utah or other attractions for for sheer natural wilderness and wilderness-related activities, it beats the hell out of 95% of every other state. You can't disagree with that, unless you're a dolt. Also, I really don't understand the anti-Mormon sentiment from other reviewers. I don't know of any people that have higher morals or better family values -which is all the more impressive and a shining light in today's society of waning morals, integrity, and family values. Why this would 'turn people off' is beyond...or shall I say 'below' my comprehension. The fact that you will encounter these types of people in Utah is all the more reason to visit this unique and awesome state, not reason to dislike Utah.
