If Mr Blair spent enough time on the domestic problems of the UK as he does on trying to be sincere about saving the world, then perhaps we would think more highly of him. American contributors. Don't be fooled that this man is a great leader. He may stand shoulder to shoulder with your warlord, but he has failed to honour a single promise he has made. The rise of crime and in particular, violent gun crime is a fear for every UK citizen. Blair and his muppets have tied the Police up in red tape to such a degree that anything they do to stem the tide is pissed on in the courts and we see repeat offenders walking free time after time. It has taken this muppet nearly 7 years to do anything about the immense numbers of illegal immigrants entering the country and what does he suggest to stop them? Fining them 500 and taking away their children! I'm sure there are going to massive lines of asylum seekers wanting to pay up. The man and his government are a joke.
