Hong Kong is definitely one of the cleanest cities I've been to -- people who said it's dirty must have gone there before the $1500 fine was imposed on littering. The MTR (underground, metro) is so chic! Stainless steel seats, flat screen plasma TVs...this city is obviously very rich! Make sure you get an Octopus card, which is like a semi-debit card and you can use it for the MTR, trains, airport-express, buses, ferries and even some shops and restaurants!! (London had come up with something similar but didn't really work out that well) The shops are fantastic -- some places are expensive, but if you're not into Gucci or Versace, most things are a lot cheaper than Europe/the US. Make sure you go to Central at night, as the architecture is simply amazing. Oh and I'm not a big fan of chinese food (yea i know, i'm a freak) though I ate so much in HK I felt like a goldfish... Great city, full of life, nice people...just go there!!!
