I own a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo equipped with the tried and true 4.0L I6. As of now no serious problems with over 90,000 miles. There's no secret to making the engine last. This has been a staple to Jeep. If your looking for a reliable long lasting vehcile, a straight six Jeep should be at the top of your list. And unlike many suburbanite Jeep owners, I actually utilize Jeep and its heritage by taking it off road and when ever 4X4 is truly needed. It's a dream off road, good low end torque, and superb traction. If you have heard horror stories about Jeeps, it's most likely because of the V8 powertrain. The V8 powertrain is all Dodge-Not Jeep. AWD Jeeps always have issues both with their diffentials and weak Chryler transmissions. The 4.0L Straight Six is such a good proven powertrain, that Mercedes-Benz(Daimler Chrysler) is slowely fading them out. Too GREAT and Proven for such a car company that likes complicating simple things. Only In A Jeep.
