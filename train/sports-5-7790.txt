I have never liked basketball my whole life neverless liking the NBA. Then one day while I was taking care of my mother I tuned in on the 2000 NBA Finals, and saw for the first time the Indiana Pacers and some guard named Reggie Miller. I couldn't believe my eyes then nor since; this man didn't stand a chance against Kobe or Shaq. But, there he was like some miracle or weird dream catapulting his team and even me to believing some how they could win. As we already know they didn't win the NBA Finals but, they did manage just for a minute in time to remind a girl to believe in miracles. I just went back to college after a ten year absence. See the Indiana Pacers even inspired me, yeah me to dream the impossible dream. So, for one dreamer to the next I hope Reggie Miller and his Pacers never stop looking for miracles. I've learned over the years it's not always about who finishs...but it's about the courage to finish the race!......PERIOD!
