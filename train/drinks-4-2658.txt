It is strange to read about coffeemakers and programs when the real question is the coffee flavor. IF a person gets in a coffee delivery program because they like the coffeemaker, you are bound to be dissatisfied even if the coffee is good. The likelihood of getting an excellent coffee maker free is as good as finding a wining lottery ticket abandoned in the street. Nothing is free in this life and most registration gifts will not be made in the US or Sweden but in some obscure manufacturing place in Malaysia or Taiwan. That said, I was in the Gevalia program for a few years and found it a great source for tasting different types of coffees from all over the world. Some were very good some were not. At the end, once the attraction of experimentation was gone, you start thinking about the price and find out that it is a bit expensive to keep it up. It is good coffee and worth drinking, but if you have a trusty dedicated coffee store in your neighborhood you will be hard pressed to justify buying Gevalia. A good level of flavor and balance with bitterness, great variety and their special selection program allows you to try a great variety of coffees. High priced though.
