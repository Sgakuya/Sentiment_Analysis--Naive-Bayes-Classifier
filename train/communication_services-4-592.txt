I drive a truck in the construction industry, hauling aggregate materials [rock, sand, hot asphalt etc.] in and around the Northern California [Sacramento and Bay areas], and with a few exceptions, the worst of which is the broken coverage areas on the freeways to the Bay area, and in the foothills and mountains going towards Reno and South Lake Tahoe, and the various dead spots in and around town, which They claim will be fixed when new towers are added to the system. Other than that, I've been satisfied with their service to the point that I have disconnected my home phone and use my cel exclusivley. Customer service [if you get lucky enough to get someone that speaks clear and un-broken' english has been o.k.
