Well, maybe Dubya comes across as a dumb bunny, but I can honestly say that Igore did not impress me as anything better. Both their daddies held high political office; both came from privilege; both are smarmy and spoiled in their own way. It was close for a while, but in the end, my decision actually boiled down to who was disgusting me the least at the time and the one I personally thought was the lesser of the two evils in general. Face it folks - we had relatively NOTHING to choose from! Actually, either of the two VP candidates seemed to have more on the ball. Better luck next time - with the selection process as well as the selection.
