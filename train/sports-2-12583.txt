Isn't it funny how EVERYBODY says the same thing about Florida Football - what a loser schedule, year-after-year. OK so the SEC has a couple of good teams (as all conferences do), but what about the other 3-4 games. Go back and look at the Gator's non-conference year-after-year. Yes they play FSU, but after that its a bunch of high school teams - and guess what, they are going to do it again in 2001 - this year they play Luoisiana Monroe (!!!!!), Marshall, and New Mexico (OUCH). Add that to Vandy, Kentucky, and Arkansas, and I can't explain WHY WOULD ANYONE GO TO THOSE GAMES. Hey Spurrier - What Me Worry???
