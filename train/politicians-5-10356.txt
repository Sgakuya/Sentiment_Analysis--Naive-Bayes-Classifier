Best president ever. He's got the tenacity to get the stuff done, unlike so many other well-meaning, but unassertive conservatives. His courage and dignity is unsurpassed. He knew what kind of heat he would take for appointing John Ashcroft. He knew the press would tear such a devout Christian apart......but he did the right thing and brought him on anyway. And he also has never failed to back down from his values in mentioning his Christian convictions and principles in any of his national addresses. In other words, he won't back down from what he knows is right and that's exactly what America needs in the whitehouse. And now he's cleaning up after that ass of a president we used to have by bringing honor and integrity back to the whitehouse and America in general and by finally doing something about the evil, civilian-murdering, America-hating, terrorist-supporting middle east. I think the people protesting this war are just the same cry babies that protested when he WON the presidential election; and they're probably still just sore over that, not taking into account any real truth behind what's actually going on with the war in general. And as for blaming a bad economy on George W., first of all the economy is not in as bad of shape as the liberal media would have everyone to believe, and second, any significantly detrimental factors effecting the US economy that may or may not exist are more than likely backlashes of that past 8 year long mockery of the presidency, don't you think? Anyway Bush is doing a fantastic job. Respect his courage, morals, and integrity; support the war against this evil nation, support our troops, and finally, just let the man run the country.
