A very deep, complex read with equally challenging characters. The central theme of the whole book is that without free will and choice, man loses his humanity, thus society becomes very deterministic in nature, which is what the clockwork orange symbolizes. Free will is what's needed to maintain our humanity and individuality. What Burgess sets out to analyze through the character Alex is the utilitarian notion of the harm principle, which as set forth by John Stuart Mill states that any action is permissible so long as it doesn't harm anyone else. It is clear that Alex's immoral acts against others is harmful to society at large, so the big question becomes is it better to permit a negative form of free will, since goodness is authentic only if it's chosen and not imposed upon by authority. Throughout the entire book, there is a tendency to criticize authority and socialism as well. Imposing discipline won't change man's environment. Just as man is capable of great good, so is he capable of doing great harm. Such evil cannot be rationalized away. Alex says that he likes doing evil simply because it feels good. That's why centralization of authority, from fascism to communism has led to so much great evil. Burgess really focuses in on the role of state propaganda and mind control, which makes the public complacent of a government's actions. In the case of mass society, the indoctrination is much more passive; with Alex, they are forcing him to believe in something which he doesn't believe in. The goons who are trying to make Alex into a good citizen are actually no better than Alex and his friends. Through original sin, the evil act itself chose us, not the other way around, therefore the world is a bad place, and temptation will always be a problem. The conclusion: man can over time reduce the effects of this highly deterministic original sin by choosing goodness over evil.
