I went to ozzfest back in 2000, near albany unfortunately it was right around when the pearl jam incident happened and security was extra tight, so there was no moshing, and they didn't let anyone get near the stage-or leave their seats,once seated... But I will say this... as far as a show... the lineup was great, there was pantera,godsmack,static-x,incubus, and more. Pantera blew the show away. They got ya worked up and Phil by far is the best at working a crowd.Ozzy came out, and being as Ozzy is from my time, it was great,and you can't help but admire the man, but I am not sure the show was all that good. Ozzy was having a lot of fun squirting people..especially his own security with a power hose. The reception for the man was unparrallel.I was up near the front and I looked behind me and everyone was freaking out when he came up out of his chair. First time all day my husband enjoyed himself...he can be a bit of an old fart but you also have to realize Ozzy is the only music he recognized all day long. I had been into a majority of the bands for quite a while. I liked Incubus but the show was mediocre,I really expected a bit more from Static-x since I loved the album I had of theirs, but really watching the show wasn't much more than just listening to the album.If I had another chance to see an Ozzfest, I would go in a heartbeat, and leave my husband behind:)
