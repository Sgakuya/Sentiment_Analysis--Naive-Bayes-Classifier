Salma's gorgeous I realize that but she's also talented and intelligent. If you like her then learn about her and look at all the hard work she's put into to seeing her dream film Frida completed. I don't believe Salma ever wanted to be the bombshell she's gotten the reputation for in movies. But you take the roles you're offered if you're a struggling actress and no one has opened doors for you. You just make the most of the opportunities you get. No, no don't cry her a river Salma's not complaining she's making things happen for herself now little by little. The truth is most of her true fans don't even know the truth about Salma. However, I read an interesting comment about Salma at one of the other message boards on this site someone said that Salma was ethically moral hmmm fans and detractors alike will never understand how true that comment was and sadly don t seem to care.
