McDonalds is cheap, so you can't really expect the food to be that great. They have shrimp-sized hamburgers and rubber chicken. However, their fries are the best fries in the world! You can't beat McFries! McDonalds also has great shakes, especially their egg nog shakes they sell in December. The apple pies are good, but they were better when they used to fry them. All in all, that gets McDonalds about 2 or 3 stars, but it doesn't end there. McDonalds has GREAT breakfasts! The best is the famous hotcakes and sausage! The hotcakes might not be as good as homemade, but they're much better than frozen pancakes. The sausage is even better than you could cook them! They also have delicious apple danishes and cinnamon rolls, although not perfect--they're sometimes cold, sometimes warm, sort of hit-or-miss. They're good heated in a microwave though, if you bring it home. They also have good McMuffins, and they make their hashbrowns just as good as their fries... who ever knew a funny-shaped hashbrown-nugget thing could taste better than homemade hashbrown? It does, seriously! The price is excellent, especially with all their extra value meals. It's cheap to eat, and at breakfast, a wonderful experience.
