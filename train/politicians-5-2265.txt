I think Mr. Powell makes just about a perfect Sec. of State. He is a war veteran, wounded and much decorated at that, a scholar, a diplomat first class and an American that honors and respects the Office of the President of the United States. I believe that many of the people dismissing Mr. Powell in this forum should have to discover what the lack of freedom to express themselves feels like. The freedoms we enjoy come from the sacrifice and humility of people who serve, not people who complain and do not contribute. It is people like Mr. Powell, who dedicate their lives in service to America and honor their fellow citizens with that service who deserve our total respect. If it were not for such men this country could possibly be permanently in the grip of one or more of the forces that have always opposed us.
