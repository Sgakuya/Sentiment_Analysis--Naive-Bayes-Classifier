John Wayne must have been very happy when this shovelhead came along, in that there was at least one actor in Tinseltown with less talent than The Duke. Heston was totally wooden, histrionic or unbelieveable in virtually very single role he disgraced. Totally undistinguished screen debut in Dark City. Absolutely laughable as Vargas in Touch of Evil. Unrelentingly stilted, yet self-impressed in those dreadful Biblical epics that just make you want to vomit. If all this wasn't bad enough, the old douchebag became an ultra apologist for the rightwing twerps after he was washed up in Hollywood, most notably with that death-worshipping and carnage-affirming criminal conspiracy known as the NRA. Every time you see a news story on TV about some armed-to-the-teeth loser going postal or some armed-to-the-teeth child shooting up his teachers and fellow students, you have, in large part, the NRA and Numbnut Heston to thank, folks. This guy, so sanctimonious and self-righteous (must have taken his crappy Biblical roles too seriously, friends), actually has blood on his hands, like it or not. But the droolers are in total denial, decrying the messages sent out by supposed liberal Hollywood, but quick to put up as conservative icons, as exemplars of What's Right With America irresponsible violence-purveyors and death-glorifiers like Heston, Stallone and that positively horrible Schwartzennegger.
