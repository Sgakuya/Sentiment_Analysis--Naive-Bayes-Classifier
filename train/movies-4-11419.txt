I would give this an almost four. It is about a 17 yr old girl who is going through this goth stage. She has pretty much ostracized herself from everyone. She gets a job at a men's clothing store where a middle aged man works {played by Albert Brooks} works. he is sort of a quiet bit of a boring kind of person. they strike up a friendship. then the sad part happens when he turns out to be dying. [sorry to give away a spoiler} She helps him out by finding a long lost relative. Toward the end she changes a little and starts to allow others in her life. there is some pretty good acting. Albert Brooks plays a different character than he ususally plays.
