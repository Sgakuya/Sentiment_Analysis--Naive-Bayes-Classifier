Just because I feel sorry for some of the people in New York does not mean I am required to give it some superhuman rating. New York is an okay place to live, but just like Kentucky, the personality here could improve. And also, they provided us with a good baseball team. Mike Pi(a)zza is a NY stereotype in one person. Snobby with their nose four miles up in the air. But they aren't all damnyankees. I mean, my two favorite reviewers on this whole darn site are from New York. And I (sigh) ALSO have to add the fact that New York gave us Art Garfunkel. Rock stars again. So I have to love them for that. Overall, New York is a nice place, but Hoochie makes a point when he says it is overrated. I think the same thing, so I give it four stars.
