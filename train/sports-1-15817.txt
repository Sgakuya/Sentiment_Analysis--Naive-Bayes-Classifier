i cannot believe warren sapp compares himself to being a slave owned by the league. playing football in the nfl is a job. nothing more, nothing less. i hear his disappointment in the way he is being treated by the league commissioners. well warren, if your unhappy in your job, get another job, or transfer. you make millions of dollars a year. you are famous and infamous in this great nation. try finding another job making that kind of money playing a sport that you love. i don't think it is possible mr sapp. look at the rest of the world and see how good you have it. just play football and keep your big mouth shut. your very disrespectful to your co-workers and the rest of america. you have more opportunities than 95 percent of america. i don't want to hear your crying about justice. you are treated more than fare. when police, school teachers, firemen and nurses make $35,000 a year for working 40 to 60 hours a week for 50 weeks out of the year and i hear warren sapp complain about justice makes my skin crawl. warren get a real job then tell us about injustices. go on a diet and shut your mouth. play ball
