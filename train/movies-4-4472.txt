My family has begun a new tradition for Christmas Eve. We venture out to dinner and then a movie together. This year we selected this film. Having read the book I was interested in the way they would thread the original text through the film. Cindy Lou Who's character is greatly enlarged in this version, but then it is appropriate to the story line. She is the main bearer of the message that you are left with at the end. Yet even more magnificent,and what I did not expect, was to be enthralled by was the set and costumes used to tell the tale. What a wonderful job! I would love to watch it again to study the settings etc. I also loved the little dog. Hard to believe that they found him in a pound. This film has a real message for all to see. I hope it becomes a Christmas Clasic in years to come. As an added note - when my family left the theatre that night and walked to the car we saw a shooting star. Perhaps it was heralding the birth of a new king of Christamas films. Or perhaps, since it was Christmas Eve it was simply the Grinch delivering presents. :)
