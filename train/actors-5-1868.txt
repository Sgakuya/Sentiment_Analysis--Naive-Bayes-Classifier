Okay, okay. Enough with the girls thinking he's the sexiest man alive. Not to be rude, but in case you didn't notice, this is for 'acting'. Not looks. If you want a 'looks' category, then by all means, ask the rateitall owners for one. Good luck in that. I can't even get a single man's name on the actors list...(sarcasm doesn't help, dol, remember that) Sorry, just talking to myself. Anyway, I do think that Johnny Depp is a great actor, thanks, mainly, to Pirates of the Caribbean. It's so hard to relate the 'Jack Sparrow' character from the one he played in Edward Scissorhands, which only adds on to the broadness of people he can play. He's a very talented man and I don't mean to typecast him but I anxiously await the sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean.
