Anthony Hopkins has to be one of the most talented actors of our time. I haven't seen many of his movies, but the few I have seen show that he is a man of extreme depth and range. He selects his roles carefully, and prepares well for them. He gave one of the most chilling performances in Hollywood history as Dr. Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs and its two successors, Hannibal and Red Dragon. No other actor could've captured the audience as well as Hopkins did in that role. His presence in that movie was awesome- he performed so naturally, and the end result was one of the most memoriable performances of our time. One of Anthony Hopkins' other performances, while certainly not as good, was as President Richard Nixon in the Oliver Stone film Nixon. While Hopkins was unable to capture the Nixon Look, I must say that overall, he played the part quite well. It is quite obvious that Anthony Hopkins prepared heavily for that role, and he took it very seriously. The end result was impressive, and I enjoyed his performance. In the final analysis, Sir Anthony Hopkins is certainly one of the most talented actors of our time. He takes his work very seriously and prepares heavily for his roles, and the end result is always the same: a brilliant performance from a fine actor.
