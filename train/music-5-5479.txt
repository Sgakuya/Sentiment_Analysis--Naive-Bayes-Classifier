This album came from nowhere...at times its slow and powerful, quick and jazzy at others, it is really something totally original.Perhaps the most overlooked thing about this incredible first Sabbath album is that while it was made on a shoe string budget($1200)and was done in 2 days, it has by far the cleanest recording done at that time(1969),for example look at the Beatles,the Who or the Rolling Stones in 69'-their albums sound accoustically dead when compared to the first Black Sabbath album. I play in a band with a rather large PA system, whenever this CD(album)is played I have to bring all the high frequencies way down-the clarity is stunning...not to mention the musical content itself,its also interesting to note Ozzy's voice was nearly baritone on certain songs of this album,which in my opinion has a much better quality to it when compared to later Sabbath albums and of course his solo crap.I must also pay respect to Terry Geezer Butlers playing on this and all Black Sabbath albums, he is by all rights more of a progressive bassist then a simple rock bassist and I think his energy and style are not easily duplicated...not to mention he wrote nearly all the old lyrics
