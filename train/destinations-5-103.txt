Bangkok is awesome. I have been there twice. The first time was in June 1998. We took the train from Kuala Lumpur. My husband and I stayed in the Kaosan Road area. It is a well-know area to backpackers but we were well into our 50's at the time and felt right at home. The temples are truly awesome and the Reclining Buddha has to be seen to be believed. We also enjoyed taking the river boats that are part of the city's transportation system. You have to be quick getting on and off as the boatmen don't waste any time pulling in and pulling out of the piers. We took a great day trip to Ayutthaya, the old capital, and the Summer Palace. It was totally worthwhile even though we travelled in a hot and dusty mini-bus. My husband and I both had massages while we were there. The price is right and the service is wonderful. We also left by train to Ko Samiu. The second time was in March 2004. I was at a conference and stayed at a 5 star hotel. I had a sweeping view of the river from my balcony and was treated to a fireworks display right outside my window. Both times I found the shopping to be great. If you bargain well you can get some great Thai silk garments at a great price.
