Her hair is red, her eyes are cold, and her acting is mediocre. There is just something about Nicole Kidman that annoys me. I watched Eyes Wide Shut and though she did have her moments, most of it was blah or merely okay. But I also watched Practical Magic and I see that with enough make up and an incredible co-star like Sandra Bullock, maybe she can be an almost-decent actress. I prefer to not watch Moulin Rouge because I hear some people were converted to liking her and I want to keep my idols real, not superficial. I don't mean to offend anybody but this is my honest opinion on her and it has nothing to do with Tom. Although, I do think she deserves some pity for being thrown aside for the beautiful Penelope Cruz.
