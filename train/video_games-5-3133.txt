FFX-2 is epic in scope, daunting in re-playability, presents more genuinely tactical situations for varying battles, presents beautifully colorful landscapes for the eye and most evidently of all in what seems to have become a standard in gaming these days: it stars a trio of attractive women in curiously skimpy outfits. The most light-hearted fantasy offering yet, its more non-linear, female-oriented (or male oriented, depending on your point of view) story-line is a marked departure from previous outings and may disappoint purists, but so far I've found it to be quite endearing as well as addictive which is of course what the Final Fantasy series is all about.
