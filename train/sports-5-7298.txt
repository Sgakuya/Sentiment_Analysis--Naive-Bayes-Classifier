He's in my Top 5 as one of my All-Time All-Star team (he's one of my forwards). As great as he was on the Sixers, he was actually a bit past his prime. Had you seen him in the ABA with the old Virginia Squires and Nets, he was un-freakin'-believable. Counting his ABA stats, I think is the #3 all-time scorer. The first time I saw him was in the early '70s in what was called the ABA-vs-NBA Supergame (which they played twice and lived up to the billing both time). We were all mesmerized by Julius taking the ball from the top of the key and leaping in for a slam dunk over two defenders. I never saw anything like it. In my watching sports for 35+ years of my life, nothing got me more excited and electrified than seeing Dr. J steal the ball and go in for an uncontested slam dunk. He also could do those geometry-defying finger rolls from behind the basket that would kiss the glass and go right in the hoop. To contend the point of a previous poster, the Doctor was probably the most complete player I ever saw, who could shoot inside, shoot outside, pass, rebound, block shots, and strip you clean. He was also very articulate, a true gentleman on the court, and a great leader. I feel bad that he has had some personal troubles of late (though I must say that Alexandra Stevenson is a specimen). If you had to ask me who my favorite athlete was, I'd choose the good doctor.
