I am a recent Cornell Graduate (May 2002) and I would like to say that Cornell is the best school out there pound for pound. That comment about the SAT scores just shows you really have no knowledge of what it takes ot make it in college. I turned down other schools with much higher SAT averages to go here and hve not regretted it for a second. I know many who did not do to well on the SAT who made quite an impact in some very tough courses and then went on to do quite well on graduate admissions tests (so much for your theory). In regards to the suicide rate do you research read more than one person's opinion check this link if you are too lazy to og look yourself http://www.cornelldailysun.com/articles/1734/. I find it amusing so many people hate on Cornell I guess that means were doing something right. The REAL CU BABY!!! Any other school is just a joke.
