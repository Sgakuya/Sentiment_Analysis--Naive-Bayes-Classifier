This is a very important expansion for the sims, because it lets your sims get out of the house.They can invite friends,spouse, or take a family outing to dinner, shopping, video arcade, even a park and swimming.If you can only get 1 expansion, this should be it. One thing I didn't like about it and the reason I give it a 4 is because your sims have to be fully charged in order to go downtown. Then like with a majority of sims the time is out of proportion in that a person eats dinner, has to go to the bathroom so bad they're practically peeing themselves (sometimes do pee themselves) and then are so totally exhausted after eating and peeing that they must go home to sleep. I mean really this is the worst part of it. I don't know about you but I could go to a movie, shop, buy lots of clothes, sit down and eat... maybe use the bathroom once, and it's not drastic, go home and still kick it and watch some tv or do woohoo before hitting the hay.
