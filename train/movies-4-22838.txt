 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is definitely worth seeing in the theater. I was blown away by J.K. Rowling's incredible imagination and her ability to step into a child's mind. The special effects are spectacular, and there are delightful surprises sprinkled throughout the show. My only complaint is that the movie focused primarily on boys and reinforced boy/girl stereotypes to a certain degree, which I suppose is no big surprise. It was very annoying, for example, when Harry Potter broke the rules on one occasion and then again with his sidekick, and the behaviors were rewarded. On the other hand, when the main female character (Hermione) did the same, she was punished. Hermione was initially portrayed as an uptight, goody-two-shoes sort who got by because she studied compulsively, whereas Harry Potter was just naturally talented. Finally, most of the other children in the movie were boys. I appreciated the way that Hermione emerged as a stronger character as the movie progressed, though. On a final note, I think this movie is appropriate for very mature second-graders and up. I definitely wouldn't take young children to see it due to many scary scenes and the length of the show (about two-and-a-half hours).
