My daughter and i went to see this yesterday at the matinee. including us there were about 15 people there. since it was about noon on a tuesday. there were only three children present the rest of us adults. I point this out because i really believe this is movie that even adults can like. we both found it quite enjoyable. there are a couple scenes that may be more fun for children like the food throwing scene. a sweet movie that is really in the way of a fairy tale book you would read. { i guess it originally is based on some books written years ago about a nurse} Takes place in the late 1800s or early 1900s. A widower must find a nanny to help take care of his children. so far the kids naughty behavior has chased away 17 nannies. Enter nanny McPhee, she is magical but Mary Poppins she is not. she can do magic with her walking cane but she also encourages the children to problem solve themselves. the side plot is the father is being financed by an eldery aunt who has informed him he must remarry by the end of the month or she will stop all finances and the children will be separated and fostered out or put in work houses. so nanny Mcphee helps the children to figure out what to do to stay together and get a new step mom. very sweet movie. the kids are cute. Emma Thompson is great as Nanny McPhee.
