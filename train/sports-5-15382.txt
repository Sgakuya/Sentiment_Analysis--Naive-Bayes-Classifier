Manning and Brady are easily the two best QB's in the NFL at the moment. Manning set the single season TD record last year, has thrown for over 30k yards in just 8 seasons- passing for over 4k each of the last 7 years. His career td to int ratio is around 2:1, has a completion percentage close to 65% and is one of the best clock managers in the game. Peyton's ability to get rid of the ball quickly makes him very tough to sack and as skills at quarterback open up the running game. Yes, he hasn't won the big one of yet, but he's also been hampered by never having the home field advantage or ever having a bye week in the playoffs despite going 28-8 over the last two seasons. With the advent of a dominating defense you'd be hard pressed to find a better team, with a more explosive weapon than the Colts and Peyton.
