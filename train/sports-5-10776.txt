I am amazed to read some of the past negative comments on Frank Beamer...By no means can this man be judged by his first years at Virginia Tech and say that his recent success is just a spoof. I submit that Frank Beamer is the architect of a great football program that he had to build from the ground up. When he started, no one had heard of Virginia Tech and now we are a household name. On ESPN they can say Blacksburg and not have to associate it with Virginia or Virginia Tech like they had to during Michael Vick's first year. We won the ACC during our first year in the conference when everyone picked us to finish at the bottom. Sure we have had some off the field problems with some players, but you don't have to look far in the ACC to find good coaches, like Bobby Bowden and Larry Coker, that have had to deal with similar situations. Our success on the football field has been trending upward for some time and we have Frank Beamer to thank for that.
