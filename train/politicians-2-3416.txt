Little can be said for this president except that his corruption in regards to oil are obvious and detrimental to our country, that he is destroying the economy and favoring the rich far too much to make anything good happen, that he is destroying the environment, taht he absolutely can't do impromptu speaking at all (because he is a nightmare in public speaking...lucky for him he has a great speech writer...but unlucky for all of us who have to sit through his speeches and watch him read word for word at the pace of a sixth grader), is unable to come to grips with his mistakes (how beneficial is consistency when he is consistent in error???), that he is on the verge of destroying the separation of church and state, that he has an unrealistic view of the war in Iraq and won't come to the realization that we need more troops over there, that he let Osama bin Laden go when we literally had men who had him in the sights of their guns at one point, that he is sending our jobs overseas at an incredible pace....I could go on, but I think everyone gets the point.
