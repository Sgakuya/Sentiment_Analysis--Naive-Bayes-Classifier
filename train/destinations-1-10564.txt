I have found that everytime I smoke these, at least after I smoke a FULL pack, I am left with an awful cold that lasts for appx. a week! I am beginning to think it's more of a lung infection. This only happens when I smoke P's. My normal brand is Marl. Lights and this doesn't ever happen! I wonder if I could be allergic to P's??? Anyone have any idea? Also, for those of you posting crap about cigs causing cancer, go post that shit somewhere else. Why would you visit a site rating cig taste, etc. and post that? You think smokers are morons? Well you are a bigger moron coming to a site like this to spread your filth.
