Once again, I do not live in Arkansas and am merely judging on what I have read of Mike Huckabee's policies as the Governor of Arkansas. Since becoming Governor, Mike Huckabee has been a strong advocate of education reform. He has helped to create one of the best accountability programs in the region. He has helped to extend thea vailable of college scholarship and led to the creation of charter schools cross Arkansas. Huckabee claims that he believes that everyone who can work should work, and this is reflected in that Arkansas' welfare rolls have decreased by over 50% since he assumed office. Huckabee fought for the establishment of a Property Taxpayers Bill of Rights. Most importantly, Huckabee has brought tax relief to thousands of Arkansas residents by pushing through the most broad-based tax cuts in state history. While doing this, Huckabee still managed to create ARKids First, which since 1996 has helped bring health insurance to thousands of children previously uninsured. He has fought to control government spending and is a strong advocate of returning tax dollars to the people of Arkansas. One of Huckabee's most important actions as Governor of Arkansas was fighting for the authorization of a broad, wide-range renovation program for Arkansas' less-than-stellar interstate highway system. Hopefully, when the construction is finished, Arkansas will have better roads. I for one have traveled through Arkansas and find the condition of 80% of their roads to be absolutely ridiculous. However, it seems that Governor Huckabee is looking to fix that problem. In the final analysis, I believe that Huckabee has brought to Arkansas a positive attitude and has initiated many programs which have benefited the citizens of Arkansas, most notably the ARKids First Program and his tax cuts.
