Rowland and Taft pale in comparison to this guy in terms of corruption and ethics violations. No governor in recent memory was as corrupt as George Ryan. The man built his career on corruption, and went out disgraced amidst revelations of his various indiscretions, including illegally selling truck driver's licenses to unqualified people while Secretary of State -applicants who couldn't speak English, who supplied fake addresses and who passed the test only because they had been given the answers. While in office, he failed to keep check on the state's budget, resulting in a huge fiscal mess that his successor had to deal with. A true moderate Republican, like Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut, who could have accomplished great things. Ultimately, his shortcomings forced him to forego running for another term as Governor and destroyed his legacy, which was actually beginning to reflect a thoughtful and balanced governor capable of examining both sides of an issue and coming to a reasonable decision.
