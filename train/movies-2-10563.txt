It's kind of frightening that some people on this site gave this movie five stars. RateItAll should think about barring them from the site because they lose all credibility when they do stuff like that. I didn't have high expectations before seeing this film and that's a good thing because this movie is bad - very bad. The plot is unbearably predictable and the script could have been written by a junior high student. The only things keeping it from receiving one star are a few moderately funny lines from the wirey kicker and speedy receiver and the great-looking Brooker Langton. Keanu is pathetic and Gene Hackman needs to pick his scripts better. Don't waste your time.
