I really enjoyed reading Circle of Friends. I have yet to see the movie, however I had Minnie Driver in my minds' eye as I read since she played Benny in the movie. An interesting and complex look into what seem to be simple lives at first appearance. Binchy brings us in to discover how all of these lives are somehow connected, she illustrates the joy and sadness of growing up and the strength of friendship. Most of all, we are with Benny as she questions life, is insecure and somewhat naive. This friendship between Eve and Benny that formed in childhood is clearly resilient. Binchy has a wonderfully descriptive style that made this an easy read.
