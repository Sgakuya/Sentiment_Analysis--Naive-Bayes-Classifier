Last week I bought an HDTV, I called Comcast to find out about getting HD service and was pleasantly surprised to learn about their Video On Demand service and Dual Tuner DVRs. The HD box that I got also enables the On Demand content and there are thousands of hours of content stored that you can watch for free - my kids love the Kid and Teens category. Anyway, the installer showed up right on time. She (yep she) showed me how to work the DVR and since I had a single tuner TIVO unit, she took that out of my AV system and hooked it up to an older TV in my basement. I love the DVR for ABC/NBC/CBS shows, and the VOD shows from the cable networks. The installer also asked how my internet service was doing (no problems) and told me that Comcast was going to get into the phone business. I can't wait to dump Verizon. 4 Years ago they made me wait 2 weeks for an installation appointment and then didn't show up - they suck. I was thinking about getting a satellite dish, but now that I have the Video On Demand, there is no way I will leave Comcast.
