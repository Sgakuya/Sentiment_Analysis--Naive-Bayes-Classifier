Almost no skill as an actor really- ham-fisted and very wooden. I personally don't agree with his politics at all, but as for his ability - put it this way: it wouldn't matter if he was the head of the Weathermen or the Symbionese Liberation Army- or the Grand Dragon of the KKK or head of the John Birch Society, because let's face it, he sucks! As for his movies, he's one of those lousy actors who nevertheless made a few very good films, like Touch of Evil, the original Planet of the Apes, and the uninentionally hilarious, over the top, 10 Commandments, where he was outshined by Brynner and Edward G. Robinson.
