Though the narrator of the novel was not a Christian, God used the viewpoint presented to strengthen me in the faith. I think that, because we are human, we try to find reasons for the horrible things that happen in life. Though the narrator realized man cannot find a reason for the sorrows of life, Camus also shows through Paneloux that the Christian has hope in trusting that God does understand, and that God loves us. At first Paneloux attempted to find the reason by blaming others, similar to Job's friends in the Bible, but he realized even the innocent die. Okay, enough of that. There isn't much of a plot in The Plague, but that means little when the reader actually reads the book as it is meant to be read. Camus is highly detailed--his imagery is absolutely beautiful. Also, the small mannerisms, eye contact, and minute details (such as the cat in the street) all support one of the themes. A person cannot go throughout life worried about the threats that exist, but rather, should treasure every moment. Even the small things in life are precious. Camus does a wonderful job of portraying this. I could type more and more, but I feel I've written enough--perhaps too much. :)
