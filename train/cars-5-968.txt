I'm really satisfied with my new Honda Accord. Although I've only had it for a week, I feel completely comfortable driving it. I bought the Accord because of its safety and reliability records, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it also handles very well, has a smooth ride, and gets great gas mileage. I was amazed to find out that the first major service comes at 105,000 miles! Paying a bit more for the EX model is worth it, in my opinion, because it includes the lumbar support (the driver's seat in the LX is very uncomfortable, in my opinion), keyless remote entry, radio controls in the steering wheel, and a sunroof. If you're looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable, safe, reliable sedan, I don't think you could do better than the Accord.
