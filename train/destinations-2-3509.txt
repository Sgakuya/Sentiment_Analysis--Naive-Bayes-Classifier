The nice thing about Ottawa is the Ottawa River. Largly ignored by the people of the city, the Ottawa is majestic and is one of the great rivers of North America. Almost primordial in it's appearance, it spills over two cataracs as it makes it journey to the St. Lawrence. Ottawa has treated it's namesake river with total indifference and disregard, and if the river were an entity, I am sure it feels the same way about it's namesake city. There is also the Rideau River and canal. Interesting, but lack the majesty of the Ottawa. As for the city - it has got to be one of the most boring Western Capitals there is, with some of the most tedious boring people I have ever come across.
