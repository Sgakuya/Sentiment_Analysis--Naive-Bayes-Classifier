 Clairi res dans le ciel Song cycle by Lili Boulanger (1893-1918) and selected songs by Franz Schubert (1797-1828) and Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) - Wiebke Hoogklimmer, Contralto - Patrick Walliser, Piano (order-number THOROFON CTH 2477 / THOROFON is a label of BELLA MUSICA EDITION, GERMANY). Lili Boulanger was the younger sister of Nadia Boulanger, the famous teacher of composition. She died in 1918 when she was just 24 years old. In 1914 she composed the song cycle Clairi res dans le ciel ( Clearings in the Sky ) for soprano or tenor which I transposed for the alto voice, retaining the proportions of keys, and with theses different keys the songs acquire a whole new timbre, of course. The piano part is very exacting, because Lili Boulanger must have already had a conception of a later orchestration in her mind, while she was composing the songs. She managed to orchestrate 8 of the 13 songs, after all, and created wonderful timbres for them. Clairi res dans le ciel belongs musically to French Impressionism. The song cycle's content is similar to that of Schubert's Winterreise and Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen . The songs deal with the unrequited love for a young girl and the subsequent longing for death. Lili Boulanger deals differently with this topic at the Fin de si cle in Paris than the two german speaking composers. To keep this connection I have combined Lili Boulanger's song cycle with selected songs by Schubert and Mahler for this CD. The exact content is: Franz Schubert (1797-1828): Geheimes / Der Einsame / Der Musensohn / Die Taubenpost / Der Doppelg nger - Gustav Mahler (1860-1911): Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt / Das irdische Leben / Nicht wiedersehen! / Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen - Lili Boulanger (1893-1918): Clairi res dans le ciel (13 songs on poems by Francis Jammes) - Detailed informations about Wiebke Hoogklimmer and the pianist you will find on the website http://www.wiebkehoogklimmer.de
