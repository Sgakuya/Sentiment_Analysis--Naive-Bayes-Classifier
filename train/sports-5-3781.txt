Lou could steal them bases. Before Rickey Henderson, he had the single-season and all-time SB record. Also was a very competent hitter (3000-hit club) with a bit of power. He is the surprising answer to the trivia question, Who are the only 4 players to hit the ball over the centerfield wall at the Polo Grounds (a 500' shot). Hank Aaron, Joe Adcock, and Luke Easter (while in the Negro Leagues) were the others. Brock was also a devastating player in the 1964/67/68 World Series (4 homers and a .391 average), though gained some infamy for misplaying Jim Northrup's flyball that cost the Cards the 1968 Series. Not Ruth/Mays/Aaron-great, but solidly ensconsed in the second tier of great players.
