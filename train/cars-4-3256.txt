This is our 3rd Jeep. We still have Jeep #2 Cherekee Sport 1999. So I thought it would be neat to have the new model Jeep, the Liberty, so we bought it back in Oct. 2002. My main concern about the Jeep is that is spins out of control easily, even when driving slowly on relatively gentle curves, on barely wet road surface, unless you have it in 4-wheel drive. This can be a scary experience. I ALWAYS put it in 4-wheel regardless of the season if the roads are wet AT ALL! I don't know how this can be improved upon, unless they lower the chassis closer to the groung...otherwise I like it alot...don't know if I will keep it after the lease is up..I may really look around at the SUV market and not purchase or lease a vehicle simecause it has the JEEP name.
