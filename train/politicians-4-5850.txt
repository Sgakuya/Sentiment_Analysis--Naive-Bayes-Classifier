According to The Economist - a magazine that I admire - Nancy is a poor choice for leader of the House. By selecting a radical, San Francisco Democrat to be a major Party voice, The Economist argues, the Democrats risk alienating the moderate America. While I understand this argument, I completely disagree with it. My frustration with the Democratic Party during the 2002 elections was due to its inability to articulate exactly what it stood for. Was it against war on Iraq? What did it recommend for the economy? Why was the Bush administration's policy bad for the US? Pelosi is who she is, but one thing that I have no doubt of is that she will be able to articulate a clear message.
