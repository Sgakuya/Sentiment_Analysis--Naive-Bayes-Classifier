tim burton injects some goofball comedy in the first half of this movie, and a few jolts of his trademark dark irony in the second. otherwise, it really feels nothing at all like his work. it carries like an eighties high-school movie, with the nerds against the jocks, with some minor genocide. the apes take the role of concerned parents in the higher strata of their government, which is woefully under-represented. the ape military is pure wrath on tim roth's part, and effective canon fodder the rest of the time. only helena bonham carter seems able to emote well through her make up. as for the humans, it's understandable why they are oppressed, and the less you see of them, the better, and you don't see much. the ape world has little culture or history to be proud about, and while you understand why the apes were powerful enough to rule, you don't understand why they chose to. the movie doesn't so much tout peace as an option, but slap you with it. but, the humans and the apes can't really be blamed for their unimpressiveness; it's created by the plot. the plot, like the script, and a few other distractions from the awesome visuals, should be given some lee-way, since this is a future to our time, and a distant world, and the characters can't be just like us in speech, or in motivations. the monkey/human dynamics in the beginning scenes aboard the human ship are a little heavy-handed, as are some of the quotes from the old film, and from today's pop culture. pretty much every con is forgivable. even that if you're counting moons throughout the film, the ending may not make sense. i have to admit that the movie had me impressed by effects, laughing, and at times bouncing in my seat like a monkey. i'll see it again.
