I love LA. The glitz, glamour, Hollywood, the entertainment industry, The laid back attitudes ,the scenic beauty in the surrounding areas. This is one great city, truly a La La Land. I definitely recommend it as an urban get-away vacation city with lots to see and do. You can actually see movie stars and celebrities walking around just being ordinary people and no one bothers them. There are a number of suggested things to do there. In particular, drive into the Hollywwod Hills and see the views of the city. Go to Pink's for Hot dogs Homer Simpson would love. Sit in the audience for a TV show. Go to Santa Monica or the Rose Bowl Swap meet. It's just a great place, but....I think I if I lived there and saw the negatives, I'd be turned off on it some. No one walks anywhere. You MUST drive. Traffic is crazy and smog is a reality. It's expensive and earthquakes are for real.The downtown is almost an afterthought. People there can also be stuck up, superficial and will use you for their own selfish gains. This place has the best looking women around though. Across the board, young and old, of whatever racial background, the best looking women are in LA.
