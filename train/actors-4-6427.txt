Okay, let me give it to you straight without all the hooplah about how hot he is and what a cutie he is and how he rocks everyone's world. Joshua Jackson is undoubtedly a talented actor who has grown tremendously throughout the years, and is still learning. He may not be conventionally handsome, but he has an endearing charm that grabs your attention when he's on the screen, whether he plays a hunky hero in The Skulls or a haughty homosexual in Cruel Intentions. His strong presence is what makes him attractive and scores him big points with the ladies. I think he should definitly do a lot more voice work, like a Disney movie or something and grab a totaly new market that's not so teeny-bopperish. I don't watch Dawson's Creek at all, and I hope Joshua takes on more challenging roles in the future so that he can tell all the bumbling critics out there who bad-mouth the guy because they're blind and starving for attention where they can stick their one-star ratings.
