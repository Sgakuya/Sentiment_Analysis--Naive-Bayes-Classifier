Well... Wisconsin is my home state so perhaps I'm a little biased. However -- it's really beautiful. There are forests in the north, Lake Michagan (the Kohler-Andre Park is nice), Lake Superior, and yes, there are bigger cities: Madison, and I suppose Milwaukee, depending on what you're looking for. Many smaller lakes and rivers are beautiful too. All the seasons are good. Summer is very green up north (though I wish it was a bit longer), the color in fall is spectacular, and I think that snow is very underrated. It's not just something to shovel--it's pretty, and fun too. Spring's the only season I'm not crazy about, but it's pretty short.
