Now here's a guy I can enjoy watching on C-SPAN. He's a master of the filibuster and is syrupy-smooth in his dislike for compromise and what he views as kowtowing to anyone or anything that would threaten his beloved Pascagoula shipyard and its workers (his father was a pipefitter for the same shipyards). His honorable defense of his constituents and his unquenchable addiction to camera lenses are respectful, since there is nothing better than watching a consummate politician who is hopelessly out of touch with the rest of this diverse nation blather on and on about a 1.35 trillion dollar tax cut and how it will benefit all Americans (except the working poor, racial minorities, single parents and basically anyone Lott is not). His fellow senator, Thad Cochran, is much more humble and respectful of other ideas and opinions than Chester Trent Lott. Lott is a Mississippi good-ole-boy in a well-pressed Brooks Brothers suit. I would hate to think that the good people of the Magnolia State would send this condescending coiffured obstructionist to Congress, especially after this nation was represented by the likes of James O. Eastland, one of the most vicious racists and segregationists ever known to have graced the hallowed halls of the Senate. Jamie Mumbles Whitten wasn't much better, either. Talk about an ego streching from Meridian to Jackson and down to Pascagoula via Hattiesburg and Bay Saint Louis! Chester Trent Lott certainly is showing how the South will rise again. Remember, this guy used to be a Democrat up until 1972, when he declared he was going to fight the Kennedys and the Javitses and their ilk. Give him credit, he's been consistent in that area. But what has Chester accomplished in Congress, besides being Minority Leader of the Senate? He's got to work harder at doing some sort of constructive legislation with all people and not just be sucking down one mint julep after another. (Or would that be bourbon?)
