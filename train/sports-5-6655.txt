Larry Brown has always considered himself a foundation builder. He takes broken teams and fixes them. He teaches the fundamentals, how to defend, how to rebound, how to be patient on offense.... how to play the right way. His formula has turned around programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Now, it appears as Larry Brown gets older, and finds himself still without a championship, he has grown impatient with this foundation building model, and wants to become more of a roof builder - ie take a team with talent and potential, and take them to a world championship. The Pistons are a team that finished first in the East in 2002, and already display a lot of the characteristics that Brown likes - defense, rebounding, and toughness. With untapped talent like Okur, Prince, and Darko, my guess is that this team will win the East again. Whether the Pistons can compete with the big 5 (LA, Sac, Dallas, SA, Min) remains to be seen.
