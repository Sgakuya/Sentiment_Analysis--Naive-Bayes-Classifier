Walking into Best Buy is like walking into an electronic amusement park. There is so much variety and so many demos to try out. I like the quality of brands and products they offer as well as a large selection. I wish it wasn't so loud inside which is probably due to the style of structure. I also would like to see employees who are more knowledgeable and really know how to assess my needs and to recommend a proper product. Their marketing is better than any electronic chain out there. A better return policy would be great as restocking fees are a big turn off. All in all-I really like Best Buy and would recommend Best Buy to others.
