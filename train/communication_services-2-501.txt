Alltel is great as long as you don't have to contact them or use your cell phone at a critical moment. I have constantly bought the best phones to have the (hopefully) best service but the straw that broke my back was when they told me that they could not repair my Star-Tak phone which is a little over two years old. They said Motorolla doesn't make that one anymore nor do they repair them. Obsolete already???? They suggest I buy another expensive phone. How convenient.The phone only seems to work in areas where there are pay phones.Break down somewhere and you will not have reception. Try calling 611 and they tell you to go to a pay phone to call them.
