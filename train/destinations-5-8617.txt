I have been dipping since i was 14 ((i know it was illegal, but i was raised on a farm)), and I can honestly say that I have tried every brand available in my state's market. Grizzly is by far the best. It's flavor is pleasantly intense, but not overpowering, and it lasts SO much longer than other brands, such as Skoal, Cope, or even RedSeal. Plus the price is just the icing on the cake. It is the cheapest around, at $1.92 a can, while the next cheapest (RedSeal) is $2.49 a can. I have had many unpleasant experiences with snuff and dip, but Grizzly has never been the root of any of these problems. It gets a perfect five-star rating from me.
