Henry Aaron was a great baseball player and an awesome hitter, but what impresses me is his mental strength. There is no way we can ever imagine the pressure he was under as he neared the home run record that Babe Ruth held. What would it be like to challenge the record of a legend that has the respect that the Great Bambino has? On top of this pressure add the death threats that we now know Aaron was getting on a daily basis. And then there were the threats to his friends and family, and bomb threats to the ball club and to the stadium. And with all those distractions, he was still able to overcome them, and break the record. The human spirit still amazes me. This man is a hero to admire.
