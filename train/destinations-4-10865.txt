FANTASTIC POST SPEEDY ! You are 1000% right about that 3 girl clone from New Jersey. Cedar Point is a really great family amusement park so if you aint been there,done that,then don't vote it a 1 star (3 times) to try to knock it down in the standings and then give your local Jackson,New Jersey,Six Flags amusement park a 5 star rating (3 times) to promote and raise it in the standings you New Jersey homer !!! And,oh by the way Ms.New Jersey I know about your sunburn ! She has opened another account under the handle of i have a sunburn! so she has at least 4 accounts now and who knows how many more !!! But,she took your hint Speedy and dropped the geographical and gender references in her new account nickname.
