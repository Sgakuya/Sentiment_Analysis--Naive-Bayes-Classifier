This guy's fun to watch. My dad and I went to the Phillies - Expos game a couple weekends ago to check out the new stadium and (hopefully) to get a look at our new closer in action. It turned out to be a ridiculous game. Billy came in for the top of the 9th, with the score tied, and he looked confident out there. He has a huge stride to the plate and gets the job done quickly. He promptly took care of the first 3 batters he faced and we ended up winning with a walk-off homer (Doug Glanville) in the bottom half. Billy will help Thome to carry the Phillies to the World Series this year. You heard it here first.
