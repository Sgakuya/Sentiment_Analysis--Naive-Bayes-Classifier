You need to possess a high-octane energy level trying to keep up with Paul Thomas Andersons pace in the way he makes films. What I like about him also is that hes one of the few directors that seeks the potential of an actor by trying to cast them against type. Tom Cruise is always playing the good guy, but in Magnolia he played a chauvinist pig and it worked as I wanted to strangle him. Don Cheadle is always playing a tough cop, but for once we see some range in Boogie Nights as he plays a weak man. Adam Sandler is always playing the funny guy, but in Punch Drunk Love we see someone whose psychosis raises a few eyebrows. I wasn't a fan of Punch Drunk Love, but Magnolia and Boogie Nights was enough to re-assure me Paul Thomas Anderson knows how to tell a good story.
