Horrible! Although the actual drivers did a fair job packing, they could not fit all of our items into their truck, since the truck they sent was smaller than what we had contracted for. We ended up having to rent a U-Haul for $900 and drive the 400+ miles ourselves just to take the overflow. Then the driver complained that he had been fined at the weight station and had to pay stiff fines, and obvious attempt to try to get a bigger tip. When they unloaded, they brought about 3 trips into the house and then got tired and left everything else in the garage for us to move ourselves. On top of everything, when I went back to Starving Students to try to get them to at least re-imburse half of my U-Haul expenses that I had incurred because of them, they have refused. Their claims agent, Curtis was rude, and I felt showed no concern for my position at all. Considering taking them to court, but not sure if it's worth my time. If anyone has had any satisfactory conflict resolutions with them, please e-mail me and let me know how you were able to deal with this company. ***********UPDATE: I recently received a call from Starving Students offering a compromise in re-imbursement of my expenses. Although it was far less than what I feel I was rightfully owed, it's worth it to be done with dealing with them. I will say that Mr. Enay, their claims director, showed a lot more empathy and professionalism in the late stages of my claim resolution. Honestly, I would still think more than twice before ever using this company again.
