The professional academics like him, because most our educators are on the left on virtually every issue. Truman excelled at two things that endeared him to liberals forever: (1) he cussed like a sailor, and (2) he would stop at nothing to defeat Republicans. Thank goodness, the country wised up and Truman knew he didn't stand a chance if he tried to run again in 1952. What a relief it must have been to have Ike replace him. 4/7/03 - I'm going to update this, even though it will mean losing those helpful ratings I got...if you're ever in the Kansas City area, try to visit the Truman library and (better yet) the Truman home. Everything in his house is left like it was when he died in 1972. His hat is still on the rack, his wife's dish rag is still lying across the kitchen faucet, and there is loose change on the table. At least it was this way last time I visited, several years ago. Whether you like or dislike Harry Truman, it's a genuine time capsule, a wonderful place to walk through.
