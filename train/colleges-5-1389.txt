As a college administrator, I have visited and worked at a number of schools. There are a number of wonderful universities but I keep coming back to my first love, The University of Virginia. UVA is wonderfully unique in higher education. Yes, it's a beautiful campus designed by Thomas Jefferson and yes, it is wonderful academically. However, it also possesses all of the other intangibles that make a place great and almost bigger than life. A student at UVA has a sense of belonging to something bigger than themselves, more than just a string of courses leading to a degree. It has history, it has soul and frankly, it has a sense of magic. That may sound corny, but those who have attended UVA, and some who have only visted, understand this quality. If you have the chance, stop in Charlottesville, VA and take a few minutes to walk across Grounds. Ask a Lawn Resident if you can peek in their room and visit the Corner. I promise you'll be hooked. I'm not saying that UVA is the best choice for everyone, but I walked away with a quality education and a deep love and loyalty for Mr. Jefferson's University.
