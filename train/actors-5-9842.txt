I think Reese is one of the best actresses ive ever seen, having known her both personally (she babysat me when i was little) and as an actress i think she deserved a perfect score. She might not be in the best movies but she ALWAYS plays her parts wonderfully. She is a nice person and not snobby like most actor/actresses are and seems to be a very caring person. If you disagree with me then go rent a reese movie and watch it bc you obivously havent seen her before. I also think she is very beautiful and want to congragulate her on #99 on the peoples top 200 hottest people list, which is pretty good for someone whos not well known, Last note, ID do anything to just spend a day with her, shes awesome.
