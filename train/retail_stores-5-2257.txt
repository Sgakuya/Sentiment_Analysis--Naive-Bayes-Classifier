Sick and tired of the same ol' same ol' at Ralph's / Kroeger / Safeway / Albertsens's, et al ? Tired of hearing the worst 70's music ever recorded in those stores ? Try something diferent at Trader Joe's. Overall quality of food is excellent at most reasonable prices - and you will definitely find food products there you wont see anywhere else. Hey, y'all - nothing's perfect, and I would not drive 100 miles for TJ's bread, and have yet to be impressed with the produce. You wont find cosmetics or hair color there either. I have been in over 25 different TJ stores (dont ask me why) .. and the atmosphere in all has been super. Staff like where they are and what they do - it really shows, big time. I make it a point to buy something I've never tried before when i shop there -- a little cullonary adventure, has been worth it almost every time. Nothing's perfect, but if any retailer deserves 5 stars, TJ's does.
