Well, I don't currently have their service but I'm considering getting on it. From what I see and what I need in a plan I believe their Digital Plus 450 plan will work great for me. I'm currently on Pacific Bell and I was happy with their service for the most part until they recently changed their plans. They no longer offer peak and off-peak minutes. Instead they just offer a set anytime minutes and then 1000 weekend minutes. And I'm one of those individuals were most of my calls are made M-F day night not weekends. Verizon offers on the plan I stated above 450 anytime minutes and 500 off-peak minutes which includes M-F 7pm-7am along with Sat. and Sun.) and they also through in 1000 mobile-mobile minutes. The plan cost $49.99 which is $10 more than the plan I had at PB. But my bill at PB would be almost $200 because they didn't offer enough peak minutes. Therefore, I believe that by going on this plan with Verizon I'll save money I just hate that I won't be able to use my Nokia with the plan. I'll have to find a new phone. Therefore, I do have one question for those of you who are currently on Verizon. What phone do you have and how do you like it?
