After being attacted to rent by their lower prices, I reserved a car. When I received a confirmation, I got an "extra information" stating that I was not allowed to travel basically anywhere outside Washington State with the exception of Vancouver, BC and Portland. When I called to double-check since I needed to drive up some 350km north-west to Vernon, British Columbia, I had someone who didn't want to give me a good reason for their rental practices and who actually hung the phone up on me. I beleive this is misleading advertising since they offer "unlimited km" on several renting sites. Only once the reservation is done that you get the extra info of their very restrictive driving coverage. And as the lady told me: they follow the position of their cars a couple of times a day via a GPS system.
