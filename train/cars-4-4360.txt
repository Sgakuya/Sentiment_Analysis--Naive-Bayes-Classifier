Way back in '95 we bought a new Ford E150 conversion van (conversion by Tiara) and it remains the best vlaue I ever received from any vehicle. It was competitive in price to a premium car, had separate stereos for driver area and rear passenger area. The rear passenger area had a tv & vcp with separate headphone jacks (tv & stereo) for each captain's chair, and instead of asking are we there yet? the kids invariably would say, the movie's not over yet, we'll come in when it's over. (Do you think they were spoiled?) Anyway, I put 150,000 miles on that rig, drove it everywhere along the Atlantic seaboard, Chicago, Toronto, etc. and did little more than change the oil, tires and transmission fluid at designated intervals. It got around 24 mpg on the highway, and the only problem was one daughter who found herself carsick if she read or watched tv, until drammamine saved the day. I felt like I was trading down when I got my first Lincoln Continental, and the kids were equally less than excited about it. All their cousins reminisce today about riding in Uncle Eschew's van, singing, at the top of our voices, Well, shake it up, baby, now . . .
