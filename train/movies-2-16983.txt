Though it copped a couple Golden Globes, we found it to be a slow, depressing movie. The language was really foul as well. The movie is also guilty of what I feel is the worst thing you can do in a movie, read a dialogue of INTERNET chat (The awful Whoopi Goldberg film, Jumping Jack Flash, did this incessantly.) In Closer, we are made to sit through a 10-minute Chat session between two guys (one pretending to be a girl) having INTERNET sex. Verrrrrry distasteful and boring. Adapted from a play, the movie focuses on two couples who spend the entire movie cheating on each other in every possible combination (except the 2 dudes don't get it on) and suffer the obvious repurcussions. As if we don't already know what adultery can do to a relationship. The movie is supposed to depict modern-day relationships. If that's the case, I'll stick with my Loretta Lockhorn for another 50 years.
