I'm a Woody Allen fan and look forward to all his films, both the good and the bad. This was a good one, in my opinion. It reminded me a little of his Crimes and Misdemeanors, only with a twist. Did anyone else, like me, wish for the bad guy to get away with it? If so, what's wrong with us? I loved the scene when the wedding ring hit the rail at the pier, because then, we knew what was going to happen...only it didn't. I agree with Daccory (15) that the lead was somewhat leaden with nothing much to recommend him, but then again, he was the bad guy I wanted to "get away," so he must have had something going for himself besides his looks.
