One of the great cities of the world. Istanbul (former Constantinople) was capital of the Eastern Roman Empire for many centuries, as well as the sucessor Empire, the Ottoman for nearly 500 years. The world is still feeling the ruptures of the fall of the Ottoman Empire and Istanbul was it's heart. So many things to see and do in Instanbul. Istanbul also grows and seems to get bigger all the time. Huge new bus station and a really nice new metro. You can take the new Metro from the new airport direct to the new Autogar (if you are moving on) or straight into Arkarsay. It is possible to walk from there to Sultan Ahmet. The area around the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sofia momument has been cleaned up and there is no traffic except the modern new streetcars that are now operating. Definatly worth a vist. An absolute must! Very reasonalbe and I personally promise that you will not be bored. Aya Sofia must be seen. They charge too much now to visit the Topkapi museum.
