I usually don't have a problem with Wal-Mart, at least not the one that I now frequent, but that's partially due to my shopping habits--I only go to get specific items, and I usually don't linger much afterwards. I don't expect to get high-quality products there, but for shampoo, toothpaste, craft stuff and things like that, it's still the same stuff you can get at any other store, just cheaper. That aside, there have been a few complaints that I have had over the past few years. One is almost always the fish department--80% of the time I go there, there's a raging ick epidemic for those poor things, and there's not a person who cares. Having used to work at Wal-Mart (Photo Lab Tech, 1 year), I see how they handle that kind of thing, at least in one store--it goes back as a tick mark on a sheet of paper as a loss . Kind of disturbing. Then, as an associate, I had to stand and watch my immediate boss get screamed at with some severe name-calling because she refused to sell the man an illegal photo reproduction from the self-serve photo image center (As a company, Wal-Mart and its associates are held responsible if any copyrighted material of any kind is reproduced in the store, even from a self-service station--it can to fines and firings). Then, to top it off, the store manager came by and, to appease the man, let him take the illegal copy, despite federal laws. I'm sure glad that I don't work there anymore!
