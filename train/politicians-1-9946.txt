I've HAD IT with this backwards S.O.B.!!!!!After 9/11,he SHOULD have worried about getting the economy of America back on track!!!But nooooooooooooo!!!He didn't wanna do THAT!!!He wanted to get f***ing revenge!!!!God says that vengence is his;ESPECIALLY the killing kind!!!He should have let God take care of the terrorists,and did EVERYTHING he could to help this country after 9/11!!!!9/11 was BAD enough!!!!Then he had to make it TEN times worse with this f***ing WAR that NOBODY wanted!!!!GOD I wish Kerry would have won!!!If he had then he would have fixed this HORRIBLE mess,and EVERYONE could have gotten on with their lives!!!!
