What a lot of you seem to ignore is the fact that this president's entire life was subjected to a multi-year 40 million dollar investigation with a microscope and all they could come up with was he lied about having a affair with a consenting adult. Citing Whitewater, Travelgate, supposed murders, theft, etc. are totally bogus products of the right wing attack machine. Remember, Mr. Starr investigated the mountain of spurious allegations made against the Clinton Administration, and came up with NOTHING. The vandalism but one has to admit, the Clinton Administration did balance the budget, did reform the welfare state, did enact family friendly legislation, and presided over the longest economic boom this country ever experienced, accompanied by EVERYONE (statistically speaking) in every income bracket doing better, rich and poor alike. That they managed to do this while under unrelenting disgraceful attacks by the right-wing and their surrogates makes this presidency all the more remarkable.
