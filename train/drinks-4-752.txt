I read someone else's review recently of Black Dog ale (at least I think it was Black Dog) and was very bothered to see that they panned it big time. Too bad because we used to drink this all the time in Wyoming and after a day of skiing it was like nectar from the gods. I know that an ice cold can of Busch will taste fantastic when you finally ease into a lounge chairs, steam rising from your clothing, after a day on the slopes but this was a good beer then as well as outside of those conditions. In fact when I moved back East I was searching for a local merchant who sold Black Dog and was really bummed I couldn't find it. If you see in a cooler near you I'd recommend picking up a bottle
