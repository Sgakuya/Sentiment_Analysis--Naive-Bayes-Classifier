Among the best/flashiest dunkers in the NBA, Davis plays for the NBA's worst team - a team some have even accused of dumping games in their shameless pursuit of signing Lebron James next season. That said, it makes sense that someone with as much athleticism as Davis is getting the touches and the green light that he does, which, in turn, explains for some of the ridiculous stat lines he's put up this season. Nothing, though, explains for the unsportsmanlike display he put on against the Jazz a couple nights ago (throwing the ball against his own hoop, looking for his 10th rebound and 1st triple-double). This is why I thought Ricky Davis had 2, MAYBE 3 stars written all over him. I had all but thrown him in the same cage at the zoo with fellow 'tough guy', Ronnie Artest, until my roommate told me he was actually a good guy off the court (big with charities, etc.). Hence the four stars.
