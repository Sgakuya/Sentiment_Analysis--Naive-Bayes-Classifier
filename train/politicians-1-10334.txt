To paraphrase the Comic Book Guy- Worst President Ever! But wait, he's not actually President. A FULL recount of Florida showed that however you count the chads, Gore WON. Republicans refused to count all the votes in Florida. They even discriminated in counting military ballots. They counted unpostmarked, illegal votes from Bush counties while not counting military votes from Gore counties. Since being selected by the Supreme Court, Mr. Bush has been nothing short of horrendous. He turned a 5 trillion surplus into deficits as far as the eye can see, cost us 3 million jobs (worst record since Hoover) and appointed almost solely right wing extremists. And of course you know what he did in foreign affairs. Lied about WMDs to get us into war with Iraq, resulting in the death of 400+ U.S. soldiers so far and thousands of Iraqis. When Clinton lied, nobody died! A recent poll in the UK found 60% of those polled said Bush was the greatest threat to world peace. And to quote London's Mayor, Ken Livingstone, Bush is the greatest threat to life on this planet that we've probably ever seen. 1 Star is way too many. Can we have negative stars! This guy doesn't just deserve impeachment, he deserves a jail cell!
