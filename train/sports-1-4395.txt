UPDATE: No, Carolina32, it's not just you. But he not only looks like a rat....he is a rat. Literally. Seriously, he lives in the sewer, and feeds at night. Only cheese though......which is why he always looks constipated and tries to schedule Wisconsin every year. UPDATE: 'MUSICPROF', nobody is saying K can't coach. That would be dumb. However, you're terribly wrong by saying that all of NC becomes Dook fans when they are in the title ame, or whatever you said. Maybe immigrants from other states, but for the most part, THE OPPOSITE of what you said is true. That year in '95 I think it was, when ya'll sucked, everybody hated you even more, even though K wasn't around most of the time. I know where Nebo is, EXACTLY where it is, and Id be ashamed of myself for liking a team that is not of the people.......that is, if you're a native. Yeah, I know Nebo, you probably hang out at that packed Wal Mart on 70? NEBO? - I know EXACTLY why you like Dook. Know what I'm saying? You don't like that area there around McDonalds, Moores, Burger King and Ingles, do ya? Yeah, I know EXACTLY why you like Dook. THAT is usually the only reason a native will like Dook. I can't speak for every fan in the ACC, but Carolina fans will hate Dook forever........whether they're 0-30, or 30-0. I'd be ashamed, supporting them yankees. 'MUSIC PROF', yeah, I know that area. YOU ARE ONE OF FEW! I've seen mad Carolina support in that area................my whole life. Sheeeeeeit, didn't Phil Ford (all time Carolina scorer) do the grand opening of that big fancy Lowes ya'll are so proud of? Everything in that same little space - Lowes, Wal Mart, Carnival with 8 foot ferris wheel, clothes, and food. That sheeeit cracks me up. You're in Tarheel country, buddy! HA! But if you're from where you say you're from.................you already knew that, huh? Any small town in NC (OR BIG TOWN) is ALL CAROLINA, baby. Go Heels, WHAT! But you knew that, huh? NC State beats Dook in that area of the state, no?
