Good, but doesn't quite pack the same punch as the first one. The level of gore is toned down dramatically in the last half of Tarantino's Kill Bill, where the Bride (whose name is revealed in this installment) finishes her rampage and is faced with the unexpected. Well, comparatively--I mean, in Vol. 1, there was blood spraying EVERYWHERE, here is just an eye snatched out of someone's socket here and there. This movie fills in many questions left from the first one, with flashbacks. Same cheesy retro styling as most of Tarantino's work. Oh, and if you hated the commercials for it as much as I did, you're going to hate the beginning of this movie--yeah, it's in there, yuck. Overall, interesting story, the demise of the antagonists weren't nearly as extravagant as in the first movie, but it'll do.
