Because of Brooksie, Greatest "All-Around" Third Baseman in Baseball History is the appropiate classification for Schmidt. And Just imagine if he hadn't required a bunch of knee operations prior to even making the majors! I was there at the Vet for a large percentage of his games and always said Mike shouldda been a Cub Card, Oriole ... somewhere with classier fans. Memo to fellow Philly fans: Fans can still be "knowledgeable", even if they happen to not be quite AS loud and boisterous about it. And, with respect to a previous poster, Mike talked to the press plenty. (Carlton was the one who didn't speak to anybody -- unless you brought up Fine Wine LOL). Scmidt was always extremely honest with the Media, to boot. And here's a cool fact: Schmidt never considered himself "good enough" -- very humble and frequently down and hard on himself. Therefore, Philly misconstrued his self-conscious nature (just as Eagles fans took that Snowballed Santa as being "drunk"). Philly fans just like to hear themselves yell -- and have to be louder than the next one. Believe that's why they still relish the 1993 fluke-sterioded - drunk tree hitting -gambling on 1993 games- "Macho Row" jailbirds like gods.
