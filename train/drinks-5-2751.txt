After reading through the other comments let me point out that this survey is about the coffee - not the establishment or as some seem to espouse cult. So...concerning the coffee (not the cup or logo) Starbucks sells/brews/distributes the freshest and most robust coffee available in America. Starbucks has a wide variety of beans grown in many different areas of the world. Most Starbuck shops display a chart which aids in selecting the coffee that matches your palette best. The chart not only tells you whether the coffee will brew mild to strong, it also gives a descriptive on flavor (kind of like the descriptions vintners give on their wines).
