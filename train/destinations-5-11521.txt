Cancun is the number one spring break destination in the world for a reason: Amazing quality of beaches & water, killer clubs & parties, and even ancient Mayan ruins! By the way, our Agency has been getting a TON of calls on hurricane damage to Cancun....have no fear...most of our spring break properties did not sustain damage that won't have them open in time --- book the Costa Real, Presidente, Solymar, or Girasol...they're all spring break friendly & ready to go. Beware of anyone trying to sell you Miramar Mision. This property is closed as it is going to be razed for new condos. If you have specific spring break questions or concerns about Cancun, email me.
