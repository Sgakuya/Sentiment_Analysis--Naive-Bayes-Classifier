When I first started writing this comment I was going to try to show the good sides od Stockwell and show people he is not totally incompetent. However, after a split second, I realized that Stockwell has no good sides and is totally incompetent. Let's start from the beginning. First, he defeats Preston Manning in a landslide victory. Well, that's good for him, but too bad he couldn't get the party united behind him, because we all saw what happened when about one fifth of his part left him because he was a more awful leader than Alexa McDonough. To beat that, Stockwell was so great that he wasted Alberta taxpayers money, failed to breakthrough in Ontario, lost his closest supporters, lost his smartest supporters, and is now left with, well, who is he left with? I heard that this ingenuis individual is going to run for the Alliance leadership again. Let's see who he's facing. Stephen Harper: an individual who wants to distance the Alliance from the Tories and give the Liberals everlasting power, which could be a good thing. We have Diane Ablonczy and Grant Hill, who want to build a coalition with the Tories. Finally, we have Enza, the Toronto transvestite. She ran for the mayor of Toronto last year, and get this, she came third out of eleven people. But the overwhelmiong message I get is that the Alliance is finished. They can vote for a coalition with the Tories, a man who wants to build a firewall around Alberta, a Toronto transvestite, or Stockwell Day. You can see my point. The Alliance doesn't have a hope. In fact, recent popularity has dipped below levels of that of the NDP. Now that's how you know things are bad!
