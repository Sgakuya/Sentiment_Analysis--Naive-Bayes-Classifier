This is the way the country was meant to be. I just can't think of a more ideal place when it comes to rural. Small towns are the lifeblood of this state and it seems nearly all of them are beautiful and quaint. I you had the 4 seasons and put it on a postcard Vermont would epitomize them all. Vermont is THE place to go for fall foliage - Bar None ! Just jump in your car and drive on the back roads from one little hamlet to another graced with mountains, valleys, villages, and white steepled churches. It's as if you've entered a Norman Rockwell painting. Lake Champlain is great. It has islands, sandy beaches and you can even chug a ferry across it to the Adirondacks of New York state (also beautiful). Skiing here is the best in the east. It's also within a few hours drive to Boston, Montreal and New York so it's not too isolated. If I could find work here I'd move to Vermont in a heartbeat.
