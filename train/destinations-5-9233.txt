I'm a 40 year old female from Vancouver, B.C. In 1998 my father, my pre-teen and myself flew to Toronto to spend Christmas with my brother and his family. One of our most memorable excursions was a day trip to Niagara Falls. All of us mixed ourselves into two vehicles, and left Toronto in time to arrive at the Falls by late afternoon. This turned out to be a perfect plan as it allowed us to view Niagara Falls in daylight as well as in the evening all lit up. We Vancouverites, used to our mild winters couldn't believe how cold it was at Niagara! ( We thought Toronto was cold enough!) But our family members wisely insisted we borrow toques and gloves and scarves so we had a bearable outside walking look at the awesomeness of Niagara Falls. I feel it was definately worth the drive and the cold just to see it. Both children and adults got a kick at knowing we were in pointing distance of the United States side of the Falls. We stayed outside long enough to enjoy the splendour of seeing the Falls lit up at night, then we headed in to the tower building nearby. I was shocked at how expensive the rates were to ride the elevator up the tower to view the falls: over $100 for 7 people. Ridiculous!! Viewing from ground level was good enough for us; every family member had been totally impressed! What we did discover in the building though was a good quality family restaurant where we gratefully warmed up with hot chocolate and French fries. As an added bonus a big Christmas light display, with cute animal motifs etc. was set up on the exit road. A great family outing!
