How in the world did Wheat Chex move to the top of this list? It has to be one of the worst cereals out there! Even topping it with a solid layer of sugar can't improve the cardboard taste of this pathetic cereal. In fact, it would serve better as gerbil litter (you know that rodents wouldn't waste their time eating this stuff) or as drainage material for plants. I think prison inmates deserve to eat this for breakfast as additional punishment, although it might spark a riot. It's even awful in the traditional Chex Football Mix recipe. (I always replace it with the more palatable Rice Chex.) Please help move this wretched cereal to the bottom of the list where it belongs!
