yikes. i can't believe some of the comments here. It was a good movie - yes, it is not actionactionaction, but it never professed to be. Yes this was apparently where Megs marriage came to an end. But why that means you give the movie 1 star is a mystery to me. No this does not put forward the idea that 'white man worth more than tan man'. There are bad people and good people of all colours, folks (and one of the biggest bad guys is the kidnapped fellows CORPORATION who won't pay the ransom, and basically cuts their losses and scoots. BAD WHITE GUYS!! BAD WHITE GUYS!! Feel better now, all you wieners who see racism, and other isms, in everything?!?
