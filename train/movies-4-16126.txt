I was truly impressed with this movie. It was a good story, a good period film and all its characters were written with great depth. You sympathize with both the journalist and the secret agent, neither of whom are anywhere near perfect but still don't strike you (well, me, at least) as bad people. Fraser's situation made me think of Spy Game, which tried to capture in realistic fairness the complexity of national security. A spy must either put his conscience on hold and do things a civilian would never do or risk a nuclear war with Russia. It was provacative; the spy ends up getting killed not by his enemy but by his friend. I left wondering whether the journalist killed him 'for the Vietnamese' or if that was just his excuse to kill him so he could get the girl back. Anyway, for a love triangle this story was truly original, I'd have to say. Overall the story was very well written and very interesting. I recommend it.
