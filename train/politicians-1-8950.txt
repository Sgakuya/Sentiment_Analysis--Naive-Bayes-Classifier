Clinton was unequivocally, THE WORST President the United States has ever had. He did absolutely nothing beneficial while he was in office. He boasts about how the economy grew so robustly under his presidency, but in reality, Ronald Reagan was ultimately responsible for setting the stage for future positive growth and prosperity, by supporting technology, increasing the strenght of our military, and funneling money into our nation's infrastructure. What did Clinton due???...He reduced our military, pardoned convicted criminals, engaged in coverups (Vincent Foster),had inappropriate sexual encounters, and jeopardized the security of our nation (read the book Dereliction of Duty, available in Barnes and Noble). Clinton was an embarrassment to Democrats and Republican's alike.
