heartbreaking. That is the only word I can think of to describe the padres. I believe they have all the potential in the world. Kevin Towers needs to be kicked out, and someone needs to wake Bochy up. I swear he sleeps in the dugout. Klesko, Hoffman, Kotsay, Nevin (well, nevin and hoffman, when they're healthy) could potentially lead the team to greatness. They did it with Ken Caminiti (hello, crack addict) and Greg Vaughn for heaven sake, they could most certainly do it now. What really irritates me is being put on hold for the ballpark. Until it is built, it seems like winning isn't on the agenda. It needs to be! But they've been playing well the past few weeks, maybe they're turning around. Let's keep the faith, pad fans!!
