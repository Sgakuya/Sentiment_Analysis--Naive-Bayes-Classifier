How can you beat an album like 'London Calling'? How can you beat a band like The Clash? In my opinion, you absolutely cannot. Songs like 'London Calling', 'Spanish Bombs', 'The Right Profile', 'Train In Vain', 'Rudie Can't Fail', 'The Guns Of Brixton', and 'Clampdown' make this magnificent gem a total classic and something all generations can listen to, relate to and without a doubt enjoy! Their earlier masterworks like 'The Clash' (1977) were added to with the production of this album. Listen to ANY of their music if you haven't, and definitely get 'London Calling' if you don't have it already. The Clash always and forever!
