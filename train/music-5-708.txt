I don't even know where to start with this album. This is the kind of album that only comes along once in a very long time. Bush exploded onto the music scene because of the perfection that is called 16Stone. Every member of the band BUSH creates a masterpiece in their respected area of expertise making this an album a must have. The lyrics are simlpy amamzing and the sound is incredible. From the hard rocking songs like Machinehead and Little Things to the sweet and sexy sounds of G;ycerine and Alien, this album covers is it all. Producing an amazing FIVE hits this album is something any music fan should not have to endure life without. BUY IT!!!
