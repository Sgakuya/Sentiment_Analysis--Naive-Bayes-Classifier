McDonalds is above average. First, the fries are good, although not as good as competitors (such as Arby's, Captain D's & Krystal). Also, the Chicken Sandwiches are very tasty. The new all-white-meat Chicken Nuggets are a vast improvement over the chicken parts of years past. Now, the negatives. First, the service can be quite medicore at times with slow drive thru lines and wrong orders. And, WHY are they getting rid of the Super-Size? The oppressive Atkins diet may just ruin fast food as we know it! I had better enjoy the awesome super-size while I still can! As for creativity--the current ad campaign is terrible. McDonald's and hip-hop DON'T MIX! What happened to Have you had your break today? The internal designs, however, are bright and colorful--much better than the dark, bleak, dull insides of most sit-down dining chains. Also, the drive-throughs are quite convienent--especially the ones with the computer that will confirm your order. And, they have EASILY had most of the best toy tie-ins: Power Rangers, Sonic the Hedgehog, and more. Only Burger King comes close with Hamtaro and Pokemon. Their logo, the ubiquotous golden arch, is still pretty cool. As for the bags and containers, they are slickly-designed as well. I, of course, have an empty super-size fry container as a relic of a by-gone age.
