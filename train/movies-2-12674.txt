Dukes of Hazzard is a dumb movie with no real plot or characters of any significance. There are three things this movie was known for: those idiot Duke cousins, their Dodge, and Jessica Simpson's tight shorts. It seems to me that not much effort went into producing this movie; indeed the most difficult part of producing this movie was trying to get Jessica Simpson to fit into those famous shorts. It's the only thing that worked in the entire movie! This is just another sitcom from the 1970's remade into a movie. Hollywood really needs to sit down and get more serious about producing more creative products, rather than re-hashing the same lame plots over and over again.
