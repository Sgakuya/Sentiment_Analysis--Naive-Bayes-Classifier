I am having a really difficult time wondering what people see in George W. Bush. He does not care about the vast majority of working class Americans. All he cares about is big bussiness and building up the military. I will predict that within the next four years we will have a great recession, there will be no raises in minimum wage,the country will be in great national debt, social security will be gambled away on the stock market, inner city schools will fail.The country will grow so divided with minority hatred towards this administration. .My heart bleeds for all the Americans who fell for his lies. I know they were easily manipulated by Pat Robertson and the Christian Republican right. They tried so hard to bring morals and values into George W's campaign,and make Democrats look like heathens, But face it we all are sinners Republicans and Democrats alike have all sinned.Remember Watergate and Irancontra scandal by the Republicans.
