Martha's Vineyard is a very beautiful little island. The three main towns on the northern shore, Vineyard Haven, Oak Bluffs, and Edgartown all have unique and different feels and flavors. The towns up island or toward the southern part of the island are rural in feel and flavor. The problem with Martha's Vineyard is the weather. It is never really warm there. July and August have warm days, but it turns cold at nice and sweaters and jackets are required to stay warm. Martha's Vineyard is also extremely expensive and has more tourists than the little island can accomodate. Martha's Vineyard was a great place to get away from it all about 30 years ago. Today it is an overcrowded, expensive tourist destination with below average beaches, cold ocean water, and just plain cold except for July and August.
