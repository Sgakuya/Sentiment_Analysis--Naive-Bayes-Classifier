Released in 1989, the self-titled, second full-length effort by the Indigo Girls (ie Amy Ray and Emily Saliers) put the folk duo on the map and earned the group a Grammy for Best Folk Recording. There is no real argument whether the Indigo Girls was deserving of consideration, if not the win as the effort is strong throughout and contains some of duo's best singles, such as Closer To Fine, Kid Fears, and Land Of Canaan. The release was also helped by the notable guest artists who contributed (eg Luka Bloom and Peter Buck). When approaching the Indigo Girls, this is clearly the first full-length effort to acquire; however, one should note that this CD has been re-released with two bonus tracks (a different version of Land Of Canaan and a live version of Center Stage).
