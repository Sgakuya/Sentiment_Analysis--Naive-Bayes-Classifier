I love Abercrombies clothes, they are trendy, sexy and yet still have a casual feel to them. I had to take one star away form them because they are directing their advertising of overly sexy clothes to children, but only one because I belive in responsibility. For me responsibility starts in the home, so if you are concerned with what children are wearing GO THROUGH YOUR CHILDREN'S CLOTHES. As to the racial discrimination, most of you are hypocrites because I don't know many people who didn't laugh at South Park (White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian) and that is the most racially discriminating thing on any market, besides if you don't like their policy or the saying on the shirt, walk out of the store without it....I think most importantly what I am saying is take responsibility into your own hands, if you stop buying they will change. If you think something is to racy for a child DONT BUY IT, quit whinning. From a Person who isn't of Caucasian descent!!!
