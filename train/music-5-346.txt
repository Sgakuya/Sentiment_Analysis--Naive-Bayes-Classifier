Radiohead established themselves as one of the most inventive and ambitious bands of all time with this album. The shifts in songs like Let Down and Exit Music (For a Film) are subtle yet incredibly effective. Each song is like a mini-masterpiece on its own, and combined, they make an unprecedently brilliant work of art. If there is one flaw in OK Computer, is that the songs tend to lack continuity. No song really sounds the same, and playing the album straight through will probably leave you feeling disoriented. It's a small price to pay for something this great, however. This and Siamese Dream are my picks for the best two albums of the 90's.
