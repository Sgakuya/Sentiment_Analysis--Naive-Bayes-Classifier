It kinda scares me when I agree with axlrod2003 (LOL) but in this case I must. Everything in this store looks as though it was purchased at a garage sale somewhere deep in the burbs featuring reworked vintage stuff from the late 60's and early 70's. Old Navy never seems to fail to constantly serve up the biggest selection of drab prison hues, cheap looking tightness, and offensively ugly styles found anywhere. And girls if your butt doesn't look big enough to you slap on a pair of those low ridders and add a few pounds...come on you KNOW nobody looks good in those so at least don't let the fashion gurus of the moment sell you on that one.
