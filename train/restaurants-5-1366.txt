I manage a Sonic Drive In, and am troubled by many of thses comments that have been made. The root of these complaints does lie with the manager and owners. It disturbs me even more that it seems the managers do not care that their stores are reciveing these types of complaints. There are many drive in operators and managers who do care about the quality of service and food. Sonic Coporation does care about them as well. They have implemented many new training programs for the managers and owners to participate in. However, if they do not care initally training will not help them either. I urge all customers who have comlaints to contact the managers, if they do not care find out the owners name and number. We also have this number 1-866-ok-sonic. Someone will definatley help you. The complaints logged will not just go to the managers, but to co-op supervisors, owners, and to corporation. I am very proud to work for Sonic; and take full advantage of the additional training to help me run a better store for our customers. I hope that you will give the Sonics who do care a chance to give you a full fledged Super Sonic experience.
