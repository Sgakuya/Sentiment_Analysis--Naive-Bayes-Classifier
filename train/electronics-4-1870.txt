This is a good system, but I don't think that it can top PS2. Sure, the graphics are insanely nice, but still that is the only thing that is better. The controller is somewhat bulky and the system is somewhat large... but not much larger than PS2, especially in length. No memory cards... which is okay, but I like to steal my friends card so i can skip to the end of storyline games. I would say that PS2 is only better by 0.50 if it was on a scale of 0-10. I like the fact of the 4 controller slots, but NOT the controllers. The DVD remote is about 20-30$, which isn't really that bad.. considering that a PS2 DVD remote (not REQUIRED, but is nice to have) is also around the same price. Otherwise, I still think that this is a great system with few flaws. PS2 and gamecube are also good, but I think PS2 just is a little better than all 3. Still, I really like this system.
