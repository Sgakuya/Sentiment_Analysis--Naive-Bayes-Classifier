I live 'ere! To any one visiting, a few hints: London is great for a few days but it is NOT true England. Great history architecture museums sites etc but unless you have lots of money you will find it very expensive. To me it seems everyone is out to rip off tourists and this is a shame. Also i find a great many people are not british! I know this sounds xenophobic but about 20 - 30% are recent immigrants and thats the official figures. The best places are the great towns with historical sites, the country houses, the hills of the lake district Pennines and Scotland, the proper english towns and villages,Pubs that are not teen discos or restaurants.Places that try hard to be hospitable and provide good food, service,etc are becoming more apparent. Please come and remember to persevere: you are always an hour away from a gem of a place . And we do talk about the weather a lot!!
