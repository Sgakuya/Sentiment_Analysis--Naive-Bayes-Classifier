To be fair, I dropped out after the first class, which in my case was COM525 (on ground). Supposedly, it was a managerial communications and ethics class, but all we really did was learn how to use UOP's website. Lectures were nonexistent. Class consisted of people taking turns reading documents. We had discussions every week, and all the class really decided was, yes, ethics differ from person to person. I think MBAs in general are overrated; I think UOP MBAs are worthless. If it's knowledge you desire, then buy textbooks and study them yourself. If it's only the degree you desire, then go somewhere else. By the way, the University of Phoenix is actually a for-profit company named the Apollo Group. Think about that before you sign up.
