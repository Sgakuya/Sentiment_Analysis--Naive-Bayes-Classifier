The town is really rough, ugly and the people keep accosting you. I even had one gal who seemed friendly to me, but then it turns out she had something to sell (I won't say what) and when I expressed no interest whe started cussing me and I felt fearful in the district. Not enough police on the stree either, they seem to be hiding out in cars or in other places, likew guarding he cruise ship harbour. The roads are just a mess of confusion too, they just seem to weave around, no clear directions to them. And the whole terrain is not kept up, weeds seem to sprout everywhere, junked cars are left beside the road and no effort made to keep the vegetation trim and neat. The place is just like a third world country, it seems to me. This is strange, as it used to be British, and I usually htink of them as neat people, especialy with gardening.
