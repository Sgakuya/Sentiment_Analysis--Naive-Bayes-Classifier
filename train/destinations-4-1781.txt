I was born and raised in Upstate New York, and have grown to love this country very much. Despite it's problems (which every country has) it is a nation filled with some of the greatest bunch of folks. Whether it is the rocky west coast, the deserts and plains of the midwest, the beaches and hospitality of the south, the beautiful Adirondack mountains in the northeast or the farms of New England, the United States is a very diverse land but we all have something in common. We value our freedom. I love the United States, and what it stands for and no matter what anybody says, nothing will stop me from loving the red, white and blue!!
