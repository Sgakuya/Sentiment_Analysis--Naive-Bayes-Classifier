 Well, it looks like at least a few of mindless masses are on to Corzine in some respects. I followed Corzine's race in New Jersery through the primary and general and had a web site that detailed his involvement in the Bilderberg Group,to which Corzine is on the steering committee. Not one word of his membership in Bilderberg was raised by anyone on either side during the campaign.If your not up to snuff on Bilderberg, contact me and I'll provide some background on Bilderberg's love affair with New Jersey. A dangerous organization in it's own right, and Jon Corzine is their stay behind agent in the US Senate. He was in attendance this year also.
