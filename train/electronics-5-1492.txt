A lifelong experimenter and designer, Paul W. Klipsch was a major force in 20th-Century American audio, winning numerous patents and creating many classic products that continue to inspire engineers today. Few mature audiophiles today could have failed to be influenced by the Klipsch sound. In the 1950s and '60s, Klipsch loudspeakers were essential components in high-fidelity systems. Powered by electronics from companies like Marantz, McIntosh, Scott, and Fisher, even the earliest generations of high-efficiency Klipsch speakers were capable of astoundingly lifelike dynamics and detail. The sonic realism that today's best systems can deliver is in many ways the result of ground-breaking work done by Klipsch with his Klipschorn, LaScala, Belle, Cornwall, and Heresy models. He was often quoted as saying, What this country needs is a really good five-watt amplifier. Tubes + Horns = Music
