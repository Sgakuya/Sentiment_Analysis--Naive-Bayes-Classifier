A fearless shooter who has a variety of inside the post and outside shots, plus he can play with his back to the hoop and also can put up a jump hook and other shots. I didn't like it when the Lakers gave up on him. On the downside, he's a very soft defender -he plays 3 feet off the player he's defending and plays everyone in a 'zone defense.' Also, he's a strictly 1 on 1 basketball player, one of the worst of the lot (in terms of decision making and passing up open teammates) and partially because he does take so many bad shots, he has always had a poor shooting percentage. He's a streak shooter. When he's on, he's on like nobody, and he can also go cold for weeks at a time. He really needs to improve his team play and get other people involved because he has the potential to shoot his team out of a game as often as he helps his team win.
