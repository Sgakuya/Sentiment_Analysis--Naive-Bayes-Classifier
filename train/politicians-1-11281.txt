Herein likes the quintessential dilemma with the Democratic party- it's exclusively the home of radical liberals like this dirtball. Recently reveiwer Flick posted some very strong and extemely detailed reveiws of Durbin in which he asked for patriotic Democrats to take a stand but here's the problem: there aren't any! Recently Durbin compared our troops to Nazis, our detainment of terrorists equivalent to the Gulags and America to the Stalin, Hitler and Pol Pot regimes ON THE SENATE FLOOR NONETHELESS! (Lucky he didn't make an off the cuff remark at a birthday party he might have been forced to resign) Where are all the liberals decrying this slander? There are none simply because liberals actually agree with his language. To liberals AMERICA is the Evil Empire- we're the fascists! Bush is the Nazi! We have a terrorist threat none like we've ever seen and liberals are fixated on distorting the record of our war effort, our procedures and actions for political gain. Where were all the posts written by liberals when Nick Burg had his head chopped off of Al Jazeera? How about the Itlalian journalist? How about the French social worker? None! And when you point out the disparity of their efforts, the penumbra of their America bashing anti-patriotic claims they act appalled and pull hissy fits. Who are you to call me anti-American? (Well if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck...) But then forget it if a couple terrorists report having been mistreated by our troops- we'll have full length 5000 character hyperbolic denunciations of our troops, the President, and our country. And when the facts don't comport to their mendacious claims- facts be damned! We've taken in close to 60,000 detainees only 600 of the most hard-core terrorists were taken to Gitmo. They were all given military hearings at which time every one of them could present evidence in their defense and after which 15 were released. And these aren't even combatants covered under the Geneva convention. (three immediately returned to terrorist activity) Detainees are given religiously sensitive meals three times a day, allowed to pray, are given directions and times observances, and those engaging in good behavior are allowed recreational time. (do you think if the terrorist captured George Bush they'd be feeding him Doritos? Do you think the Islamic world would be up in arms about him being photographed in his undies? Oh right he'd be beheaded- on TV nonetheless) Of 60,000 detained less than 0.1% have died in US custody. (many of whom attacked troops) Of those less than 0.0067% are being investigated for possible negligence. Lets contrast this with how hostages- not combatant-but HOSTAGES are treated by the terrorists? Do you ever hear the liberals crying incessantly about them? Of course not! The problem lies purely in the underlying philosophy that liberals hold. The world exists as a power struggle for earthly desires- there is in essence a dualism between the being and the person and therefore all human action is derived from the person. It follows then that actions fullfill earthly desires inherent only in the person- and political structures are therefore mearly systemic divisions of power nothing more. Through this paradigm a dead body is dead body, all torture is torture and an individual right is a right regardless of individual behavior. This is why you'll see banners at liberal rally's like stop the cycle of violence. Violence you see exists in a vacuum and when used it's ambivilent between causes. So to a liberal Bush is terrorist- you see that claim daily here on RIA. To a liberal America is a butcherous regime like Nazi Germany, Stalin's USSR, Pol Pot's Khemer Rouge. To a liberal we are the crusaders trying to impose our views on the Islamic world. Ah just ignore that Fatwa! They really don't want to impose fundamentalist Islam on us and the rest of the world.
