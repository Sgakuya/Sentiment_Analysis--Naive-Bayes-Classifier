Ariel Sharon is the man that GOD has placed in power for Israel at this time in history. Ariel Sharon is a master-mind military genius. Since all nations will be coming against Israel, there needs to be a leader who knows what to do for the people at that time. Ariel Sharon is this man. We all need to read the promise GOD gave to Abraham when he was asked by GOD to come out from where he was living and believing and begin the Jewish nation. Genesis 12:3 is a promise from GOD. If we do what this promise says, either individually or as a nation, we will receive the reward. GOD is a covenant-keeping GOD! Just the fact that the nation of Israel exists proves that GOD exists, and that HIS Word is true and relevant for today.
