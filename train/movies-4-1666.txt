I guess I didn't see the actual Tiger as it was crouching in the movie...but I enjoyed the movie none the less. Perhaps it happened while I got up for more popcorn. I dunno. As for understanding the techniques and cinematography in this motion picture, I think they enhanced it greatly using the approach they did. The old Bruce Lee movies were my favorites. Because they showed the feareness of real martial arts. Bruce was an awesome fighter...! Since then the only Chinese actor to come along who even comes close to Bruce Lee is now...Jett Lee. Jackie Chan is an 'entertainer' and holds way way back in actual martial arts violence and devasting destruction as a result of using the ancient ways of the Chinese warriors. He's ok as an actor tho. Regarding Crouching Tiger tho, they seem to stay with the ancient ways and history and they maintained keeping my interest through out. Some traditional Chinese Martial Art Movies can become rathe tedious at times is my point. I enjoyed this one...! Gung Hei Fat Choi..!
