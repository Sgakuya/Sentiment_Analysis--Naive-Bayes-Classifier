NHL 2002 continues the great tradition of hockey games from EA Sports, but this new entry takes some getting used to. No one will fault its improved graphics, immersive animation or excellent player AI. But the gang at Vancouver have taken a different approach to the whole feel of the game by veering sharply off into the land of the wacky. The commentary by Jim Hughson and new colour man Don Taylor has very little to offer to the proceedings save for a constant patter of jokes; some continually funny and most annoyingly inane. Your first reaction might be to turn it off, but if you keep with it it actually becomes less intrusive and ends up acceptable for all but the most hardened puckhead. It also seems to be a bit more accurate to what is actually happening on your monitor, but you'll still get instances where you'll be shooting puck after puck into the net and the guys comment how well the opposing goalie is doing. As a whole though, the entire package is the tightest PC hockey game yet and provides lots of thrills with new checks and player abilities like blocking shots and deflecting pucks in front of the net. There's a new twist too added with NHL hockey cards that you can collect and then use ingame to boost player stats and unlock hidden features in the game. Even if you already have the amazing 2001 version of EA's NHL, plunk your loonies down and pick up the new one. Top shelf!
