It is a beautiful island in the Hauraki Gulf, about 30 minutes by Ferry from Auckland. It has something of interest for everyone! Great beaches, swimming, surfing, skin-diving, fishing, water-skiing, sailing, etc. Many of the beaches are so isolated, or secluded, they are virtually uninhabited. There is clothing optional beaches. The Island has vineyards, artists, art centers, wonderful restaurants, pubs on the beach with garden bars, and entertainment. Bus tours, and boat tours, and fishing expeditions are available. There a horse riding center, and horse treks. Many original stores. Friendly locals. The best selection of a variety of beach types in a small area that I have ever seen. Just a great little island!
