Pamela Anderson SUCKS - literally (and quite well as she demonstrated on that infamous video tape) and she sucks as an actress. At least in a porno movie she can truly show her skills. She simply has no acting ability to be an actress of any type. She is not beautiful. Don't believe what you see in magazines - you'd be surprised what a good photographer, good lighting, and graphic designer can do. Most of what you see when you look at her is fake, but that doesn't seem to make any difference for most people. She was NOT funny on SNL- her attempt at being funny was the only thing laughable. And I feel sorry for the 13 year old girl who posted her comment below. It's very pathetic.
