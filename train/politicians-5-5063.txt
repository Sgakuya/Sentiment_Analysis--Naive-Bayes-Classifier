Most people look at this guy as a boring stiff. But he's not! If you would just look at this guy a little more closer, you would see that he's actually a pretty cool guy (You'd probably know I mean if you have read his Rolling Stone interview). Sure, I may disagree with a few of his views (He's pro-death penalty) but overall, I think that he's a very good politician. A shame that he goes through years of hard work and experience in politics and falls short of his ultimate goal (the presidency) because Jeb was too chicken to do what's fair and let them recount the votes in the state of Florida, cause he was too afraid that his brother would lose. He really got the raw deal that time, but he'll be back.
