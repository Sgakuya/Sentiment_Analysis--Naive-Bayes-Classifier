I seriously don't care if you fascist ten year old Hilary fans rate my comment as unhelpful just because you don't like hearing different opinions. Go ahead, cowards. Anyway, onto Hilary herself. This young woman is terribly untalented. She cannot act, period. It's very cheesy and overdone, and she has no range. And her singing is a joke! She really can't sing at all, the songs are fairly catchy but her cheesy lyrics are generic and uninspired. My only conclusion to how she got famous is that she's cute, blonde, and marketable to tweens. I'd give her one star but I respect her for not skanking it up and showing off her boobs and ass at every opportunity like Lindsay Lohan. Plus, I REALLY hate it when people say she is fat, because she clearly isn't.
