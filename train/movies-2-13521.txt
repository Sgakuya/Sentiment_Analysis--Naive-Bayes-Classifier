Once again Andrew Scott has blown me away with a great movie review and it even convinced me to change my review a little bit on this particular movie. I still do not care for the movie, and I still wouldn't recommend it to children or maybe not even most teenagers, but after reading Andrew's thoughtful review on this movie, I don't any longer consider it to be about straight couples not being able to live in love and harmony. I do still feel the movie has too much hate and violence in trying to make its point about beauty, but maybe that is the only way some people can find love...I don't know. I just don't care for this movie, and I will never watch it again. But it isn't near as bad as other movies out there, that is for sure. And as always, Kevin Spacey is an excellent actor and can pull anything off that is put before him.....
