If you took all the funny performances ever filmed, loaded them onto a space craft and shot them into outer space, we would have no fewer minutes of Whoopi Goldberg performing. I've never heard that woman utter so much as a single funny phrase. Moreover, everything she says is racist. She takes on some schlocky, Jewish moniker and that's supposed to absolve her of responsibility for being racist? If she was white, everyone would hammer on her for her non-stop diatriabe on white people this, black people that. If her new show Whoopi makes it past 5 episodes, the French are right, Americans are complete idiots.
