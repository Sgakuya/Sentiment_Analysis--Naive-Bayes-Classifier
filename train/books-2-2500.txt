Years ago, when I was a young kid reading the funny pages, this strip was amusing at least some of the time. But it ran its course a long time ago. It suffers from a permanent case of the stale cuties, and is not funny or even creative. It keeps running the same few gags...e.g., the kids are supposed to go on an errand and instead of going straight there, they do countless other things along the way, punctuated for the reader by a meandering dotted line. That was pretty good the first time, but then it was repeated over over until the reader became embarassed with it. And those insane characters with names like I dunno and Not Me were dumb the first time around, and grow more insipid with each repitition.
