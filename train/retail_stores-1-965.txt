On behalf of Abercrombie Fitch, we'd like to thank all of the weak minded, painfully insecure unoriginal teenagers that shop our stores containing a wide array of highly overpriced products bearing our name to fit in with the rest of the popularity-hungry crowd that have made us the ever-expanding company we are today. When you walk into our stores, the way people see you will change dramatically. Don't have a lot of friends? Not a problem! For just $39.95 you can purchase one of our all inclusive white cotton tees (With Abercrombie Fitch logo on back side sleeve) and transform yourself from independent self assured to that cool, sleek sexy conformity everyone else wants you to be! Can't make friends with the super cool, fake crowd? Just come through our registers, and, for a limited time only, with any purchase of $600 or more, (not including tax) we'll throw in a bottle of our hippest new I Forgot How to be Myself This Seemed Like a Great Alternative cologne spray free with your order! That's right! Just a few pairs of blue jeans, a few tank tops a hoodie, with Abercrombie Fitch logo printed on front AND back (because people have to know that you're cool from behind too- who knows who may run up and talk to you!) and you're on your way to smelling great. Who knows, maybe your whole life will change! So what do you say? Let us say it for you! Give us a try! Abercrombie Fitch, helping more and more people become shallow, superficial dependent on our merchandise to give them their identidy, one day at a time. -Starbreeze672
