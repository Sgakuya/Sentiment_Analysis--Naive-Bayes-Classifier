You know it's funny how people like Redoedo can drive through a state once or twice and know it's entire worth. Arkansas is a great state. The beauty of places like Hot Springs, The Ozarks, and Eureeka Springs is unsurpassed in most states. (Just looking at what's off of I-30 is a ridiculous way to judge the state Redo ). The people are friendly, the weather is warm and you can go out at night without worrying about being beaten or raped. And while there's a tremendous difference in the people and landscape of North and South Arkansas, they are both great in their own way. On more thing; you shouldn't hold anything against Arkansas for that last s**t of a president we had. Just because Clinton was from here doesn't mean he's in any way an accurate representative of the people of Arkansas.
