I tried Marie Callender's Beef Salisbury Steak Frozen dinner with macaroni and cheese and green beans. The vegetables were fine, but the meat was terrible. First, it had this God awful smell and it tasted worse than the smell. I took one bite and almost spit it out. It hurt me to swallow it. (I'm the type of person that hates to waste food.) Then I held my breath and took another bite of it. This dinner might as well have been a vegetable plate. This is the worst M/C Frozen Dinner I've had and I've tried them all. I don't know who tasted this before it was put in stores but they must've had congestion out of this world.
