Good, though flawed solo album from '71. Some weak tracks, but the bitter tunes are the best if you can get past his anger and cynicism, and political rants ( or insights, depending on your views): the old timey "Crippled Inside," the McCartney bashing "How Do You Sleep?" and the venomous politically charged "Gimme Some Truth," which may have inspired Christopher Guest's hilarious National Lampoon parody of Lennon: "Magical Misery Tour." The title track and the sad ballad "Jealous Guy," which was later covered by Bryan Ferry, are the best known cuts. Members of the Moody Blues and Badfinger, George Harrison, and legendary sax player King Curtis contribute to this fine, but not spectacular album.
