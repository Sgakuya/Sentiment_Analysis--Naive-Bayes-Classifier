St. George itself is actually a rather small town, easy to see on foot, but there's a wealth of history to take in. Sites relating to both British and American (particularly the Civil War--Bermuda was a storage point for British armaments destined for the Confederacy) history abound. As for the rest of Bermuda, it's a beautiful place, with friendly people and magnificent views. However, don't come here expecting sprawling resorts and wild nightlife like in Jamaica, the Bahamas, and the Virgin Islands. Bermuda is a much more stoic place, built upon the old British traditions. Definitely not a place to bring small children.
