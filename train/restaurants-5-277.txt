In-N-Out is an exceptional restaurant. They do not franchise, one family owns the whole show. The menu IS limited, but they know what they are doing. They do one thing (hamburgers and cheeseburgers) and they are the best available in a fast food environment. The fries tend to be undercooked... Ask for them well done, which they are happy to do... and suddenly they become the best fries ever. You can get your burger with or without onions and they will gladly grill onions for your burger. You can also order items which are not on the menu... 3x3 and 4x4 (triple and quad meat patties). In-N-Out is simply the best. $5.00 gets you a double double (two meat patties), fries and a drink. You just can not go wrong.
