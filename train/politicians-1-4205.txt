Ralph Nader was my hero. I became socially conscious and active because of him. He really does know Gore is better for our country than Bush. I'll give up my subscriptions for Consumer's Digest and the Sierra Club because I am so mad at him and the Green Party. A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. People wake up! Do we really want to return to Reaganomics and what we went through in the 1980's? Gore was one of the leaders in bringing the environment to the national forefront. Nader and the Green Party have their own political ambitions before the good of this country and its citizens. I am praying for Al Gore and I am praying for this country. Ralph Nader has lost all of my support.
