Unfortunately, I am a customer of the infamous Alltel family! I was warned beforehand, but obviously, I did't take heed. The service is terrible and the customer service representatives are even worse! I have had problems with my services since day one, but no one(Alltel) seems to care.I went to one of the Alltel stores assuming that I would be helped,but that turned out to be an even bigger mistake. The store employees called the company store but nothing was accomplished, even after being put on hold for over two hours. That disgusted me! You people at Alltel really need to get it together because before long, you will be rated the worst wireless company in the world. I have a phone that constantly cuts off during conversations or when I am trying to make calls. I am not permitted to change phones nor will they try to find out the problem for me. Alltel SUCKS and as far as I am concerned, Alltel IS the worst phone company in the world!
