What was amazing about woodson was the very few chances he got on both offense and defense and how he turned the game on each chance. Sure, a QB can throw 40 passes a game against central-western-mid university and 10% of them may be touchdowns. However, Woodson was the guy that got one pass in the Penn State game -- Touchdown to him with the whole defense watching him. In the Ohio State game, woodsone shut down the best receiver in the big 10 that year - David Boston --- and once again in his handful of touches got a punt return touchdown. Game after game with less than a handful of touches Woodson made the huge play. P.S. for those Manning lovers, Manning never showed for the big game. The difference between the Heisman and the runner up is the guy who shows for the big game.
