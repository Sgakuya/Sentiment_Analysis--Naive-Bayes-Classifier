Despite being one of the smallest and most densely populated states in the highly urban northeastern corridor, Connecticut offers forests, charming small towns and villages, and pastoral farm lands that are not far from sophisticated cultural amenities. Look into Putnam in the secluded northeastern corner for antiques and historic homes. Or check out the urban grit of New Haven- for Yale University and great places to eat. Litchfield in the quiet northwestern hills has a neat town center and green with white steeple churches and interesting shops. Mystic seaport and the southeastern coast offer historic sites and fine beaches- especially for a former Californian like myself. So much to do for visiting or living, yet close to everything. A very progressive state, that offers broad minded tolerance for all.
