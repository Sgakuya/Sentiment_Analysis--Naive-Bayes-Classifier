Every time I watch the movie "Forrest Gump", with its obvious symbolism of the baby boom generation, I think of the Clinton presidency. In many ways the Clinton presidency similarly personifies my generation. Bill Clinton assumed a presidency where all the dirty work had been done in previous administrations. Whether it was Reagan moving the economy or Bush taking an unpopular military action, all evidence pointed to some good years ahead. Indeed our economy boomed and our security seemed as strong as ever. Unfortunately, Clinton squandered it all because his personal (not presidential) actions. Whether it was his infamous "I didn't inhale" marijuana statement, his fabled womanizing or the final Lewinsky scandal, President Clinton proved to us that he was unable to express any impulse control. He disgraced his office and, in the process, disgraced us all. "If it feels good, do it" was the mantra of my generation and it will be remembered as the Clinton logo as well. He not only disregarded the many opportunities that were given him, but showed an amazing level of disrespect in the process. He was able to single handedly destroy the potential of the democratic party and virtually guarantee republican victories until all of us can forget about him. Hillary would have a reasonable chance if she can get away from him. To all my fellow democrats, I urge you to quit defending President Clinton and instead sweep this disgrace under the rug with the rest of the hidden dirt.
