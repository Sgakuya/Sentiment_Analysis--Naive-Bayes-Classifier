I think Columbia's medical school is among the best in the country. Although, the first 2 years of any medical school are not much fun for anyone, the integrated pathophysiology course that spans the second year has evolved to become both engaging and informative. Third year is spent mostly at Columbia-Presbyterian hospital where the physicians and surgeons are fantastic doctors, teachers, and mentors. The sites for the primary care rotation now include fabulous opportunities to go to Indian reservations and underserved areas accross the country. The Columbia students (majority are Ivy Leaguers) are diverse in age and interests and spend a lot of time outside the classroom pursuing a variety of activities, most of which are supported by the very cool P S club. Of course, the NYC location is great for anything else. Loved it and recommend it to all.
