This was certainly a Good film as the rating denotes but not one of their best. I was definitely disappointed by having high expectations. I felt as though, like so many actors or films makers that have a couple of hits, that they tried (and tried too hard) to pull together all the good elements that they produced in past films and repackage them into this one. There were way to many similiarity of music, dialogue, camera use etc. and ufortunately it didn't come across well in my mind because it felt like they were ripping off themselves. For instance the scene near the end of the movie after Owen Wilson has crashed his Austin Healey into the Tenenbaums house. All the fire trucks are there and the camera is going from group to group recording disjointed thoughts and individual moments within that scene as it pans through the crowd. This is EXACTLY the same tactic as they used in Rushmore just before the play begins and they go from audience member to audience member and listen in on what their saying This kids gonna burn this place down , I gotta use the phone , Apparently the plans were never formally submitted to the city etc. Great, original use but just felt strained in this case. Still liked the film, thought Hackman was very good, Glover was good, Houston is creepy (still) and Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, and the guy who played Mr. little jeans in Rushmore were all good.
