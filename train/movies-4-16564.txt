I saw this movie expecting to be disappointed but was surprisingly impressed. I think what I loved most about it was the amount of depth of each character and the realness of the situation. They all had traits that could be annoying or redeeming. Yes you do want to slap some sense into Barrymore's character but I personally have known very young mothers who have done by far much worse in similar situations. They usually have no dreams, they don't give up their partying and often forget their poor kids' birthdays. But there was an up and down side to everything. Like I admired her for not accepting her parents' help and working that much harder, but then felt it was a pity she wouldn't just humble herself and accept their help so she wouldn't have to resort to aiding drug dealers and handing her son all the household responsibilities. Then Fay for example, she was always sweet and supportive even when she saw Bev's flaws, but it seemed that she never had to work a day in her life nor had any desire to. But, it's like your friends and family in real life - sometimes you're crazy about them, sometimes you wanna ring their neck. That's what I loved about this movie.
