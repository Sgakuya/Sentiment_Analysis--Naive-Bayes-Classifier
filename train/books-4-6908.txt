This series *used* to be my favourite. I have all of the books up until the ninth installment - 'Winter's Heart', and that's where I stopped. I simply couldn't deal with the overabundance of characters, the extremely busy plotlines, and the fact that every time a new book came out, I'd have to re-read the entire series over again just to keep track of where I'd last left off. The first few books - say up until the fifth or sixth - were fantastic. Incredible characters that existed a mind-boggling world of beauty and depth, mysterious and exciting happenings...I was addicted. Now, however, I have no patience for the complicated nature of the story, but would still recommend it to those who want to spend their time and money on a quality series.
