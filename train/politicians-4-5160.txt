I like the man. I voted for the man. Even I can see that he will never take this election. I think it is time to pack all the lawyers in the van and surrender to the Floridians. W made his point. Our country is, in fact, more stupid than I suspected. The only solace I find is knowing that W will only last 4 years. Hopefully at that point, the democrats will be able to find someone who is not only more than qualified (as is Al), but someone who can find a way to campaign successfully in Florida. I am disheartened by the whole process, and I am angered by the fact that my vote and the votes of 49 states seem not to matter in this election. I take some small comfort in knowing that Al won the popularity contest -- take that W!
