I grew up in a house where I was taught God, country and family. Having lived in CA as a small child when Reagan was governor I heard many good things about his leadership. I helped campaign for him in 1980 even though I wasn't old enough to vote. In 1984 I proudly cast my vote for him as President and never regretted it. After the last 8 yrs of the kind of administration we had, I longed for the Reagan years. A time when I felt safe in this country, when we had a leader who said what he meant, and meant what he said. A leader who believed in God, country and family. He was not a perfect president, but he gave a lot of us what we needed at that time. It was morning in America, and once again I felt pride in this country. God bless America, and God bless Ronald Reagan.
