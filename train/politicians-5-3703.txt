Thank you, President-elect Bush for the humble and thoughtful acceptance speech. Please don't give into the liberal left that want your policies (and campaign promises) diluted. Your campaign was the first one that I found myself totally behind. You have shown Americans that you are above the gutter tactics of the Democrats. We now have the White House, the Senate, and the House. While we have control PLEASE hear your fellow American's conservative cries!! Get us the great justices like Renquist and Scalia. Get rid of not only partial birth abortion, but all abortion! Who cares how many liberals we offend? Do it for us, Mr. President!
