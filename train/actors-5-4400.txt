Jason is terribly under-rated in the Hollywood industry. He truly stole the show in The Patriot, and had it not been for his creative genious in developing his charactor, Tavington, the film would've flopped! Jason has all the necessary qualities that it takes to be an enduring, superb actor, not just another of your basic eye-candy stars. Part of the beauty of this man is his humbleness of himself, and the respect for those he works with. The entertainment industry in the US could greatly benefit by considering him for more roles other than those of the villian . If you've only seen Jason in The Patriot, you're denying yourself a very pleasurable experience! I suggest Divorcing Jack , Dangerous Lady , and The Fix , to name a few..,
