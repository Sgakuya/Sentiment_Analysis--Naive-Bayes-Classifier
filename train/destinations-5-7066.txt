I've heard mixed reviews from friends of mine who have been here, but I can't say enough about my five days in Barcelona. I went there alone on a whim, not knowing what to expect. I didn't want to leave... everything was so incredible! Gaudi's architecture, La Sagrada Familia church, the city parks, Parc Guell, the port area on the Mediterranian Sea.... amazing. It got to the point where I decided to challenge the city to show me something that wasn't beautiful, so I got on the subway and got off at a random stop. I came up the subway stairs to find a massive fountain and a huge cobblestone plaza. Visit Barcelona sometime in your life. You won't be disappointed.
