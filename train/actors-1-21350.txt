Honestly i think that hilary duff was doing well on lizzie mcguire until she became a diva and wanted more money.....I CANT BELIEVE she started singing!!!!!! BAD BAD BAD voice. She sounds like a 9 year old in punk clothes dancing like a monkey on stage. Whoever signed her up to do a record was either DRUNK or HIGH!!! hilary duff gave an excuse for making music....she said it was a way for her fans to get to know her better. first of all how can 6-13 year olds understand music she didnt write....if she did write it or even co-wrote it...all of her music sucks!!! HILARY QUIT NOW....SAVE YOUR SELF FROM THE EMBARRASSMENT!!!!
