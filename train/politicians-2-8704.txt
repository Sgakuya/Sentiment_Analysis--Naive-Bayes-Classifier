Grover Cleveland is the only President to ever preside over two seperate administrations, one fro 1885-1889 and the other from 1893-1897. He was a man of devout principle. Cleveland was also a man of honesty and devotion, and every single executive action he made while in office was made because he believed it to be the right thing to do. However, unfortunately, he was unable to exhibit necessary amounts of leadership, espescially during the economic depression during his second term. [Presidential Leadership: ** out of ***** Stars] As I mentioned before, Grover Cleveland failed to exhibit much leadership during his time in the White House. Several pieces of important legislation were passed during his administration, but not due to his efforts. He did advocate significant tariff reductions, but due to his lack of leadership, was unable to achieve much change in that area. He vetoed several bills which would have provided drought relief to western farmers, something which did not help improve the economic conditions of the nation. In two areas, however, Cleveland exhibited significant amounts of leadership. Almost as soon as he assumed office, the Republicans tried to limit his power to remove Republican-appointed federal officials. Cleveland went all around the nation making speeches in opposition, and eventually forced the Republicans to back down. Moreover, Cleveland boldly brought the Monroe Doctrine back to life by sending warships to Venezuela to ward off British warships who hoped to pressure Venezuela into agreeing to extend the borders of British New Guiana into their territory. In his second term, Cleveland did not exhibit any amount of leadership during the economic depression other than successfully repealing The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, which had caused a significant reduction in the production of gold. In a move which signifies strong resolve or tyrannical rule, Cleveland sent federal troops to Chicago to put down a massive railroad strike, alienating many Northern workers from the Democratic Party. In short, Cleveland was not a party hack- rather, he did what he thought was right in his own heart. [2. Foreign Relations: ** out of *****] Cleveland's foreign policy was guided by his opposition to American expansionalism. He firmly opposed the annexation of the Hawaiin Islands. He did bring the Monroe Doctrine back to life by sending troops to Venezuela to face off British warships threatening the nation. Cleveland also declared the United States neutral in the Cuban Independence Issue, costing him a lot of support. His greatest resolve was his sending three warships to the Somoan islands to protect American interests there. This would lead to an eventual triple protectorate over the islands by England, the United States and Germany. [3. Economic Management: * out of ***** Stars] During Cleveland's second term, America entered its worst depression in its history. Due to his strict interpretation of the Constitution, he felt that the federal government had no constitutional powers to end the Depression, and it raged on until the start of the Spanish-American War in 1898 during the McKinley Administration. He vetoed several bills which would have provided drought relief to farmers in the west. Cleveland's failure to deal with the crisis cost the Democrats bigtime in the midterm elections in 1894. [4. Accomplishments/Vision for the Country: ** out of ***** Stars] Cleveland had no real vision for the United States, and giving his inability to exhibit significant amounts of leadership, I doubt that he would have been able to accomplish any of the goals that he may have had. [Final Score: 1.75- ** out of ***** Stars]. In the final analysis, Grover Cleveland is at best a mediocre President in the eyes of most historians. His resolve and dedication is admirable, and he did, in all actuality, do what he thought was right with every executive action he took. However, when you are in a profession in which your decisions affect the lives of so many.... it is not enough to simply believe yourself to be right; in all actuality, you HAVE to be right.
