In a better America, it would have been George W. Bush struggling to get 5% of the popular vote, the race would have been between Ralph Nader and Al Gore, and Ralph Nader would have won it by a landslide. The opinion that a vote for Ralph Nader was a wasted vote or a vote for Bush is idiotic. Unfortunately, 97% of Tuesday's voters wasted their votes by voting for who they presumed to be the lesser of two evils, thus throwing away the opportunity to have the greatest President in America's history. Thank you, Ralph Nader, for trying to get us out of this stupid mess that for whatever reason America keeps chosing.
