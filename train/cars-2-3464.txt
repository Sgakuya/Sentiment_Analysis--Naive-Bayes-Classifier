I bought my 2005 Highlander about 3 months ago. I have 3 major complaints. 1. The acceleration hessitation and transmission jerkiness is really becoming irritating. It seems to be getting worse. I only have 5k miles on the car. I've been in a couple of situations where I felt the hesitation was dangerous and potentially could have caused an accident because I had my foot on the gas and the car wouldn't move. 2. The air throb with the top open and the back windows down is completely unreasonable. This is an incredible design flaw. If I had noticed it before I bought it, I would have gotten something else. 3. The oil filter placement on the 3.3L V6 was poorly thought out. The car has to be cold to change the oil becuase you have to reach up under the exhaust manifold and do everything by feel. It isn't possible to see the filter. There is also no easy way to extract the filter from the engine compartment after it is off because your arm is wrapped around the fan and under the exhaust. You end up spilling oil everywhere.
