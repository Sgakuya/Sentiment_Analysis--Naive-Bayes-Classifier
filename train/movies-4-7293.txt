The quintessential golf comedy. Bill Murray cannot be denied. Ted Knight, Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield are great (who says he can't be a member of the Academy). The film is funny without being completely without merit (as in the badly thought, and poorly realized sequel). I was impressed, and always take a little time to watch it when it's on. The characters are poorly conceived, but the humor makes them palatable. Harold Ramis did quite well with this one. The movie was almost a seventies movie though, and because of that, the viewer must sit through a bad sound track and poorly designed wardrobe. Additionally, the film quality does leave something to be desired, but this one is definitely worth a rent.
