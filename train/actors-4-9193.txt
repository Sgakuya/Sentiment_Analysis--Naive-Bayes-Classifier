Who doesn't like Mary Poppins or Maria from The Sound of Music? (Okay bad question since I'm sure there's someone out there ready to jump all over that one.) Julie Andrews is undeniably talented - good actress, excellent voice (unfortunately now lost), bright, cheery face, flawless complexion. The only thing I didn't like about her when I saw her in films growing up was her funky short red hair - too flat, too blah. One of her most outstanding traits is that she has the ability to come off wholesome regardless of her role. I'm not sure if that doesn't annoy me more at times than it impresses me but I'm sure it depends on my mood.
