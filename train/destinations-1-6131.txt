Another southern border state that reeks of intolerance. Lots of poor people that seem hung up on the idea of 'social fundementalism'- that have no money, no medical care or little else. Worried too much about gay marriage and blind patriotism. UPDATE: DONOVAN I totally respect your opinion- however from friends in KY that I talk with on a regular basis- there is a fair amount of intolerance. I am sure there is some natural beauty- however from my visits I have found much highway debris and also seen much poverty. There seems to be a fair amount of people that are not too bright. Sorry to say KY deserves its mediocre rating. Also if the state was so 'enlightened'how could it re-elect a silly fool like Jim Bunning?
