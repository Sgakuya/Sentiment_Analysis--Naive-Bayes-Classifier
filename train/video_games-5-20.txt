I knew this was out but I was still struggling through NOLF2 and I had to finish that first. I didn't know what I was missing and for the first time people were actually surprised that I hadn't already played it - shit, my reputation as a gaming freak was slipping so I loaded it up and enjoyed the game that famously knocked Half Life off the top spot. Being a great historian of WW2 I found myself being taught how to jump, crouch, shoot a gun and throw a grenade. The graphics were amazing and if you've watched Band of Brothers then you are 90% of the way there. It was the only game that allowed me to spend some multiplaying time with my brother, working as a team we infiltrated our objectives, healed our wounds and shouted orders to our online allies. This game gave me that WOW factor that I hadn't experienced since Doom 10 years earlier.
