Hello People! I am a manager of a Whitehall Jewellers store. I have read all of the comments in this section. 1st, let apologize to any of you that have received less then perfect Customer Service (the customer service hotline is 1-800-310-0063). Please realize that or company has close to 400 stores coast to coast, and even though we try to put the right staff into each and every store, we can not expect to will satisfy every person 100% of the time. Here are a few policies to clear things up. The Whitehall Promise of Satisfaction guarantees our customer service continues even after you leave our store. #1. 30-day Money Back Guarantee ( you get back exactly what you pay us with not just store credit. Also, you have 90 days to do an even exchange and a lifetime trade up policy) #2. Lifetime Replacement Guarantee on all Diamonds and Gemstones ( if a stone is lost due to a defect in the mounting. ' IMPORTANT ' to keep this FREE guarantee you have to allow us to check your mounting at least 1 time every 4 months. The easiest way to do this is to stop into a Whitehall store anytime you see it. You have 4 months from the last time you stopped in. Even if you stopped in last month why not take 2 minutes to let us check it again? This will give you 4 more months!) #3. Lifetime Trade-In Guarantee on all Diamonds and Gemstones (this means if you spend $1000 on a diamond ring when you upgrade to a piece that cost $1500 you give us your old ring and $500) #4. Unlimited Free Cleaning and Inspections for the life of your jewelry. Here is our website --> http://www.whitehalljewellers.com
