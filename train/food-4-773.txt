ok so every loop does taste the same. But so what? I've had these my whole life and never got tired of them. They are really sugary - not so good for you - but oh so good to your tastebuds. They do taste artificial but what fruit flavored cereal doesn't? They're mascot is awesome, the cereal is good in milk where it takes on this really sweet flavor and dry where it maintains a sort of sweet and tart taste (they probably put citric acid or something in them to give a resemblance of citrus undertones from the 'lemon' 'orange' and 'lime' loop, even though I'm ready to swear that they only thing that differs between each colour in this cereal is the dye)
