I agree!! Wachovia is awful!!! They have charged me about $400 in fees in the last year!! They pick and choose what to post first and the deposits are ALWAYS posted last!! Twice recently I have called their 800# to check my balance and was told that I have let's say $300 as my available balance. Which means that my ex husband has made his child support deposit into my account. So I go to the grocery store that night and guess what?? The next morning I have an unavailable funds fee charged to my account. To me available means that the money is there and ready to use!! They say that's not how they do things and available really means nothing!! Maybe they need to consult Webster's and find out the meaning of the word!! I wish some lawyer would file a class action lawsuit against them for their unfair and highly deceptive practices. I would certainly join in on it!! As soon as I find another bank that is here in NC and in FL where my ex lives I will tell Wachovia to stick it where the sun don't shine!!
