To bad there wasn't a higher rating than this one for this young man! Christian is undoubtedly one of the finest, in every sense of the word, and most talentedly gifted young actors around these days. It's a shame to say it, but you definitely see it with many of the other actors that are out there and have come to where they are based on how they look or who they know in the industry; but truly leave much to be desired on pure talent and range. Thank God this is NOT SO with Mr. Bale! It's a shame that those in a position to promote this remarkable jewel of acting talent and ability, continue to overlook this rare gem! As for non-descript individuals who refer to themselves with names of nutritionally valueless lumps of artery clogging, calory contributing, cholesterol filled fried pastry dough, I have quite a full life allowing me quite a lot of experience on many different levels in a broad range of areas! I'm proud and glad to say being a Balehead is only one of them! Might add that you take yourself up on your own suggestion and get yourself a life .
