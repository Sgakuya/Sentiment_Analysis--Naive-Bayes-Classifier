After reading McCarthy's The Crossing, I had extremely high expectations for this book. All the Pretty Horses is the story of a couple of Texan farm boys who cross the border into Mexico around the turn of the century. This was a very violent time in this part of the world, and that violence is reflected in many of the adventures which the boys have.

While The Crossing is a more significant book, All the Pretty Horses is an entertaining read, and if you are at all interested in the Texas / Mexico regional history, I would recommend it. However, if you only read one McCarthy book, get The Crossing...
