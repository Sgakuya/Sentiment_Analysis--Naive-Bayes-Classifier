When, oh when, is this man going to receive his well-deserved Oscar? He is one of my favorite character actors, and I have enjoyed his work since he appeared in The Right Stuff. Ed Harris is not gorgeous, yet he dominates every scene he is in. He was so compelling in A Beautiful Mind that it was shock to discover that his character was merely a figment of Nash's tormented imagination. Recently, I saw him in The Hours and he was utterly heartbreaking as the poet dying of AIDS. I would never have imagined that Harris could excel in such a role;his success in portraying the poet illustrates his enormous range. How many actors can you think of who have brilliantly portrayed astronauts, secret agents, and tormented poets?
