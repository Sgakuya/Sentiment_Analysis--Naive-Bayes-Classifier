Virginia Tech is an incredible school. It not only has one of the top engineering schools in the country, but also offers over 120 other majors, including a quality business school, a highly ranked school of urban affairs and planning, quality arts and sciences courses, and an outstanding school of veteranary medicine. A land grant school located in the beautiful New River Valley, Virginia Tech is surrounded by hiking trails, skiing, white water rafting, and many other outdoor activities. The students at Virginia Tech are at once friendly, accessible, spirited, and loyal. Its athletics are outstanding, including its football program which competed in the national championship Sugar Bowl this January. All of this for a bargain tuition. It's the perfect school.
