Ok for one thing...i know JJ's family personally and they are not rich they make a hard earned living like everyone else. My family is by no stretch of the word rich and i have a basketball goal in my driveway thank you. JJ may not be the best defender in the country...but he is probly one of the best shooters! 8 games into the season and he has only missed 3 foul shots! He holds the record for consecutive free throws in the ACC and is projected to be one of the best free throw shooters in NCAA history by the end of his career. Another thing...Duke would not have won against Oklahoma last week if he wasn't on his game. He is penutrating to the basket more and his ball handling has improved immensly since last year. JJ may not be a LeBron James or Michale Jordan but i know that he will be respected for his abilities in the NBA...after his gets his college education. Put that in you pipe and smoke it UNC!
