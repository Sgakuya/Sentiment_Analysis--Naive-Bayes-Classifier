 The high felt as the plane passes over the Grand Canyon and then just ahead you see the lights of Vegas is undescribable. The pilot says we will be landing in Vegas in 20 minutes. And the lights get closer and closer and bigger and bigger. Then you land!! It's an amazing feeling walking off that plane. The sound of those slot machines and the advertisements for the shows gets me spyched. Waiting in that big line for a Cab and then finally getting driven to the hotel on the strip amidst the light is just incredible. Playing blackjack till 6am, drinking a vodka and cranberry. If I win enough money I may call one of those girls on the cards that are all over the place. Oh Vegas! Viva Las Vegas!! Viva Las Vegas!! Viva Las Vegas! As for the rest of the state I have no idea. I guess I should venture out. There's plenty of brothels outside of Clark County! Whoo!!!!!!!11 Whooo!!!!!!1
