Pure genius! The depraved behavior of the main protagonist of this game is truly something to marvel at. CJ kills gangsters,drug dealers, innocent bystanders, cops, firemen, ambulance/taxi/truck drivers, and will beat on his woman if you want him to, although she might pull out a gun and start shooting at his ass when he starts with that crap( You go girl!) -- Also the shear size of this game is amazing. Three times the land area of the first two games .... COMBINED. I think this game has exploited all of the talents of the PS2 platform. The graphics could have been sharper and less pixelated, but that would have meant giving up the massive size of the game. Not a trade off I would like. Anyway the next platform from Sony should remedy that dilema. In the meantime I'll enjoy what we have here, which is a masterpiece of a game that will surely test ones moral compass ............ 32,647 kills and counting.
