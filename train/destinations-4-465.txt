I've been to the Bahamas 5 times and this was my best visit(March 2004). Had a wonderful time because we got away from the tourist traps/shops and walked throughout the city. Visit Nadyia's Frozen Yougart off of Bay Street(between Bay St Clothing and Shoe Store, kinda like the alley) and don't let the name fool you, the food was wonderful & priced reasonably. Owners were very friendly and accommodating. Bahamas has really cleaned up the place since my last visit so there's not too much begging/soliting. Looks really good and clean. The newest annoyance is the hotels trying go get you into time share schemes.
