I disagree with you Louie... He's above average in my eyes. He managed to get an 1,000+ yard season this year with the Browns' suspect line. Right now he ranks in the top 10 backs, and would be even further along if he had a team around him. He's a helluva tough hard worker and the definition of a team player. He would be even more devastating as one half of a one-two punch, either as a short yardage back or as a running fullback. Still, he's a better feature back than Clinton Portis or Tatum Bell. He's stronger than probably the two of them put together. He's fully capable as a pass blocker, and he is a decent reciever. More importantly, he has far better stamina than either. Plus, being a bigger back, he can bruise a defense into submission as the game goes on. Neither Bell nor Portis could do that. I think Shanahan made a mistake in letting him go. If the Browns build around him and get a solid o-line to help out Braylon Edwards and Charlie Frye, they could have a top 5 offense as soon as next year. That's a big task though, since their line is below average across the board at best. It'd take at least one early round draft pick and a big free agent to make the line no longer be a liability.
