I don't get the reasoning that because he had a quickie with an intern, he's no good as a President. The thing to look at is did he do a good job as President? The opposition parties were trying non-stop to find something to stick on him and the persecution of this was far out of proportion to the deed committed. I don't know how his policies were perceived domestically but from this side of the pond he was a diplomat, engaging, had charisma, helped formulate a number of social and ethical issues around the world, as well as peace initiatives, was globally orientated and respected abroad for it, believed in equality and left office with the best fiscal health ever. Maybe someone will correct me, but during his time the US economy and general welfare of the people were the healthiest they've been.....,weren't they?
