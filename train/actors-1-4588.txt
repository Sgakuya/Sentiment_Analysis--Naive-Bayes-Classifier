Carrey is a mediocre actor at best. His comedy relies on crudeness more often than not. Very little intelligent comedy ever came from his brain. Ironic he played Kaufman who did possess a brillliant, if not strange, sense of humor. As to the idea that he has done things for us as a comedian I can only say this... If he wants to do something for me how about a nice $50,000 loan to fix up my house. My life is neither enriched by him as an actor nor as a comedian. Most of his movies have been garbage. Sandler does better and more entertaining comedies and has a certain intelligence to them. Both should stay clear of dramas however. Neither can do it effectively.
