California is a Huge and Diverse State...Their are Mountains,Hills,Valleys,Deserts, Beaches..Their are areas that Look and Feel like your in the Northwest,Midwest,Northeast,South,Southwest or other parts of the Continental U.S..Their are Hot Areas,Cold Areas,Cool Areas,Dry Areas,Rainy Areas,Foggy Areas,Humid Areas,Cloudy Areas,Sunny Areas...Their are Rich Areas,Poor Areas or in Between...Their are Very Safe Areas,Very Dangerous Areas or in Between...Their are Expensive Areas such as along the Coast or in or around the Larger Cities,but their are also More Affordable Areas such as in the Central Valley or in the Deserts... California also has Huge Cities,Small Cities,Big Towns,Small Towns,Densely Populated Areas,Sparsely Populated Areas,Clean and Beautiful Areas,Dirty and Ugly Areas or in Between...Their are areas that are Predominantly White,Black,Hispanic,Asian or all Mixed Together...California also has an Extremely Diverse Economy with a Great Variety of Entertainment... So what i'm basically trying to say is don't rely on other people's Negative or Positive comments on the Entire State,because it's not the same everywhere here...California is not all Crowded,Clogged with Traffic,Polluted,Expensive,Dangerous or infested with Gangs...California is still a Great State to live in and if you don't like one area,their will always be another part of California that you will enjoy to live in or visit.
