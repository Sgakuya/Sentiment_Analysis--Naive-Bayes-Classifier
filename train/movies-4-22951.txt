A very solid film, a minor classic, that touched on a lot of contemporary themes and events, it's a very 1960's kind of film that was based on a mediocre French sci-fi novel by Pierre Boulle.Like Jaws or The Godfather, it's one of those rare movies that are much better than the book. The acting is spotty overall, though Heston is better than he usually is, Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter were good, and Maurice Evans was quite good as Dr. Zaius, a role originally intended for the great Edward G. Robinson. The sequels grew progressively worse, but this film, although often corny or pompous, is fine, and often funny, intentionally or not. The eerie score by Jerry Goldsmith is seldom mentioned, but it was haunting and very effective too.
