Not too bad if you are in the mood for some new releases. However I am a huge fan of horror movies and cheesy sci-fi, which are nowhere to be found at blockbuster. My blockbuster doesn't even have a section for horror, so you might find something like Scream under the comedy or drama section. Pretty weak selection all around, as they tend to carry only the most popular titles. Also, although the staff are always friendly and helpful, I don't like how they insist on calling me by my first name whenever I rent a movie. I may not be any older than they are, but using my first name assumes more familiarity than I am comfortable with. Stop using my name, people.
