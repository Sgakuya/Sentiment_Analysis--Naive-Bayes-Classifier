Great if you are a hardworking family person who wants a top notch place to raise kids, grow old, and be part of a real community. If you are a party college student, who wants to stay out late and have lights and glamour of a big city, then i will admit, that rochester probably isnt your kind of city. I can agree with most people on here, Rochester is deffinetly a perfect place for family life, but probably not for being a young partier. But seeing as most of us grow out of our young partying state, and then are ready to have a family, what it basicaly comes down to is, If you were born and raised in Rochester, and you feel bored when you get out of highschool, go to college in Boston or Chicago or something, but move home after college when you look to have a family. i know they are both minor league, but... GO AMERKS AND GO RED WINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As for the Buffalo bills.... Better luck in the future!
