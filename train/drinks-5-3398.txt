My friends and i have been drinking Twisted tea since it first came out. we consume between 2-3 cases a week. when it first came it was an awsome malt beverage.AS of a month ago here in Maine there was some real bad tasting teas going around. they were all cloudy. at first the Boston beverage was telling the stores that it was frozen thats the reason for the taste and the cloudiness we knew it was BS because we have had some that froze and thawed many of times and they were still like new.so a few days ago Boston Beverage came up to a store where i purchase a lot of my twisted teas for a taste test and they said they could not taste any difference between the cloudy teas and the clear ones We all knew it was BS . Now what Boston Beverage is saying is that twisted tea Co. is putting more Lemon in ther Original teas so this is making them cloudy.if this is the case i will rate this product a 1( we just dumped out over 3 cases of teas because they all tasted like a flat malt beer. and in Maine it's against the law to bring back opened beverage containers to the stores from where you had purchased them from. total BS ) this is why i rate the Oiginal twisted tea a 1 at this time. i am hoping that twisted tea is not changing anything in there recipe because like i said earlier is it was an awsome product. Thanks for listening to me in blowing of some steam. John Pierce Bowdoin, Maine
