St. Petersburg is easily one of the most beautiful, interesting cities I have ever been to. I must qualify my opinion by stating that I went there in the spring of 1991 during the last days of Gorbachev, but from what I've heard from others who have been more recently, things have only improved. Now, the hotel I stayed in and the food and amenities were sorely lacking, but the city is what I'm rating, not the hotel, and what a city it is! On my first day in the city I burned through almost 6 rolls of film, and this was before visiting sites like the Hermitage, St. Isaac's, the Peter and Paul Cathedral, the Summer Palace, etc. For those of you who are unaware of the city's history, Peter the Great brought many of the great architects from Western Europe to Russia to design and build many of the palaces and buildings around the old sections of St. Petersburg. As a result, the architecture is absolutely stunning! If you can imagine streets jammed with cathedrals and palaces equal to any of Western Europe, you've pretty much imagined St. Petersburg. If you like Paris, you haven't seen anything until you've been to St. Petersburg. Just ignore the immature rants of those who wish for a return to the cold war...
