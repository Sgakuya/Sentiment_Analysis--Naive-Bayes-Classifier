Very nice service! I had a pre-paid phone though them before... but it was to expensive to keep buying airtime... so I got a nation 450 with rollover and 5000 night/wknd min. and wireless web and unlimited mobile to moble and a free sony ericsson phone (T226) for 45$/mo!!! thats the best cell deal around my area and theres 6 around lebanon, tn. the GSM coverage is better than CDMA around here and also I have GPRS too... the good thing about GSM is SIM cards. You can take the card out when you get a new phone and your number will move with you to your new phone. also you can use it all over the globe. hence the G in GSM .... Global System for Mobile communications. yah its not as fast as CDMA, yet... with 3GSM and EDGE you can attain up to a 128Kbps transfer rate. and with Cingular purchasing ATT wireless, you will get even bigger and better network coverage! I was approved for a phone without a deposit at all!! I had my phone in less than 10 minutes! most of that was deciding which plan to go with! It wane really well... my phone only messed up a couple times by asking me to insert my sim which came a lil loose while the phone was in my pocket. thats the only problem I had really....
