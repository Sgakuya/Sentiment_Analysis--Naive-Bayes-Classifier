I first saw Nicholas Cage back in the late 80 s in Raising Arizona. Since then I have continued to marvel at his range as an actor. He can do funny, insane, sexy, intelligent and dippy - all believably and all in one film. I have never been able to explain his smoldering sex appeal to someone who didn t already see it but it s definitely there for me and I think it has quite a lot to do with that piercing gaze that seems to look directly into the soul. That may be acting but with him it many times borders on a kind of visual poetry. So it would be safe to say that Nicky Cage has my personal vote as one of the most gifted actors of our day. I still don t get the Lisa Marie thing - but hey, in the cold light of day, apparently neither did they.
