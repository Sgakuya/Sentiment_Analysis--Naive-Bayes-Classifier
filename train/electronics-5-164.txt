An excellent value all around. I've owned my Panasonic CD player for almost four years now and am nothing less than satisfied with its performance. The unit itself is thin, light and compact and can easily fit in one's jacket pocket or knapsack. It has been very durable and has withstood many accidents on my behalf. My only complaint is that the XBS (extra bass) feature at times distorts the quality of the music. Instead of there only being one XBS setting (on or off), perhaps there should be more as with the Sony Discman line featuring normal, mid and maximum levels of bass. Other than that, I have no complaints. If you're in the market for a portable CD player I highly recommend the Panasonic brand. Its rugged, dependable and affordable.
