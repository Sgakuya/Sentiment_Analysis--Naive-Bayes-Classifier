I'm an American that went to Brisbane on a trip...didn't like it at all. I stayed in the Royal Albert, a great hotel by the way, and outside my door lay the world's biggest snobs. I got the impression Australian urbanites, perhaps many Australians, worship royalty and snobby behavior. I couldn't care for the Queens St. area at all. There's nothing in Brisbane you couldn't find in NYC or any big city near you. Everywhere shuts down at 6 or 7, like most of Australia. What's up with that? Don't listen to that reviewer about the Gold Coast, it's way more interesting than most of Queensland. But do go to the Outback, as far as Roma, if not farther. It's very beautiful and worth your time.
