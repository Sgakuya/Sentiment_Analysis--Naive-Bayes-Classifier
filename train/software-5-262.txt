Basically the same as OS 10.3 Panther, but that is a good thing! It's reliable, fast, sleek, easy on the eye, and reliable. Did I mention reliable? Microsoft could really take a hint from Apple instead of just ripping off certain graphical features. Dashboard wigets are a little overrated, but it's for me to say that since I get to use them whenever I want now that I have tiger! If you've already got Panther, and you don't care much about widgets, then don't upgrade - you probably won't gain much. If you are a MS Windows user considering switching, Mac OS X is a terrific reason to switch. I am in the process of making my switch from a Dell Inspiron to an Apple Powerbook G4 1.0GHz because it's just so much more reliable and fun to use. And it's good for productivity - not just easy on the eyes.
