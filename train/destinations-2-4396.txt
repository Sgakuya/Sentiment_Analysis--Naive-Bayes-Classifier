Not a good place to live for the 20's crowd!! My husband and I are newly married and in our mid-20's. We moved here for job purposed (the economy here is fantastic), but I cannot wait to move. There are many benefits to this area: Sunny weather, four seasons, friendly people, academic culture, growing economy, etc. However, this area is designed for people in their mid-career, 30 - 40 age range. We've lived here for a year and a half and have only found a handful of young and trendy people. There is no fashion sense in this city. The style is so 10 years ago - we like to call it plaid shirt city. So, if you are ready to settle down and raise a family in American suburban bliss, you'll love it here. If you're young and looking for a trendy, cool community, go elsewhere (and take me with you!).
