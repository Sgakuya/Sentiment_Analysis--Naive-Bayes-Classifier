This tea is in a completely different league from most bottled teas. What you get is pure, unsweetened, high-quality Oolong tea. No carbs, no calories, and - unlike coffee - no cholesterol. As oolong has among the highest caffeine content, among teas (though usually less than black tea), it will probably have 1/4th to 1/2 as much caffeine as coffee. The flavor is about what you'd expect from an Oolong tea - much smoother than green tea, with a rich taste I think is closer to barley tea than black tea. In my experience, unsweetened, bottled tea is MUCH harder to come by than it should be. Ito En should be commended for their efforts to offer American consumers the pure, high quality bottled teas commonly found in Japan. The only down side is the '$1.80 price for 500 ml (16.9 fl oz). I'm also unable to find a decent discount on it at any online stores.
