Canadianswhat do you honestly have to be proud of? Maybe I hate America but they have more to dispute about. You invented hockey,like wow, wat a gay sport where you wear 50 kilograms of equipment, and you cant watch with that tiny little puck of yours, you have no history whatsoever, wasnt this country created like 90 years ago or something like that? too much geography, the east and west both wanted to separate, no military,no good beer and all you do is go out bragging about how good and important you guys are and all. Well most people actually dont know where canada is or what they contributed to this earth. it just shows how small you canucks are on world stage
