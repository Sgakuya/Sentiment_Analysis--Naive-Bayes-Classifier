European flights with Aer Lingus are to be avoided. Ground service (check in/information et al) is bad and inflight service is worse.(Food is so bad, last flt, for the first time in my life, I brought my own just to keep me going, even though one does not expect too much from airline food) Business/executive class travel within Europe is undoubtedly and consistently the worst of any scheduled airline, big and small.Aer lingus seems to be caught between budget airline services and non budget prices (except for limited special offers in economy class). Any of the senior cabin staff will agree but say they are helpless in the face of company policy. Trans atlantic service has still got a good reputaion for good friendly service. I am travelling to the US soon, business class, but in the light of repeated european experiences with A L (when I had no alternative) I am thinking of booking with Continental (who are cheaper anyway).
