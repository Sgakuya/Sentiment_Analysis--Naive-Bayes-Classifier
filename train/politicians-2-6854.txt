Trent Lott, like so many other relics from our sorrowful racist past, obviously harbor some ill sentiment towards minorities in this country. But the real question is: will this hinder his ability to lead, and lead fairly? I guess since he made such an obvious public 'snafu' it will be easy to shoot arrows at the guy, but let's be real folks. Don't you think there are a whole lot more closet racists out there who have the same feelings? At least now that Lott has been 'outed' he may watch his steps more carefully from now on. (Is that really a solution?) But there are many more racists who will continue to (presumably) espouse a hidden racist agenda while claiming publicly to be pro-racial equality. What good is it that we are all now becoming homogenized under the rubric of an unfortunately too liberal political correctness campaign that aims to remedy inequality while actually only serving to hide it even further. Think about it. What has the Lott fiasco taught us, and more importantly, what has it taught the Lotts of this world? Well, assuming Lott will be censured in some public forum or other, all it will really have accomplished is to tell those Lottists to keep their mouth shut even tighter. In the end the Lotts will make a public image appearing to be pro equality at an increasing rate, serving only to obfuscate the real problem. Look at what candidates do next time to see the real racists, rather than denounce them publicly for their words. Sure, words do hurt, but politicians are there to serve, and if they serve a racist agenda while publicly proclaiming one of racial equality, then you truly know who you are dealing with.
