I'm not a particular John Ford enthusiast- many of his films suffer from sentimentality and a simplistic approach to American history,while criticisms of his unhelpful portrayal of Native American Indians and tendency to rowdy childish humour are valid- but he was still one of the major directors,and a poet of the screen.His relatively lowly position,on an American website,comes as a surprise.The Searchers is the greatest,most majestic western,The Man who Shot Liberty Valance has a lovely elegiac,nostalgic quality,My Darling Clementine is another timeless classic,Stagecoach virtually defined the Western (so influential and copied it now seems somewhat cliched)and finally made a star of John Wayne.The Quiet Man,a deservedly popular romance,may be loaded with Irish blarney,and seems a touch misogynistic,but makes gorgeous,evocative use of the beautiful Galway settings -Ford always had a great eye for landscape,and not just Monument Valley- and has a marvellous,tender lyricism.And there are other longstanding favourites well worth seeing.
