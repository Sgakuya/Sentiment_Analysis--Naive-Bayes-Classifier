My least favorite Republican this side of John McCain and Trent Lott. While it's funny that a man who ran for President against Truman in 1948 continues to play a role in public life after Clinton, Thurmond is terribly inarticulate, has a shifty past when it comes to civil rights (a shame since the vast majority of Repubs are quite different from the stereotype), and has spent most of his career focused on constituent relations, wishing people happy birthday at taxpayer expense and other such nonsense. Worst of all, he is certain to die in the next six years, guaranteeing that the Repubs will lose control of Senate (since S.C. has a Dem governor). Granted, the S.C. appointee will have to be a more conservative Democrat than Ted Kennedy and his ilk, it's still a disaster for Repubs to be relying on Thurmond's health like this.
