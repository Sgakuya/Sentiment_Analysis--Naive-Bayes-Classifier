I'm willing to admit it. I've underrated Shaun Alexander in the past. He's currently on pace to break Priest Holmes' single season touchdown record (I doubt he will, but he is on pace currently). He will likely be this seasons rushing champion and for all practical purposes I thought he did better than Curtis Martin last season. His running style is a little akward, but he does have the ability run past defenders. Whenever he's getting hit, rather then squaring his shoulders to try to overpower tacklers he turns his shoulders and sort of scraps off of them to get an extra yard as well as sometimes outright break through. He is, in my humble opinion, a better back than even L.T., and way too underrated. My biggest problem is I don't think he's as good of a back as some of the up and coming ones, such as Larry Johnson, Steven Jackson, and Willis McGahee. UPDATE: Well, he broke the Total TDs record and tied the rushing TDs record. I'm thoroughly impressed. Oh, and while we're at it, scratch Willis McGahee off of that list of better "up and coming" backs... He did awful since he made the mistake of claiming to be the best back in football. It must be proof that there is a God and He is just! Put either Carnell Williams on that list instead, he really impressed me in the end. I'll rate him a 5 because he is a Pro Bowler and he has earned every bit of it.
