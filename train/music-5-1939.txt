As always, Our Lady Peace has produced a wonderful, deep album. Though it's not my favorite album they have produced, it is still far, far better than almost anything else out there. The cd was named after the book, The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil, and contains sound bytes of lines from this book. Although many claim it to be so, it is not a concept album, since most of the songs were written before the band. The lyrics from this album are inspirational, and the music goes along beautifully with them. I can listen to the cd over and over again and not tire of it. It is my hope that Our Lady Peace can save rock music in a world that is overrun by no-talent, superficial music.
