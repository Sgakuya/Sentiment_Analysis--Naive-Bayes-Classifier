Comparing Minnesota to Penn State is a joke. PSU has declined dramatically over the past decade and when they've finished with losing records in 4 of the past 5 years it's not much consolation for any team to say they've owned the Lions as of late. Minnesota has been preseason picks to contend for the Big Ten title for the past several years but fall short by a considerable margin each and every year. They seem to do just fine until they get beat by Michigan, then the whole season goes down the tank. They got swept by the state of Michigan two years in a row, lost to Iowa four years in a row, lost 3 of the last five meetings to Wisconsin. They managed a 10 win season in 2003, but since Glen Mason arrived the Gophers haven't done a whole lot. If Minnesota can beat 2 of the 4 B10 teams they're struggling with next year I might bump Mason up a notch, but right now Minnesota's just a pretender with B10 title aspirations and a coach who can't ever bring them over that hump.
