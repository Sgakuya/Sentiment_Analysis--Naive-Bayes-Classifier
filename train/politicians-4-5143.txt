FOR AMERICA, FOR FREEDOM, FOR JUSTICE and FOR LIBERTY ... I promise and assure you Al Gore would be Life and George Bush would be Death! 2 nights before Haloween i week before the election. I ENVISIONED IN A DREAM George Bush as a Warewolf, He chased me, caught me and bit my hand off! I screamed out in my sleep and was immidiately awakened with a severe headache the following Day and the next day also. I wanted to e-mail and tell the Democratic Party, but I procranasted. I have been thinking about this dream a lot Was the Bitten Hand the lost votes??? or was the bitten hand the removal of help for the poor and downtrodden that people in his party so terribly advocate? Help me get the word out. I feel it is my duty That in Politically Curropted State as Florida is it not a violation or a Conflict of Interest for all this to be happening in the State where George's Brother Jeb Presides??? Come on America, Be for real!!!
