I've always liked Rhode Island. This state has awesome beaches and ocean shore. Newport is a great weekend destination. There's nothing else like it with the castle like mansions on the ocean in Newport and it's downtown has got a very New England colonial look to it. Block Island is a cool place to visit with strong island and townie character, nice scenery with lighthouses, bluffs, and sandy beaches without the crowds of Marthas Vineyard. Providence is enjoying an urban renesaince that Worcestor, Hartford, and Springfield should be paying attention to. Providence also has great restaurants but as noted below it still has that creepy mafia thing hanging over it. I wouldn't mind living in the Ocean State, and an added bonus, it's close to Boston and NY.
