I just finished Split Image, a biography of Anthony Perkins. It reveals much about the trials of an actor who could not allow his sexual orientation to smother his acting career, especially back in the fifties. But Mr.Perkins was beloved by those who knew him.That in itself, is a great tribute. And Alfred Hitchcock told him, he was ashamed of Perkins' fellow actors, for not nominating him as Best Actor for Psycho. His later choices? He had a family to care for, and had bills to pay. Loved him as the Quaker, in the drama, Friendly Persuasion. UPDATE! A point of interest: His widow, Berry, was one of the victims of 9/ll. She was a passenger in one of the planes.
