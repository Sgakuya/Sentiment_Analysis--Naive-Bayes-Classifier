Louisiana has two distinct parts: the north is similar to Arkansas or East Texas and is very protestant, while the southern half is home to a strong Cajun heritage and is more interesting. New Orleans has a vibe all its own; it is dirty, sleazy, corrupt, and often violent. Yet, it is fascinating and never dull....try some absinthe at a French quarter bar,go wild and party yourself naked during Mardi Gras, check out some of the spooky cemetaries, watch a jazz preservation group play....the place has a culture like no other. Baton Rouge is a likeable city, home to LSU and a phallic capitol building. Inside, you can see the bullet holes where the famous Huey Long was shot. The rest of the state is mostly blah. Truthfully, this is a better place to visit than live, as the state's infrastructure is terrible. Schools are among the worst in the country, highways are in pretty rough shape(the adjoining rest stops are run-down and not too relieving), crime is high in too many areas other than New Orleans, there are relatively few economic opportunities, and poverty levels are still high. Basically, this state ranks just about last in every quality of life category, and it ain't exactly what I would call a sportsman's paradise; the outdoor sporting environment has been ruined by pollution.
