 Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book is a good cookbook to have on hand, whether you cook once a year or daily. The basic information it provides is really valuable. For example, it has directions for every method of cooking different types of vegetables. I appreciate this because I never remember how long to boil corn on the cob or how hot the oven has to be for baked potatoes. It also has great standard recipes for things they never cover in fancier, gourmet-type cookbooks, including applesauce and pumpkin pie. There's a helpful reference section in the back that reviews basic techniques, and nutrition information is provided for every recipe. If you're looking for a reliable, comprehensive cookbook, Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book is an excellent choice.
