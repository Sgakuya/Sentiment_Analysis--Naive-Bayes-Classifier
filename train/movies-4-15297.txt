It is a little hobby of mine that if a movie is based on a book to first read it and then make the comparison and this time it was grossly dissapointing. Not in a way to say that the movie blew because it was actually quite good. The story was pretty much completely in line with the book for the first half of the movie, but the second half, wow! The ending of the book was my favorite part and I left the cinema feeling violated, truly violated. All in all it is a good film, very entertaining and, in retrospect, the ending is not horrible just not as good as the book's ending. My recommendation is to see this film AND read the book.
