Cellular One in Bastrop, TX (78602)has been advertising UNLIMITED MINUTES (all you can utilize during peak hour time and 1000 off peak). What they don't tell you and which is in the fine print you must read with bifocals is that you MUST utilize their network atleast 50% of the time, otherwise they will cancel your service. For those of us in this suburban area that's 30 miles from Austin and whom utilize majority of our talk time in the Austin area (not Cellular One's coverage area) one finds that the Cellular One network in Bastrop gets utilized maybe 20%. This company is horrible, the sales rep doesn't know anything about the service nor the phones. So wonder they dont have any business in Bastrop and Cingular is eating their lunch.
