Admittedly, the Marx Brothers aren't for everyone (the nonsensical zaniness can wear on the patience of the more-austere customer, and the racist asides are off-putting regardless of the contexts they're viewed in). Climbing past these barriers (please tell me you can), what you've got here is one of the best these vaudevillians ever did. The plots of all the films were wafer-thin frames meant to showcase the boys at their craziest, and Groucho made the most of it with his unforgettable portrayal of Rufus T. Firefly, the political savior of the fictional country of Freedonia that's trying to stave off bankruptcy and war with a neighboring country. Street vendors Chico and Harpo are sanely installed in Groucho's Cabinet, and hilarity ensues. Veteran foil Margaret Dumont is at her aristocratically funniest, and even Zeppo is thrown a few good lines. Wicked commentary abounds about the shifting sands of political fortune, and both the "palace mirror" bit and the final "battle" arrangements should be required on every film school syllabus. These performers may be gone, but their legacy of laughter has yet to lose its luster.
