There is a wide variety of activities, in which one may engage ... in education, business, culture, night life (from low key to dressy), and the choice in restaurants is simply awesome. I have visited and enjoyed both the Potter's House & the Fellowship Church in Grapevine. Most importantly, living in Dallas has been an eye opening experience in relation to my knowledge of other countries of the world. I truly appreciate the exposure to so much cultural diversity. However, when I first moved here, I realized the size of the city is definately not conducive to the small town feel I was used to, but I guess that would be true of any city of this size. At any rate, opportunities to plant healthy roots and growth are out there for those who opt to persist in such activities. I in no way regret any of the experiences I've had and look forward to completing my second degree and beginning a different type of work and experiences here.
