1st, if me and another player of my same talent got to pick 4 guys my first pick is Larry. reasons: 1. his versatility to shoot, pass, rebound, make plays and come through in the clutch. 2. he will get the most out of everyone else on the team. 3. his intense will to win. Wilt falls short with numbers 1, 2 and 3. Michael falls short with numbers 2 and 3. (both played in watered down leagues) Majic falls down on number 3, if you think about it he came into the legue on the same team as kareem. This put two all time top ten greatest players on the same team. Then a (proven in college) rookie joined them. Not so with larry without him neither parish nor mchale would have elevated so high. D.J. was a proven veteran and ainge again a (proven in college) rookie even out with wilks and scott. My point is to point out how larry made his teamates better, namely parish and mchale, where as majic fans can't say the same. both mchale and parish are in the hall neither one was headed there until they joined larry. props to wilt, michael and majic but larry is the purest basketball player of all, remember basketball is a team game and those of us that got a chance to watch him when the league had the highest level of competition were so fortunate. It isn't until now for instance in lala land that teams are starting to recover from the watering down so that they can accumulate players to compete with those day's. thanks larry
