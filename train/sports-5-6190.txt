THE LANDLORD...That says it all right there. Blocked shots, rebounds, double-doubles, and lots of points in the paint! YOU JUST CAN'T COMPETE! And I'm sure that all you people that say he's ugly are just the most beautiful, super-model type>right? Just because he's good taht makes him ugly, gay, etc.? But really though, is that the best you've got?...Sheldon Williams is AWESOME, and you know it...to bad that the best thing you've got against him is He's ugly....Ohhh yeah and as for unc4me07, okay that picture prooves AbSoLuTeLy nothing! I would have picked a better picture to proove my point 'Williams basically has his hand on the ball even with May's hand all over his face. I mean really, GOOD TRY THOUGH! >GO BLUE DEVILS
