This series is fantastic! Tolkien's imagination and vision are captivating. His invented world is original and beautiful. The first time i read through these books, i was confussed a lot. There are a lot of place names, river names, named geographic features and people who are mentioned but do not necessarily have an important role in the novel. That is my only criticim. I'm glad that these books have achieved such popularity recently because it creates interest for these wonderful stories that may not have existed before. So many themes in these books can be related to the human experience: love, friendship, trust, honour, society, loyalty, simplicity, etc., etc., etc., everyone can learn something from these fascinating little hobbits and their vast array of friends!
