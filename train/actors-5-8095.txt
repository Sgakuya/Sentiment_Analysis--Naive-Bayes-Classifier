Miss Bette Davis was a great actress. She KNEW she was, that's why she considered herself a character actress. But, she never forgot that she was a STAR. One of her key acting achievements that many of her fans have not seen, was her 1952 protrayal of Margaret Elliot, has-been movie goddess in THE STAR. What a harrowing performance. First offered to Joan Crawford, who turned THE STAR down flat, Davis read the script and seized the moment. In this film, Davis did everything but HIT THE CEILING! She smoked cartons of cigarettes, slapped faces, violently threw her sister and brother-in-law out of her apartment, was thrown into jail - drunk with the screaming meanines and, subsequently locked out of her apartment for non payment of rent. Homeless. The result is a tragic but realistic look at an actress who hits rock bottom in Hollywood. Davis, presenting herself in the worse light of any of her contemporaries, deservedly received her ninth Oscar nomination for the part. The movie is on video, but needs to be on DVD!
