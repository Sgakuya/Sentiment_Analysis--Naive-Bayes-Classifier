I've been saying for 7 years that the guy's a clown. The day Ohio State hired Tressel I also explained to everyone who would care to listen that the little streak is over. We can't block or tackle. We are sloppy and soft. The only thing I disagree with with all the people calling for Carr's head is that he is too conservative. Too conservative? If we're not in 5 wide throwing it, we're running some stupid trick play. I don't see anything conservative about our offense. I would love to see us play REAL Michigan football - physical, smashmouth football. Carr's a joke. He should have been gone after the 2000 season. Also...for all those saying, "If not Carr, then who?", I'll tell you who - Les Miles. He's a Michigan man, his teams are FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND and physical, and he is a winner. So I say...FIRE LLOYD, HIRE LES!!!!! GO BLUE!!!!
