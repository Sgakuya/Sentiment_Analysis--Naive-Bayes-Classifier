I've been in the executive MBA program at CTU for over a year. It's a great program. I've learned a lot. It is fast-paced & rigorous, but good material that has helped me already in the business world. I went to one of the best private universities in the country for my B.A. At both schools I've had good and bad professors. And at both schools, I've got out of the classes what I put into them. This may be even truer with online classes. Yes CTU is expensive. But, so are most other MBA programs. If they aren't expensive, I'd be worried about their quality. The text books have been good but again, some better than others. Online is not the way for everyone. You have to be motivated to read and study on your own. You have to be able to figure things out on your own mostly. I’m now approaching the end of my MBA program with CTU. I’m very pleased with the course. The virtual campus and classroom portal have been great. The classes have been challenging and I’ve learned a lot. Despite being online and not a traditional campus, I’ve actually made friends with other students through small group projects and discussion boards. After everything is said and done, I think that the things I’ve learned have helped me to do my job better, and that was the main purpose of my degree. I wanted to sharpen my business skills through this MBA program and ultimately amplify my career as Offspring’s Vice President of Business Development.
