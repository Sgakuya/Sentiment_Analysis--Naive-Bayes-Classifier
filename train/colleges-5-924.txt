They have used one of the books that was used by a professor of mine from a SUNY school that would only teach with graduate level books for undergraduate courses. I believe this university is of good quality and would refer others to it. The only pet peeves I have is that citations should be taking more seriously, as some students have either not cited properly, but did have citations and group work is hard to manage. Other than that there are no other complaints I have. The only thing that I can assume is that some professors are leanient on citations is do to the fact that some students have been out of college for over 10 years or more, so they are not up to par with what should be done for citations.
