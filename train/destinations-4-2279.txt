A very old and very great civilization that has fallen on hard times. The main challenge for the Iranian people in the coming decade or two will be shaking off a repressive, self-serving dictatorship, which unfortunately has a canny grasp of how to play the emotions of the people to get just enough support to stay in power, using divisive non-issues (not all that dissimilar to tactics used in the U.S., though any comparison between the two regimes is misleading). Some day Iran has the potential to be an enlightened democracy unlike anything else in the region, since they have a long tradition of education and learning, as well as an energetic and young population.
