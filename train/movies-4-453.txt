Released in 1989, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade is the third and supposedly final installment of Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones movies. For the uninitiated, Jones, a swashbuckling archeologist (Harrison Ford), is off to find the actual Holy Grail during the 1930's, hoping to find it before the Nazis do. The catch is that his estranged father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) got the jump on the quest. Along the way through Venice and the Middle East, Indy meets the mysterious and beautiful Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), fights rats and Nazis, and must face his long ignored faith in family, ethics and higher powers. Before viewing the film, I was concerned about the casting of Connery as this trilogy is clearly Harrison Ford's baby. I was worried that the screen would not be big enough for another major star; however, the two had great chemistry, and the synergies between the good-hearted, but sometimes naive Jones, Sr. worked well with the hard-nosed son. The rest of the movie is essentially a reworking of the original; however, the formula still works.
