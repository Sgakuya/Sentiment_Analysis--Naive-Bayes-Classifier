They aren't the best Wireless Service. Although my phones have worked pretty well. My complaint with AT&T Wireless is their customer service it is like Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde, one moment they are friendly the next they are not. I know people where some they treated fine and the other they treated shabbily. One representative even hung up on someone. As a company that should not be done. Another thing is I wanted a new updated phone, and I had to fight, as a long time customer to get any kind of deal. Another person I know who is with a different company was offered an upgrade to the phone that I really wanted but AT&T said I'd have to go to a much higher monthly rate, my collegue did not and this person has a better phone. When I'm done with this contract with AT&T I think I'll look for another service
