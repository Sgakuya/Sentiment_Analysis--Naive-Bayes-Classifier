I also work at CEC and in all honesty all these ratings are from elders. Think about CEC is all about the satisfaction of kids... Many parents don't like it because its loud or they don't like the pizza or whatever the reason. Did you ever think to ask how your child likes it because I bet 9/10 children would rate CEC a 5 if they could. CEC is not a place for adults its a place for kids. So give in once in awhile instead of going to Applebee's, Long Horn, ect.. places where children don't have much choice of what to do but sit down and eat. Treat them to a fun time at CEC where we make magic. Also I love all those parents out there that complain and complain about CEC but still spend 100's of dollars there. Obviously were doing something right.
