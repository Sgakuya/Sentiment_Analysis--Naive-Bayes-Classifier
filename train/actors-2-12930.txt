As moooch as the MooCow would love to rail against her, he has to grudgingly admit that Liv does indeed have some talent(unlike her worthless father), although she really needs to be involved in quality work(Empire Records, The Lord of the Rings), or she becomes an irritation not unlike the appalling Julia Roberts. The MooCOw did not care for her character in Lord of the Rings, which was a cowpilation of udder, moore interesting characters, specifically made to create a false love interest draw in the chick crowd, but the MooCow has come to see that as the writer/director's fault moore than the actress's. And, truth be told, mooch of the MooCow's bile comes from his hatred of her father and his worthless, hopelessly over-rated cheese band. Maybe she can break away from her association someday; until then, the MooCow just isn't interested.
