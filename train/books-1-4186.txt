If it were possible to simply give this book a zero, I would have. I found Holden to be incredibly self-absorbed and hypocritical, the poor-little-rich-boy act not only failed to impress me but put me to sleep on about seven occasions. How anyone can find this book to be insightful or thought-provoking is completely beyond me. Throughout the book Holden contradicts himself, blames anyone apart from from him and whines about how he has it so tough because he can't pull himself together. The apparent symbolism in the book is obscurely placed and often in such a way that the concept is lost. Any deeper meaning behind this novel is simpley lost in the boring and aimless comments which are unfortunatley abundant throughout. Towards the end instead of Holden gaining some sort clarified perception we instead see how naive he really is, he reverts back to childish emotions and superficial comments and this is all on the very last page. This book is out of touch with modern appropriation, so much so that I completely despise every single character apart from Maurice and if I ever hear the word 'phony' again i may have to begin stabbing people with plastic forks.
