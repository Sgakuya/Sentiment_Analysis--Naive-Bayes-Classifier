The time will come for audiences to acknowledge comedies in books, on the stage and in movies as, perhaps, the most difficult art to accomplish. Not every director can be as creative and witty as a Preston Sturges or a Billy Wilder (or as consistent: on occasion, Wilder was himself less than successful in comedies). The script of '1941' probably read funny, but the well-meaning filmmakers were ill-equipped to transform into comic form the premise about a Japanese invasion of the West Coast during WW2. Spieberg as director and co-editor, was found wanting in that while the audience understands the intended humor in this lark, it responds rather to what remains on the page, not unlike what George Lucas had to go through as producer to Willard Huyck's 'Howard the Duck'. Robert Zemeckis, a co-scripter for '1941', might have been more successful than Spielberg directing '1941', considering that Zemeckis would come out with 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' two years later. As it stands, enjoyment of '1941' is effortful and, considering the talent involved (Day Aykroyd, John Belushi, John Candy, etc.), the disappointment is major.
