I lived here for a year and moved away. Boring city overall, the smoky mountains are nice and the zoo is ok but not much else. People here are sorta friendly but up to a point, it seems once they find out your not from the south they cop an attitude, must still be mad about the Civil war or something. Not the smartest people i've ever met either, kinda backwards and on the hick side, if you are progressive in your views, you will not fit in here, i lived here a year and couldn't make any new friends and i've lived in other places and had no problem meeting new people but Knoxville is kinda stuck in the old ways of the south. Smokers everywhere here and the divorce rate is HIGH, TN overall has a real bad divorce rate, one of the highest in the U.S. and the reason is the folks here seem to marry right out of high school and get divorced a few years later and are stuck with kids. If you are single and over 35, forget it, nightlife sucks and with so many divorced people with kids, no one goes out much which is another reason it's hard to meet ppl here, you are either divorced with kids or married, being single here sucks! Too many fast food chain places all over this city makes it hard to find a good place to eat too. overall, if you want to live in a boring city with tons of divorced women looking for a "sugar daddy" to support them and deal with extremely hot summer weather and deal with bad traffic, Knoxville is for you, all others, avoid.
