I'll be honest - I'm not rating Clooney's acting abilities. I'm here to let everyone know what a delusional imbicile he is. How can he go on Charlie Rose and call President Bush a killer while referring to hussein as a jerk and a rat. Has he ever stepped out of his mansion and actually read a newspaper? Is he blissfully unaware of the atrocities saddam has inflicted upon the Kurds? Is he unable to understand the positions Mr. Bush is taking or the reasons he is taking them? How ironic, my income is one percent of his, at best, yet I feel sorry for HIM! Get out of the lame Hollywood liberalism, Clooney. Get the truth.
