okay, lets talk about ruth being good just in his day supposedly. yes, there are pitches today that ruth didnt have to swing at. ruth also had to put up with pitches that were later deemed illegal, so that ends that argument. fat?! he holds the post 1900 record for most runs scored by a player with 177, and most seasons of scoring 150+ runs. oh yeah, he also led the yanks in stolen bases a couple of times. the man drew over 2000 walks, he had incredible patience. however, if a run was needed, he would expand his strike zone. proof of this: he was the single season rbi king in 1921. lets see: a .342 avg is excellent, but, batting avg is overrated. the more importants stats are on-base% and slugging avg. ruth has a .471 career on-base%, 2nd only to ted williams(.483), and he blows away ted williams in slugging with a staggering .690 slugging%, ted's was second, at .623. in the world series, he dominated, having 2- 3hr games. his batting avg is very impressive as well. his .847 slugging avg has since been surpassed by Barry Bonds, but who cares, ruth dominated 1921 much more than bonds did 2001, and bonds had all the advantages, like steroids, creatine, smaller ballparks, the juiced ball, watered down pitching, not to mention that he's exempted from a rule limiting size of elbow braces, so he can crowd the plate all he wants. and, bonds had company in 2001, with sosa at 64, luis at 57, and arod at 52. bonds to ruth? no way, never. ruth won 20+ games in consecutive seasons, and had seasons of pitching over 300 innings, his career era was around 2.00. one more thing about him to bonds, bonds has the better bat technology, and, uses a kid-sized 31 ounce bat. ruth used an enormous 44 ounce bat, no comparison. one more little thing....babe ruth saved baseball from the 1919 betting scandal. if it werent for him, there would likely be no mlb today. BABE RUTH.....GREATEST BALLPLAYER OF ALL TIME!!!!!
