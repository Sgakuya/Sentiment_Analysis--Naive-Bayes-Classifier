It's films like this that actually makes you feel your cinema ticket was money well spent. It tells the story of the porn king John Holmes and the Wonderland murders in 1981. I was a little sceptical at first, but I'm glad my enquiring mind had taken the chance to see this. Graced with outstanding cinematography and an intriguing script not to mention good performances Wonderland will surely surprise you. Fair enough it's jumping on the bandwagon of the success of Boogie Nights, but Mark Wahlberg's character Dirk Diggler was actually heavily based on John Holmes. We see a man spiraling into the greedy world of the excesses from success and the prices he has to pay sometimes by those close to him, played brilliantly by Val Kilmer. We see his vulnerability and almost pity what he has become. Lisa Kudrow plays Kilmer's ex-wife and manages to play a strong woman with steel emotion, almost a far cry from her dim-wit character Phoebe from Friends and she does this convincingly. The person who surprised me the most was Kate Bosworth. Far from the opposite end of the character spectrum of her role as Anne-Marie in Blue Crush she manages to nicely underplay the character Dawn (Holmes' Girlfriend) without being to over-bearing, mawkish or annoying, but more the naive girl whose forced to grow up quickly, almost overnight. If you liked Boogie Nights you'll like this film.
