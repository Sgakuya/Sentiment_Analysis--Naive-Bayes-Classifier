Based on the character created by R.E. Howard, this is one of the best swords-and-sorcery movies ever made, and a great role for Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie successfully evokes an ancient, iron-age atmosphere of decadent city-states and noble savages (like the titular character). The movie proceeds episodically, with occasional lulls, but contains many memorable scenes and an excellent score. James Earl Jones is great as the evil high-priest of Set, Thulsa Doom. In addition to the obvious emphasis on bloody swordplay, the movie explores a number of themes, such as the differences in religious attitudes between civilized men and barbarians, and the nature of power. Conan himself is a likeable character, violent and lusty to be sure, but also quick to make friends and posessed of a sense of humour. All in all, an entertaining and enjoyable movie. Followed by a vastly inferior sequel, Conan the Destroyer , and numerous imitations.
