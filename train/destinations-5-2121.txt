I'm glad to see this is the highest-rated country in N/Africa, because I had a great time here. Wonderful food, music, and crafts. The people are generally quite nice (the beggars are a pain) and like most Islamic countries that haven't been bombed, invaded and occupied, there is very little crime. Casablanca is interesting (not what you'd expect from the movie though (-:) as are Fez, Ceuta and Marrakesh. The old city of Fez is especially worth a look, a Medieval Islamic city that looks just like it did in 1500, except for the tourists and tourist shops. In general, Morocco has a pleasing variety of landscapes-mountains, deserts, beaches, even forests (quite rare in N/Africa). Like a little world in miniature. Just keep two things in mind: stay away from Tangiers, and don't go into any of the mosques if you aren't Muslim (gov. policy says you can, but the people don't like it-FYI). You can get just about any drug here too (prescription or otherwise) but there's much better things to do in Morocco.
