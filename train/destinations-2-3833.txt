In a nutshell, Columbus is just a suburb of The Ohio State University. Buckeye fans are like meth addicts. The climate is awful, unless you absolutely hate seeing the sun. Nothing much to do but visit the 10,000+ strip malls or fast food chains, which a lot of people do as evidenced by the number of fat loads waddling around. There are more SUVs and trucks on the roads here than anywhere else in the world and they all hang out in the passing lane. In fact, most of the freeways are so clogged with trucks you'll be lucky to ever achieve 65mph. And if you go over that speed, the OSP revenue-collectors will be happy to take your money. Ohio is a tax nightmare. Its tax structure is based on 1920s thinking. On the plus side, the zoo is excellent. Violent crime is not as bad as most cities this size. Ohio itself is a rollercoaster-lover's dream and Columbus is centrally located with respect to Cedar Point and King's Island.
