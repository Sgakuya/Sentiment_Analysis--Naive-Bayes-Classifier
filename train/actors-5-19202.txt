I have never heard of an actor who was a real, and great as Matthew Perry. Everything I hear about him, just makes him sound better, and better than before. It's not just the way he looks, all the he's gorgeous, but his personality, is truly one of a kind. When I read about him, or simply watch Friends, or a movie that he's in, I am mesmerized, because I know that I will never see another person as great as he is. Although to some the situations that Matthew Perry has experienced in the past two years would be a flaw, it makes me love him even more. The things that he goes through in life, that may be embarrassing to him, make him more real, more of a person, rather than an actor, who has all the money, and no problems in life. His seemingly perfection, and his imperfections, are what make me love him. I have loved him since I first saw him on Friends, and that was five years ago. His personality is hilarious, and witty. I never imagined that Matthew Perry was as funny, as his character on Friends, Chandler, is! Then I saw him on interviews, on many different shows, and he was hilarious! I don't know where comes up with the things he says, but I love it. His laugh to, is precious, and adorable. There's no doubt in my mind that Matthew Perry, isn't the greatest actor, ever in history.
