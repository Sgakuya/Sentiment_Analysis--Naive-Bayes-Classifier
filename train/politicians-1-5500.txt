John Kerry keeps talking about how he hates Bush and doesn't like the job Bush is doing. Yet Kerry never says what he would do as president. I'm tired of the attack ads. I want to know where Kerry stands on issues; he keeps waffling and focusing on his hate of Bush. I'd like Kerry a bit better if he talks about his plans for the US rather than saying, Vote for me because I think Bush sucks. And Kerry shouldn't talk about Bush's honesty when Kerry's campaign is taking illegal soft money. John Kerry talks about knowing how the typical middle-class family lives, yet his first wife was worth $300 million, and his current wife owns Heinz ketchup. Although a billionaire, he gives almost no money to charity (a few years ago--1995?--he donated $135 for tne entire year)and once took a Buick from a shady dealer who was in trouble for bribing public officials and racketeering. When questioned about it later, he said that he had simply forgotten to pay for his car and then he wrote a check for it. I could never get the keys to car from a dealer and drive off without paying. You wonder what the dealer got in exchange for the car. He took more lobbyist money that anyone else in the Senate, and in all of his years in the Senate, none of the bills that he sponsored ever was passed. Rich playboy and poor excuse for a politician. He owns five houses worth $33 million--not exactly an advocate for the middle class.
