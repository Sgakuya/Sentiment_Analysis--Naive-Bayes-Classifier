Just wanted to make a comment for all the Sore Looserman types floating around in LaLa Land. Get a grip..every vote WAS counted...several times in fact...Old Al lost everytime. What you really mean to say is lets keep counting (translated as manufacturing what we need) until we get the votes we want. The Heroic US Supreme Court stepped in and stopped this Hooey. What would Gore have done? How about spent every penny of the so called surplus on useless government agencys to the point where he would have had to raise taxes to support them. Thank God that at least some Judges had the good sense to keep Sore Looserman out of the oval office...thank God that there will be no more Clinton/Gore for at least the next four years...What kind of President will GW make? I have no idea...but I guarantee that it will be better than what we have had for the past eight years. Clinton/Gore will go down in history as the worst administration this country has ever seen.
