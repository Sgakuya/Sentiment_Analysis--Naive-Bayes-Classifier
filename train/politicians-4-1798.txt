Seems focused and driven. I like the guy, personally. He chooses to maintain his image as a regular guy, refusing to use the Governor's executive office or live in the fancy state Executive Mansion. His decision not to run in the upcoming gubernatorial race gives him the opportunity to make principled decisions without having to worry about voter backlash, and Codey is utilizing that opportunity. His budget proposal relies heavily on spending cuts, which quite frankly is the only real method of achieving real structural balance in the budget. Three years of tax increases under McGreevey didn't succeed in plugging the budget gap- it only widened. Codey's formula for the restoration of fiscal sanity may be the right one. All in all, seems to be, as the previous reviewer stated, holding his own, especially after assuming an office previously plagued by scandal after scandal.
