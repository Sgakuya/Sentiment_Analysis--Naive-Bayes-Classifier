this is what i call a comic-book movie. cheesey, super-predictable plot, cliched relationships, scenerios that are an insult to science. besides the fact that space station mir doesn't have gravity, it's not big enough for so many people to just walk around in. plus and asteroid wouldn't be worst conditions imagineable , it would just be a giant rock. but i suppose you could look past all that and enjoy a fun ride and supporting characters written with cool humor. but for me, personally, i just can't stand ben affleck and liv tyler. especially together. i know everybody loves them, but they really just grate my nerves. i love how liv tyler's character was the great little-wife-waiting at home, and the girl astronaut's character was easily-forgettable at best. plus, in a situation like that, i suppose it would be america to save the day anyway, since we're still so dedicated to our ailing space program. but it is kinda funny how these movies always make america the big heroes.
