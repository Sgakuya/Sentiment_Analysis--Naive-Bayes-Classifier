McDonald's is okay if you eat it on a rare occasion. When I was living the single life, I'd eat fast food (Taco Bell, McDonalds, Quiznos, etc) practically everyday...but I've been blessed w/ a high metabolism and an active job that keeps me on my feet, so I'm not overweight. Plus I work in an airport, so that about all they've got is fast food restaurants. BUT...I don't hardly at McDonald's anymore, much less Burger King or Wendys too. After watching Super Size Me...I've shyed away from all burger joints. Granted, if you do anything in excess like the guy in SSM it will hurt you in the long run. But it really made me think twice about eating there again. Only if I'm super hungry and it's the closest thing nearby.
