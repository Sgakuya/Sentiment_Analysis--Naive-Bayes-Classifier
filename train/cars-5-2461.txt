The car looks awesome. I turn heads where ever i go, and i have no exterior mods whatsoever. maybe they're looking at how terrible it is? hah, not when they give me the thumbs up. Got many props from many people. The car is stock. Handles awesome, tackles those curves like nothing. Extremely fast once you hit 2nd gear... i don't care about horsepower because in layman's term, this car picks up the speed and has high top speed. this is a maniac car, and takes a maniac to drive one... totally awesome!!!!!!! the interior is great for 2 people, anything more than that, you're going to feel sorry for the additional seatings unless they are 40lbs... on top of that, trunk room is a little small, but what you get in performance makes up for the lack in interior room. If you ever have the opportunity to just drive it, please do, you will be impressed. Go to the autotrader or something like that, find someone selling it close to you, even if you don't want to buy it (pretend you do of course), just take it for a test drive (Twin Turbo version) and i'm sure your opinion will change if it's not favoring the supra already... but beware, the power of this beast is not something i would recommend for the inexperienced.
