Very interesting movie. Staged liked something from Our Town. except the people are much nastier. I must say I really felt some compassion for Grace the fugitive who ended up in the tiny town Of Dogville in the 1930s. the town agreed to hide her from whatever she was running from at first they slowly accept her in their lives and even form some friendships. but soon thanks to gossip, lies and other nasties, the town turns on her with such unbelievable cruelty. Not so different from real life when all someone needs to do is spread a little gossip, make other suspicious of you and see how they turn on you. this movie is not always easy to watch since it really shows how horrible the townspeople can be to Grace. the ending is something else. I will keep quiet if I approved or disapproved of the ending. Longer than I like in a movie. but lots of great actors.Nicole Kidman was terrific.
