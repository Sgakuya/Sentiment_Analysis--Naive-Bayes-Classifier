Oddly, it is kind of hard to put how great he was into words. I mean, what can you say? It is like trying to explain how beautiful some place was to somebody who has never seen it. I saw him play a million times, and I don't recall him EVER having a bad game! He could be playing the Bucks or somebody in early November, and just be totally out to destroy their souls. He almost jaded us. He would hit some shot that today would be all over sportscenter, and the commentator ( Albert or whoever)would calmly say, Jordan. That's all you could say. Watch that game 6 play in Utah in super slo-mo, and look at the expression on the Utah fans' faces when Jordan got the rock. They knew what was next and so did the entire damn world. That's MJ in a nutshell. Jesus Christ could not beat Jordan. Anybody who thinks otherwise is bitter or doesn't understand the game.
