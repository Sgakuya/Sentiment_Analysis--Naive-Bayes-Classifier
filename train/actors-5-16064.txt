Greetings!! After watching GH back in the early eighties I thought I would never like an actor or actress better than Robert Scorpio. But having stopped watching for over a decade I was really down and one day got caught up in the "great friends" portrayal of Sonny and Jason.... I ended up getting hooked once again from 1998-2003. (Although I stopped in late '03 I still have almost every episode of '04).Well anyway, I just tuned in today and I once again come to the same conclusion as I did before.. There IS NO ACTOR BETTER than MAURICE BENARD!! Plus, He is a classy person in real life. His acting with Steve Burton ( another 5 star person/actor ) and Carly ( Tamara Braun ), ETC..... was beyond superb. People who cannot see that are only looking at storylines not the individual actors talents. SWR
