News from Mississippi is nothing if not consistent. The following Associated Press item carries a July 28, 2003 dateline. ----- The Gulfport, Miss., city council voted 5-1 to condemn the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of the Texas sodomy law prohibiting gay sex. Councilman Billy Hewes, who introduced the resolution criticizing the high court's decision during Tuesday's council meeting, said the ruling corrupts the moral fiber of this nation. In June the Supreme Court ruled that the Texas law that made gay sex a crime was an unconstitutional intrusion into people's private matters. The ruling invalidated similar laws in 12 other states, including Mississippi. Billy Hewes said the ruling is the worst thing to happen to this country since they took prayer out of schools. Jody Renaldo, director of Equality Mississippi, a statewide civil rights organization, told Hewes he was elected to serve all the people, including gays. Speaking to the Gulfport City Council, Renaldo said many gay men and lesbians own homes and pay taxes in Gulfport and deserve the same rights, freedoms, and protections as other residents.
