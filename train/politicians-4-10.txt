Has potential to be a good monarch and restore some credibility to the house of Windsor. Seems reasonably intelligent and willing to take part in public life. My sense of it is that he will probably be more willing to modernize the British monarchy. Truth of the matter is that the UK no longer has a massive empire that can support such a top-heavy social hierarchy. Unlike many others, I don't believe that the monarchy should be scrapped. Britain has a parliamentary system where the Prime Minister function s as the Head of Government but the monarch is the Head of State, which is a titular function. In other parliamentary states like Germany and Israel, the Head of State is an elected President. Scrapping the monarchy isn't really necessary and in the case of Britain, it serves as a link to the past which is important for them. Additionally, they serve as a check against infighting within the political establishment. People look for the royals to rise above the fray and offer a broad unifying vision for the country. Sometimes they fail at the task, Elizabeth II many times hasn't been all that responsive. sometimes they do rise to the task, like when King George VI, an unlikely hero in many respects, lead the country bravely through the Second World War with the help of Winston Churchill. Many aspects of monarchy are dated, starting with the rigid class order which defines it, but it serves a purpose in the broader scheme of governance.
