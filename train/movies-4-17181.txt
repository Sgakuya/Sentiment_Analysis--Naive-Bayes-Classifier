A beautiful, touching, sad movie! Ladies, you may want to leave your guy home for this one. While it may be slower than some can take (I think my poor boyfriend got a little bored during this one), Beyond Borders is a treat for those who don't mind a subtle, heart-felt journey into the world of relief-work and human compassion. I would like to see Angelina Jolie in more movies like this; she shows her has talent and range as an serious actress--infinately more subtle than her hot-bodied, ass-kicking video game vixen role as you-know-who. The romance portion wasn't as steamy as I thought it'd be, but it was a beautiful love story nonetheless. If you want your compassionate, thinking side to be touched, this is for you!
