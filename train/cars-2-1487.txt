A mediocre vehicle that doesn't keep up with its competitors, in more ways than one. Supremely comfortable, except for the details: the cupholders are flimsy and counterintuitive, the armrest is non-existant, but the steering wheel is in a good position and the chairs are perfect. Turbo lag is a large issue, becuase if you need to avoid an accident, you usually don't have the power you need until the debacle has passed. You can get used to that, though, and learn to anticipate throttle movements. Handling also leaves something to be desired. With a Front wheel drive setup and a sub-par 62/38 front rear weight distribution, it understeers like no other. Plus, the front wheel drive coupled with the 205 horsepower (worse with 235 Viggen) creates torque-steer so pronounced it'll throw you off the road if you aren't prepared (torque steer is when the wheels turn when power is applied on a bumpy road, causing the car to turn unexpectedly). Not the best car for the money. Choose something with RWD or All wheel drive like the 325 or A4
