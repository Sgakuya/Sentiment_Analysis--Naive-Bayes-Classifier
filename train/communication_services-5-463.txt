I haven't yet gotton a virgin mobile phone. The reason why I think it is great? The phone I have now is terribly expensive to buy prepaid minutes, and virgin mobile is only 25 cents per minute! I am paying right now 20 dollars for 40 minutes, when with Virgin mobile I can get 80minutes for twenty bucks, also the rate of 25cents goes down after you have talked on the phone for 10minutes that day it is 10cents per minute. To those of you who said after 24hrs you are wrong, you have to do this everyday in order to get the 10 cent a minute. It starts at five am in the morining. However it is still a good plan. I don't want to bother with a contract or monthly bill especially since i only use my moblie phone I have now ( which sucks) occasionally. I rarely use 20minutes a month. So if you need a reliable phone for emergencies or just to say hey Im headed over your way want to hang out to a friend! You are definetly set. Why bother with those jerks who want to con you into paying a huge monthly bill just so you can use your phone to get a hold of someone when you need to, not just because you want to talk. People have also tried to con me into getting rid of my regular phone for a cell! Don't do it. Local calling unlimited is cheap through sbc, and if you want to call family a phone card from sam's will last you awhile for about 30 dollars 1200. why pay 3 to have the plan, plus 5cents a minute. The whole world is a crock trying to steal our hard earned money! WATCH OUT FOR YOURSELFS MY FELLOW HUMANS, BE CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS, DON'T JUST BUY SOMETHING THAT LOOKS GOOD! HOPE.
