I have earned academic degrees from three IVY league Universities, and have been a professor at a fourth. I have probably visited more than 100 college campuses in the United States, often as a guest lecturer. I firmly believe that Cornell University is without question one of the three or four best universities (larger schools) to get an undergraduatate degree in the nation. Its size is a tremendous plus for any young person mature enought to make use of a diversity of acadmic offerings, a menu that outranks those of many schools that are listed above Cornell in US New & World report. By the way, that report harms Cornell because of one of its strengths - its combination of private and contract colleges. Cornell has one of the most beautiful campuses in the World. Ithaca is one of the truly great college towns...making Williamstown, MA and Hanover, NH and Princeton NJ boring by comparison. I often think of the Cornell/Ithaca world as the ultimate college experience. Haarvard should be an insurance shcool for Cornell, not the opposite.
