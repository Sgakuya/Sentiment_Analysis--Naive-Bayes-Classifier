 Looks like crap and domestics will still smoke it. If by domestics you mean '68 Shelby's and 427 Cobra's, then yes. Unfortunately, today's domestics are lucky if they don't break down before the green light flashes. The '99 and '00 Si, in Electron Blue Pearl, of course, is very pleasing to the eyes and is fast as hell - 160hp from a 1.6L 4-cylinder; for the mathematically challenged, that's 100hp per liter of displacement, which is impressive for ANY car. And that's stock - lest I remind you how easy it is to get these things well over the 200hp mark via intake, turbo or supercharger, exhaust, nitrous, etc. And since reliability is of the utmost importance, it's hard to go wrong with a Civic, or any Honda for that matter. Although I'm not too impressed with the latest Si - it looks like an even more mini minivan. Or a Jelly Belly, perhaps. I can only hope that lagging sales will prompt the return of the Si coupe.
