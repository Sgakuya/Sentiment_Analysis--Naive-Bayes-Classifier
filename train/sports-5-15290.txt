Brett Favre is the best period. First of all, the guy's entertaining. Back when Sapp was with the Bucs in Green Bay's division, Favre Stiff-Armed him to the ground while he was rushing him! And not only that, after the play, he'd get in Warren Sapp's face and trash talk him! Show me another quarterback that can pull that off successfully. Not only that, the guy makes throws no other quarterback can throw. And forget about everyone saying he throws too many INT's. Yes, he did throw some bad passes, but a lot of them had to do with his broken thumb. And at least half of those other INT's were either A. a bomb thrown on third and long (which really don't hurt you), B. thrown up in the air at the end of the half, or C. tipped off a recievers hand and then intercepted. At the end of the season, however, this stopped happening, and the recievers started to step up. Expect this year to be an off-the-chart year for Favre, because of how dependable the recieving corp has been lately.
