The Jerk is about an intellectually challenged man (played by Steve Martin) who is raised by family of black sharecroppers in rural Mississippi. When Martin goes off to experience the world, he casually invents a product that makes him an instant millionaire: the little nose clip on glasses that prevents them from sliding off your face. This movie is ridiculous but it allows Martin to steal the show. My favorite scene: a deranged gunman is firing at Martin as he works in a gas station. The bullets are missing him and popping holes in cans of oil right behind him. When Martin finally figures out what is going on (after asking his boss if the cans are defective), he runs away shouting a warning to his boss, Stay away from the cans! He hates the cans!
