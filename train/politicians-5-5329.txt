Maybe not the most dynamic personality, but he is clearly more qualifired than Bush. At first I ws going to vote Bush's way, then I realized, Gore is not Clinton, and he knows the game. Bush is governor in a state with a weak govenorship. Privitizing any part of Social Security is a bad idea, and he doesn't know the issues. I would rather have a man that knows the system, and he has a superior tax plan. Al Gore is more qualified and it should be based on that above personality. I apologize to Al Gore for ever considering not voting for him. I guess I always listened to my parents growing up and didn't know the issues.
