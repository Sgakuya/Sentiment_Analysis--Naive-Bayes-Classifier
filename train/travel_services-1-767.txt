This company knowingly rents malfunctioning vehicles. They will reset the battery on cars to turn off the check engine light and send the customer out in it, without knowing or caring why that light was on!!! They also fail to put insurance papers in the cars at many of their locations. To cut down on company costs, they let their cars be rented with expired registration. Sometimes they will doctor temp tags to make them look valid, and when questioned, they will tell customer that the vehicle company authorized it for a period of time. DO NOT BELIEVE THAT! What they are doing is illegal, and you may get the unpleasant experience of a felony stop! Other times, they'll just explain to customer that if they are pulled over and cited, that Advantage will pick up the ticket. Maybe so, but whose record will it go on/ and who will suffer the hassle and embarrassment of the ordeal? If that weren't enough, they like to confirm specialty rentals with a credit card. This supposedly guaruntees that the vehicle in that car class will be ready for you when you get there. They say this solely to sound professional and often do not have anything close to what you requested. If you want further info, ask me. I'll be happy to discourage anyone from renting from disadvantage rent-a car! How do I know so much? Well, I had the horrid experience of working there for several months. I quit after expressing concerns to the district manager who condoned all of the shady practices of ARAC.
