Dublin has a lot of good historical walking tours. My favorites were the tours that start at the Trinity College gate. They have separate walks for Dublin history, the 1916 rebellion, and the College itself. Here's a tip: the humorous and informative 30-minute tour of the college includes admission to see the Book of Kells; this lets you bypass the long line of ticket-buyers and walk right in. The Temple Bar area has lots of great music -- trad, jazz, rock, everything. There are also some easy day-trips from Dublin to the Boyne Valley sights such as Trim, Hill of Tara, and Newgrange. And all the bars and restaurants are now smokeless!
