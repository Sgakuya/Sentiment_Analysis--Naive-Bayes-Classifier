My only regret about this rating, is that I had to give him any stars at all. Hes the Barry Switzer of college basketball--having been a VERY mediocre coach at Army (just a few games over .500 during his 5 years), and after talking Pete Gaudet into quitting as head coach at Army in order to save his sorry a$$ at Duke--went on to make Pete a scapegoat for all of his own failure. Stuff like this ridiculous quote, is another reason why IMHO Chefsky is the most over-rated coach since Doherty won AP caoch of the year: 14. jibman33 , on 7/4/2001 4:47:00 PM, said: Duke was awful before Coach K got there. DUKE WAS FREAKIN ACC CHAMPION THE YEAR BEFORE! COACH K ARRIVED, AND WAS IN THE NATIONAL TITLE GAME JUST TWO YEARS PRIOR!!! Coach K, like most Dukies, was met at the door witha solid silver spoon. Which is why I said it and I'll say it again: Coach K = The Barry Switzer of Basketball.
