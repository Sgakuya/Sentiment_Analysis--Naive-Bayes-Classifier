The Godfather movies alone will definitely assure him a place in film history. A good director can hold your interest in a film from start to finish, and that's what he does in those films. I think all three were over three hours long, and yet you don't feel like you've been sitting there that long. Apocalypse Now just couldn't hold my interest for the entire length of the film, but you can still see why it's a film worth watching. My favorite of his films is one that is very underrated--Bram Stoker's Dracula. The images and characters are so vivid, it makes you forget the old Bela Lugosi film entirely. All in all, he's an excellent director, and as a sidenote, he even had George Lucas as an understudy at one point.
