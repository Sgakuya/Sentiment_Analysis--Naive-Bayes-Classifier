A good, solid, theatrically-trained actress--always nice to see a member of the New York end of the biz make it in the Hollywood game. The term anorexic gets thrown around a lot these days, I think irresponsibly. Some people are just naturally skinny. Our overfed culture exalts thinness, probably because it's a hard condition to attain given our national eating habits. (In cultures where food is scarcer and thinness is the norm, the ideals of beauty tend to be more fleshy.) I certainly wouldn't want to set Flockhart's twigginess up as a standard; but the trashing she's been getting for it looks suspiciously like misguided envy, or sour grapes: She's thinner than I could ever be, so there must be something wrong with her.
