I use to like this store a few years ago but now think its rediculas i mean come the frick on there prices are fricken rediculas they go up all the time you cant get jeans for less then 70 most of them are more and i do like some of them but would never pay that much and for some reason the ripped ones and the ones that look crappier cost more which i dont get but all there sweat shirts are atleast 70 tshirts area atleast 30 polos atleast 40 or 50 shorts atleasst 60 and the store reaks of sent my eyes started to water in there once and all there prices keep going up i mean they use to price there clothes like other stores in the mall but now its more of a high end store and there are those stupid people who everything they own comes from there and those stupid people mostly fat whho have to have a tshirt that says abercrombie and then the people who go in searching for the cheapest thing they can find in there just so they can own something from there its really pathetic oh and it seems as if old navy kind of copys there style except in tshirts so if you like there more simple stuff check them out for atleast half the price
