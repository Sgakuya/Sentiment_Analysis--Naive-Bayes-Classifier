I have a great deal of respect for Winona Ryder. She did theatre work at the American Conservatory Theatre, and hardly any actors do theatre work these days. Also, I read somewhere that She's never been in a film that grossed more than 100 Million. For a double-oscar-nominated actress, that's pretty weird.You'd be suprised to see how much these people make. All of them. Just to know that she's not that sickeningly well paid makes me a huge fan. I also think it's wonderful that she takes on these off-beat challenging roles. I'm sure everybody who's reading this has probably heard that a billion times, but it really is true! Mon Dieu! She's gorgeous. Absolutely. Lovely complexion. I could eat that complexion with a spoon. No, I am not a stalker. I also respect her for her apparent involvement with V-Day, and she wears those Free Leonard Peltier buttons. I am also for both these causes, so I was thrilled to see that someone else(Particularly her) should also take an interest. She was also very involved when Polly Klaas was abducted. And so I respect her.
