After waiting 40 minutes and noticeing several groups of people that had arrived 10-15 minutes after we had placed our order, I asked our waitress what the deal was? Her reply was I'll see what is taking so long. After another 8 minutes, she returned and said it will be 5 minutes. Another 10 minutes go by, now we ask to see a manager. He comes out assures us our order will be right out. After 10 minutes go by, out comes our order,not the right ones, but still it's an order. The manager says he's sorry about the delay, DELAY. After we finish our meal, we our given the bill for our meals we did not recieve with nothing more than a smile and a thanks come again. I'm quite sure I will never want to go back and wait that long for a breakfast again
