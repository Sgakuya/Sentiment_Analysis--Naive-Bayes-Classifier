I am 2/3's through my Masters program and find it very challenging but rewarding. There is a tremendous amount of work between the DQ's, individual projects and team projects. The simulations are great and other than one facilitator, I have been more than pleased. I have never worked so hard, the classes are really condensed into 6 weeks, and the evaluation is tough. Although the university requires participation 4 out of 7, the facilitators require content that show intellegent analysis. The individual projects, often based on simulations, are pertinent to the topic but require you to really think about handling situations. The team is as good as you make it. I have been in both good and bad. Mostly, I have found them rewarding but I always assume it is MY project, so am never disappointed. Only once did I complain to the facilitator - and I know for a fact the two individuals left on my team were penalized. I aced the class - but I did the whole paper. The materials are real world and relevant with significant opportunity to tie in your personal and work experiences. I have enjoyed the people I have gone to class with and although I have taken some breaks due to my employment reimbursement program - I am still in touch with several of prior classmates from around the GLOBE! It is what you make it. You must be very disciplined. As for financial aid, I have no experience with it. As for guidance - I have made my own decisions as to when to take a break and when I changed my major.
