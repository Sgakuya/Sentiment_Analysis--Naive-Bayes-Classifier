People who put Santorum in Hell for his views show the hate they harbor for anyone that doesn't agree with them.I believe that the practice of homosexuality is a mortal sin if it is practiced with a clear knowledge of its sinful nature.I myself have commited sins against the 6th commandment before I was married. I was given the grace by God to see this and have been able to repent with the Sacrament of Reconciliation. A true humble love for our Heavenly Father always leads to Truth.I see the sin of premarital sex,homosexual sex,pornography,masturbation,and adultery in marriage, among others sins against the flesh. I believe God gives us the gift and grace of loving all people, not just the ones who think the same way we do.We were all created to be with Him;just give your mind,heart,and will to Him. .He will work miracles! And someday maybe, the very person you once hated on earth,will be beside you in Heaven! Practice humility first,then you will have love! God bless you all!
