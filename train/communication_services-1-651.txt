I would like this to serve as a warning for potential cingular customers. For the last three years I was a cingular user, and unfortunately I had problems with them every few months, spending hours on the phone with customer service. Thus, I decided to end my contract, and since September 2004 I have no longer been a customer. Two months after ending the contract, I received a bill from cingular stating that I have to pay for usage during the month of August (this is after I already paid my August bill). After calling customer service and spending more than half and hour on the phone, they told me that I am liable for any delayed charges whenever Cingular has to rely on other companies' phone towers (since I had a national plan), and they have to pay extra. Not only had I not gone over my minute limit for the month of August, but I was charged $50 extra for it 2 months later, because Cingular claims that it received delayed charges from another carrier, which they imposed upon me. I find this completely outrageous and would like to warn any other cingular customers about this technique they use to overcharge their customers. Be careful if you have a national plan. In my opinion, you should stay away from any cingular contracts if dont intend on calling customer service every other month.
