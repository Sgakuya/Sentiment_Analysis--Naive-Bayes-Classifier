Repetitive, completely unchallenging combat, funky graphics which have aged horribly, music that pales in comparison to that found in the series' other entries, a scattershot story that just tries way too hard to be epic, infuriatingly long summon animations that you can't skip past, boring characters, and the adulation of throngs of zombielike fanboys make for the most overrated game ever made. It took me over a year to get all the way through this game, and when I finally finished I was left asking myself So where, exactly, was I supposed to be blown away by this thing? Don't believe the hype -- this is an average RPG at best.
