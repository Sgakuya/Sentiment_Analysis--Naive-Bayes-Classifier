At first I was convinced that this poll was a joke, but after reading some of the commentary I was astounded to find out that some of these people are actually serious. Some wrote about how Canada has no culture, no history, and nothing to be proud of. While this is no place for a long, drawn out explanation on Canada's merits, it must be said that anyone holding a less-than-favourable opinion on this fine Country is not only delusional, but is beyond reason. Canada is among the greatest countries in the world. It would require vast arrogance and ignorance to say otherwise. If anyone has any qualms about Canada, especially those who have written that claimed to be from Canada and 'hate' it anyway, I suggest you take the time to ponder what your life would be like if you had grown up in North Korea. This juxtaposition alone should at least make you begin to reconsider your slanderous views. In retrospect, writing this article is probably a vain act, as these so-called 'Canada-haters' probably would stop reading after the first few sentences, as this piece of text probably requires higher-than-room-temperature-IQ to comprehend.
