I never saw the appeal of subway. Up until recently, (when they decided to copy off of Quizno's) they just offered cold sandwiches. Nothing that special. I do agree though, that they can be better than greasy burgers and fries for those that eat out a lot and would like something a little healthier. I didn't particulary enjoy the service I recieved on two different occasions at the subway right outside of my college campus. The workers were incompetent. I went both times to get sandwiches for my brother and sister-in- law to take to them. Both times, the workers were very slow and I sat and watched as they just threw the toppings sloppily onto the sandwiches.
