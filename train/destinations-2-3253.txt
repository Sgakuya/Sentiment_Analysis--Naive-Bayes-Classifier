i find the people in seattle are in two different catogories.1 snobs 2 scary. not ever being racist i feel like a manority. homeless everywhere and the people who work in the public. ie busdrivers , librarians , etc are rude and plain unfriendly. although beautiful to look at , i would never buy a ugly house for 300.000.00 its ridiculous. i moved in a nice building to find out its a home to drug dealers. there isnt alot to do with my son, and for a city you would think there would be more option for children. im terrified to place my child in school here. the south side of seattle is like a place for the criminals or people who cannot afford a billion dollar home. thats my commplaints.. sorry if it sounds ugly, but i though moving here would be great ,, turns out after all the touristy stuff and greenry, its scary snobby and boring.
