Oh, I do love Chicago! I even tend to like movies that have anything to do with Chicago - The Blues Brothers , Ferris Bueller's Day Off , Uncle Buck to name a few. I've been there quite a few times and I must say I certainly do not think Chicago has any kind of identity problem; it would not only be difficult to confuse it with NYC or any other big city but also Chicago does not even pretend to be anything but the big, booming, fast moving, and earthy giant of the mid-west that it is. It does share a sense of excitement that I think all really huge cities have. You'll find lots of wonderful cultural opportunities here too - excellent and plentiful museums and theatre, sporting events and a variety of festivals as well as world-class restaurants. The hotels are also plentiful and there are several well kept historical ones. My favorite (so far) is The Drake which was really breathtakingly decorated last Christmas when I visited for a few days. It is also conveniently located, along with many other fine hotels, within walking distance of some great shopping. Chicago is an exciting place to visit all year round, but if you go in December be sure to dress for cold temps - the wind coming off the lake can be really mean!
