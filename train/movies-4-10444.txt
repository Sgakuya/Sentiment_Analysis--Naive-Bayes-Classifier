This movie had such a promising title! Imagine: a movie adressing a question rarely considered: what women really want/think/feel-- in the context of the double standard so alive and well today. Just for its theme, the movie deserves a good rating-- it is a formidable task to try and explain via entertainment some of the issues facing todays women and men. I think this movie did some of that: clearing up misconceptions (Helen's character being not being a total bitch) and gave a good overview of how a man's man might function.. My favourite part was when the coffee shop girl is in bed with Mel and thinks Lied about the grande . Sorry but it's hilarious. And I can so identify with it.. I just think men might see the movie and realize, some of the reasons females act the way they do from being bitchy to faking orgasms.
