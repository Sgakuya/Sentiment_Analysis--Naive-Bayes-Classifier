I think that Bush needs to let any of the foreign affairs he is dealing with go. He is not good at them at all. He is good at domestic issues, but thats it! For example, he isn't even worrying about Osama bin Laden anymore. Now it is just Saddam this and Saddam is bad blah blah blah. Even though Saddam is agreeing to cooperate with the UN inspectors. There is no reason for a war, except that Bush says Saddam did try to kill my dad after all . Get over it! And why go against our allies just because they won't join us? That is stupid and all he is doing is screwing over our relations with these countries. And that's just because they don't want a war. If he could come up with a damn good reason to go to war, then I'd support him. But he hasn't so far, and unless something major happens, I don't think he will.
