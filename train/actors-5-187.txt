I recently saw an interview with Jack Lemmon on the Bravo channel, (you know, those interviews where that college professor and an actor is sitting on a stage and a bunch of college students are the audience). Anyway, it was sad to know that this guy dealt with depression and drinking off and on in his older years. Plus, he was such a humble guy but on screen he was superb. This guy just seemed to have a stronger screen presence as he got older. True, The Apartment was good but Glenngary Glenn Ross (25 years later) was just as well an illuminating performance for him! He was so versatile. I can't think of too many actors he can be dramatic and funny and pull it off with such grace and dignity. We miss you Jack.
