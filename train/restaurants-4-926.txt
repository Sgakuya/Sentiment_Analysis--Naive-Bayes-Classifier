Subway is decent, but I wouldn't call it great. It satisfies a craving if you want a good sandwich, but it could be better. I usually get the roasted chicken sandwich. I wish they'd keep the chicken warm instead of nuking it in the microwave! The toppings are decent, but could be fresher. I like their new variety of breads- my fave is the country wheat with all the poppyseeds and other stuff sprinkled on top. My only concern is that there are so many Subways! There's one on practically every corner and they keep turning other restaurants into Subways! Enough already- you've cornered the market on subs so stop building one on every block!
