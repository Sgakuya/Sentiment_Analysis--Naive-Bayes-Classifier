I was in the Windy City in 2000 and I can't say I didn't like it. It seems to be a very busy, bustling city with a lot of culture and things to do for everyone. The view at the top of the Sears Tower skydeck is virtually indescribable... just see for yourself, you can see fifty miles in every direction, and you have a great view of the city of Chicago. New Yorkers will undoubtably disagree, but Chicago is the skyscraper capital of the West. There is also nothing like an afternoon at Wrigley Field. It's arguably the quintessential sports venue in all of America, it's like you're going back in time fifty years (heck, light weren't even installed until 1988). Unlike football stadiums, I don't think baseball stadiums need all those video screens and other electronic stuff, it's a pastoral game tha should be played in a simple setting that should take you back 50 or even 100 years. All in all, Chicago's a wonderful city to visit, it's huge, has something for everybody, and aside from New York and LA, it truly personifies the American culture.
