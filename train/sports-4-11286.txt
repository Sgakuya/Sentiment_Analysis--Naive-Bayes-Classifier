Chan is coach who goes underrated even by many Ga Tech fans. His first three years at GT have been marred by events that occurred just as he was coming on board, such as Flunk Gate when the team lacking depth lost even more to academics. Also lost a very promising running back his second year to a knee injury. Despite these and other GaTech land mines he has managed a few big wins and a bowl game each season. This upcoming year, his forth, promises to show improvement despite yet another academic SNAFU which has resulted in a self-imposed loss of scholarships. Chan should be commended for accomplishing so much despite the unexpected adversity. If the Tech faithful will give him time he may prove to be an excellent coach.
