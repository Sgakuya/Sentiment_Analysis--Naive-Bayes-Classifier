This is a film worthy of repeated viewing just for the sheer pleasure of entertainment. Jean Reno fits the role of Leon (An Italian milk-drinking hitman of action and few words!) like a glove. Natalie Portman gives a wonderful performance as Mathilda, a twelve year old woman/child whose family was annihilated by crooked DEA agents led by Gary Oldman, whose character serves as a terrifying example of good cop gone evil! The plotline wouldn't be Oscar material, but the lighthearted scenes between Leon and Mathilda are fascinating because it's like watching two people from two different worlds getting further acquainted and eventually growing together. The last fifteen minutes of the film are full of suspense and shows the viewer how truly cunning our Leon is and why he IS the professional in the first place. This movie was cleverly shot and Luc Besson is an awesome action film director. But the action gives way to emotional scenes that are truly fitting and makes the film so satisfying to behold!
