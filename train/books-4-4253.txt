In high school, I was forced kicking and screaming to read Portrait, and I don't think it hit me until about halfway through how great it is. Since then I have read the better part of Ulysses (which is huge, and I'm loving it.) The fact is that a lot of people struggle with his works because he writes stream of consciousness, and most people don't read that style very often. To top that, he does seem to skip around, but he does that (for example, in Portrait) for some reason-- like skipping around at the beginning of Portrait to show the mindset of a 10 year old boy. Ulysses is much more dense reading, and for those who don't deal well with this style, I don't suggest even attempting it, because you'll hate every second of it. I don't think he's overrated, but I think you have to accept him as what he is-- not concrete at all.
