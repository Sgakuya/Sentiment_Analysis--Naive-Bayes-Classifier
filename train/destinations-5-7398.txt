I know Paris gets a lot of knocks against it but I really love that city. I went there first when I was 16 oe so and toured all over for 5 or 6 days and there was so much to see. There was so much to do there also. I went back 6 or 7 years later and loved re-visiting some of the museums and sites in Paris. People are a little difficult, but I find that to be generally true wherever you trabel. I speak French to a degree, so that might have helped out a little bit. So many things to see - some must seees include Versailles, the Louvre, Pompidou Center and Quaetier Latin. There are also a lot of 1 hour excursions outside of the city that are worthwhile.
