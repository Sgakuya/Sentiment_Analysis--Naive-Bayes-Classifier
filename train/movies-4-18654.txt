I really, really liked 'The Others'. It takes place in post WWII in the English Channel of Jersey. Nicole Kidman plays a somewhat-off woman, isolated in her large Victorian house with her two children, who she claims are allergic to sunlight. Funny things start to happen when three servents show up (they are there to replace the other servents wno mysteriously vanished..) The young actors who play Grace's(Nicole Kidman's character) children do a remarkable job and add a lot to director Alejandro Amenabar's (I hope I spelled that right) dark, dreary vision. Where this movie rarely reaches nail-biting horror, it does have a very creepy undertone-what with the dark house (the curtains must be shut at all times for the children and they have no electricity) and the little-almost cliched ghost-type goings-on (Doors shutting, piano playings, curtain openings.) Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job of a woman on the verge of madness, trying to combat all at once the possibility of the supernatural taking over her home(and her children-the best part of the movie is when her daughter channels this scary old woman), her children becoming scared and distant, and her need for her long lost husband to return(this part is a big head scratcher..watch the movie, you'll see what i'm talking about.) As far as the servants go, they very obviously are up to some sort of something that a lot of the ending is kind of ruined. But it is such a cool ending, that really doesn't matter. My main complaint with this film though, was that it always kinda stayed on a plain. Even amidst all of the apparent goings-on, it never really reached the feverish chaos I expected. It was still a very solid movie. One that I would recommed highly
