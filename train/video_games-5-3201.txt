Finally Red Faction is out! All the hype has been building on the FPS from Volition with its Geo-Mod and great story line, this may revolutionize the FPS as we know it.The hype meter has been high on this game and ever since I played the demo,Ive been wanting to get this game really bad.I can tell the difference between the final product and the free demo THQ and Volition gave out awhile back. You are Parker,a man who wants a change in his life and decides to go to Mars for bigger and better things.Little did he know what he was going to run into....basically a slave camp! The miners revolt and this is where we start the game.A character in the game named EOS starts this rebellion and calls the rebels Red Faction ...your job....simple....go through hundreds of Ultor soldiers.....think you can do it miner?! Gameplay Well,if you played Time Splitters or Quake 3 Revolution,you will be familar with the controls.If Time Splitters is 60 FPS then Red Faction is also 60 FPS.Havent Noticed any slowdowns yet...not even when I played deathmatch with 5 bots.Deathmatch mode is acceptable,not as many as TS and Q3R but atleast this one has a meaningful 1 player story mode.The Deathmatch has 9 areans to choose from and this is where you can practice at and get use to the controls,just seclect no bots and start expiermenting with Geo-mod engine haha..blow stuff up! Graphics and Sound Great graphics...nothing like SSX but still great.They paid attention to details...something I always notice in a game.As far as character models and artwork,Volition did a great job in that department as well.The music goes well with the game,kinda futuristic sounding and the voice acting is good.Some of the things that are said are helerious...funny thing to do is to grab your trusty flame thrower and tourch somebody up and watch them run around screaming...I know its wrong to laugh at that but try it, you will too! Overall Did this game live up to the hype which surrounded it? yeah...yes it did.Its something that will revolutionize FPS as we know it and we can look back at this game as the originator of geo-mod blow stuff up...huhuh I really like this one and think its the best PS2 game Ive played so far.It you are into a FPS story driven game and want to blow holes in just about anything, then I would without a doubt get it.Its only about a 9-10 hour game which I beat in a day.....so its short on gameplay I guess.....considering it was so good, I played almost stright through...heh, now that a sign of a great game and its my best PS2 game period. This game gets a 9.4
