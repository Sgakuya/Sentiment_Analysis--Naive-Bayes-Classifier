I was never into Star Wars as much as most people, but that doesn't mean I didn't have high expectations for the beginning of the series. Lucas really mucked it up with this one. At first I thought it was cool but looking back over the movie, you just find that it could've been so much better. The Gungans are the most annoying creatures ever, and Jar Jar Binks' attempt at comic relief falls flat on its face. The fight scenes are good, but that's about it. Lucas doesn't show us much of the galaxy, and what he does show isn't very exciting. The planet of Naboo is extremely boring, Tatooine is a desert wasteland we're all too familiar with, and Couresant is kind of a cool place but we hardly see any of it. Also the conflict within the senate from which the future Emperor gains power evolves way too quickly. The acting and fight scenes are decent. Everything else is less than stellar.
