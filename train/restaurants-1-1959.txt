I never cared for the flame broiled taste of BK Anyone who walked in, ordered, chowed down and then walked out with there stomach feeling like it just got kicked in by a mule knows why. The thing that turns Me off to places like this is as follows. You see the Burger King commercials on TV right? You go into the Burger King resturant look at the meal choices board and then order right? Ok My point is why in bolth instances does the food look soo damn good large, fresh, all put together so nice and neat,well worth the four bucks for that delictible meal. And then you get it, what a let down, what a slap to the face. The burger looks like it has been up someone's a s for the better part of the day the fries are cold and limp and the only good thing about your drink is that it does come in a cup. If Burger King were to show actual photos of this slop, the only living things dining there will be the roaches. Talk about false advertising.
