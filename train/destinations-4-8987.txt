I have been dipping Copenhagen Fine Cut since I joined the Marines in 1995. I went to a Hunters Extravaganza and got 30 free cans of Longhorn Fine Cut Natural. Since Gas Prices are so high these days, I thought I would save money on snuff and dip this free stuff if I could handle it. Halfway through the first can, I thought it was awful, but then I noticed I was getting used to it. Now I love it. I like it because it holds its moisture longer than Copenhagen. I guess since my lip is so desensitized, Copenhagen seemed to dry out in my lip in about 10 min. Longhorn stays moist and I get a lot more spits per pinch. Also, you get more snuff per can than Copenhagen. When my 30 free cans is depleted, I will certianly purchase more Longhorn.
