A pretty amazing piece of architecture in an absolutely beautiful city. I've always wondered what it must be like to grow up in a place as architecturally stunning as Prague. To be just constantly surrounded by such beauty and history. I was going to get on a soap box and say how Americans live in a throw away society and have little appreciation for what real history is but I'll save that for another time and just tell you this... if you got and you're standing on the city side of the bridge there is a tower to the left just at the edge. When I was there the door was open and being annoying tourists we decided to climb the stairway to try and get to the top well just to warn you this is want they wanted us to do. You start climbing and the stairway gets smaller and smaller and just about 3/4 of the way up there is a small room and a woman collects a toll from you to keep going. After climbing 3/4 of the way up of course we paid, it was one of the oldest tricks in the book and we fell for it so be forewarned
