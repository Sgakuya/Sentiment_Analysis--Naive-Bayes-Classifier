People all seem to justify their affection for Seattle by its scenery or natural splendor, almost as an excuse to defend its many shortcomings. This strikes me as peculiar because although Seattle has scenery on its side, it's far less beautifully situated than Vancouver, British Columbia. Moreover, Vancouver ALSO has all qualities Seattle lacks. Having grown up in Seattle, the things that drove me nuts the most: arrogant Seattle attitude that the city is the best, as if people had never visited elsewhere; the slowest automobile driving I have ever witnessed in the world; general lack of pride in homes/gardens; introverted attitude, people rarely socialize; early to bed, early to rise mentality; pathetic nightlife; downtown that rolls its sidewalks up at 5:00 p.m.; generally unfriendly attitudes between neighbors (there are exceptions); unremarkable architecture yet, again, a blind faith in the superiority of Seattle; a population's complete unwillingness to move forward progressively with transportation alternatives; obsessed with baseball and pro-sports generally--building TWO new sports facilities when the one there was just fine, not great, and letting the Alaskan Way Viaduct stand ready to kill many people in the next big earthquake...need I say more?
