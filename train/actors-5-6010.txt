Tom Cruise is one of the top actors in the world. I am so proud of him for surviving all of the negativity he's recieved for being talented, sexy, and real. Movies like Interview With The Vampire , Jerry Maguire , and Mission Impossible: II show his incredible talent for acting and capturing emotions. How many people could do their own dangerous stunts and make it look amazing? He's just wonderful through and through...that's sexy. People make rude comments about his nose, teeth, and dyslexia, but he's managed to get through all of that and not change his appearance or hide his imperfections just because some nobody thinks he should be perfect. That right there is called strength and confidence...those two virtues put together make his sexy beyond all other sexy!! Tom, you are ALWAYS going to be loved because I'm here to love you FOREVER! Your imperfections make you BEAUTIFUL!
