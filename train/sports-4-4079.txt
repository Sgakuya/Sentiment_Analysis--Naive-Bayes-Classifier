My Dad, brother and I met him at a dinner in Syracuse in 1982 (I think) while he was coach at Iona (Jeff Ruland played for him) and what a speaker! He was even funnier yakking over a few drinks, the guy could really hold court. When he went to NC State, we thought he might be over his head, Iona wasn't that strong a program and seemed to reach its highwater mark under him. When he won the national championship, against the prohibitive favorite Phi Slamma Jamma U/Houston team (featuring Clyde Drexler, Akeem Olajuwon, and several additional future NBAers) we (along with the entire college basketball world) were stunned. Watching him aimlessly run up and down the court from one group of Wolfpack revellers to another, looking for someone to hug and dance with, was an added treat. Gone too soon, rest in peace, Jimmy.
