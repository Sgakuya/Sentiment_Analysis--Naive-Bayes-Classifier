This school is a joke. It's a glorified community college. So what if you have to be 23 to be admitted and have work history . They offer IT degrees, but don't have computer labs, offer nursing programs, with no lab or classroom (would you want that nurse touching you who never set foot in a classroom?) Much of the activities are group activities, so the strong carry the weak. Your grade is dependant on your group's performance. They try to simulate the work environment. Ha! We had 30 students in a class and the school had 3 laptops on which to learn. Even IT startups have more equipment than that. I left because of that, and the laughs I was getting from prospective employers when I told them what school I was attending.
