Now this is an attractive woman. She is what I would describe as a 'handsome woman', a tough and intelligent voice. I'm certain that in make-up she is more presentable, but there is still the poignant quality of her eyes. She seems like the type of woman who would completely take control in bed, but wants a good battle to boot. I hope that she gets an Oscar some day, just to show women like Halle Berry and Julia Roberts that they received theirs not for talent, but for rubbing elbows and other body parts with ugly old producers, just ask Burns he'll tell you. Anyway, Linney needs to act across from Feminine Hollywood egos like those mentioned and these here; Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd, Selma Hayek, and Toni Collette.
