John Kerry's record as a United States senator is quite lackluster and may do him more harm than good as he runs for President. He has had a consistantly liberal voting record that doesn't really reflect the values of the entire country. His record on defense and security is notoriously weak, as he has voted against every major weapon system that has been used to help the United States fight the War on Terrorism. He stood on the floor of the United States senate and spoke for nearly an hour on how Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the United States, and he voted for the resolution that gave President Bush full authority to launch a military campaign against Iraq. Eight months later, he criticizes Bush for using the authority that Kerry himself voted to give him. Kerry can say that he voted for the resolution with the understanding that the President would exhaust every option before going to war, but the bottom line is that Kerry assisted in giving Bush a blank check. Then recently, Kerry voted against the $87 billion to fund the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq. He wanted an amendment that would've taken the costs of that supplementary plan and deducted him from Bush's tax cut. That amendment failed, and Kerry voted against the bill. While Kerry was certainly in the right to demand that the $87 billion be paid for and not tacked on to the debt, he of all people, as a former soldier, should understand that partisan debate over fiscal policy should not take precedent over vital funding for our troops that are engaged in a costly and bloody war in Iraq. All in all, Kerry's entire Senate career has consisted mainly of voting for something that is popular at the time, but immediately criticizing that policy when things turn sour.
