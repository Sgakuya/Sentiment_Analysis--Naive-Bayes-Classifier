I have a couple of things to say about Sonic. First of all I work at a sonic in Louisiana. I have never in my life heard of recycling food. All of our workers are informed and tested before they are even allowed to work with the food. We train our employees that once the food has been brought out the door, it CANNOT be brought back inside. Bringing food from outside back into the store is against health codes. As for carhops sitting around talking to friends and boyfriends, that is just crazy. If we are caught talking to anyone besides a paying customer, we are sent home. I don't think anyone should judge every sonic based on the poor management skills of one particular Sonic. I think sonic is the best eating environment ever. What other fast food place can you go where you eat in your car and your food is brought out to you? NOt only that, but the girls are on skates and they check back with you to see if you need anything else? Nowhere. These girls that bring your food out work in the heat during the summer and the cold in the winter. They have to take your food out to you when it is raining and snowing. The food you order is made AS YOU ORDER IT and not a momment sooner. I think sonic is definitely Five Star Worthy
