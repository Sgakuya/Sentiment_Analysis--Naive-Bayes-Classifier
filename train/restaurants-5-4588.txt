Sad to say, the Tony Roma's franchise in Omaha was sold for its physical location -- at an unbelievably huge price that just could not be turned down! Restaurants that serve pork ribs are a dime a dozen here and there is much competition for THE best. Not so with BEEF ribs. Roma's is MUCH missed. They were the BEST beef ribs to even be found in our area. We recently discovered their sauces can be purchased online by the case (or in gift packs), but $4 per 18oz bottle is a little much for us. FORTUNATELY, we discovered their recipe for our favorite BlueRidgeSmoky sauce, as well as the cooking method(as quoted by Roma's chef, Denis Zeeb). We now have our Tony Roma's events in our own back yard!
