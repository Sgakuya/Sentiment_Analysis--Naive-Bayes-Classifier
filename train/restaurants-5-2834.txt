First, it's not what most people think of as "chili". It's sweeter, not especially spicy, and wouldn't really work in a bowl. This chain, like other, smaller chains still concentrated in Cincinnati, makes coneys (chili cheese dogs) and 3-, 4-, and 5-ways. A 5-way is a plate of spaghetti topped with chili (ground beef in a thin sauce), pinto beans, onions, and cheese; just subtract an ingredient or two for a 4- or 3-way. The stuff is incredibly addictive. Besides the food, which is served in diners with booths or counter service, the service is consistently great (both in the Cincinnati area, where I grew up, and in Columbus, where I live now). The staff is happy, friendly, and attentive. The kitchen is open, so they're always interacting with the cooks, who also seem to be having a good time. A great experience if you're visiting Ohio, Indiana, or Kentucky!
