I have to note the resemblances between the Alien and Terminator movies. In both of the first movies, one of the themes was the distrust of computers and robots. In Alien, Ellen Ripley is nearly strangled by an android, and the Nostromo's main computer, aptly named mother for the crew's dependence on it, withholds information from the crew. In Terminator, Sarah is being chased by a super- killing machine, the Terminator. The sequels to these two movies were both directed by James Cameron (Cameron also directed the first Terminator film as well). The sequels were all about the redemption of robots and androids, and proving that they can be forces of good. In Aliens, Ripley is horrified when she finds out that an android will be on her crew as she goes out in seach of the Aliens. But as it turns out, the android saves her life, and they grow to become friends. Same with Terminator 2. Sarah is extremely afraid of the Terminator when he comes back, and views him as a threat to her life. But then they become friends! James Cameron, I can definitely see a trend..
