Out of deference to the Irish today on St. Patricks day, I will have to give them a high rating. It is very well deserved though. Ireland is a country on the move. A country that was once one of the poorest in Europe is now the fastest growing. It is a beautiful country with really nice people. There are many contrasts, between urban cities that have a classical, European edge (Dublin) to beautiful seaside scenery along the Atlantic coast. In addition, real progress has been made in the past 5 years concerning the strife between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. It is not so much of a concern anymore, but still it's acute and it comes up every once in a while. The fighting is very localized and it should not stop anyone from coming. When visiting the British Isles, Ireland is a must see!!
