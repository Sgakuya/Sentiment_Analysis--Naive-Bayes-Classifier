No doubt about it - Mainerates very high for unspoiled scenic beauty. It's almost a waste to designate some areas natural parks, given the basically unspoiled status of most of the state. I've been to Maine a few times (too many years ago), but it was always fun to go there. I worked on a construction project in Portland in the 1960s (before its urban renewal, which turned out nicely), and when the workday was over, there wasn't much to do. For fun, we'd go out to a local landfill in the evening and shoot at rats scrambling around in the trash. It's a nice place to visit and, if you prize the totally quiet, solitary, contemplative life, I guess Maine would fit the bill very nicely.
