I am an American and I think it is time for Americans everywhere to stand up for what is right and tell Al Gore to go home!! He has stated that he wants every vote to be counted. I don't think that the ballots that were thrown out in my state was recounted! What about the other counties in Florida? Why does he just want a few counties counted? What about the other States? Al Gore lost in 29 states. Looks to me like that is over half of the United States that did not want Al Gore for a president. Who is paying for all of this? Al Gore doesn't care about America as he says, he is dragging us through the mud! Isn't it time to clean up America? Clinton and Gore have managed to make us the laughing stock of the World! I'm beginning to think the man has a screw loose, he is a spoiled rotten brat he is not concerned about the people in Florida, he is only concerned for himself!!
