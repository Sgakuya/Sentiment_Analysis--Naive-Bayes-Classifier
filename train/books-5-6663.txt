The Hobbit is a book of courage and heart, which implies you should never give up no matter how impossible the task may seem. I personally recommend The Hobbit to readers of all ages. Reading The Hobbit is one of the most extraordinary expressions available to human beings. Bilbo, a hobbit, is invited on a treasure hunt with Gandalf, Thorin, and a cast of twelve other dwarves. Can he overcome goblins, wargs, and then get through the Mirkwood forest to face Smaug, a ferocious dragon? Thorin, the King under the Mountain, has his heart set on regaining his treasure from the plunder of the dragon. In the early stages of the journey Thorin thinks little of Bilbo because he is little (hobbits grow from two to four feet tall). Thorin soon finds out that Bilbo will play a bigger role in this nonstop thrill ride through fantasy and adventure than he expects.
