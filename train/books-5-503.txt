The third book in the series. With the second book in the series, The Chamber of Secrets, Rowling was on the verge of turning the stories into a tired plot of Potter saves the day again. But with PoA, The events unfold around Harry, with very little involvement by him untill the end. A nice change of pace. All the Potter books are interesting and highly entaining. Appropriate for children, even though there are some dark moments. The best thing about these books is that parents can read them and enjoy them as well. It appeals to all ages. The religous kooks who decry it because the wirchcraft and say it promotes satanism should all have there head examined. The books are wonderful.
