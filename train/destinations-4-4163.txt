As a native of the Baltimore area, I really am disappointed at the bad beat that this city gets. It really is amazing to visit with its cultural diversity. There's a little bit of everything for anyone- great restraunts and shops, and great historical significance as well. It's great to visit Fort McHenry- truly awesome to visit the site of the battle that inspired our national anthem. The skyline is beautiful as well. The Inner Harbor is really the city's cultural center-you always see something interesting there every time you go- whether it be performances or street players. It's the best place to spend the 4th of July holiday. The traffic is horrendous and take it from someone who lived in Inner City Baltimore-the crime is high. If you're looking to move to this area- move to Baltimore County.
