Fleetwood Mac's most popular album, Rumours, completely epitomizes their style. There's lots of good stuff in here. Unfortunately, there are a couple that I'm not crazy about. For the most part, Lindsey Buckingham's songs are guitar-centric, very good songs. I find I enjoy these most. Stevie Nicks' mystical reveries are very good as well, if not a little feminine. Christine McVie's songs are, to me, downright annoying. I hate her cheery pop-style. Regardless of what I think, however, this album is considered the greatest break-up album of all time, and with good reason. While some of the songs seem very cheery, you have to really pay attention to the lyrics to realize just how bitter they are, especially in the Nicks and Buckingham songs. The absolute highlight of the album is The Chain, written by all five bandmembers. It is very dramatic, and a good rock song. It sums up the basic premise of the album. Overall, this album is very good, and there's a reason it's considered one of the greatest of all time.
