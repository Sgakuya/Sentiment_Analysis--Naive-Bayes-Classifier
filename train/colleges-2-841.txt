I am currently in my second block of classes and I am not nearly as satisfied as I was with the first classes. I think that you are pulled in with good instructors to start and then left to fend for yourself. I am experiancing no feedback from instructors and unanswered questions. Alot of the students are asking questions about assignments because there are no specifics in the syllabus. I feel very ignored with these insructors and I think it is a shame that the rules that we were taught in the first block of classes do not seem to apply to all instructors. There is chatting in the main classroom instead of the chatroom, there are hundreds of just checking in posts in the chat room. I think that there should be rules to follow like we are taught in the first classes, but there are not. It seems that the students run amuck and the required 100 words for the DQs are not even adhered to. I think that this school has a long way to go. I had an instructor disappear for eight days straight then posted an explanation of being sick on the eighth day and still has not returned since, when she promised to. I posted a question to another instructor 3 days ago and still have not gotten an answer, even though she has been in class since then. I would caution anyone thinking about going to this school to really make sure this is what you want.I also forgot to mention the attendence problem that alot of students have been having and they finally got it straightened out in the fourth week after students were being threatened that they would be auto dropped, even though they did have more than sufficient attendence.
