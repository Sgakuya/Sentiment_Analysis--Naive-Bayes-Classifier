I work for Kay Jewelers, and it's very obvious that all of the people who are on this site have gone to stores where the employees do not know what they are doing. I have never heard of some of these outrageous problems, they are crazy! First and foremost we are trained to be all about customer service, so for anyone in our company to refuse to do repairs telling you to take it back to the orginanating store it was purchased at is ludacris. Secondly, for items to come back from the repair shop looking differently is insane, and asking them to pay for the ring to be reblessed any priest or pastor should be more than happy to do it at no cost to you or your husband. So before anyone says "Oh don't shop with Kay anymore they are bad", get your facts straight and learn more about the items you are purchasing in the store and what you can do to make your purchases last a lifetime.
