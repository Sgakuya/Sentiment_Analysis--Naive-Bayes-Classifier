definitely a smart purchase, if you're willing to invest an extra $40 CDN in a decent charger and some AAA NiMH batteries. general faults: -i'd like to be able to disable the backlighting on the display for better battery life -the software provided (RioPort audio manager) for managing your mp3 playlists could be a whole lot better -your 64MB starting memory is two 32MB flash cards, and since songs cannot span two cards the wasted space is double what it could be -yes, i know the point is portability, but a port for a power adapter would be a relatively inexpensive feature to add. -my right earphone developed a slight static crackle after a few days. obviously that won't happen to everyone, but it's annoying for me. also, don't buy this if you're running windows NT, you need USB support!
