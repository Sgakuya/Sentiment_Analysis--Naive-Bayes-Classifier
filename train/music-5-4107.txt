This album is so great! I can't really describe it, but I know deep inside what I feel. The whole basis of this cd is the emotions that go along with love, and each one, from being blissfully in love (All that Heaven Will Allow) to being alone, apart from the one you thought would always be there (When You're Alone). I have felt all the emotions while listening to this, and it enhances and gives fondness to the memories of those times. This album really showcases the Boss's amazing songwriting talent! The lyric booklet almost reads like poetry (Valentine's Day, Walk Like a Man) and it is just superb! I have loved it forever, and I always will! A favorite of mine, this softer Bruce cd should melt any heart, and turn you into a Bruce believer!
