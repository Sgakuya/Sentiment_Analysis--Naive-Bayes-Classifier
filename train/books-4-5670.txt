I confess, I made the mistake of watching the movie Less Than Zero before reading the book (but in my defence, I didn t even know that there was a book to be read). And that changes your (or at least my) perspective on things. If I read a book and then watch the movie I often get annoyed about how much it is different. But when I see the movie before I read the book it all switches over and does a U-turn. And this is annoying because the book is the original not the movie so you really don t have any right to have those sort of feelings. Based on this my perception of Less than Zero (the book) might have become biased since I (that is my mind) still considers Less than Zero (the movie) the original. But let me stop my bellyaching - since I m sensing it s becoming a bit too outdrawn and focus on the bookreview. Right then... here we go. This book is basically about drugs, booze, rich snotty brats and money. Excess, excess, excess. Bret Easton Ellis really strips down the layers in terms of writing until you re left with naked, exposed sentences that make you wonder if you re really supposed to care for the characters, other than Clay obviously. Clay the narrator brings us along to parties, into exclusive clubs, down dirty alleys and along the empty freeways. We are drawn into a shallow, meaningless world where nothing really does matter at all. The way of telling the story gives you a real claustrophobic feeling when reading it. It makes you feel like you re trapped and can t get out of Clay s mind, his feelings and his useless life. Claustrophobic indeed. Even though this wasn t a book that knocked me over and had me reading it nonstop because I just couldn t able myself to put it down it conveys itself subtly and many times I recall telling myself just this paragraph and then I ll turn the lights out . So all in all I short n sweet read that, if not leaving you any wiser, it sticks itself in your memory for a long time afterwards.
