Arizona is truly the most beautiful state in America! It is so geographically diverse, it's crazy. In the southern portion of the state, the desert scenery is really a sight to see, with varies of plant and animal life here found nowhere else in the world. Sedona speaks for itself. The scenery there is absolutely jawdropping! Flagstaff is one of the nicest places I've ever been to! The people are very friendly and the scenery is top notch! Take a walk around downtown Flagstaff, there's more to do than you think! There are three National Parks. Petrified Forest, Saguaro, and of course, the GRAND CANYON! The greatest natural wonder on earth! And with over 15 National Monuments, more than any other state, there is plenty to do if you're a sightseer or an avid outdoors person. If you think Arizona is nothing more than a flat, lifeless desert, then you're sorely mistaken! Take a trip here, then you'll realize that Arizona has alot to offer and you'll be saying that Arizona is the most beautiful state in America!
