as the band fear once said, new york's alright if you like saxophones. i like saxophones. and new york. and there's nothing in the world that beats passing out in front of cbgb's while hugging a 40 oz of colt 45, then waking up the next morning and having to beg people for change so you can afford a train ticket back home since someone stole your while you were sleeping, so you could make it back to jersey in time for class. new york is teenage memories for me. i will never, ever hate new york. oh yeah, and that whole new york STATE thing...the country part is nice, but insignificant in the shadow of the great city. they should be two completely different states, because they seem that way anyway.
