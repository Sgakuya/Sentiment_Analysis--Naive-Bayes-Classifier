You know Im getting real tired of these second hand smoke activists running around telling people where and where not they can smoke. You want The truth Ill give you the truth, The truth is is that there is no evidence second hand smoke kills anyone. Everyones heard the second hand smoke fact thats says, 3,000 people die every year from second hand smoke right? Those statistics that you saw on that truthc comercial about 3,000 people dieing every year of second hand smoke actually were lies. And Im not just saying that, those statistics were put out in an official report by the EPA. Thats report then was sued by a cigarette company. This case went to a federal judge. After carefully looking over the information he concluded that the EPA would throw out information it didnt want (ie that information that said smoking didnt really hark you that much), and keep information that they liked. The EPA took out 19 of the orginal 30 pieces of information givin to them. Then truth said on one of its latest commercials A recent study by the EPA shows that 3,000 people die every year from second hand smoke . They did this thinking that people would trust the credibility of the EPA and hope that the normal TV watching persons ignorance will make them belive this. This they hoped will lead the way to a smoke free world. Hopefully if we shoot off enough propaganda it will get what we want to happen, a smoke free world!. Lies do nothing Truth. If you dont belive me get it from a respectable source. http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,26109,00.html The facts are that plenty of studies show second hand smoke doesnt do anything bad for you. But Plenty of studies show it does. The fact is this is not a very well researched topic and for truth to so deliberitly put out commercials like this is wrong. Now I know Im on the smoking section and were supposed to be supporting or not supposrting this specific brand but lies piss me off and this is a lie so it pisses me off.
