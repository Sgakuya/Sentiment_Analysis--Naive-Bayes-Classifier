I remember first noticing Hilary Swank as the star of The Next Karate Kid. That's right, she played a female version of Ralph Macchio, and, although the movie stunk, she was good-looking enough that I watched the whole thing. My impression was that she'd be one of those teen stars that lasted for a year or two. Her appearance a couple of years later on Beverly Hills 90210 only reinforced my opinion of her as a good-looking B-list actress bound for anonymity. Shows you how much I know. Turns out she's talented, and based on last night's Oscar win, she's now one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood. Not bad for someone following in Ralph Macchio's footsteps.
