When I saw the trailer for this film I thought it looked enjoyably over-the-top, but I was so disappointed when I saw it. Yes, it was over-the-top, but for all the wrong reasons. I have never seen such an absurd love scene between Diaz and DiCaprio. Passionate? more like a pair of puppies imitating mating. The narrative was sprawling and haphazard and there were too many things, mainly to do with the charcters, that seemed acronistic. All this for a film about the oldest chestnut ever - revenge. It could at least have had a more compelling drive to it. At one point DiCaprio looks like he's going to substitute Day-Lewis as his daddy-figure. And Day-Lewis's acting performance was pretty hammy. If he gets an award, indeed, if this stupid film gets anything, I'd consider it a traversty of justice.
