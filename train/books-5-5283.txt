This is a touching, heartfelt, amazing piece of literature. I read the short story in the 8th grade and then promptly stole the book from my English teacher. It's about a man named Charlie Gordon with an I.Q. of 68. He's picked for an experient, an operation, that will make him become more intelligent. He meets Algernon, a mouse who had the same operation, going under the same experiment. The book is written in 'progress reports' and through them you can see Charlie's growing capability. Daniel Keyes paints a bittersweet portrait of love, growth, acceptance, and loss. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who dreams of being better than themselves, of having a life they know they could never have.
