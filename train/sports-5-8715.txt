Nash is having another outstanding year, this time in Phoenix. I always loved it when Dallas would play on TNT, and Charles Barkley would rail about how Michael Finley should be Dallas' go-to player, etc. It was a laughable statement backed up by nothing more than Sir Charles' considerable supply of hot air, which he willingly releases during each broadcast. By my estimation, Finley should have been Dallas' fifth or sixth option in 2004... which brings me to Nash, who was second only to Nowitzki in each season he spent in Dallas (even in 2004, his off season). And it continues in 2005. While it would be foolhardy to credit him (in Jason Kidd-fashion, circa-2002) with Phoenix's renaissance (Amare Stoudemire deserves most of the acclaim), Nash has played a large part nonetheless. There is a caveat, though: Nash has a history of breaking down in the second halves of recent seasons; let's hope, for the Suns' sake, that history does not repeat itself.
