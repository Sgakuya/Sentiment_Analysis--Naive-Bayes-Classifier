Oh, Lord, how I hate to enrage all you Bard-huggers out there (see my comments on Shakespeare himself in the Authors section), but God, was this a bore. I admit, I was forced to read it in high school English a few months ago, and I enjoy books more when I can read them at my own pace. And when I sat back and thought about the plot, I realized that it had much insight into human nature, but I still don't much care for it. Fortuneatley, I was sick a couple of the days we were reading it in class, so I missed some of this drivel. On the other hand, I'm only 15. BUT..I'm one of those endangered species, a precocious, therefore intelligent, teenager, if I do say so myself. I READ for pleasure, I don't sit on my butt laughing at Beavis and Butthead. But as I said, I'm only 15. Perhaps I'll appreciate Shakespeare more in 20 or 30 years. But in the meantime, I do indeed LOVE great literature, but this overrated pound o' (excremental) flesh does not qualify as great literature. Sorry, Bard-huggers, but I'm expressing my personal opinion as a free citizen of this country.
