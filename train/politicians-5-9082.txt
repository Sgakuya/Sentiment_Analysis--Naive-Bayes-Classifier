I think that President Clinton did a very good job for all Americans during his time in office. Along with Al Gore they were a fine team. I think that if the Republicans would of laid off him and the Democrats they would have more done for us but it was one constant harrasment after another. It is noticible now that the Republicans can dish it out but they don't want it back. Their thing is lets move on . Months after Bill Clinton has left the White House he is still being picked on, I say GIVE HIM A BREAK..I really think it a crying shame the way everything was out in the public and he and his family had to deal with it. Let me say, the way in which delt with all this BS made me admire him even more. I think that Hillary is one hell of a fine lady and so is Chelsea. I would be proud to have them for friends. I also hope that the American people wake up and clean up the voting mess that was in the last election and lets have AL GORE and TIPPER back at the White House and get rid of that fellow who got appointed.
