I am an employee in Austin, Texas and I was thinking that a grocery store would be a great place to work to get a full time job and recieve benifits. I shopped at Albertsons all the time and thought it would be great to work there. Boy have they let me down! Not only will they not give ANY employee over 29 hours a week, they sent out a news flyer that in order to recieve benifits, you have to work 30 hours or more a week without fail! I'm lucky if they give me 15 hours a week! And also, they won't train me for diddly squat! I work in the service deli and really all I've learned is how to fry chicken and slice up meats. I am clueless about evething else, and I do ask my manager if she will show me things, but she tries to ignore me! And another thing. I've just learned I can't reduce a price of something no way, no how, I don't care if it's not fresh or customer is dissatisfied. -I'll let Albertson do the dirty work of training me, what little they do, then move on somewhere where they treat the employees with respect! I went from liking this store to absolutley hating it! Kiss my butt, Albertsons!
