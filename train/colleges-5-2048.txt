I have visited friends at pretigious universities including Duke and Washington University in St. Louis, and I would never transfer. Not only are most of the major departments ranked in the top 10-20 nationally, there are few easy A's, the town of Chapel Hill provides entertainment year-round, there is an abundance of extracirricular activities, a strong Greek system, and athletic prowless to boot. In the past two years I have been here, the school has made tremendous strides in providing more resources and outlets for the students. The mixture of conservative and liberal students provides for interesting dialogue in both classrooms and common areas. Those who complain about the school's impersonal aspects tend to be those who refuse to do anything umcomfortable or inconvenient to get what they want. A great school, a intimate campus, and great people.
