The Green Bay packers are slowly but surely loosing the spark and look of a superbowl caliber team. The man at the helm taking them down the crapper is Mike Sperman. All the mistakes and penalties and mis cues are signs of bad coaching. The buck stops at your door Sperman, pack your bags and get out of town. Green Bay has a bad habit of keeping bum coaches way to long. Hopefully they will not continue this tradition with Sperman. Mike you don't even have the discipline to keep your own fat ass in shape so how are you going to get this out of your players. You have minimal NFL experience as a coach, and before the Pack none as a head coach in the NFL. Its time to face facts, you can't cut it in the NFL. So waddle your fat ass out of town and go back to coaching high school.
