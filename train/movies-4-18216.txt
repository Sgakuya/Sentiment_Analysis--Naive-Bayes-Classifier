If you truley are a fan of scary movies; The texas chainsaw massacre is a must see film. I have to agree with kamylienne with the disapointing fact, that the movie is not a true story. The movie however, is based on fictional cases in texas (re: Ed Gein.) I have to say Kamylienne's comment about the film being gross is a bit far fetched. If your going to see a movie entitled Texas Chainsaw Massacre, wouldn't you expect it to be a little bit gross. I actually appreciated the way the filmakers didn't use too much graphic details in the murders. Like a great artist once said less is more! Overall the film was scary, well directed, poorly written, and the film tarilers did it no good!
