Barry Bonds is simply the greates player to ever live. Bonds is the greatest hitter of all time, the reason for that is not his strength which people say was given to him by steriods, but because he has the greatest eye in the history of the game and the coordination to match. He only swings at strikes, and he is the only player in all the major leagues that never looks foolish at the plate. His credentials include the single season home run record, the only player in major league history to steal 500 bases and hit 500 homeruns, 8 gold gloves, and he will soon be the all time home run leader. You can't beat those stats, and for those of you who dispute the fact that he is greatest ever because of the steriod issue, why is he dominating everyone else in the majors who are also supposedly on steriods. The only player in history that can compare to his hitting stats is Babe Ruth, and the simple fact of the matter is that Babe Ruth played in a time when the pitching was inferior, half the talent in the world wasn't allowed to play due to segregation, the glove that was used was no more then a padded work glove. Bonds is the greatest hitter of all time, and overall greatest player of all time.
