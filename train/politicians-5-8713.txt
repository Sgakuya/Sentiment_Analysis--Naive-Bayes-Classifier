I'm anxious to read a biography that just came out on Cleveland. I believe its subtitled a study in character or something along those lines. I want to do my own research but the impression I received from some recent discussions about Cleveland is that he was a great defender of limited gov't, sound currency and economic freedom -- and a pricipled man as well. Told by advisors to drop his objections to trade tariffs because it would cost him the 1888 election (it did), he refused by saying: What's the use of getting elected if you don't stand for something? As someone who doesn't consider himself a Republican but appears partisan b/c the 20th century Democratic Party has been full of such despicable characters, I'm happy to have found a Democrat I can look up to! Here's to Grover Cleveland!
