Mr. Spielberg is one of the most talented and influential moviemakers of our times. Film after film, his directing talents have made him the standard by which most of today's directors are judged. He has redefined the entertainment industry, there's no doubt about that. Let's review the masterpieces that he has produced throughout his careers that I have seen: The Indiana Jones Series , ET , Jaws , Schindler's List , Poltergeist , The Color Purple , Jurassic Park , Saving Private Ryan ... the list goes on and on. Each of his movies are different (see Wiggum's comment for a detailed analysis). Horror, drama, science fiction, you name it, and Steven Spielberg has done it. It saddens me, however, that Steven Spielberg seems to be losing his touch. I wasn't too big a fan of AI or Minority Report . He really hasn't produced anything of his normal caliber since Saving Private Ryan . However, even his few recent stinkers cannot ruin his firmly established place in the annals of the entertainment industry.
