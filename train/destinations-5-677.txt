I've been there 7 times, spent alot of time overseas in the Navy, it is one of the safest tourist traps I've ever been to. The main streets are very safe, especially compared to Rio de Janero and the like. If you didn't have a good time, chances are you stayed at the wrong resort. They have resorts that cater to the spring-breakers, adulds only, family, just want to get away from it all, or even the overweight crowd. If you stay in Cancun Zona Holeteria (Hotel Zone), you can experience a great night life, true American chain resturants, and the regular tourist traps. If you seek solilitude, go 30 minutes south, to the Myan Riveria, where it's less crowded, and less commercialized. The fishing and scuba diving are great and much cheaper than in the states. Almost all persons in service positions have a good working knowledge of English, and the dollar spends as easily as the peso. Yes, they all are looking for tips, but service is great no matter what and they aren't pushy. The beaches are beautiful, the Mexicans are generally warm and friendly, the dollar goes far......what's not to like. Yes, you can eat Mcdonals,KFC and Pizza Hut 3 times a day, but you don't have to. The Cogo Bongo is one of the best clubs I've ever experienced in mt life, and for less than $30.00 for all you can drink...... I blow $50.00 at my hometown bar for less that 1/4 the fun, and the same ol' thing. I can spend $200.00 per night in Ocean City MD for a crappy motel room, or $1000.00 for 8 days in Cancun on an all-inclusive resort (only 3 hours air time) ....this is a no brainer!
