McGreevey's recent revelations regarding his affair with another man were certainly shocking. However, it would be unfair to judge his tenure has governor, which began in January of 2002, soley on his personal life. He inherited a large budget deficit, and his instant response was to raise taxes on the wealthy- a huge blow to New Jersey's small business market. He did deliver substantial property tax relief to New Jersey homeowners, but overall, McGreevey really failed to have the political fortitude to reign in on spending. His deficit reduction plan relied heavily on tax increases and not enough on spending cuts. As far as his affair with another man goes- I really don't see the importance of the issue to his governing of New Jersey, except for one thing. McGreevey put his lover in charge of the office responsible for protecting New Jersey from terrorism. New Jersey is a very high-risk state when it comes to terrorism, and McGreevey jeopardized the state's security by placing a Jewish poet in charge of the Office of Homeland Security. The guy is not even a US citizen. Overall, McGreevey's tenure has been an unimpressive one, and the recent revelations only further diminish his standing. New Jersey is losing nothing of particular value on November 15.
