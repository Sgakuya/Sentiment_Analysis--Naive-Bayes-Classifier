Yeah, it was pretty embarassing. I think my beloved Aggies should forget about the missed opportunities of the past, and hope that we can avoid another national TV embarassment against the next also-ran team. The fact is, even in the heyday of the early 90's, we still couldn't win any big games. How many Cotton Bowl trophies came back to College Station? None under Slocum, that I can recall, even though he got close many times. That was his trademark--mediocrity. In fact, the only real success A&M football has had was under Jackie Sherrill in the 1980's. He was a winning coach, and could win the big one. As an Aggie, I see how overrated we were in the 1990's. We never belonged in that top tier, because all we had was defense. Now, I just wish we had a team that could compete with the Utes--pretty sad. But...we did just kick Clemson's ass!
