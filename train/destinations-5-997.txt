First things first: I am English, so I suppose I'm biased. But still, gotta love the place. As someone said, if it didn't rain so much it wouldn't be so green here. The whole country is green. Which is great. Don't complain about the English reserve: we're forced to be polite. We're not unfriendly or cold, just reserved. Don't complain about football hooligans, they're just a small minority who spoil it for us all. And British food might be awful (though I disagree) but the whole country is covered in Indian, greek, French, American (McDonalds anyone?) restaurants so you can't reasonably complain... at least we've recognised our weakspots and adopted the alternatives. People do complain about Britain being pretentious and uppity, trying to be a big player when it's not. Just to put it in focus: our Commonwealth covers more than a third of the people on this planet; we have the 4th largest economy in the world and militarily, while obviously not even on the same scale as the U.S., we are still in the top 5 in the world for spending. We're no superpower but our leaders give us credit for international statesmanship. And we're loyal. Size-wise we don't compare with the U.S. but otherwise there aren't too many nations with more influence internationally. UNique global position - ties with America, Europe and the Commonwealth. Slag it off all you want but inconsiderable it ain't.
