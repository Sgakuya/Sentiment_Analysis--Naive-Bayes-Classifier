this was a funnier movie than I thought it would be. Saw it when it first came out. three office workers, lives are made miserable by a horrible, cad of a boss. In one funny scene they all describe the way they would like to do him in. Lily tomlins version dressed as a Snow white and surrounded by cute cartoon animals was the funniest. One thing leads to another and they think they accidentally poisoned the boss, he of course if fine and finds out what they were afraid they tried to poison him{rat poison, box looked the same as sugar box} he threatens to have them jailed so they kidnap him take him to his house and jails him there. in the end he gets his commupence and they get their just rewards. Dabney Coleman is great as the jerk of boss. Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, and Dolly Parton are all good as the office workers.
