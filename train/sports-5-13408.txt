Hmmmm. Let's see. Two Super Bowls in 3 years. Longest win streak ever, in and out of playoffs. Longest first quarter scoring streak ever. How can you not like this guy. No yelling, no screaming, just solid football. He also knows how to put a coaching staff together, i.e. Romeo and Charlie. Of course, the poor whiners from the New Jersey Jets will complain because he came to New England. And the poor New Yorkers will whine becase, well, they're New Yorkers, and it's just in their nature. Wait! This just in from the news desk. Bob Kraft has just replaced Belichick as coach with bringer of famine because B of F said in this forum, and I quote, I could coach a team better than him. Yeah. Sure.
