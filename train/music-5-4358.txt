A phenomenal, poignant, throwback record by one of the great storytellers of our time. In my opinion, no other musician could have pulled off a 9/11 tribute album without coming off as opportunistic or contrived. Bruce does it with no apologies, no fanfare, and no held punches. When he belts out I want a kiss from your lips, I want an eye for an eye... in Empty Sky, it packs a wallop. Anyone who is from the Northeast knows that Bruce is the folk storyteller of Jersey, Philly, and New York. He is made more credible by the fact that 150 residents of his town, Monmouth, perished on 9/11. A great record, and a powerful one. His best stuff since Born to Run.
