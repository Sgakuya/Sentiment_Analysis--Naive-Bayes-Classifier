The first time I ever saw Billy Gillman was when I was sitting in a restaurant that had CMT on. They were doing a segment on young talent, and I saw the usual young girls on. While it was impressive, it was really nothing new. Suddenly Billy came on with his song One Voice , and I had to stop and listen. I was amazed that this young child could sing like that. It's more of a rarity for a young boy to become a singer these days than it is for a young girl. I was very impressed. For those of you who say that this boy has no talent and sings too high and whiney... shame on you!! For his age, of course his voice isn't fully deveoped yet, however... he shows extreme talent and tenacity being able to do what he does so well. Many others his age can't follow a tune long enough to complete an entire song. As for hoping he improves with age (as others have also said), I sure hope he does... when his voice changes, as inevitably it will do... I hope for his sake, that his voice only gets better and proves to all of you skeptics that talent comes from within.
