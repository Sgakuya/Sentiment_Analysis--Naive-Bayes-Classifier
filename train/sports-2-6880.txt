What a mess Paxson has gotten himself into regarding this whole Carlos Boozer thing. He does Boozer a favor by not holding him to the final year of his $700K a year contract, in exchange for the promise that Boozer would resign with Clevelend for about $40M over 6 years. So what does Boozer do? As soon as the Cavs release him from his contract, he signs with Utah for $68M over 6 years. In other words, Boozer sold his integrity for about $28M. So where does that leave GM Jim Paxson who just squandered one of the Cavs young building blocks? Can you fault him for trusting Boozer - former Dookie and widely considered to be a stand up guy? I don't know. But I guess you have to manage by results. Before this fiasco, the Cavs had one of the best young nuclei in the league in Lebron and Boozer. Now they have Lebron. That makes Paxson a failure GM in my book, and Boozer a liar who is only in it for the money.
