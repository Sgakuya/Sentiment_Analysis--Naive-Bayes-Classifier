Compared to Minnesota and North Dakota, West Virginia is kind of cosmopolitan (which isn't saying much) I enjoy the West Virginia panhandle. For sure, Weirton is a industrial town with very high unemployment. Weirton, however, also has excellent hoagie shops and Italian food. Weirton has very interesting topography and you can get a nice large house for 50,000 dollars. It also is only 15 minutes from the Western Pittsburgh suburbs, so you always get a job in greener pastures. Wheeling, is a cheap city of 100,000 people in the West Virginia panhandle which has a very low crime rate and a decent central business district and is also close to Pittsburgh (45 minutes), Columbus (90 minutes) and Morgantown.
