I really feel sorry for this pathetic creature. First, as governor of Pennsylvania, he left behind a state deficit totaling hundreds of millions of dollars when he bolted to join W's so-called anti-terrorist initiative. Since then, he's been a minister without portfolio, with no real mandate, authority, staff or budget. Here it is, coming up to two years after 9/11 and there's still no cogent, reasoned, working anti-terrorism policy and appartus set up yet: so, Ridge is nothing more than a figurehead, and not a convincing one at that. The color codification of terrorism alerts was one of the most embarassing fiascos in the history of American public policy, and the country, despite all the lipservice the Bush Administration has puked out, is not essentially any more prepared to deal with the threat than it was two years ago. Now that's efficiency!!! Furthermore, New York City, which is still the most likely terrorist target, is now spending hundreds of millions of dollars per year for preventative measures, but was granted only something like $26 million by the Bush Administration in subsidies for this purpose. Ridge apparently did very little lobbying to secure the funds to further protect the city that already took it on the jaw for the rest of the country on 9/11. Thanks alot, Tom, you worthless piece of crap!!!
