I am leaving this comment to all the dumbass people who complain about having to wait 5,6,7 minutes for their food at sonic. It is true that this happens when we (yes i work at sonic) get busy, but what people don't realize is when Mcdonalds or burger king or any other place with a drive-thru is busy you will wait 5 to 10 minutes in line just to place your order then wait another 5 to 10 minutes to get your order so you will wait anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes or longer to get your food everytime they are busy so next time you are sitting in line waiting for your chance to place your order and then waiting in line some more to get your order think about how this compares to sonic!
