The best film I have seen in a long time. While the end of the film is predictable, the world of intrigue which Robert Redford must enter to try and get his agent out of harms way is fascinating. Since the film consists of many flashbacks over a surface story in which Brad Pitt's character has been captured by the Chinese, there is no need for a great deal of continuity testing, although each segment of the film does test well. The climax isn't huge, but it is there, and while the future of the characters remains unknown at the end of the film, I was quite impressed with the realistic qualities of the film, and its not so realistic ones as well.
