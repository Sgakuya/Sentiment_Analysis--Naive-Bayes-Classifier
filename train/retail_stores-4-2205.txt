As a Publix employee and someone who doesn't have the most money to spend, I recognize two important things. One, that Publix tends to add a few cents more to products than warehouses do. Two, that Publix beats out just about every other store in the way of customer service and cleanliness. I've only been to one where the customer service was poor, while the dozens of others I've seen have great customer service. Publix strives for customer service and clean facilities and products. If you find something below average, they include the manager's name on the reciept and encourage customers to contact the division office if the store's manager is uncooperative. So, for great products, cleanliness, and service, if not the best prices, I give Publix a 4 out of 5 stars.
