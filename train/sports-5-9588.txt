This year looks to be one of the best they have had scince 92-93. They will take the Pacific Division, a good battle against Seattle for the Western Conference, and have a good chance for the NBA title. TO DENVER JUUSAN: What season are you watching? UPDATE TO DENVER JUUSAN: First of all, I have been watching the Suns play. Have you even been watching the games? How can you say that the Suns are going to be 8th ranked with only 1/4 of the season, as you put, has been played? Why don't you wait untill the 3/4 mark of the season and get back to me. WAKE-UP DENVER JUUSAN: You are doing what you are claiming numbah and myself are doing, prediciting the outcome of a season. My question in to you, how are you coming up with this picks? Again, do you even watch the games or are you looking on your Playstation at the overall ratings of the players? ON THE PAST?: If you didn't get it the first time, this is about CURRENT, not the past. As far as the Nuggets, Melo-Yellow is not saving them. And if your basing the Suns on the other pro teams in Arizona, you better look back a lot further on the past, scince you seem to like doing that. The Cardinals, they have always sucked, The D-Backs, on bad season so far, and the Rattlers of the AFL, 3 time AFL World Champions, in six apperances. Fact of the matter is, The Suns are on top, and it will take alot for them to drop to 8th. So, again, like you said before, when the season is 3/4 of the way through, then make your play-off claims.
