Nowhere in the world will you have so many gambling options. You can kick it old school downtown, you can hang with some locals at some of the smaller casinos a few blocks from the strip, you can spend time in the midst of incredible opulence, or you can gamble in what feels like an amusement park. And, with sports gambling legal, you can also spend time betting on your favorite team and watching the game. Las Vegas has something for every gambler. Plus, with so many hotel rooms throughout the city, it is generally a piece of cake to get a relatively inexpensive room. I'm not sure if you can spend a week there, but Vegas is the perfect weekend trip.
