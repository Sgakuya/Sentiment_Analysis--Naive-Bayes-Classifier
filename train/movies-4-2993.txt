If you're amused (instead of nauseated) by the acting of Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze, you'll probably find Point Break to be a goofy, fun movie. No aspect of Point Break is in any danger of being called a cinematic achievement, but the surfing and skydiving scenes are great, and the cartoon-ish name of Keanu's character ( Johnny Utah ) by itself is good for a few laughs. If you're a fan of cheesy Swayze-style action movies (think Road House ), you won't want to miss this one. If you consider yourself to be a refined, sophisticated film connoisseur, you don't need me to tell you that this movie should not be at the top of your must-see list.
