Here is another really very good actor that really never had a chance to show his talents. Black listed in the 50s really killed him. So sad to believe in an good ideal of your convictions and suffer for it. I really like him. To bad he could not extend it into old age. I enjoyed most any film he was in. Died at 39. Love him in Gentlemen's Agreement. One of the most thought provoking and important movies of any era. Especially after what happened in Europe in WWII. See it if you can!!! I give him a 4.3!!! More if he was in more films. That's how convince I was that he was developing into one of the best talents in hollywood.
