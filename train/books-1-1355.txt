This is not a top 10 comic by any stretch of the imagination. The jokes in this strip are almost as simplistic as the drawing, which is saying a lot. The strip's entire appeal seems to be to Scottish Terrier owners who think anything with a Scotty in it is wonderful. Apparently the entire online readership of this marginal comic has come to RateItAll in an attempt to boost Raising Duncan's popularity, but that would only work if this comic were funny and/or artful instead of just mildly charming once in a while. When I saw Raising Duncan ranked among Calvin Hobbes, the Far Side, and Peanuts, I hoped to have discovered a previously unknown pleasure; instead, I found a forgettable disappointment whose author probably encouraged his mailing list to inflate his pet project (notice how most of the 5-star ratings were posted in the same 3-day period?). Raising Duncan should be lowered down to Prince Valiant / Mary Worth territory. Boo, I say! Boo!
