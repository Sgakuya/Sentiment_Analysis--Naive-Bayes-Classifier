Oustanding school. Our company's top performers have been hired from here and continuously are impressed with the candidates we receive from Purdue. The campus is always improving itself and it is a wonderful place, although the surrounding town leaves something to be desired. If I went there, I would probably not ever leave campus. But forunately the campus is so great, you would not have too. Strong acedemic reputation for engineering and a very up and coming business school. Purdue has taken a technical strategy to its business school and we have been impressed with the results. Very respectable athletics as well. Above average in the major sports and of course since this is a Big Ten school, the teams are very visible for watching on TV and following if you are an alumni.
