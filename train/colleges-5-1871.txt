Emory's energy, depth of resources, and diversity are nearly unparalleled in American academia. Who needs a football team when you have interesting classmates, a range of extracuricular opportunities, approachable faculty, and broadening experiences? Students at Emory are serious, ambitious, and personable -- but there's hardly a typical Emory student beyond these shared characteristics. For those who are eager to learn, contribute, and excel, look seriously at Emory; those who do not like diversity or competition, look elsewhere. And don't let the cost dissuade you: Emory's financial aid and scholarship programs make possible the Emory experience for deserving students.
