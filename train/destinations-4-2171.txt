China is one of the world's oldest civilization with many accomplishments behind it. It truly has the potential to be an economic powerhouse only if they would finally end this communist regime which only put them down economically. The history of China is interesting, but very complicated and with many different cultures and influences within the country. There is a lot of variety within the country. Beijing has a lot to offer. The standout attraction is visiting the Great Wall of China. It is truly an experience to stand there, it was always one of my dreams to visit this wonder of the world. Xian is also beautiful. Visiting China is strange because there is a bit of a culture shock and the vestiges of communism still abound (posters with Mao's picture etc...), but it is still quite an experience to visit and see this country and it's very nice people.
