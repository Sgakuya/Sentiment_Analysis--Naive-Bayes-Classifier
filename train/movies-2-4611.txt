CAUTION: My review may contain spoilers. I think this movie left out too many important details. If the people seeing it had never read the books, they would probably have a hard time understanding what was going on. I was very disappointed. Nothing was said about Lupin, Pettigrew, Sirius, and James being the Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs that created he Marauder's Map. We didn't see enough of Hogsmeade except for a glimpse of Honeydukes and the Three Broomsticks (and the Shrieking Shack at the end). We never get to see Zonko's or the Magical Menagerie. Lots of little details were completely unmentioned, like the pocket sneakoscope, Harry getting the Firebolt as a gift from his godfather, (he just gets it without explaination at the end of the movie), Crookshanks' ability to enter the whomping willow and why, Draco's fake dementor at the Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw quidditch match and how Harry dealt with it, why Snape held such a grudge against Harry, I could go on and on. The movie just skipped quickly through the story leaving out way too much. I vote not to make anymore Harry Potter books into movies because in order to do it right, Goblet of Fire would have to be at least four hours long with an intermission and perhaps get a PG-13 rating for violence. True fans wouldn't mind, at least I wouldn't. My kids liked H.P. and the Prisoner of Azkaban though and I guess most kids will. The special effects are good. The real story however is still in the pages of the books and in my vivid imagination.
