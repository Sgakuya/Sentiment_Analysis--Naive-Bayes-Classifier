I have been chewing tabacco now for 30 years. I started out with leaf tabacco but when I was about 28 years old I switched over to wintergreen fine cut skoal and remind there for the next several years until they came out with mint skoal. As the price of skoal continued to rise I look for a new brand and finally found red seal mint that actually in my opinion was better then skoal and much less expensive. The only problem is that you need someone with experience to market your product. I have a hard time finding this brand and especially the mint flavored, It's always sold out with dozens of other flavors or brand setting on the shelves collecting dust. my name is Bill Donaldson from Mansfield, Ohio 44906, 419-526-2882 or willfletch99@hotmail.com. I would like to work for you! I have 25 years of management experience and feel I could represent your company much better then what you presently have. Thank You Bill Donaldson
