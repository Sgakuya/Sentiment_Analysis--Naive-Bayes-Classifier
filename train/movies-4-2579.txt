The Negotiator is an above average action/thriller starring Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson's character, Danny Roman, a respected hostage negotiator, is framed for murder, and takes several people hostage as he attempts to uncover the truth. As his colleagues are forced to deal with a man who is an expert at hostage negotiator, Danny insists that he will only talk to savvy negotiator Chris Sabien (Spacey). Top-notch performances by Jackson and Sabien, as well as a solid supporting cast which includes J.T. Walsh, John Spencer and Paul Giamatti (who is quite effective at providing some comic relief) puts this film over the top. Although the film was a bit too long and slow at times, for the most part it was suspenseful and exhilerating with an explosive and somewhat surprising ending.
