It's kind of funny that Marcus chose to address certain parts of Pobody Nerfect's comment, but ignored the final couple of lines: Well, after over 80 years, all other baseball fans can be assured of two things. The Red Sox will find a way to lose and their fans will be jealous of the success of the Yankees. And even the most ardent Sox supporter with even the slightest bit of objectivity would agree that the four games that Manny has played in LF does not provide any reasonable sample size to determine whether he has held his own. Lastly, I, too, remember Duquette doing something to piss off Pedro and Nomar. I don't remember if it was DD's backing of Carl Everett or the way he handled Mike Stanley or the way that everyone around them was getting huge contracts, but it was something (and I certainly don't think that there is any reason to use the kind of language you did. It is inappropriate and disrespectful to the other users of the site). Being a Red Sox fan is truly an exercise in futility.
