WHAT? MY beer is ranked 161st? I read the LONG list of beers ranked ahead of mine, and let me tell 'ya something, MY brew will get you just as tight as those fancy-shmancy lagers and ales, it'll just take MORE of 'em to do the job. Heck, I got time! I'm not going anywhere! I'd like to see one of those Anchor Steam, or Grolsch fans, go to Yankee Stadium and ask the concession man for one of THEIR beers. The Bleacher Creatures would laugh and razz 'em out of the ballpark! Besides, it's unholy to wash down a Yankee Stadium hot dog with a Samuel Adams. That's for f**** Red Sox fans! Anheuser Busch Natural Light, by God, THAT'S for me. For the price of ONE bottle of SNOB beer, I can buy me a 12-pack! Yes I can! Besides you really CAN'T buy beer, anyway; you can ONLY rent it! The remnants of that SNOB beer goes down the toilet the same as MINE!
