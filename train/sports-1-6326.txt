Does anybody else get the vibe that Cameron Crazies never saw or cared to see a basketball game in their lives before moving to North Carolina? And still, it's all about theatrics and being crazy when they are at the games, not basketball. These people don't know basketball - if you watch them close, they always have to wait for the players' reactions to know what the ref called. They always have a confused look on their faces, followed by either a loud cheer or boo. And the Dean Dome isn't as loud for two reasons: 1/ it is twice the size of Cameron, making it more cavernous, and sounding like an NBA game rather than a high school game 2/ we are watching the game closely like people who love the game do, not putting on a goofy little show. You people know as much about basketball as Bush Jr. knows about being a good president. And we don't call you ugly as a comeback or to get under your skin - we honestly believe that Dookies are quite literally unpleasant to look at. Now go make fun of poor people, or play polo or whatever it is that you do.
