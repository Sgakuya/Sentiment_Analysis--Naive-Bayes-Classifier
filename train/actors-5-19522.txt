There was a time that I didn't really care for Eric McCormack as much as I do now. When I first started watching Will & Grace, I found him to be moderately annoying along with Debra Messing. But both of their characters have grown on me and especially Eric McCormack's character as Will. He is just so adorable, and cute. Unfortunately he doesn't ever seem to find a decent boyfriend on the show, and of course the first good one the writer's gave him turned out to be a guy who just came out of the closet. So in tradition, they turned his boyfriend into a guy who wanted to experience other guys before settling down permanently, in other words making him look like a gay whore..very stereotypical ! But anyways...on a last note...Eric McCormack is loaded with talent, and he also seems to be really down to earth. I recommend NBC's Will & Grace very highly to the prime time audience of America. One of the few shows that is actually worth watching anymore...
