Obviously a great player and freak of nature for his time. But the best player ever? If that were true he would have won more titles. He played in an era where the 7 footer was a rarity much less have 2 or 4 of them on the floor at any givien time. He was also a player where other players didn't necessarily become better by playing with him, a la Larry Bird, Jabbar, Jordon, Johnson. Don't get me wrong, I agree he was a phenom, but not the best BASKETBALL player ever. Not even the best center, I take Russel and Jabbar over Chamberlin. Check the head to head match ups, both centers beat Wilt more times than he beat them.
