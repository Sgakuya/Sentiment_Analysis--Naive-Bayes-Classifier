Sure they suck this year and are now 3 and 10. And although Favre fans will not want to hear this, Favre is done and should be sitting the bench, at least give Rodgers some playing time. Despite their record, this young and injure-riddled team has played hard in every game against both good and bad teams. They have not been blown out and the players seem to like Sherm and now Bates. I say they still have a bright future if they can keep players healthy as their offensive line and overall defense keep getting better. Finally, Gado could have a great career at Lambeau. He certainly has helped me on my fantasy team!
