I graduated from SF State with a B.S. in Business Administration in 1998 so I think my opinion has some validity. Their Human Resources program is highly recommended if recruiting, training, and Comp and Benefits is your thing. Dr. Sullivan is the head of the program and he has connections to all the HR Directors of big companies like HP, Intel, Sun Micro, etc. I did have my graduation pushed back at least one semester because one of the classes I needed was cancelled (due to lack of enrollment). My experience with general education classes was good. I thought the teachers did a very good job and their expectations were very fair. Some of them did have accents but nothing that can't be worked around. Being Chinese myself, I have been listening to people with accents all my life so I'm used to it. If you are business major, the vast majority of the students in that program are Chinese so as far as ethnic diversity goes it is diverse. I disagree with Filmgirl's assessment of SFSU being on a beautiful urban campus setting. SFSU is sitting on 19th avenue which is an extremely busy thoroughfare. Lots of people, cars, trains, and buses making their way down that street. SFSU doesn't feel like a student campus, it's more businesslike. The top of the Student Union building offers an oustanding view of the Pacific Ocean and the surrounding Sunset district. When you compare how much you spend at SFSU to what UC charges it is definitely worth the money if you want an education. If you want a job, they do have a career building where they have listings of jobs and help you with resume writing. I didn't found it helpful for myself but it's there.
