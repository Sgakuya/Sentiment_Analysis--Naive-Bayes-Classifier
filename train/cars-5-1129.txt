As a college student who is paying for this car myself with internship money (not one whose daddy bought it for them), I can say that it's really been worth the money. Mine is a 2000 Honda Civic, the value package model. It's got all of the features I wanted (except for cruise control) and so far it couldn't be more reliable. It's also got great gas mileage (about 27 city, 35 highway), so I'm not spending a fortune at the pump each week. The quality to price ratio is very nice, especially for someone who just wants a reliable car that does everything you want it to, and isn't really concerned about going from 0 to 60 in 3 seconds. Plus it's comfortable to ride in, and my 4 door has plenty of room for when I'm hauling friends around, or moving from city to city between semesters.
