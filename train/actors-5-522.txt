He wasn't the original method actor, but he popularized the Actors Studio method. I have to admit he is one of the greatest actors, ever! He made me cringe, sometimes. He had that effect on his supporters, where they could have pulled out their hair, after hearing about his latest outrageous behavior. Such a time was when he sent a Filipina/German actress named Maria Cruz, (using the name, Sacheen Littlefeather, and dressed in Native American costume), to refuse his oscar. Many felt he was cowardly to not have done so himself. It was a huge controversy at the time! "The Men" is one of my favorites of his appearances. His personal life was a mess from the start of his film career. It was a long journey to his sad appearance as a bloated person who looked so very lonely. But these images will fade away, while his brilliant performances will always be remembered.
