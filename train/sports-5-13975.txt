The reason I started watching football in the 1st place. In my eyes, the greatest player to have played the game. Made the most with which he had. Sad to see other ungrateful people take him for granted to provide greatness year after year with virtually no help what-so-ever, and he does this for 10 years. To be able to do what he did, for so long should grant ANYONE the right to quit on his own terms. The so called Lions fans that talk about Barry in a negative light should be ashamed of themselves. At least have a backbone and back up your guy that shredded the crap out of any defense that tried to stand in your rb's way(especially my Bucs). I know your guy was the greatest, and you know it too. The difference is, you guys are still too pissed off(for no legit reason) to admit it.
