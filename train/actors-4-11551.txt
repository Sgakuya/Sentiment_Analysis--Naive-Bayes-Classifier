Meg has a unique style that makes me just want to root for her in every movie that she is in. She's a really likable person, at least on screen. I thought that Meg gave wonderful performances in both Sleepless in Seattle and When a Man Loves a Woman . Her forte' does indeed seem to be romantic comedies ( You've Got Mail and Addicted To Love ). She gave great performances in both of those films. Also great performances in Top Gun , City of Angels and City of Angels . The only negative thing about Meg Ryan is that a large portion of her own personality remains with her when she's acting on screen- that likable, good girl type attitude. I'd like to see if she could undertake a role which requires her to play the bad girl .
