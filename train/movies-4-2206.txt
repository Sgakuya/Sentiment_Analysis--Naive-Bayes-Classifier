I really enjoyed this movie, and I can't believe it's not doing better than it is in the box office. The story, based on the Alexander Dumas novel of the same name, had everything you could want in a movie: an exciting plot, love, action, betrayal, revenge...I don't think I was bored at all while watching it. The actors were cast brilliantly, especially Guy Pearce as the main antogonist, Fernand. James Caviezel was great at being sort of a foolish character at first, and then becoming a smart, decent man in the end. I would rate the movie 4.5 stars overall, with the -.5 due to the fact that the ending was quite predictable (although I'm told it's different from the ending in the book).
