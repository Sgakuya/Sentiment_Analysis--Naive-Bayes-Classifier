The reason why I'm not giving this game a five is because I have to leave room for development especially with NHL 2003 just around the corner. However this game is very good, Perfect for your typical hockey game fan. This game is very close to the real game and is extremly addictive. Why is it so addictive? Its so addictive because you can create your player and develop your player over the course of 10 years! Once one season is finished the game takes you to the next season and so on. So you can see how many points you can accumulate in your career. Another great feature is you get to draft players at the end of each year and the older players retire!! The graphics are super and the game rocks!! I wonder what new features will be added to 2003. You can bet that when it comes out I'll be here to review it!
