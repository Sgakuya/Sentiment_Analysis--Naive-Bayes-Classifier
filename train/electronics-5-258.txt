A note to vfernandez: Aiwa is the best in sound quality. Sony sucks. All you hear is high frequency bass and entirely too much treble. Kenwood does sound good, in speakers! Kenwood doesn't make much portable equipment, that why their stuff is priceD so high. For those of you that know sound quality, you would recognize that Aiwa is hard to top. Most people just buy Sony because it's a popular name. Sony is overpriced and cheaply made. I once got a sony cd player for christmas, and I dropped it on the CARPET and it broke. My Aiwa cd player has been dropped too many times to count and it still works perfectly; and i have hardwood floors in my house. Sony adds a lot of useless crap to their equipment just so they can convince you to pay their outrageous prices. Aiwa gives you exactly what you need at the price you will be willing to pay. AIWA IS THE BEST!
