Wake Up all you envious wannabe football programs (not to mention the police blotter for Oklahoma, Miami, Ohio State et al.) The University of Southern California is the current National Champion, they are currently undefeated and ranked Number One. Although they may not have the strength at receiver this year in comparison to last year, it will be enough to make it back to back Championships. The only good thing that can be said about the University of Miami Hurricanes is, that when they play a home game the crime rate in Miami drops by about 50%. Since the majority of the criminals are in the stadium and on the field. GO TROJANS!!
