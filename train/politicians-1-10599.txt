Jackass. Loser. Idiot. Monster. All these words were created with one person in mind; George W. Bush. The man is a danger to society, he should be locked away in a dark basement with no food or water. I mean what is this guy thinking? Oh no that's right.. he isn't! He practically forbids fundings to abortion clinics, under all his time as a guvenor he has never pardoned any of the prisoners in death row (and looking at the USA legal system I'd say that many that have been killed were innocent) and he refused to sign the Kyoto (not sure about spelling) program designed to lessen the outlet of nitrogen. The reason? The american economy wouldn't profit. Stupid git! So let's see... against abortion, for deathpenalty and against slowing down global warming. Oh yeah I really like this guy!
