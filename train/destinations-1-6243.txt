Is there a reason that everyon in Georgia wieghs 500lbs? (for those of you who have a Georgia education, lbs is an abreviation for pounds) Not to mention the people are very mean, and it is very very hot. Ugh, is spent the worst 5 hours of my life held up at Hartsfield Atlanta arpt. some idiot person made us go all the way accross the terminal to ask the people at the counter a question about our boarding passes, then when we got back to the gate, the dumbass said the flight was oversold and wouldnt let us on. Georgia sucks. People need to realize how much it sucks and stop moving there. Of course, give it a few years, and it along with many other of the southern states will try to secede from the union again lol! and this time, i say we let them!
