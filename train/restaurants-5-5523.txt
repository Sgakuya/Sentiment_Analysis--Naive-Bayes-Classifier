I was really surprised by the low rating this establishment has earned. I read all the negative comments and cannot disagree more. #1. The food is not overpriced. Half a buck per wing is pretty much the going rate these days. Compare a Hooters wing to a Domino's wing or a Pizza Hut wing, and then tell me who is overpriced. Hooters wings have double the meat than the pizza-joint wings. Hooter's wing dressing is several cuts above the competition, as well. #2 I can't help but concluding some of the negative comments are due to waitresses not falling head-over-heels at the sight of a pathetic, Camry-driving, yuppie putz who was raised in a school system where self-esteem was over-emphasized. These young ladies had a life long before you darkened their doorstep.
