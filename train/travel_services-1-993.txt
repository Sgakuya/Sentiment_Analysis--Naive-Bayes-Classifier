Stay away from these criminals. I was warned by several people, but thought I really need to save some money. I dealt with both the Winnipeg and Vancouver franchises. When Vancouver delivered our stuff a bunch of things were missing. They said they'd look into it. No phone call. We called them at least eight times if not more. And each of those eight times they acted like they had never heard of our complaint. Got the run around. Always had someone say that they were looking into it. They never looked into anything. At one point, the mover (who had provided his cellular number to us) accused us of just wanting to get a free TV out his company! Mailed a Claim to them, but to no avail. Now we are in the process of suing both companies for negligence. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. SAVE THE EXTRA MONEY AND GO WITH ANYONE ELSE. ANYONE. I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH. THIS COMPANY IS CRIMINAL AND SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN.
