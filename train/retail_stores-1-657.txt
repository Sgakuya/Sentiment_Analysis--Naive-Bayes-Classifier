You are the LOWEST. Because of your shoddy merchandise, I have just lost a pair of eyeglasses and a bunch of notes on various aspects of a new job. This is because your SIDE POCKETS of a particular backpack also have the possibility of someone putting items in an area which is OPEN (i.e., NOT a pocket for items). This is easy to miss if one is in a hurry or distracted. Items put in what someone thinks are backpack pocket can be easily missed and are in reality holes for items to fall out onto sidewalks and therefore lost. When I arrived home today I discovered all my notes are missing plus my very expensive computer glasses -- because LL Bean's backpack side pockets also have open areas for items to fall through, a simple miscalculation can result in valuable items being lost.
