This is the worst!!! I used this thing last year and I had trouble with the updates. Tech support is terrible and takes forever. This year I got the federal for 9.95 and the state for free. CHEAPER IS NOT BETTER. Problems every step of the way. Just got off the phone after an hour with tech support. My problem was I could not download the South Carolina state update. Turns out the update was not even there even though the website said it would be there 1/30/01. I used dialpad to call so I had no long distance call. Funny enough, I downloaded the free turbotax just to see what the numbers came to. I owed money with Turbotax, I got a refund with Taxcut. All in all this thing stinks!!!
