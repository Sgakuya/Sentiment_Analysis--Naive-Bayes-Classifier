An interesting museum, but not quite as intriguing as the Field. Still, if you're in Chicago a few days this is worth seeking out - some of the exhibits are amazing, such as a full 727 plane, a gigantic train set, and a complete U-2 submarine. The best way to get here is via the Metra train from the Loop or simply drive down Lake Shore Drive. One of the difficulties with this museum is it's a bit off the beaten track in a south side neighborhood called Hyde Park. Hyde Park itself is quite nice, but is surrounded by some iffy (if gentrifying) neighborhoods. One could argue, though, that this area is more genuine Chicago than, say, Lincoln Park.
