I've never really thought much of the Hyundai brand. They, along with Kia, continue to have a poor-quality stigma with me (and, judging by the ratings here, I'm guessing many others). However, I've had a change of mind during the last several weeks. A friend of mine recently bought a new '04 Sonata, and soon thereafter, I had the pleasure of driving it for a short distance. Though it was only a short (15-minute) drive, I must say I was thoroughly impressed with this vehicle. The exterior styling is sharp, a good combination of Mercedes and Jaguar overtones. The interior is every bit as plush and comfortable as a Camry. Fit and finish appear superb throughout, even under the hood. Though the acceleration (even for a V-6) is a little sluggish, the ride is smooth and quiet. Steering responsiveness does leave a little to be desired. Michelin tires come standard, and a 10-year, 100K warranty is available. All in all, the Sonata strikes me as a more than competent alternative to the Accord (which I've owned for 9 years), Camry, and Altima, and every bit as good as, if not better than, the Chevy Malibu. Next time I'm in the market for a midsize sedan, I will definitely give the Sonata a serious look.
