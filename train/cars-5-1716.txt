I have a 2000 ZX3. When I bought this car I was not in the market for a car, but this one was very impressive. It has lots of room for passengers and also for me (I'm 6'6 ). The hatch was a big selling point for me. With the seats down, it has tremendous hauling capacity. Performance wise, it has a nice engine in the Zetec but it's real forte is ride and handling. It just soaks up the bumps and seldom loses it's composure in any curve. Also, it is an easy car to modify with a significant aftermarket in existance. Appearance is quirky. I can't say it is good looking but it is very cool looking. I highly recommend it.
