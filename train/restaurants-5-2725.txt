 Fat Don's as a friend of mine used to call McDonald's is both wonderful and abhorrent. It's a rare occasion that I eat at McDonald's save for road trips and even then the likelihood decreases if there's a Wendy's nearby (mmmhh Wendy's). There are times though when Mcdonald's just hits the spot, and then of course it stays there and refuses to move out of your belly, but going down it just seems so right. Best McDonald's experience?...everytime I've finished off a meal and discover that there are still a handful of long, crispy, still warm fries hiding out in the bottom of the bag. Worst McDonald's experience?... The time I had missed dinner and at about 10:30 at night figured I'll just rush to McDonald's before they close and pick up something to fill me up. I was starving and got to the drive through minutes before they closed, then back home, up the stairs to my apartment, in the door, opened the bag and discovered that there was NO MEAT on either of my cheeseburgers!! The horror! I could see all those pimple faced kids yacking it up as they locked up for the night thinking about me with my meatless burgers. That was a McDonald's low moment for me. Still though you gotta love Mickey D's..
