Cute and amusing are the words I'd use to decribe Miss Congeniality. While this movie certainly won't win any academy awards, it has an old-fashioned charm that's absent in many of today's comedy movies. Sandra Bullock's brand of slapstick humour never gets tiresome here. As a bumbling FBI agent who goes undercover as a contesant in a beauty pageant, she must've tripped at least a dozen times while wearing high heels yet it was funny every time! Though the plotline is simple, Miss Congeniality shows viewers that beauty is more than skin deep. I enjoyed Miss Congeniality very much! It was much better than I expected.
