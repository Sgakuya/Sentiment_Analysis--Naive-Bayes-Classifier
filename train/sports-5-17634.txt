ORIGINAL: Question, is this a list of NFL organizations or a list of current teams (ie the 2003/4 season as of this comment)? Assuming the latter, with a 5-0 start and currently 8-2 midway through the season, the 2003 team certainly deserves four stars at this point as it remains too early in the season for five. The Carolina Panthers have obviously created a winner thus far around defense, special teams, and the ground game, overcoming a substantial weakness at the quarterback position. If the list is for organizations, then I would say three stars as the franchise is too young to say above or below average. Note also that as of the date of this comment the description provided by RateItAll still says that the Panthers are in the NFC West. I'm sure everyone knows that the NFL has been restructured and that the team is now in the new NFC South; however, I wanted to mention this fact for clarity. UPDATE: With a three game run in the NFC Playoffs (two wins on the road) and now playing in the Super Bowl, the Carolina Panthers easily deserve 5 stars (and the other reviewers and raters need to re-evaluate the team given their current rank on this list of current teams).
