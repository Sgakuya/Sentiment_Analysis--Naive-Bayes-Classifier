Tasty food, low prices, and even some semi-healthy options. My opinion of Taco Bell was vastly raised by the wonderful chalupa. Here's one complaint though: the first time I ordered a chalupa, I got two of them -- one Baja and another one Santa Fe . I remember not knowing which was which when I wolfed them down, but boy was one of them especially great. When I returned two weeks ago, I placed the same order, since I didn't want to pick the wrong one. I vowed that this time, I'd remember which one was which -- but then it arrives, and both of them are in a wrapper that has the names of all four flavors on it. So I still don't know which chalupa is my favorite. GRRRRR...
