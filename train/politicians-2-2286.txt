Just another buckpassing empty suit who tries to pass himself off as a leader. According to his autobiography, Powell rose through the ranks of that dubious institution of the U.S. military by never taking an unpopular, controversial stand that countered the conventional wisdom of the Masters of War: for the sake of furthering his career, he never spoke his conscience. He just rubber stamped and lockstepped with the rest of the Pentagon drones. As the ultimate Yesman and Bagboy of the Bush Administration, he was a prime player in selling the U.S. public a bill of goods concerning those weapons of mass destruction Iraq supposedly had that were such a threat to us. Turns out those WMD probably never existed, or certainly what the kazoonies had was no threat to us at all. So, a totally unnecessary, immoral and illegal war was waged on false pretenses, and Powell was the lying point man at the U.N. in this charade. In this, Powell can either be seen as a well-meaning naif whose credibility has been gravely compromised by a very questionable Bush Administration foreign policy, or a war criminal who is not much better than the rest of the reckless sabre rattlers calling the shots these days in Washington. The scary thing, however, is this twerp is one of the more capable members of W's brain-dead brain trust.
