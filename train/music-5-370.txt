As with all Radiohead recordings each is a stepping stone in a new dirrection to which we will someday find out the final transformation of this band. OK Computer is but a step toward KID A and that a step toward greatness. I cannot for the life of me put this recording down as it reminds me of the sweetness of the Beatles at their finest moments and others such as Todd Rundgren and even the 80,s band Jellyfish. Clearly Thom Yorke took a vacation on this album to rest up for what was really troubling him that which would become KID A. OK Computer deserved a high rating but there should be one more star available for KID A to push the envelope a little higher.
