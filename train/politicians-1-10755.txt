this is my government project on james buchanan and i want to know if u guy/girls think it is "A" quality Less than average president ( James Buchanan ) The only president who never married, Buchanan was almost 66 years old when he succeeded his presidency. He was president when the fight over slavery began. President Buchanan was a prominent figure in American political life for nearly half a century, holding some of the nation's highest offices. With his diplomatic experience, Buchanan also became involved with foreign policy in the Senate, eventually chairing the Foreign Relations Committee. By the end of his ten terms in the senate, he was one of the most powerful senators in Congress. At the Democratic convention in 1856, Buchanan won the presidential nomination on the 17th ballot. In the fall he won an electoral victory, although he failed to get a popular majority over John C. Fremont, the Republican, and Millard Fillmore. Millard Fillmore was known as the know nothing candidate. Two days after Buchanan's inauguration, the Supreme Court declared in the Dred Scott case that Congress had no power over slavery in the territories. With his long experience in diplomacy, Buchanan expected his administration to conduct a vigorous foreign policy. He fought to extend American influence in the Caribbean, but congressional opposition forced him to give up efforts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Never the less, domestic matters intruded upon his attention. The panic of 1857 added to the unpopularity of his administration and contributed to heavy Democratic losses in the congressional elections of 1858.Buchanan's reputation is judged mainly by his conduct during the last months of his presidency, and he is therefore generally regarded as an ineffective executive. In his defense it can be said that he was a lame-duck president caught in a vicious crossfire between secessionists and Republicans. But at the same time his devotion to a conservative legislator led him to narrow his powers with an original constitutional crisis. Many issues divided the nation, but slavery was the main cause of argument. Buchanan personally was against slavery. But as President he quoted that the Constitution protected slavery and that the laws must be obeyed. When 7 of the 15 slave states left the nation in 1860, Buchanan refused to use force to hold them in the Union. He hoped they would grow discouraged and return to the Union. I think Buchanan wasn’t much for aggression mainly because he wouldn’t use force to keep the South in the Union. That started the Civil War and that’s how Abraham Lincoln got elected. A lot of people blame him for the Civil War and I would have to agree. He was the one to have them depart from the Union. Plus The Civil War was the most destructive in U.S. history and that’s probably why most historians look down on him.
