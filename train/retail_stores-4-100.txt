Borders and B N are probably very close to each other in terms of quality of service and ambiance. They have a very well designed interior, evoking a feeling of scholarly learning as is common in old libraries. On the other hand, the coffee shop evokes something more modern (not all B N's have the coffee shop). Surprisingly, it is also a good place to meet people. The upsides to the stores? Selection is very good (for both), although of course this depends upon the size of the store. Customer service tends to be OK, not great. Borders seems to offer somewhat better customer service, if only minimally so. Customer reps are usually very busy either taking calls or devoting time to store related functions (like re-arranging books). Both Borders and B N offer discounted books, which tend to be placed at the front of the store and near the checkout counters. This is in fact one of the places I most often find myself, and many a time the cheap prices make a difference in my buying habit (well, that's just me). Most Borders also offer a wide selection of music and videos, which only the larger B N's offer. (But watch out for those CD prices. Almost $20 a CD.) The drawback? The bookstores are not a 'campus store'. What I mean by that is if you are looking for some obscure manual on differential equations or advanced multiple regression techinques published by your college professor, chances are you are out of luck. This is not necessarily a fault of the store, since the supply of obscure manuals is always low and almost never national in scale. But I have found sometimes that even pretty well known scholarly works are not to be found in either Borders or B N, and you often have to resort to going online, where overall prices are higher (because of shipping) and discount cards give you fewer savings.
