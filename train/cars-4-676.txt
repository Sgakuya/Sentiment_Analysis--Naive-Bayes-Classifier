I have a 2000 Univega Alpina 500. This is an excellent starter bike with a 7005 series aluminum frame. The frame has a replaceable rear deraillure mount and a rear disc brake mount making it upgradeable. However the Rock Shox Jett front fork is not suitable for off road use and I replaced it immediately with a 98 Rock Shox Judy DH ($200) which greatly improved the handleing characteristics. Likewise the components are cheap and it did not have clipless pedals, I upgraded the pedals to Shimano 646. The wheelsets (Zac 19) are junk and break easily. I have replaced the Shimano Alivio rear deraillure with an XT and the front with an XTR Shimano which has noticably improved shifting, next I will replace the brakes with Avid and the brake levers and shifter pods with XTR components. The crankset and bottom bracket will also be replaces with a stiffer set (Race Face or XTR). I have replaced the seat with a Terry Liberator and the handlebars with Sun Ringle Uncle Jesse. All nin all this bike is a frame that can be ridden until it is rebuilt but it is an excellent value since a similar frameset would cost as much as I paid for the bike. I have raced it as it is now and it will make a fine racer once completed but the cheap components keeps it from being raceable as it is stock.
