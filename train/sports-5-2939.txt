HERE'S a challenge... Give me fact, not opinions, not judgements on weight or character, facts or stats that explain how Babe Ruth sucked. GIVE ME ANY STATS THAT SAID GEORGE HERMAN BABE RUTH SUCKED... COME ON... YOU CAN'T!!! Ruth was the most dominat player EVER. EVER!!! Rating Ruth any less than a 5 star player is like saying the Yankees suck. It's merely an opinion or emotion unsubstantiated by mere fact. It's like saying Bill Gates is a horrible business man because he's a scrawny, four-eyed geek. It's an idea that can not be credibly backed up. Ruth was the most dominat sports figure of all time, in any sport! Period! No one revolutionized a sport, or dominated both ends of it the way this man did. To simply say he was a homer or an out is simply proving your own lack of knowledge about Ruth. The man was a power hitting machine, sure, but one with a .325 lifetime average. If you took his 1927 season (where he batted a paltry .356) and took away all of his hits except his homers, his homer avg. would be .111. This suggests he JUST MIGHT have done more than hit homers. Oh, and his OBP that year was .476. Take his homer out of that and it would be .365, which oddly enough, most players these days would kill for. So any of you giving Ruth his deserved 5 stars, right on. Anyone giving him anything less than 5 stars has their heads firmly up their keisters.
