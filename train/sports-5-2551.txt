I hate to see all of this Theo bashing going on. Obviously in his few years of being the GM of the Red Sox he has done a great job. We have seen the Red Sox make it to the world series in both 2003 and 2004. This could be the year that we see our team win, all with Epsteins leadership. Theo has shown dedication to the Red Sox his whole life, i am glad to see someone with so much passion for our team. He spends his time in Florida with the team for spring training and is doing everything possible to keep the players happy while also making the Red Sox an even better team! I am so jealous that num1n personally knows Theo- because he is the type of guy that i would love to marry. Long live Theo! and his career with the Boston Red Sox!
