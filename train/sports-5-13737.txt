Despite some crazy things that have happened to the Niners this year - an untimely death in training camp, a season-ending injury to TE Eric Johnson and the quarterback situation, Coach Nolan has done a nice job overall. Give him a chance. The 49ers are the worst team in the NFL right now (which will mean getting running back Reggie Bush in the draft, GOOD), but, be patient Niner fans, a good success story has to start somewhere, as it always seems to start near or at the bottom. I have a feeling Alex Smith may not work out and it wouldn't be the first time something like that happened. Coach Mike actually has plenty of talent on his team and his immediate need is at the quarterback position.....oh we long for the days of Joe Montana, Steve Young and Jeff Garcia! Give Mike Nolan a chance to get a good team together and be successful just like his predessors Bill Walsh, George Seifert and Steve Mariucci. Remember.....BE PATIENT. GO NINERS!
