Anchorage is a very functional city that was established during the turn of the century and rebuilt in the 1960's after a large earthquake ripped through the area. Alaska is an extremely scenic place, but there's nothing in Anchorage to write home about. Lots of major oil companies have their region al offices in town. It's a fairly compact city that you can see in no time flat. Basically its just a stopover point. As for living up there, it seems to me that most of the people I talked while I was up there seemed to want to get out. Common complaints included long winters, unfriendly locals, and lack of career opportunities. Overall, I would say that Alaska is a nice state to visit but not so great to live in.
