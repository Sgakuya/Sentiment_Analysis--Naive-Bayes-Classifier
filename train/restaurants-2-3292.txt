Papa John's pizza is a taste hit in our household. Unfortuneately they have a ordering limitation that is ridiculous (at least our branch claims that is a chain restriction) You can not order a pizza with 3/4 of a topping. Our family needs only 1/4 plain cheese on a pizza. to order a pizz half and half leaves wasted cheese and hungry pepperoni eaters and order a separate small pizza of cheese nearly doubles the cost and leaves even more wasted pizza. I have never heard of a pizzaria that couldn't handle such a simple customization. Since this makes ordering Papa John's a non-option unless we happen to have a guest who is also an only cheese eater, I give Papa John's a bad rating!
