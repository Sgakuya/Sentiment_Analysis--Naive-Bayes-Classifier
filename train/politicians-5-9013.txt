Rating Clinton as President, you must look at his record in that office. Yes, the economy was on the mend when he came into office, but HE and HIS TEAM insured it stayed that way for almost the full the eight years of his two terms, THEY balanced the budget and began to pay off our huge debt, and by HIS policies, in the face of an increasingly hostile congress, HE set the stage for, and nurtured the greatest, most enduring boom in our nations history. Yes, at the end of his second term, the US economy was slowing, but it was his successor who talked it into the long, deep pullback we have experienced these past years, in his effort to insure a tax cut which mostly benefits the wealthy. If the rating allowed, I would give Clinton 4 instead of 5 stars, because of his moral failings, but that is not the full or even a leading measure of a president's success. Keeping the peace and insuring national prosperity are the measures by which presidents are judged.
