I agree with many of the points brought up by previous reviewers regarding the subject matter of the book, and the ending, but I believe that this book succeeds marvelously at what it intends to do, which is frighten the hell out of you. Imagine what it would be like to go to someone for help, only to have the messing up your mind? Imagine not knowing what you might do because someone planted suggestions in your mind that you didn't know about? This book is about the ultimate loss of control, control of one's body, one's mind, even one's actions. How horrible would that be? Extremely scary, and a great read.
