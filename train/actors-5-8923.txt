Sandra Bullock is a wonderful actress- she's definately one of my favorites. She's done a couple of clunker films (i.e. Speed 2 ), but other than that, she seems to choose her roles carefully and become her characters. I never feel bad about buying or renting one of her movies because they are just so good. I thought that she was good in Speed , which probably was her breakthrough role. I liked her chemistry with Keanu Reeves. I thought that she gave a wonderful performance in In Art and War , which was one of her only real dramas. But, boy did she deliver in that film! Miss Congenialty was hilarious- she was so good in that film! I enjoyed her performance in Murder by Numbers . She definately became her role in that film. I could feel the intensity in that film communicated through her acting. She did a wonderful job of communicating the darkness of her character to the audience. I thought that she was funny in Two Weeks Notice - what wonderful chemistry she had with Hugh Grant. Other great performances she has given include Forces of Nature , Hope Floats and The Net . I really think that Sandra Bullock is a wonderful actress, not to mention extremely beautiful. I love her range as an actress: she can play in romances, comedies, action films and suspense dramas. Her career will only continue to go up.
