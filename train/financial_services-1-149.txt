I have never had so much trouble with a bank. I had an account in Washington DC for three months before closing it. When I tried to withdraw my money and close the account, Citibank put a hold on my savings account because there had been no activity within the last month. It's a *savings* account -- it's for storing money, not for frequent deposits and withdrawals! It took about 2 months to get my money out, and they sent me statements (showing zero balance) for another 5 months after the account was closed. In addition, the Washington DC staff was surly and unhelpful, and the branch office refused to open until there was a line outside the doors, even if that meant waiting until 9:30 AM. Worst, there is no customer service number listed on any statement or business document -- and it's carefully hidden deep within the website -- so you can't do anything over the phone without your secret telephone banking code, which you can only get at the branch office, which is closed ... Citibank is waaay more trouble than it's worth. Try anywhere else, but especially local credit unions -- they're inexpensive and friendly!
