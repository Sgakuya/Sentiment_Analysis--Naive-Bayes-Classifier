Richard Gere is a part of the I-hate-America club. This loser said that his fellow citizens should identify with everyone who's suffering The poor terrorists are hurting because of the negativity of the karma and should be treated with love and compassion Blah Blah.....This so-called Buddhist should go down to Ground Zero and see what the compassionate terrorists did to their victims. These terrorist are not suffering at all. These rats are bragging about their crimes on ARAB TV. As a fan, I am very disapointed in him. Richard has more compassion for the terrorists instead of the victims. His movies suck too!
