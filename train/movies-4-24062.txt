This review applies to the DVD director's cut. When this movie was originally released in 1979 it was rushed from production to theater and there was no time for director Robert Wise to fine tune this movie. Now with the DVD we can appreciate his vision. The movie has been significantly tightened and flows at a much better pace than it had originally. Special effects that were missing or poorly done have been recreated for this version; however they strived to keep the effect appearing as they would have when the movie was first made. There's no Star Wars prequel eye candy overkill. The movie opens with a 4 minute overture with a starfield and Jerry Goldsmith's music. I'm tempted to compare this movie to 2001:A Space Odyssey because of the time director Wise takes with his some scenes that feature no dialog, strictly the beautiful music of Goldsmith (the Kirk approaching Enterprise scene is probably the best scored music of the entire series). There has been dialog added and removed, and the overall effect gives the movie more direction and sense. Give this movie another chance as I have, and you'll appreciate it for what it should have been!
