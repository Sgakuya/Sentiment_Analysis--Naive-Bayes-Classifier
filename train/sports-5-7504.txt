I've never seen him play, and there are very few film clips of him from the years he dominated and defined the level of play in the NBA. He was the cause of several NBA rule changes during his years with the Minneapolis Lakers (one day to move to LA) including the goaltending rule, it had never been an issue before. But, at 6' 10 his defense included a bit of cherry-picking (off the rim) so a new rule had to be instituted, to keep the game competitive. Danny Biasone pushed for a 24 second shot clock after Mikan's team lost a game 19-18 in front of an almost empty gym. Many credit Danny with saving the NBA with his innovation, but it was Mikan's dominance that necessitated the rule. In his own way, he was the Babe Ruth of basketball, and people flocked to see this huge man play this boy's game. The game evolved, as all games do, and his physical characteristics would not dominate the game today. But in the 1940's and 1950's , when the game needed a hero to worship (and a villain to hate) Mikan wore both hats with dignity and professionalism. May this giant of the game rest in peace and may all the spoiled millionaires who benefit today from his accomplishments, appreciate him for the courageous trailblazer he was.
