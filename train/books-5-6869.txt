For the past eight years I have been a dedicated reader of Sci-Fi, before this I had a very short concentration span and very rarely got into a good book. The Red Dwarf series taught me that not all books are hard to follow and that even I couldn't put a good book down once in a while. I was a big fan of the TV series so the books were a natural progression and I wasn't dissapointed, the two authors (Rob Grant and Doug Naylor) quite obviously work exceptionally well together and have produced the funniest series of sci-fi books since Douglas Adams Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy. In fact I could safely say that together they continue the genius that was Douglas Adams. The concepts and characters that make up Red Dwarf are fantastic, perfectly thought out and expertly developped. Things like Better Than Life, Cat, Polymorph - in fact I am going to stop there because I could go on and name everything but it is all brilliant stuff which immerses your inquisitive minds into a world of comedy, claustrophobia, space and smeg!
