Deltha O'Neal is a fantastic corner for the Bengals. Currently leading the league with 9 INTs, he's had 28 career picks in just 6 years. He has finally broke out as an elite corner that no one can ignore. His ball hawking skills have helped his team to get an outstanding +24 turnover ratio. Granted, it hasn't hurt that his team has been playing ahead and forcing opponents to throw the ball, but he's still done a fantastic job at covering. He's also been rock solid in run support, racking up 51 tackles. He's been somewhat inconsistent year-to-year and takes too many unnecessary risks, but all around he's one of the best in the NFL. If he gets to 10 INTs at the end of the season, I'll rate him a 5. Update: Dpostoskie, you're comparing apples and oranges here. Roy Williams is a safety, meaning that he's expected to both hit harder and more often than a Corner. Alot of safeties hit like Linebackers, it's nothing that special. Plus, safeties are sent in on blitzes alot more often than corners because a blitzing corner is more likely to be read by the quarterback and more likely to leave a gap in coverage. To put it simply, if Roy Williams didn't have more tackles and sacks than Deltha O'Neal, something would have to be wrong with him.
