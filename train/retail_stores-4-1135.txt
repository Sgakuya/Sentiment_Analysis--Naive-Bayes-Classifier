I don't usually shop at Casual Corner, but I stopped by last week and had a very positive experience. Surprisingly enough, the salesclerks were really pleasant and helpful. (In the past, I've had experiences similar to SamIAm's with snooty, difficult-to-find clerks.) It must have been my lucky day, because they had exactly what I was looking for, in my size, and I was able to check out immediately. I usually shop at their sister store for shorter people, Petite Sophisticate, and I always have a great experience there. The clerks are really helpful, and the selection is fantastic. If you're 5'4 or under and you like the styles at Casual Corner, you might try Petite Sophisticate.
