Miami is a beautiful city, the nightlife is excellent, and there are plenty of things to do every day. Furthermore, there are tons of wonderful restaurants, most notably those on South Beach and in Coral Gables. Miami is great for people who want the benefits of a big city, but would like to escape to the suburbs, and have the beach within 15 minutes of wherever they are. I've lived here for 22 years -- my entire life -- and have never had any kind of crime committed toward me, my family, or anyone else that I've known. As for people's comments that there are snobby people here, I would say that you will find people like that everywhere, but there are also many nice people here who are committed to improving the city for all who would like to enjoy it. You will also tend to find that people here are more cultured than people from most places because there are so many opportunities to experience the arts, meet people from other places, and earn an advanced education. I've travelled to many places in America and Europe -- from big cities to small towns -- and still have not found anywhere that I'd rather live.
