I will always believe that this witch gained popularity and subsequently her power just because she remaind calm while her dumbass husband couldnt keep his dinky to himself. To alot of Americans and surely most women will think that means something. I just think it means she saw an opportunity to gain popularity for her own agenda and did it. That doesn't make her a leader, Just a sly opportunist. But soon enough, her excessive need for power attention or both will lead her to failure just like all the others. There are already too many signs that she will do just about anything to gain power. Thats always an achilles heel. And when she falls, I will party!
