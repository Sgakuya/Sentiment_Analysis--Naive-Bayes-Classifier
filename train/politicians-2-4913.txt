Bland, colorless political hangeroner whose entire career has been an exercise in patience while he kept his eye on the prize, namely, the Presidential nomination. Totally unrealistic enterprise in that this guy doesn't appeal to anyone, really. It's hysterical how these guys who rise to their level of incompetance in the Congress feel they have the Right Stuff to go even higher. Self-delusional is the word for it. Furthermore, this guy is too old to consider seriously for the Top Spot. The days of nominating seasoned bureaucrats and political hacks are over in that Americans became hip to the pitfalls of having over-60 types, like geriatric Bush I and that totally awful old fossil Ronnie Rectum, in the Oval Office. The Democratic Party is in serious need of new leadership, and has been for about 20 years, when you consider how high up in the party this birdbath rose.
