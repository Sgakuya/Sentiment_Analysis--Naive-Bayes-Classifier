Overall, I think that BSU is a good school. It has some strong programs with excellent faculties, such as English and theatre. The administration isn t very student-friendly, but I ve heard accounts of universities which are much worse in this regard. There is a good selection of classes to choose (including options to fulfill core curriculum requirements.) Class sizes within majors tend to be relatively small, while the campus, itself, is relatively large. Drop/add periods and repeat-a-class options are fair and forgiving. The biggest drawback to BSU is the location (Muncie, Indiana). Muncie is extremely segregated, in the sense that the university exists separately from the town and thus, nonacademic activities are rather limited (i.e., the presence of decent cafes, restaurants, music stores, etc.). This is probably due to a lack of financial support because there is not enough variety of clientele. Unfortunately, this also makes for a very dull living atmosphere. Curiously, BSU seems to have a better academic reputation outside of Indiana than it does within the state.
