Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful food and always a great waiter or waitress. One of our favorite places to go. We are lucky enough to have two of the restaurants within 45 minutes and go to both. They also have great take home tins to warm up the leftovers. The garlic cheesebread is to die for as is the caesar salad. Two of us go everytime and there is plenty of food for dinner the next night, I love taking home the leftovers . The prices are very reasonable, so dont worry if the portions are too big, you will leave full and happy with a little food left over. I am not all the familiar with the true Italian dining experience, but this is a place that you never see everything on the walls, the pictures and posters are what helps make the atmosphere so awesome. The music is great. Great for a unique dining experience.
