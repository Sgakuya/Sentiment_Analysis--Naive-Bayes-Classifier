Oh MY GOD!!!! What can I say!! Well, If you read this, obviously I can say alot! Johnny depp is the greatest actor Ive ever seen. He is soo hot and gorgeous every time I see him I think I'll just die. Ive read every little thing about him and I think he is the greatest actor in the whole world. He takes on new challenges and everything. I think he is sooooo great!!! I'm totally obsessed with him! Ive written him over 150 fan letters and even talked to the cousin of the owner of the viper room, as all you JD fans know that he co-owns. I've tried everything in my power to try to get in contact with him. I have seen all of his movies at least twice, and some over 35 times. But I still have time, I'm only 14. He is the greatest person I have ever seen and I think that any one who says hes a bad actor is a toal moron! Its one thing to glorify and obsess over someone you dont know. But is totally another to insult them. So u all suck!! Everyone else (JD fans) You guys rock!! send me an e-mail if ya want at peachy_keen_616@yahoo.com, and IF YOU HAVE ANY INFO ABOUT JOHNNY DEPP (you know, the top secret kind) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE E-MAIL IT TO ME!!!!! I luv you! I also love ryan phillippe, heath ledger, paul walker and a bunch of others hotties soooooo keep in touch!!
