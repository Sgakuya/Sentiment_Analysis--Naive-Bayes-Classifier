This guy should be fired. Not because they lost the series to the Heat, but because HE NEVER BENCHED HUGHES! This kid did 8,000 things in the span of 4 games that Roy Williams would've CUT him over!- forget benching. And about Eddie Jordan: He had 2 guys from Maryland, and 2 guys from Carolina on the floor at the same time, and the play he called that could've prevented a sweep, WENT TO LARRY HUGHES! Again, LARRY HUGHES! Jamison, Dixon, Haywood, and Blake TOTALLY/COMPLETELY/ON THEIR OWN lead the comeback, and Mr. Selfish, Mr. Wants to be the hero, gets the call with 15 seconds left! Fire this asshole. Take it from a Carolina boy. Any coach who lets St. Louis, take the game winning shot over MD and NC NEEDS TO GET FIRED! On another note, I am also EXTREMELY PISSED at Jamison for not taking it upon himself to put this kid in his place. A Carolina guy should know better. He should've chewed Hughes' ass out weeks ago! And I guarantee you Washington would at least make the Finals if Roy or Gary Williams had been the coach. They have way too much talent to suck so bad. And anybody that knows 'Tawn, KNOWS he should at least be the second option if not the first. Nothing is as infuriating as watching Hughes take dumb shot after dumb shot, while one of the most pure scorers (JAmison) in ACC history stands on the wing wide open, clapping his hands for the ball. FIRE EDDIE JORDAN! St. Louis, selfish prick. PLEEEEASE, give 'at ball to Jamison............or at least Dixon! All I know is, ANY ACC guy you have should be taking clutch shots! Not Larry (wants to be a star) HUGHES! The fault has to go with the coach! Anybody thats knows basketball, well, these things should be obvious to him. I just don't understand it. Fire him. The very fact that Hughes doesn't know by now to NOT take those shots, means the coach should be fired in my humble opinion.
