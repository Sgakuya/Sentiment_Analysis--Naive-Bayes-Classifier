This is a really fun game! It's visually stunning, both during gameplay and in the sequences. You may want to make sure your computer is updated, though--so far, I haven't had a problem with lagging or anything. I think the addition of the naval attack force would have been graet, but they took that out for this game. The game is pretty challenging, and might take a few tries for a moderate player to pass the levels. The big downfall for me is the Night Elf race--I was really excited about this new type of character, but it just wasn't as effective as I thought it would be. The Undead race has many advantages, and is pretty fun to play. Orcs and Humans are still pretty fun to play, too. For anyone who enjoys PC war strategy games, this is a good choice!
