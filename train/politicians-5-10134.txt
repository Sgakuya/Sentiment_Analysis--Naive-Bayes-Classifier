Luvya Dubya! yes thats right! he's was my man in the running for prez the first time. He most definately got my vote the 2nd round. Theres no one more qualified for presidency than Bush. He carried himself honorably throughout the campaign, *unlike his rival* and he has an excellent ambition about the war on terror. I trust him. Unlike those non U.S citizens out there like FRANCE and ENGLAND. Lord only knows what they're searching for at the present moment in time. I suppose Chirac will continually do them justice. *if thats what you want to call it*... America is a wonderful place to live, and the pride that it carries is no match for the confused degregated foreign liberal followers. GO BUSH! 4 MORE YEARS!!
