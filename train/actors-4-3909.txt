hmm. this is a hard one for me. when I first saw Damon in Good Will Hunting I was... well amazed and excited to see a young actor who seemed so dedicated to his craft. It seemed that he was much more interested in being an actor than a star. However, lately I have been a little disapointed in what I have been seeing. I can not deney that he is a fine actor, his work speaks for itself, but his recent selection in movies has got me a little worried. O.K. staring with Edward Norton in Rounders scores some points with me (Edward Norton = acting great), but he seems to be getting a little too mainstream, and pulling out that smile a little to much for my taste. He takes on some guttsy roles, but his theatrical edge is not as strong as it was in his earlier work. I respect his work, but am worried that he may be turning himself into a product and less of an actor
