Rating this country that I am a citizen of a four or five seems like being a NAZI sprouting on about all the great virtues of the fatherland. The USA has practically become a fascist state under the absolute one party rule of the GOP. I hear freedom of speech and the right of dissent- Then I can see bullying and indimidation of the press and media by the Bush regime. I see a two tiered society of the haves and have nots, high healh care costs that nearly 50 million americans cannot afford. Take a look at what happened at New Orleans. I could have easily given my country 1 star- however I still respect the generosity and kindess of most of the American people- I find it harder however to forgive them for their sheer stupidity to elect the vermin and Hitlerites now in power.
