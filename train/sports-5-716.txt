Ken Griffey Jr. was the best player of the 90's and it's a shame that injuries have dampened his play in this decade. 10 Gold Gloves, 12 All-Star games, 500+ HR, 1400 RBI, 1997 AL MVP, 3-time AL HR Leader, 1 All-Star game MVP, 3-time HR Derby winner. He's the #1 HR hitter of active players who don't use steroids. Bonds and Sosa are soooo juiced. Griffey is only 35 years old. He's five years younger than Bonds. That means that despite the injuries, Griffey can still be where Bonds is at and well beyond Sosa...without steroids. All of his injuries have been out there on the field in full view of the fans. There's no back spasms from sneezing like Steroid Sosa's syringe after-effects or Bonds' knee operation to let the roid controversy cool down. If Griffey were to retire tomorrow, I would rank him as one of the best players to ever step onto a ball diamond. The Kid could do it all and he's played the game the way it's supposed to be played: doing whatever it takes to win. Smoothest swing ever.
