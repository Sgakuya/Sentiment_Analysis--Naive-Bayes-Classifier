I've never lived anywhere near Philadelphia, but I became a Phillies fan when I was a young child, and never switched to anyone else, though there are other teams I like (the Tigers in particular). I always liked their name, the uniform with the stars over the letter i, their history, even the decal I got in my bubble gum cards when I was a child in the late 1950s early 60s. It had a picture of a baseball cap with a ball orbiting around it. For no reason I can identify, I think the Phils will always be my favorites. They won the Series just one time, the same year Reagan was elected. I wish they could win it again SOMETIME.
