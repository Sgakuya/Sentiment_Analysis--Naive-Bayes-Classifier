I have been a Microsoft OS user since the 'bad old days' of MS-DOS (sorry, command line purists), and I would say that as the years goes by, Microsoft gets it better and better. Granted that you have to really have a fast computer to run XP (yea, like try running XP on anything less than a 1 GHZ maching), so that you can hide the OS 'bloatware'. But most of the user community could care less about that - they just want a OS that simply 'works'. XP does that. It simply 'works'. You can tailor it and 'tweek it' to your hearts content. Or you can do 'nothing at all'. On both ends of the spectrum, the XP operating system offers rock-solid support, while providing seamless interfaces with so many devices it is almost too numerous to count. I would like to see UNIX, or LINUX make that claim (I know this is a 'stick in the eye' to the Unix and Linux purists - but 'so what'). Again, bottom line, XP simply works. I plug in my new hard drive - It recognizes it. I plug in my Digital Camera - I'm downloading files. I put in a CD-R, I'm burning a CD. I stick in my memory stick - I'm uploading and downloading as I need. I go out to the Internet - it provided pretty solid protection (unless I want to turn off the security). This is everything that you would expect in a Operating System. Allthough it is about time, I think Microsoft finally got it right with XP (and especially with XP Service Pack 2)
