BOY, CHECK OUT THIS PIECE OF SCRAP. IT'S ABOUT AN ENGINEERING MARVEL, KINDA LIKE THE FORD TEMPO. YEAH, THEY STOPPED MAKING THAT FOR A REASON. 8 RECALLS ON MY WIFES CAR.(RIGHT WHEEL BEARING RECALLED ONCE AND RECALLED A YEAR LATER AGAIN) INCLUDING, NEW COMPUTER AT 20,000 MILES. IT HAD 3 GAS CAPS FOR NOT HOLDING ENOUGH PRESSURE. TOOK A STARTER AND BATTERY CABLES,( FORD CONSIDERS THE CABLE A WEAR ITEM, IMAGINE THAT) PLUS 3 OTHER ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTIONS. FORD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE COMES IN QUITE HANDY FOR THE FIFTH TIME. AND THE CAR IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD, 50,000 MILES. AND THE BEST PART IS, THE BATTERY CABLE SHORTING OUT IS A RECALL ON THE Z TEC MOTORS, BUT NOT THE REGULAR SPLIT PORTS. OUR BELOVED SPLIT PORT FOCUS COST US 370.00 TO HAVE THE CABLES REPLACED. AND THE TECHNICIAN AT THE DEALER SAID THE CABLE PROBLEM OUR CAR HAD IS THE SAME AS THE Z TEC CARS. BUT FORD SAYS NO.AND THE CAR LOSES RESALE VALUE JUST LOOKING AT IT.AND IF I COULD HAVE RATED THIS PIECE O CRAP WITH NO STARS I WOULD HAVE.SO TO ALL FOCUS OWNERS, HAPPY MOTORING, SITTING IN THE FRONT OF THE TOW TRUCK WITH YOUR CAR ON THE BACK..... AIN'T THE VIEW GREAT?
