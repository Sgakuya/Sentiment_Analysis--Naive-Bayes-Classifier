Man on Fire is an extremely violent, and surprisingly good movie about kidnapping and corruption in Mexico City. I thought the cinematography was extraordinary - they did a great job of capturing the beauty and madness of el D.F. The grainy footage is similar to that used in Traffic or Amores Perros. The story hit really close to home for me - literally. The kidnapping scene was filmed right in front of a place I used to live in the Condesa district of Mexico City. While there were plenty of exaggerations in this movie, the portrayal of the business of kidnapping was not one of them. I have friends in DF that went through a frighteningly similar situation - sadly, there was no bad ass Denzell character to make everything right. Anyway, I'm starting to ramble - to wrap it up, this is a very good, very violent flick - those that have spent time in Mexico City will appreciate it more than those that haven't.
