I'm not sure why Wendy's decided to team up with Tim Hortons, it seems like a step in the wrong direction to me. I don't know maybe Hortons said they'd pay for all new construction, or advertising or something because otherwise I don't see the draw. The food is by no means exceptional (not as good as Wendy's), the coffee is okay , to be polite, and as far as I can tell there is no real character to the place. At least with Wendy's you have Dave Thomas the affable chubby old guy who just wants to make a good tasting sandwich that the average Joe can enjoy. Hooray for Dave!! BTW who is Tim Horton? What is he too good for the average man?? Maybe it's the whole mall mentality, the more shops, restaurants, there are the more foot traffic for everyone. I guess I'll just have to avert my eyes from one half of the restaurant from now on when I enter a Wendy's.
