I was born in 1965, and Pres. Reagan is both the greatest president and world leader of my lifetime so far. One of those rare presidents that had both a huge domestic and foreign impact. He was a genuine person and citizens, whether they agreed or not, knew where he stood on issues. He wasn't a fence sitter or poll watcher like some presidents we have had in the past. Reagan was proactive rather than reactive; a rare trait among most presidents. The assertion was made that he was the most racist president in the history of our country. Prove that with some documentation or explanation rather than just making the claim. My ears and eyes are wide open. You made a difference Pres. Reagan, and this country is a better place for it. May you rest in peace.
