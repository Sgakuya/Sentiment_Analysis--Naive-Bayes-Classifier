Talented. Not enough good rolls for her to be in. She will need to create her own future, but being careful to not be taken advantage of. Because she is beautiful, she will need to be careful of movie rolls that want her to become nude. Julia R does not have to show a thing (any more), is less talented and gets $20mil a picture. Go figure. She will need to be more demanding and move visual to the public. Do more television interviews so people can get to know her. Oprah keeps her busy with some movies, but if Halle can not find the movie she wants to do ... she should make her own movies or start directing and producing good works. If I had her money and advantages, I would work doing more foreign films, like Johnnie Deep did. Get out of the states and recreate who she is. It seems like she is fading fast here in the states.
