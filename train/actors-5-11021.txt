Whoopi Goldberg deserves to be so much higher up on this list than she is. She is a big-hearted person who cares about people, and is an inspiration to many. I'm not to sure about her comedic talents, but she definately is a wonderful actress. Pluses (+): Her performance in Ghost was both comedic and dynamic. The Color Purple was definately her best role which won her an Oscar. Her work in Ghosts of Mississippi really, really impressed me when she played the widow of slain Civil Rights leader Medgar Evars. She truly has a lot of range- she can do dramas like the ones I listed, and she can do comedies such as Made in America opposite Ted Danson. Minuses (-): Cannot really think of anything bad to say about good ol' Whoopi, but I'm not a big fan of Hollywood Squares .
