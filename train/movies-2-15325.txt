 Finding Forrester was a huge disappointment. After reading several positive reviews, I had high hopes for the movie. Unfortunately, it fell flat across the board. The biggest flaw was the predictable, cheesy plot. I'm not above going along for the ride in a movie, but this pushed me over the edge. There was too much of an effort to be politically correct, and I could predict everything that happened, with the exception of the ending (which was beyond trite and could have been topped with whipped cream and a cherry). Then there was the problem of character development, which was almost non-existent. There was no real effort to explain the motivations of the characters, and I found myself constantly questioning what was happening. Plus, the movie is a long one. I kept hoping it would end soon. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1 is because I'm a huge fan of Sean Connery. (Even he couldn't salvage this one, though.) Seeing Finding Forrester on the big screen is a waste of time and money, and it would be an even worse rental. Don't bother!
