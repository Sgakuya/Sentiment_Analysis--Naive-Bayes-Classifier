Just 3 days ago I purchased an '05 Wolverine and so far I love it! So far it is stock except for the Warn 424 Select that I installed. The ablility to turn off 4x4 is priceless. (Or about $250 if you wanna be technical) It rides like a sport quad but if you need the extra traction that I utility provides you just flip a switch. Fenders do like to bathe you in mud and water, but hey, its just dirt. As far as performance goes, it flies for only having a 350cc engine. It will beat a 500 Rubicon off the start and hang in very well top-end. Traction is very good, even in 2 wheel drive. Bottom line: The Wolverine is a great quad for someone who is looking to have fun in the woods and not have to worry about trying to lift a 600lb quad out of a mud hole when you get it stuck. Im sure it's just fine stock, but the addition of the 424 Select makes a HUGE difference.
