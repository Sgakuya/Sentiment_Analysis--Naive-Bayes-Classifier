I have always preferred WordPerfect over Word mainly because I have had less trouble getting the former to do the things I want than the latter. WordPerfect has all the bells and whistles that one would expect and need from a modern word processing program, and it is intuitive to the regular computer user. Moreover, since my first modern word processing program was WordPerfect, the program remains the standard for the legal profession in North Carolina, and I like the feel of it better, WordPerfect gets five stars to Word's four. Finally, I have the added satisfaction of not sending all of my software dollar to Microsoft. On the downside, employers, other businesses, etc almost invariably ask for resumes and other documents in Word format, so you will have to find a friend with Word on those occasions.
