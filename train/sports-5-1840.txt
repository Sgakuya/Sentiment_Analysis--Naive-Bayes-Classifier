Even though this team lost three quality starters since last season (Glavine, Millwood, Moss) and a valuable set-up man (Remlinger), and have had attrition in the field in the past two seasons as well, this franchise wants to win and knows how to win. Maybe because Manager Bobby Cox is a baseball genius and his players respect the hell out of him, refusing to let the old guy down. This franchise has choked in the playoffs in the past, but during the regular 162 there isn't a outfit that has done as well during the past decade. This team isn't as intimidating as it was in past years, but it still has enough talent to be in the running at the end of the 2003 season.
