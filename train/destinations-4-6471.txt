The people here are very friendly, and their cooking is terrific. On the negative side, it is incredibly hot and humid most of the year. There are some good places to visit if you know where to go. The historic town of Natchitoches (pronounced NACK-uh-dish, for some reason), is where they filmed the movie Steel Magnolias, and it has a lot of cultural interest, good shops and very old homes used for bed & breakfast inns. Not too far from there is the Melrose Plantation, where you can take a guided tour of a place that still looks just like it did during the Civil War. Cajun food can be real good too. As one friend of mine said, a Cajun cook can make a sponge taste good. I live in the far northern part of the state, and it's a whole different world from New Orleans. Don't judge the whole state by that city.
