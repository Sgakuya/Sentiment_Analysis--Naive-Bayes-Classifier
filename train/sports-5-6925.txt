Wilt Chamberlain = BEST 'AND' MOST DOMINANT BASKETBALL PLAYER EVER!!!!!! CAREER AVERAGES: 30POINTS PER GAME, 23REBOUNDS PER GAME, ABOUT 5ASSISTS PER GAME, AND ABOUT 6BLOCKS PER GAME(they didn't keep that stat back then!), ALL OF THIS IN ABOUT 43(or so)MINUTES PER GAME!!!!! Wilt COULD DO ANYTHING HE WANTED!!!!! EXAMPLES: HE SCORED 100(100!!!!!) POINTS IN 1(Check that - ONE!!!) GAME(ABOUT THE ONLY NBA players to do that in the past 5 or more years are Antwaan Jamison, Kobe(I think), and Allen Iverson(maybe)!!!)! He LED THE LEAGUE in ASSISTS one year(ONLY CENTER EVER TO DO THAT!!!)!!!!! ONLY PLAYER EVER TO HAVE A 20-20-20 GAME(20 Points, Rebounds, and Assists!!!)!!!! AND THAT IS JUST THE STATS!!!!!!
