One of the prettiest, most diverse states to visit. It's got a little bit of everything. One of the nicest trips to take is to follow Route 62 through Allegany State Forest. It hugs the verdant shores of the Allegany River and it takes you through small burgs such as Tidioute and Tionesta. My wife and I traveled this way from New York and we enjoyed it immensely. Ultimately, we'd like to follow the entire Route 62 to the end (El Paso, Texas). I am proud to have the Keystone State as my southern neighbor. Governor Ridge exhorts visitors to make a Pennsylvania adventure. It's certainly worth it. It's not quite up there with New York, but it sure comes close.
