I bought this CD for a couple of reasons: I like the Fugees, and I read all kinds of great reviews of Wyclef's solo work, especially this CD. So I decided to give it a try, even though I'm not generally a big rap/hip-hop fan. Turns out I really like 2 Sides II a Book. While it's definitely hip-hop, it's not hard-core - it's more a blend of diverse musical styles. On the first song, Where Fugees At?, Wyclef makes it clear that he's his own man by taking shots at all the people who are harassing him for another Fugees CD. The lyrics and the intro are actually pretty amusing. At this point my favorite song is probably Perfect Gentleman, a track that's so catchy I'll probably be tired of it in a week. Overall, Wyclef has filled this CD with some solid music, interesting guests (Kenny Rogers, Mary J. Blige, Youssou N'Dour, etc.), and enough originality to keep me listening for a long time.
