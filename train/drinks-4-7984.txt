G' Dickel, (thats what I like to call him) a hero among men. His whiskey is very solid for the money - the quality (taste, flavor, lack of hang over producing sickness) is right up there with some of the more expensive brands, and yet it is mid-to-low in price. The #12 is certainly superior in many ways to the harsher #8 variety. Dick's #12 is good on the rocks or cut, as I like to in my old age, with a little water, and soda, and ice, and coke. And if you are going to be a-mixing the whiskey however, all in all, for the money, old Jimmy Old Crow is a better value, as it has better flavor for the a-mixing. An old friend of the Confedr'cy, Dickle knows his whiskey...
