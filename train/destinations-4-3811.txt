I like to call Rochester my adopted home town I was born in Phoenix (nuff said) and moved to Rochester to go to The University of Rochester when i was 18. This place is the complete opposite of Phoenix, and in many ways that is a very good thing. People in this area know eachother, there is a comminity feel there unlike any other city its size or larger. Some people will faint when they read this, but i actually liked Rochester's weather as well. I especaily loved the fall and the absolutely perfect upstate ny summers. People tend to harp on rochester's snowy winters. Yes, from late november, to early march, rochester gets a lot of snow. But they also usually have at least a couple of indian summers (days in the middle of winter when the tempurature gets above 60 degrees) and the summers last just as long as the winters, and are as i said, beautiful. I also like how national chains haven't consumed this place like so many other cities. there are countless local franchisements, from fast food joints like Schallers and Bill Grays, to frozen desert places like Abbots and Luigis (they give you a pint of icecream on top of a cone there) to the hardware store of Chase-Pitkin, to the northeasts beloved Wegmans groceries, whcih is headquartered and has most of the stores in the Rochester area. It has always been my dream to live in NYC so 3 years ago, after 6 in Rochester (i stayed 2 years after college because i fell in love with the place) i moved here. I love NYC and so does my fiance, a Rochester native. But i told her that we could move home anytime she wanted (i like to call rochester home now too). We are very happy in NYC now, but i am pretty sure when we decide to have a family, we will be moving back to Rochester. And i have no problem with that at all. We would probably move to Brighton.
