First of all, I find most of the critics giving Dick one stars to have trailer park knowledge on politics. Religion and politics are seperate, or else we will be become just like the enemy that we are now fighting. Secondly, The Republicans have had domination for the last 2 years and I see the country sinking slowly back to the catastophy that Bush Sr left us. I think Dick Gephardt would bring back the American people their government if he was to be elected president. Bill Clinton was for the people, and not for big corporations to run the country; if Dick Gephardt could follow the ideals of Bill Clinton, but keep his pen in his pocket, he would be the best president ever.
