Since my mother's side of the family consisted of homesteaders who lived in Apgar Village before the area was declared a National Park - I had to visit to clearly see all the stories my grandmother told me over the years come to life! It was fantastic! I was spellbound by Glacier National Park. As I gazed across Lake McDonald I could picture it the way it used to be without the tourists. My grandmother told stories of how she swam across the glacial water. She was a brave girl. She attended Apgar School and her father was a stone mason who built the birch furniture and stone fireplace up at the ranger station at Bowman Lake. Glacier Park is definitely a special place with beauty that's unmatched.
