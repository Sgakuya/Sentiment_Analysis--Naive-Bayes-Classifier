First off,he comes across very dignified,soft spoken,precise and all of the attributes you would want in a statesman or politician.That was the good points.The bad points are is that he is very left of center,a dove,and gets away with pulling alot of crap behind the scenes because he's black and untouchable because his rating are high.His staunch support of affirmative action is socialistic.Ya,we have racism in this country when he who got to where he did as being unqualified only to be propped up by quotas could be voted in as president tomorrow if he so wish.Then he puts his kid in as head of the F.C.C and he got there through a set aside job placement.
