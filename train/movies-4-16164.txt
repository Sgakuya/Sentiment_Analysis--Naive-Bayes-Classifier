I'm torn on rating this film because there is so much to take into consideration. There are equal parts that I loved and equal parts that I hated. Since I'm not knowledgeable about the history this movie deals with, I can't judge it on that-I only know that it painted a dark, depressing time very realistically. The violence, as with most Scorsese films, is extreme but not gratuitous. It did disturb me though as even some war movies do not. It approached it in a whirlwind way-talented camera angles and harsh images. As for the actors, Daniel Day-Lewis was outstanding and Leonardo DiCaprio was moderately talented. I felt Cameron Diaz was miscast in her role as an Irish prostitute; she really wasn't convincing and couldn't stand up against her acting peers. The story is moving and pulls you in yet maybe it pulls you in too much. It seemed very long and by the time it was done, I was thoroughly exhausted. Not a film for everyone but a triumph nonetheless.
