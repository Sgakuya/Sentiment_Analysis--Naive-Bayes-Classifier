The addition of Phil Jackson pushed this team over the top. He transformed them from a supremely talented, hopelessly fragmented team that regularly got swept from the playoffs into a supremely talented, cohesive team that won the NBA championship. And he did it in one year, which is pretty impressive. Now all the talk turns to the Lakers' ability to repeat as champions and turn themselves into a dynasty. All signs seem to indicate that they have a great chance. Jackson is a master coach. Shaq, at 28 years old, is the most dominant force in the NBA. And Kobe, only 21 years old, is a better player at that age than Jordan was. Continue to surround the three of them with smart, veteran role players like Ron Harper, throw in a good outside shooter, and there's no reason the Lakers of the 00s can't win as many championships as the Bulls of the 90s.
