UPDATE: I noticed that the disrespectful comments here are mostly from the welfare worshipping, too sorry to get a job bunch. The ones that suppose that the hardworking folks in this country are here to pay taxes to support their lazy backsides. And we all know who I am talking about! As for aids, who do we have to blame for that? Live like decent humans instead of animals and the disease can be wiped out. ? O.C.Solenoid, that was wonderful. I couldn't add one thing more to your comments. His having the respect for the office of Presidency showed that he had respect for the people it represented. What an honorable man he was.
