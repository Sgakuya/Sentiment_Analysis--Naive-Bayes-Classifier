Poor services & customer service . Recently I came thur the local resturant an was using some gift certificates I had purchased from my duaghters school in order to help . My total was $3.15 an gave the cashier 2 _ $2.00 gift certifiate to pay my bill . I was told they con't no longer give ack any change from gift certificates . The cashier was plesant but, explained it was a corporate decition. I don't understand this policy at all. Many of the local stores are very slow in thier serve times an the quity of the food has not been very good. I have decided to not come back . The reason was made do to you gift certifice problem just the last straw . This comment is not a bitter commit it is just to let you know of the problems you need to work on . Thank You for this opportunity to express my opiuon on your store.
