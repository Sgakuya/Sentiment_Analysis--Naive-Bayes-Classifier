My home state. First glances are not enough to understand necessarily the moniker of Land of Enchantment. If you come to NM looking for it to be something it's not, you'll be disappointed. It's not cosmopolitan, super-high-speed-exciting, cutting-edge-cultural-chic whatever. It is what it is and it takes hold on you slowly and steadily. It grows on you; it's a heart thing, a more spiritual thing if you would. The people, native New Mexicans in particular, do not pretend to be anything but who they are--very friendly, laid back, generous, and good-natured, and my experience is that they almost could care less if that makes everyone else out there look upon them almost as museum pieces. Of course, therein is the basic problem with opinions and opinionated people in general--the tendency is to approach something different with one's own biased perspective. If so, you may not likely appreciate New Mexico. You can stop at the Caverns, or Santa Fe(admittedly overrated), or wherever, get the Token T-shirt, and move on. We all know you're really headed for the Grand Canyon anyway. But don't judge NM until you get to know it.
