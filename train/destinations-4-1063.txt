I would like to Congratulate Australia on 100 years of Federation.I have lived here for only 37 of those 100 years, I am interested in the past and admire how far this Nation has come,however the treatment of the Aborigines is something that has bothered me and still does today as i know little about why they have been singled out as a race.We can learn so much from their past and yet when i went to school i can't remember learning much if anything about them.There are so many people in this country that want to see this past treatment put to rest so would i.However upon watching the celebrations yesterday on the TV the Prime Minister of Australia John Howard did not mention the rightful owners of this land which came as no surprise to me as he doesn't believe this to be an issue.I can only hope he doesen't get re-elected.Good luck Australia on the next 100 years.
