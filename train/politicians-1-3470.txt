People are finally waking up smelling his BS. How this man is regarded as a great moral man is a mystery to me. Put down your crackpipe, forget all the crap that your parents have brainwashed you with and just look at the facts. If America does this there is no way in hell that Bush wins the election. One final point. Explain this to me republicans. Many many republicans say that if Kerry were in charge of America during the 9-11 tragedy; he would have put his tail between his legs and hidden in a corner. How do you figure? Kerry fought for his country during Vietnam and he knows what truly goes on during a war. Bush is the one that ran out on the National Guard and got high and drunk. How does this make him qualified to be a leader during a time of war.
