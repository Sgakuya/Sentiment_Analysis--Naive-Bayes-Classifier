This ranks right up there with the best of the Beatle albums and is in the top 10 of all-time. Released in 1968 at the height of the Beatles' spiritual journey into eastern mysticism with Mahereshi in India, this is a wonderful collection of the most atypical Beatle-esque collection. Happiness is a Warm Gun is one of my favorite Beatles' songs ever. After hearing the hard rocking of Helter Skelter, the eeriness of Revolution #9, or the political satire of Piggies, you just sit there in awe, considering the magnitude of greatness you just heard. A song I have yet to decipher, but a great one nonetheless, is Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey. Several good songs on the first disc include The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill, the tale of an elephant hunter and the Golden Slumbers -like medley of I'm So Tired, Blackbird, and Piggies (all beautiful songs). A favorite of many comes next with Rocky Raccoon. Also mixed in this brilliant opus are Back in the U.S.S.R., Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and Birthday. This is the ultimate album if you are on a trip or just sit down and are determined to listen to the entire thing all the way through. Its uniqueness is its main asset, which means you are bound to find something to your liking.
