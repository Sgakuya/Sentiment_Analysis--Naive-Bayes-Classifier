Once you go through a single iteration of someone being John Malkovich, the whole concept gets tiresome rather quick. I generally don't like John Cusack movies and this one did nothing to change my assessment [As a side note, I know a person whose daughter deals with VIPs at a ***** hotel. According to her, far and away the most difficult VIP she dealt with was John Cusack]. I slept through major chunks of this boring movie. I found the scene where a frumpy looking Cameron Diaz is tied up and locked in a dog cage somewhat unsettling. As for Malkovich, I don't want to see John Malkovich [as in any of his smarmy pseudo-intellectual flicks], let alone be John Malkovich. As time is money, sitting through it is not worth it, even on Free TV.
