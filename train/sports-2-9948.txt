Ah, the poor ol' Milwaukee Bucks. I root 'em on faithfully each year, and they slap me stupid for my troubles. Cursed by the Lew Alcindor trade (and still smarting over the release of George Karl), they'll miss the playoffs again in '06 as former has-beens (Cleveland, Orlando, and New York) rebuild with intent. Andy Bogut may prove disastrous (unless he learns to rebound), T.J. Ford is a big question mark with the spinal injury, and Michael Redd is poised for a big-bucks haul with either the Knicks or the Mavericks. EVERYONE else is trade bait. With Porter out as coach (excellent move, by the way), will take a fit of inspiration to find someone suitable (do I hear Larry Brown knocking?). A once-dependable franchise reeling from a lack of direction.
