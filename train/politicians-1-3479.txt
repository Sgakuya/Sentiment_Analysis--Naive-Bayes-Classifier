He turned a massive surplus into half trillion dollar deficits, yet still kept the economy in a prolonged recession. He has the worst job creation record since Herbert Hoover, a terrible record on the environment, and lied about why he sent us to war. His FCC commissioner sits idly by and allows mergers between large media conglomerates, while leading this senseless fascistic indecency crackdown on Howard Stern and others. His NASA policy is clueless--planning a trip to Mars while scrapping Hubbell. Enron was his largest lifetime campaign contributor, but now he is the shill of Halliburton war profiteers, the oil companies, insurance companies, and drug companies. Bankruptcies are at an all-time high thanks to his failed policies. Bush is intellectually and morally bankrupt and a disgrace to America and the human race.
