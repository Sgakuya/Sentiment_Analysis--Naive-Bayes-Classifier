Providence is a great city- MONEY magazine called it the best place to live in the northeast. A good arts scene- museums and theatre with much history dating from its founding in 1636. Many great colleges, (Brown, Providence College, The Rhode Island School of Design, and Johnson and Wales Univ.) Great Italian food, as well as other cuisines. The river walk downtown is like Paris. The Federal Hill area- near Brown Univ. Has great eating places, art and theatres. The historic district has a wonderful collection of restored homes from the 17th and 18th centuries. Also Don't ever miss Newport...the Cliff walk is incredible to walk and see the mansions of the Gilded age. Drive to the Atlantic coast to Watch Hill and see the great views, old New England homes and resorts and views of the sweeping pristine beach. The states beaches are clean, with lots of good surf. Overall a very 'unknown state' with many gems, small, but with much to offer.
