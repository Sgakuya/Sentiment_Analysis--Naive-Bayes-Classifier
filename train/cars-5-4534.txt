I grew up with fords. Love the 460. But I haven't been impressed with ford's styling. Inside or out. The exterior looks similar to a dodge (not knocking the dodge). The interior in(The newer models)looks to me like it has a cheap snap together dash, and they are uncomfortable to ride in or drive. They used to be the best. I don't know what happened or what ford was thinking. It has caused me to go Chevy. I have a 1996 1-ton crew cab dually that I bought brand new. Has all the bells and whistles and the styling inside and out is very nice. with the usual maintenance, all I have ever had to replace is the battery and a water pump. Tires too, of course. I'm sold. 128,000 miles and counting!
