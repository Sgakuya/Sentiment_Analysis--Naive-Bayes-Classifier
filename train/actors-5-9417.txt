Well, what can I say? Personally, I think that Jodie is one of the best actresses of all time. Just watching any of her movies would tell you so, not to mention her 2 Oscars. I have not watched all her movies [yet:)], but everything that I've seen for her has been grade A material. Her movie THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of my favourite movies of all time. Also, one of the things that I like the most about her, is her choice of movies. She chooses her movies not based on if she thinks they'll be great hits or not, instead her choice is based on what she thinks of the characters and the movie itself and wheather it is something that she feels she has to do. Hence, her passing on the movie HANNIBAL . In my openion she is one of few in Hollywood that deserves to be respected. She is talented, intelectuall, stylish, and not to mention sexy.
