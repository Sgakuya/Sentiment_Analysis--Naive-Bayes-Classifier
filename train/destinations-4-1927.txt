I'm a big patriot. I admit, I don't know very much about other countries, but it appears to me that the U. S. is a great country. I won't go right out and say we're SUPERIOR- I don't want to piss off any Brits or other foreigners reading this. But this is the only country I know of that was FOUNDED on freedom. Thomas Jefferson and other colonial people had the courage to stand up to their oppresors and found their own country based on the idea of freedom. If, by comparison, we aren't that great, our history and culture is at least a very unique and interesting one. This past century, for example. I think that when it all comes to down to it, we're not as great as we think we are, and with huge amounts of commercialization and greed and government corruption and whatnot, I'd say we're slowly going down the sewer. The country is degenerating from what it once was, but I'm still proud to be here. The only real problem I have with this country is that our government tends to be, if you'll pardon the phrase, full of s**t. All men are created equal. If that's true, why is there so much discrimination? Sex, race, class, even age all determine the way you are treated. I, for example, am 15 years old. I'm not treated equally. I'm treated inferiorly with a condescending I'm an adult and therefore I'm smart and you're stupid attitude. The Constitution SHOULD say All men are created equal, except for minors. That's the only big problem I have with this country. But aside from that, we can express ourselves freely, anyone can get a good college education, get any job they want, and, for the most part, be treated fairly. Despite it's flaws, I couldn't be living in a better country. God bless America.
