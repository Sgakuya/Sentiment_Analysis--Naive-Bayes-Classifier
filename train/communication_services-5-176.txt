I came back to Verizon after trying Metro POS in Atlanta and am glad I did. Verizon is by no means the cheapest..but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. their system in Atlanta is bar none the best as far as coverage, especially indoors and in offices. Never been inside someone's house and not been able to make calls unlike I had with Metro PCS which didn't work anywhere and friends who have T-Mobile and AT&T can never use their phones in their houses in north fulton and cobb co. I have never had a screwed up bill and at least their customer service SPEAKS ENGLISH and ANSWERS THE PHONE usually on the third ring. No cell service is perfect nor ever will be but Verizon is about the best there is.
