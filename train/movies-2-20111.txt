To me, this film was one of the greatest cinematic disappointments ever, regarding the high expectations that had been created in me by other people's comments (probably because they were mostly made by 13 year old girls). The low budget was of course quite obvious, as a matter of fact if was the programme of the film. The plot can be pretty much reduced to three friends that are losing control of a quite silly expedition and start getting all hysterical about running out of food and time because they have to be back at school after the weekend. The only reward for the bored audience is the end of the movie that offers the only real excitement.
