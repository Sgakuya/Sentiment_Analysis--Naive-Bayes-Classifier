This was by far the most discusting sit down restaurant I have ever eaten in. I am constantly shocked when I hear people talking favorable about this place. Perhaps it was the location rather than the whole chain itself but I found the food to be bland, the rice tastes as if its sat in a pot all day long and they give you way too much of it, and the other foods were all greasy AND bland. Yuck. The waitstaff was fine and so was the environment but if the food is this crappy its a waste of my money no matter how decently priced they are. I will never ever go back to one of these restaurants. I will eagerly pay higher prices for Chevy's to have good food instead of wasting it here.
