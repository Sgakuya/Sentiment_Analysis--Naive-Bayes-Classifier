The next season is gonna be crazy and i hope JJ can keep up his superstar status, he might fall, but i doubt it hes got too much pure talent Oh,and yea JJ is a Cocky S.O.B. and Michael Jordan wasn't but hold on lets pull up another BIG difference in those two...JJ is a white guy playin in a sport mostly dominated by african american players. Heck yea id be cocky too...if you're not cocky other players are gonna just chalk you up as nothing. Case in point Julius Hodge, if he wasn't cocky he wouldnt be the player he is today. I mean hes not even that good but everybody knows who he is and he'll probably get recruited. JJ Redick is good and if your good and havin the season of a lifetime by ga showboat it, if you made 5 threes in a row and broke all the records hes broke you know youd be like, Oh yea I AM the man I mean on teh court and off teh court are two different things. He might be the nicest guy you'll ever meet off teh court, but whens hes out there watch out. Thats the mentalkity all great players hafta have to win. NEW TOPIC WHOA..the only people who really focus on the players looks above their talent are stalkers and horny teenage girls who can idolize these kids. its not about looks its about pure talent and duke has that, carolina does too, im not gonna lie yea i think JJ is a good looking guy but i mean thats not why i watch basketball expecially Duke, I watch to see the intensity in the play and just for the sheer love of the game. Duke is talented there a good school, dont always look to the bad before you see the good
