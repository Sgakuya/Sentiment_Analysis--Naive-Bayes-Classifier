Let me just this how can one rate a car by the looks? I love my Aztek its an 01 with 41k. I did not want a suberban with 7 seats yuck I did not want a minivan with 7 seats yuck..Aztek owners dont want 7 seats. Power it has enough to get up the highest mountain while towing something. Maintenance, problem free in 41k thats better than 3 of my hondas and 2 acuras all which I bought new and yet they say honda is more reliable? This is my first american car and yet people say its a piece of junk wonder what they drive. This is a great car and yes it look like a CRX with 4 doors on steroids but its so nice to drive down the road and not see everyone and their moma driving the same car. It makes you stand out a little. Everytime I see another Aztek owner at a resteraunt or mall we trade our stories and I never hear negative things. Great car the end!
