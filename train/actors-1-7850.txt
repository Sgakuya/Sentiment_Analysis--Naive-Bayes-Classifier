Alec Baldwin ought to about have all his crap packed and ready to move his ass out of America since it seems likely Bush will be allowed to accept the presidency he's won several times now. Baldwin is an arrogant, hateful, ignorant and dishonorable man. He punches photographers for snapping pictures of his wife, yet incites a national TV audience to murder Henry Hyde and his family? What kind of idiot is that? And what kind of idiots would support him? It's too bad Baldwin is too much of a pansy to follow up on his arrogant claims to leave America if Bush won. What a better place America would be without idiot Baldwin spewing his hate! Grow a pair Baldwin, live up to your arrogant word, and get the Hell out of America!
