One can only hope that Kubrick had a grand design in allowing Kidman to make a brief albeit unforgettable appearance in Eyes Wide Shut. Most of her screen time was spent self-consciously shuffling around the screen attempting an emotional/psychological depth which was quite obviously well out of her reach. Coupled with the fact that despite having lived in America with American-speaking children and an American accented husband and having done numerous American-accented films in the past, she still couldn't manage to spit out a few measly words without slipping into quasi Americo-Australian, is absolutely, inexcusably reprehensible! I mean, a few accented words, huge movie star fees, legendary Stanley Kubrick film, and it was STILL too difficult for the A list actress??? What other incentives does she need to get it right? It is her JOB!
