I think this guy died in 1877 and just hasn't fallen over yet, what a liar, what an incompetant, has he EVER served in a war?? Has anyone from this administraion, I mean shrub and cheney, they get us into this war and they have NO experience at all, and won't listen to those who DO have experience--they should all be tried as traitors! Clinton did not need to have to reorganize our military because he never lied to get us into a war we did not need to be in! And, obviously Rummy knows what he is doing as there are almost 2000 young Americans dead, countless thousands maimed and it is not one bit better now than it was 2 years ago! Good Job Rummy :--(((
