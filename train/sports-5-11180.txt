I have lived in Ohio all my life (26 years) and I have been a Michigan fan for the past 16 years. I have never liked Lloyd Carr since the day he started at Michigan. He likes to play "safe" traditional Big Ten football which leads to consistant three loss seasons!!! Maybe all the old fart alumni members of Michigan are content winning the Big Ten title but us Die Hard fans would like at least a chance at a National Title once in a while!!! In this BCS era you have to take chances and make the most of your talent like USC and other teams at the top. I realize the Maize and Blue cannot be in the National Title game every year...but we will never get there under Lloyd Carr and that is just a FACT!!! I practically had a stroke during the Wisconsin game when he decided to kick a field goal at the end of the second quarter when there was plenty of time to take a shot at the endzone one more time. I have put up with this conservative play from Lloyd Carr for long enough...it is time to get a young exciting coach to shake things up!!! Lloyd did not even put Mike Hart in the game when he could have greatly helped the team...but I guess it is good he did not take a chance on him getting hurt again so we have him available for the crappy bowl game we will be playing in!!!! I am and always will be Maize and Blue...Thru and Thru but I cannot just sit back and take all of the crap I am getting from all the dumb Buckeye fans that surround me every day!!!! IT IS TIME FOR LLOYD TO GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
