I graduated from the School of Foreign Service many, many years ago (let's just say that the launch of Sputnik coincided with my freshman year). Anyway, Georgetown was a great school then. Since then, in my experience, it has taken a long slide downward. The Jesuits have always been somewhat controversial within the Catholic Church, but I've seen too many instances of blatant anti-Americanism, what I feel is liberalism to the point of being anti-Catholic (don't get me wrong - I believe in academic freedom and expression, but anarchy is another thing altogether), and too many politically correct boutique courses. I think that Father Fritz Fadner (anyone out there know who I'm talking about? ) would spin in his grave if he saw some of the stuff going on there now.
