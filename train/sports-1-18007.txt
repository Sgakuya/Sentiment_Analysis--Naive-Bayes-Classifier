They lost their 2 biggest offensive stars, their defense is unreliable at best, so can there be any hope for the Cardinals? Probably not this year. Emmitt is an upgrade for the runningbacks, but I hate to say it, he's running on empty. I doubt that a change of scenery will refuel him. They will have a horrendous passing game, meaning that Emmitt will have to face 8 or 9 men in the box. It's hard to run with an average, at best, line facing all those bodies. The management needs to wake up and not worry so much about their current players, but their idiotic offseason moves that always put them in bad positions to win.
