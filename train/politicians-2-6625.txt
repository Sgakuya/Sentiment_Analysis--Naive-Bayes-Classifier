I agree with a lot of Buchanan's platform, but his behavior in the most recent presidential election totally turned me off to him. Honestly, I haven't kept up with a lot of his political views recently, but it seems that he is basically an ultra-conservative. WHAT ON EARTH IS AN ULTRA CONSERVATIVE DOING RUNNING A THIRD PARTY TICKET????? If you are conservative, run as a Republican or don't run at all. Republicans are the conservative party. Democrats are the liberal party. Third parties are for candidates who stand for issues that are not represented by the mainstream liberal or conservative. If a conservative fails to get the Republican nomination, then he should not be running for president. His constituents have already shown him that he does not have the appeal to make an impact. All he ends up doing is leeching the Republicans' extreme-right vote. I have much greater respect for Alan Keyes, who, though he too is extremely conservative and failed to get much support in his own party, recognized that if he couldn't make it as a Republican, there was no point in wasting the money to run.
