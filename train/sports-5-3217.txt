Hammerin' Hank Aaron is the undisputed homerun champion of ALL time. Hammerin' Hank played in an era where the strike zone was actually enforced. You know, from shoulders to knees and the width of the plate (remember little league?). He was never questioned about illegal strength enhancement drugs. He never had to be. Hank Aaron never weighed 200 lbs in his playing days. The man simply had strong wrists and a keen eye. These days the pitch has to be belt high right down the middle to be called a strike. Also, you have hitters coming up to the plate in darn near full body armor so as to crowd the plate then get mad when the pitcher keeps them honest. Baseball in the 50's, 60's and 70's was truly a jewel to behold. Baseball these days is so watered down with so many teams anymore, free agency, overpaid crybabies, and the flare for making it on SportsCenter. Hank Aaron and the so many other greats of his day made baseball special for so many at one time. Sad to say, those days are gone.
