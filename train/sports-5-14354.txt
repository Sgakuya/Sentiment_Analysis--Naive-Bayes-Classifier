Dan Marino is the all time best quarterback to play the game and brady is 1 he's a choke what the hell are you talking about why dont you learn how to think before you talk or learn a thing or two about football. That gos for you to mikey frans marino holds 13 major career passing records and the single season record for most yards thrown the only player to throw for over 5,000 yards in a single season. dan is the greatest statistical in the history of the NFL.So why dont you say elways better know thats shows what you know. I defend my quarterback so keep your retarded comments to yourself especially if you dont know what your talking about. DAN THE MAN RULES GO MARINO and to all you other marino fans you rule to.
