I've flown on Continental twice and I enjoyed it. I appreciate the fact they had a non-stop flight from Omaha to Houston when I flew down there for my friend's wedding, and the entire roundtrip price was pretty good. The service is also good, with friendly pilots and helpful flight attendants. Their planes are clean and modern and not suspect in safety like some other airlines, whose planes are at least 25 years old! The only gripe I have is that we had to wait forever on the runway in Houston before taking off to go home and delayed the flight by about 10-15 minutes. But other than that, I say Continental is one of the better airlines out there!
