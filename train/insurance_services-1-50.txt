Progressive Auto Insurance should be checked by the FBI to make sure they aren't a total scam company. I was hit by a woman with Progressive, and during the arduous process, I was told once by Progressive that I was being held liable, and once that the claim I made against them was denied. In the denial letter, the agent stated You were more than 50 percent at fault, and therefore we cannot honor your claim. More than 50% at fault? This lady ran a red light and hit the back quarter panel on the passengers side. Do they not understand how physics work? Well, my AIG agent called the woman who hit me and she said I went through a green light and when my agent asked her why she didn't slow down or swerve to avoid the accident, she said I didn't even notice him there until I was already in the intersection. This is the worst thing I've ever seen and am appalled that a company this large can allow such horrible mistakes. Fight for your money, they're thieves!
