Australians....why do you think that you were safe before the war? Take a good look into reality and you'll realize that terrorists already had their eyes on you. They don't target you now because you stood by us Americans, they target you now because they are, and have been jealous of free people. They don't want freedom. They want people to live in fear. They want submission. If they had real agendas, then why would they resort to beheading people, and killing those they disagree with? They will never seek peace. Do some homework, check it out. The timeline of terror has gone much farther back than this election cycle for the U.S. and Australia. If you make the wrong choices now, you may really see what they have in store for you. Its time for the world to quit hitting the snooze button, and wake up.
