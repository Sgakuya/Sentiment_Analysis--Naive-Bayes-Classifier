The Hawk was absolutely the premier player to watch during his prime in both the ABA and the NBA. Unfortunately, many people never saw Hawkins play while being black-balled from the NBA until his reinstatement in 1969. I can tell you with no uncertainty that there has never been a more exciting player to watch for the showmanship he displayed in his career. He frequently handled the ball with only one of his huge hands by soaring to the hoop and dunking or making spectacular passes to teammates. He is most likely the greatest legend on the playgrounds of New York City. If more people had seen him play in his prime, I believe they would agree with my viewpoints on the Hawk
