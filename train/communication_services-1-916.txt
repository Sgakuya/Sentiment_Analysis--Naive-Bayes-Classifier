I could not imagine a worse company for customer service. I have now been sold 2 service contracts with FRAUDULANT services and was made promises for all kinds of things that later I found out were completely false. I even got one in WRITING and AT&T still won't honor it. I've filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and will NOT renew my contract with them. CUSTOMERS BEWARE OF THEIR SALES PEOPLE AT THEIR 1-800 NUMBERS- YESTERDAY I WAS ON HOLD FOR OVER 2 HOURS- LITERALLY! It is unreal how awful their customer service operators are at resolving disputes, nice people, but they're favorite phrase is there's nothing I can do.
