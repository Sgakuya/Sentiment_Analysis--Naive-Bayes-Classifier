It is interesting how many people think Ehud should march downtown on a white horse butchering Arabs.Being Israel's most decorated soldier I think he has more than proved he is capable of war. The fact that he is willing to go the hard road for peace makes him the man for the job.Considering how long the division in plaestine sum total has existed I think it is high time the armchair theorists and extreme fundamental protagonists SAT DOWN,SHUT UP,AND OPENED THEIR EARS AS TO WHAT IS BEING SAID TODAY! FOR WE ARE ALL AWARE OF WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. THE FACT IS THAT MESOPOTAMIA MUST BECOME A UNITED DEMOCRATIC TRADING BLOCK WITH A 21ST CENTURY AGENDA.GOOD LUCK EHUD.
