Experts in how to lose a customer! My wife & son stopped in to get a bite to eat after a ball game. My wife didn't realize that they only took cash - her mistake. However the way it was handled was horrible. The cashier told her she couldn't leave to go to the ATM despite the fact that she had an ID, checks, credit cards. Any of which could verify that she was unlikely to stiff the joint. Then the cashier had the nerve to holler at the waitresses and ask them if they would take a check and pay for the meal. None of them would do it. So then the cashier starts asking customers if they would take her check and pay the tab. How absolutely rude, & disrespectful can an employee be? For an $11 meal the Waffle house in Yukon, OK has lost a customer for life and I'll be sure to tell anyone that will listen how little they respect & value their customers...
