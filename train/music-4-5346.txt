I just got back from walking my dog with this cd. It's very good. I don't know much about Emmylou Harris, but this is a really good collection of songs, My Antonia, is a beautiful Spanish-sounding folk duet with Dave Matthews (it's my favorite thing he's ever done), it's one of those songs that just sounds like it has been around forever. The whole album has a ghostly sound, echoing ambience, and some of the songs have mystical themes that go right along with it. When I first heard it, I thought that there was a chance that it's produced by Daniel Lanois, but it's Malcolm Burn who I guess uses methods similar to Lanois'. The c.d. has an interesting fusion with modern pop-rock, hip-hop beats, Celtic touches, and of course good folk and country. The title track is pretty great and so is Michaelangelo. Not everything on here is worth listening to, so minus a star, but I think Emmylou and her producer did a good job of making an interesting sound without messing up, and it would have been easy to make a big muddle. Emmylou's thin, warbling voice is very strong and I'm enjoying this cd very muchly.
