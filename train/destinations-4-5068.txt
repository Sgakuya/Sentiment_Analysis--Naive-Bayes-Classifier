It is funny how many people think that New York is NYC and nothing more. In relative terms the city is just a small area compared with the rest of the state. The rest of New York is 100% opposite of the city. Much of New York State is hickville; just barren country land. Not over-populated but under-populated. People are as friendly as anywhere else. New York City almost should be a state of it's own. I've never been to anything like it. It's so huge and there's so much to do. Crime is a problem in any city, New York is no exception, but I feel safe when I'm there. And it's not so much that the people in the city are rude, it's just that they're not openly friendly. In the South and Midwest people can stop to smile and talk to strangers because there is 1 person per hundred miles. New York City is such a busy place that people learn to worry about and keep to themselves.
