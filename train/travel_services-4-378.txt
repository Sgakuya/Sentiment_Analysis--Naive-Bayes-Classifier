I have flown US Airways a few times. My most memorable experience is when I was 11, flying with my 14 year old brother to Florida to visit my grandparents. The food was great (I am not kidding, great, I am a sucker for airline food for some demented reason..I also enjoy the occasional hospital cafeteria). The flight attendants were so kind and helpful. Ample room, clean and comfortable. Even when we had to switch planes, the ground crew was equally helpful and kind..they even had this little cart to bring us to our next gate. Of course, my totally cool 14 year old brother did not need to be seen on any silly cart..so we had to run. Otherwise, a great trip made easy by considerate and competent airline.
