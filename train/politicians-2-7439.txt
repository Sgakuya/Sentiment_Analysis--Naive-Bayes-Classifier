Here's a guy who once told a waiter at a restaurant that he was the government. Apparently he wrote that clause into the constitution. As Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Tom DeLay welds a significant amount of power in Washington. Indeed, really he runs the Congress. Dennis Hastert is an amicable figure whose power is largely figurative. DeLay, a former exterminator from Texas, leads the cultural conservative coalition with an iron hand. He plays hardball, but that's not where I take issue with him. In politics its all fair game. DeLay went to Washington to help out business, something which is absolutely fine in my book. Problem is that when he finds some moral piccadillo that he wants to fix, he will stop at nothing to use government intervention to stop it. For instance, he is the first person to advocate that the FCC charge money to tv networks who violate decency rules. Now I know that DeLay said he is the government, but where does it say in the Constitution that the government has a right to censor? Maybe the media is slimy, but the whole thing sets a bad precedent. Some people like DeLay promote liberty, but really, these sanctimonious types are the ones we have to watch out for the most.
