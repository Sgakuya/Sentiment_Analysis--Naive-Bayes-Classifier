Whether you believe in freedom or not, it works well in Amsterdam. You can buy marijuana from the coffee shops, magic mushrooms from the smart shops, you can watch live sex in one of the many sex clubs, or you can even have sex with one of the hookers that display themselves in windows along the streets. The streets are very well lit, the people are very friendly, and I felt very safe. For those uncomfortable with these activies, no one is forced to come here. You can still enjoy the tremendously beautiful and hospitable city of Amsterdam. Be sure to read DickDirk's comment below, which proves that freedom works in Holland.
