Are we better off now than 7 years ago? Yes if we mean finacially, and that is taking into account working round the clock or two jobs. What about are Education, Medicare, Perscription Drugs, Social Security, and the Military better off. Regan was much more conservative than GWB, and Roe v. Wade is still in tact. The Democratic Senate confirmed his appointments as well as one of Bush's..Check's and balances, not scare taticts. Neither candidate has the communication ability of Clinton or Regan, but Bush has chosen Cheney to advise and help with his foreign policy expertise, and Gore has chosen Lieberman to help with the character issue. I see a major disconnect between the two. For all Al Gore's insistance on experience, it was GWB who called the correct way to handle the issue in Europe and either Al didn't know what was going on, or was untruthful. I would have someone that says they are not positive on an answer, but who has the honesty to find advice, and in the end admit failings, than someone, who like Clinton, knows everything, is alway right, and never takes responsibility. There is always an excuse. We wouldn't accept this from our children, or business associates, so why would we from our President?
