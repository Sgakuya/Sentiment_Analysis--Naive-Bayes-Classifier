Drug addiction is a kind-of-overdone genre. And the many flashy camera sequences at times annoy. But all-in-all this is a very good film. It emphasizes the power of drugs to overtake families, relationships, and even the most modest of dreams. I liked the way that dope is shown as a substitute for something else for which the characters are looking. The ending is very well done and doesn't cop-out with a feel-good resolution. Ellen Burstyn is incredible, and I certainly agree with an earlier post that she deserves an Oscar nomination. The other cast members also perform well, with Jennifer Connelly especially strong.
