Again, I agree pretty much with Irishgit on this...it doesn't hold up all that well over time, at least as a movie. Parts of it are pretentious, and downright boring. Maria Schneider really can't act. Ingmar Bergman once noted that the script would have made more sense if the 2 main characters had both been homosexuals, instead of an older man-younger woman. The much-advertised erotic scenes are often pretty silly (Bring me the butter). Still, for all that, I do think this represents one of Brando's most powerful, intense performances. As a matter of fact, it's probably the last time he ever really acted, and acted with sublime skill, in one of his movies.
