The Adventures of Pluto Nash is one of a series of Eddie Murphy movies that I have recently viewed (along with Daddy Day Care, I Spy, and Showtime). This is one is set in 2087, on the moon. The plot involves a moon gang taking over Nash's gambling-free club to bring gambling in. Nash refuses and his club is crippled in an explosion. And, thus, the chase begins. Most of the humor in this movie actually comes from the supporting characters. Nash's robot guard, Bruno (Randy Quaid) has alot of humorous dialogue to work with. Peter Boyle (of Everybody Loves Raymond) also plays an old friend of Nash. There are also visual gags, including one involving a certain female senator being on 10,000 moon dollar bills. The special effects are quite good, and the surprise twist as to who the main villian is is interesting. An upbeat ending adds to the picture. In the end, the movie is nothing remarkable or incredible, but enjoyable, nonetheless.
