What a f*cking assh*ole. This d*ck held out as a rookie a couple of years ago and now he's wondering why his offensive line isn't protecting him, much less helping him up after he gets sacked. Here's a little hint, assh*le: people don't like holdouts. You're a freakin' millionaire playing a game you love. How much money is enough? F*ck you. And don't even try and weasel out of this one and attempt to win the hearts of Washingtonians by claiming you got bad advice from your agent. Did you give any of the money back? I doubt it. You deserve every sack, broken bone, and concussion coming to you this season, you greedy bastard.
