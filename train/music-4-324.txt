Monster is really cool. Not as terrific as some of the other REM efforts I've seen, but overall really good! My favorite songs on this album are Bang and Blame , What's the Frequency, Kenneth? , and King of Comedy . And to all you nuts who think R.E.M has sold out: Is it over the thing with Superman ? If it is, I got a little somethin' to tell you. Superman was a cover; a new version of someone else's song. Some technology company wanted to use it in a commercial. After R.E.M refused to sell them the rights to the song, they went to the band who originally recorded the song and bought the rights from them. Some people thought it was R.E.M's version and accused them of selling out! Well, they didn't. They even took the matter to court! Anyway, back to Monster. A really cool album. I'm surprised Micheal, considering that he'd just recently lost River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain, had the ability to write such a lovely song as Let M In . Is there a snowball's chance in hell that one of you could explain the line in Crush with Eyeliner that says, She's a sad tomato ? I sure can't interpret it. Tongue is very pretty, but Stipe shouldn't try to sing in a falsetto voice; it makes the song slightly harder to understand. Anyway, good work, R.E.M, and take care, everyone!
