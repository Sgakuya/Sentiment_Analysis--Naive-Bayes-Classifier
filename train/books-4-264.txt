The primary reason I read this is because the guy who wrote it, Dave Eggers, teaches a writing workshop right down the street from where I live. That out of the way, the book is actually worth reading. The storyline in brief (which is true by the way) - the narrator (Dave Eggers), in his early twenties, watches both his parents die within 6 months of each other, leaving his older brother and sister, and an 11 year old younger brother named toph. Eggers takes off for California with his kid brother and sister, and goes through the bizarro experience of being single, in his early twenties in San Francisco, with an 11 year old kid to take care of. The relationship between the brothers is what makes this book special, and Toph is brilliantly portrayed in the book. Underlying the whole book is Eggers bitterness - his bitterness for his luck, his lot, and just for being young in general. He starts a magazine, tries out for MTV's the Real World, meets girls, all the while taking care of his brother. From time to time, the real life characters in the book jump out of character - say artificial thinks for the sole purpose of illuminating the reader as to Eggers mind set. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I liked the book, and I recommend it - you can feel strains of Catcher in the Rye, that don't even feel forced. Worth a read, and is made more touching by the fact that it's true.
