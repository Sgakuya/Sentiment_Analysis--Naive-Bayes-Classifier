The reverend is a true unifier. Just as the rainbow unites all colours, so does the Reverend Jackson. I saw two rainbows this morning, neither one of them had any white in it. Part of the task of unifying humanity is to realize all the evils such as war, racism, drugs, etc... originate from the white peoples of this world. The reverend recognized that fact early on when he spit in white people's food in one of his first jobs. He will now lead the people in protest of this phony President W Bush. It is time for America to unite behind a true leader, a man of God, the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Keep hope alive!!!
