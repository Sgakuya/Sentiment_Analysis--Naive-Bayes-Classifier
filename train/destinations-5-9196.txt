What I can say! I'm from Barcelona! This construction is really special for us, it had been the most visitated building in Spain last year, and it's an obligate visit for turists. We are sorry for it only because it isn't finished, but if you came here in one or two years, one of the parts unfinished will be finished (they hope finish this part in 2006, and make an oficial oppening). The rest of the building, they hope finish it in 50 to 100 years. Architects are no agree in plans, and it's true that are parts that break Gaudi's line, but that don't mind, is the most representative construction of Gaudi's work and it's really something that you must see in person. Ah! Remember that we have others Gaudi's constructions: La Pedrera, El Parc Güell, La Casa Batlló...; and we have too another architest in the same line, Antoni Domènech i Muntaner, he make St. Pau Hospital (really impresionant too) and other buildings like this.
