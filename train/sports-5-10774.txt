PBeavr said, I would rate him as a 1 except for the fact his teams have been pretty good 6 of the last 9 years. But I also won't give him a 3 or 4 because he has been coach there for 17 years and not just the past 9. If you only look at the last 9 years you are ignoring almost HALF his tenure and only prove your own ignorance. PBeavr is right! By looking at only the past 9 years we WOULD be ignoring almost half of Beamer's tenure. Let's be a little sceptical . . . we'll forgive him the first four years because they are not representative of his recruiting abilities, and we'll give him two more for program building. So let's look at the past 12 years, leaving out only the first six (or one-third). Perhaps this will keep us from ignorantly and blindly supporting coach Beamer. First 6 years win % = .283 First 6 years record = 14-37-2 Last 12 yrs win % = .750 Last 12 years record = 111-37 Overall (18 yrs) win % = .627 Overall record = 125-74-2 In the last 12 seasons the Hokies' have averaged 9.25 wins per year. In the preceding 6 years they averaged only 2.33 wins per year. Thus, Beamer's last 12 years have seen a near 400% increase in average wins per year over his first six. (My brother would say that one hell of an investment, and I think all us Hokie fans agree that Beamer was and IS!) Beamer's overall win percentage over his entire 18 year tenure at Tech IS only .627, PBeavr, but over the past 12 seasons the Hokies' have averaged .750! This is after posting an average win percentage of a mere .283 in Beamer's first 6 years. There is a stark contrast here that is undenyable, and it speaks to exactly why a wise man once said, You can't judge a coach on his first few years. Tech fans, like myself, who have been season ticket holders for more than 20 years have had to suffer through some really BAD football. (i.e. The Chokies!) But we survived the Bill Dooley era somehow, and we saw the rise of Frank Beamer. He took a team (an entire program, really) that was worthless and made it into a 75% winning team in only 6 years (that would be only 2 years of Beamer-recruited players, by-the-way)!
