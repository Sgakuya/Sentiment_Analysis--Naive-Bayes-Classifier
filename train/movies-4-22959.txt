I didn t appreciate this one much until the 2001 version was released. In the original, the writers actually gave you an opportunity to get to know the characters enough that you actually felt something for their circumstances (character development which has all but disappeared - is what I miss most about some of the newer films!). By the time the story rolls around to its surprise ending you feel all the gut wrenching loss that Heston s character felt. You have become involved to the point that you are part of the film rather than an observer. This cannot and does not happen in a film where very little meaningful dialogue is spoken and you are constantly shooting through scenery in an apparent death race to get to the end of the film. The 68 version may not have been the best thing ever recorded on celluloid, but compared to the newer holiday for short attention spans , it looks like a production of Hamlet.
