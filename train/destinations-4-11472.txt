I just returned from a trip up to the Smoky Mountains, which straddle the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. Quite possibly contains some of the best mountain scenery in the East coast. I always make it a point to return every year to the area to do some hiking and skiing (which is not the best, but it's quite possibly the closest I have to where I live). A negative is the fact that Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge have become increasingly commercialized and tacky. It has all the appeal of a roadside rest stop. However make it a point to stay in a cabin in the woods outside of town; they are mostly very affordable. Camping is also a good option. The area affords many recreational activities; from horseback riding to whitewater rafting that make it a place to come back to every year for some R & R.
