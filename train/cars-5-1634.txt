Just bought the 2001 Alero GL.And so far I really enjoy the car.I had a 1996 Camry before this and I can never say a bad word about the Toyota.I was offered good deal on the Alero and after a test drive I found the car comfortable very peppy and the radio is GREAT.So I bought the car.I have alittle over 700 miles on the car so far and I'm alittle disappointed about the gas mileage I do mostly highway driving and on the 4 cylinder I've gotten only 23 miles per gallon.They say after breakin 1500 miles I should get 30 mpg if I get that I would say that the Alero will be a great car.I do enjoy driving it more than the Camry.
