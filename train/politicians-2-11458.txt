Tried to Bork Condoleeza Rice in the confimation hearings. She's in great company: she and John Kerry were the only dissenting votes on the panel. It's always good for a politician to be characterized as part of the left-wing, lunatic fringe and these two are proud, card-carrying members. The only thing Dr. Rice did wrong was to let Babs skulk away, instead of asking, No, you've made the accusation, here in public. On what point do you accuse me of lying? I want a quotation here. Tell me what I said that was untrue. I want it in the record here, today, Senator. Make your point now and allow me to address it directly. Let me clarify this for the American people. CLARIFICATION: As IJR points out, the vote in the Senate (to confirm) was 85-13 with two abstentions. The voting in the Confirmation Panel, a sub-committee of the Senate, was 16-2 with only Kerry (big surprise) and Boxer voting nay.
