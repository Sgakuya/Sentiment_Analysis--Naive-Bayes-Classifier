I've had accounts with Wachovia since the early 1980s and have been completely satisfied with the service (in contrast to bad experiences I have had with Central Carolina Bank, in NC, and Trustco (in upstate NY). In all this time, I have experienced NONE of the alleged sleazy practices described by other posters, and Wachovia personnel have been nothing but helpful and courteous, going above and beyond the call to assist me, both on the phone and in person at my local branch. I can only conclude that the majority of complaints here result from the customers' own screw-ups, which they prefer to blame on the bank.
