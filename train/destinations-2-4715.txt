somebody has to say it, and eventhough i have black friends (although they are suburban so i dont know if it is the same) i guess it will be me. It started to decline when it became the blackest city in america, or maybe the other way around, when a city is half white half black, it is usually perfect. but when it gets too white,racail tensions flare up with any black family moving into a neighborhood, and when it gets to black, crime rates skyrocket. its too bad though, because much of detroits black populations really isnt ghetto they are just normal families, but the hoodlums give the whole city a bad name. Whats really sad is, this could be one of the greatest cities in america, it has tons of historic homes and buildings, if only the loser auto companies didn't leave, i bet detroit would still be today what it was in the 20's and 30's, a very nice, very safe, very freindly city.
