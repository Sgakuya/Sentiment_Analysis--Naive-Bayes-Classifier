Good lord, if you don't mind a little black humor, the history of the monarchs of this particular country is about as impressive a list of continued consecutive human barbarity, oppression, greed, inbreeding, ugliness,colonialism, and other delights as one is likely to find. Besides continuing the persecution of England's neighbors, this ludicrous , pig- looking creature evidently got his rocks off by marrying and then beheading a succession of brides. Evidently, he liked a turkey leg in one hand and a naked woman in the other! A ruddy fat ass who " started" his own religion, which differs very little from the Catholic faith anyway: off the top of my head, out of major sects, the Anglican and the Greek Orthodox are quite similar to Catholicism anyway. A fat sh** who produced an equally abominable daughter in Elizabeth. The funny thing is, the daughter was apparently frigid or a lesbian or something, while about the only thing you can commend this porcine villain for is that at least he definitely had a libido!
