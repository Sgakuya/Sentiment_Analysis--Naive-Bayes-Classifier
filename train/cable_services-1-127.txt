I cancelled my NFL Sun. Ticket on 2/1/05, making sure I did so well before the season started Feb-August 8 months or so ahead of time. I did this via email and I kept DirectTv's response in my email files as verification. What do you know, NFL season comes around and they start charging me for NFL Sun. Ticket. Due to this overbilling and other problems I cancelled my service and filed a complaint with BBB. There response has been that I did not cancel until after the first payment was due, which is a blatant lie. They dont care that I have their email with their verification number dated 2/1/05. Beware: Always save your communication with DirectTv, even though they will lie and ignore it, it is very useful when you fight unfair billing.
