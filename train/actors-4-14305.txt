Fabulous, quirky talent who's choices for roles in independent films stands out. Chloe Sevigny has wowed this Cow with her performances in Boys Don't Cry, American Psycho, and Kids, and one can se that she has an enormous talent. She doesn't seem to click in standard Hollywood fare(Studio 54, Boys on the Side), but that is probably a good thing. Chloe is also a very attarctive actress with a different sort of beauty, not your standard model type(although she was a model early on in her career). The MooCow thinks this actress is one of the finest young performers in independent film; she needs only to find a niche in Hollywood to make herself into a full-fledged star.
