My Outback of choice is Wayne, NJ. All but one time they were consistant on quality of food and service. The time they were not, we complained and received a call from the proprieter himself and were able to resolve our issue. Unless you are there during the week when the doors open, expect this place to be packed with a wait for seating. That should tell you that everything about this place is worth waiting for. I find the staff is always friendly, prompt and even though you may have waited to be seated, once you are seated, the flow of delivery is timed perfectly. I'm picky as far as how things are cooked, etc. and they have never disappointed. Menu features appetizers such as "Blooming Onion", Kookabura Wings (Best chicken wings from a restaurant I have tried yet, and I don't really care for wings), Potato Skins, etc. Entrees - all different steaks from Strip to Prime Rib to filet. Most steaks are in your choice of 2 or 3 different sizes, grilled chicken, delicious ribs, pork chops, lamb chops, pasta dishes, etc. Add ons like Shrimp on the Barbie and mushrooms, lobster tail, etc. are available with your steaks. For a chain steakhouse, this is the best I have come across yet. Give it a try if you haven't already!
