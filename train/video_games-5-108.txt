The grandfather of first-person shooter games, Doom ushered in a huge new market for PC software and changed the lives of pasty-faced teenage geeks all over the world. As a former pasty-faced teenage geek myself, I completely understand how easy it is to get wrapped up in a game like Doom. With a little imagination, you're actually inside a three-dimensional computer world, standing in a dark corridor with a machine gun in your hand, waiting for a monster to walk around the corner so you can riddle him with bullets. The experience is real enough that the U.S. military actually began using Doom in training programs to simulate combat. Clearly it's violent in the extreme, so I understand when people claim that games like Doom are warping kids' minds (even the Columbine High School shooting has been blamed on Doom). But to hold the media - movies, music, games, TV, or whatever - responsible for violent crime strikes me as being overly simplistic. The media is portraying as much if not more violence than ever these days, yet incidents of violent crime are down across the country and down dramatically in big cities like New York. Before Doom, people blamed games like Dungeons Dragons for youth voilence. It's always easier to point to something specific than it is to acknowledge that the problem is complex and rooted primarily in family relationships.
