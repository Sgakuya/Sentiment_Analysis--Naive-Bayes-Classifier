First, I have to say that anyone who reviewed this movie who had not seen it is a complete moron. Second, this is a good movie no matter what your political opinion. Third, all documentaries have an angle, and America is smart enough to know that Moore is biased, and Moore knows that America knows it. When Moore says What was bush thinking? Was it, oh man, who screwed me? he isn't trying to get away with anything. It's just his opinion, and everyone knows it including him. So people need to get passed that. Look at the facts in this movie... take away every ounce of biase and you still have some shocking facts that people need to know and investigate for themselves before they go and vote... and as I said before, all of that aside, this is just a well put together movie.
