I am a DeVry / Keller student, now completing my second term. Prior to this I graduated in July from Kaplan University, which was also online. While at DeVry I took one online course and one at the school, located south of Seattle in Federal Way, WA. I've found the instructors knowledgable and learned that each is rated by students at the end of each term. If they don't receive an 80% approval rating they are not asked back. I liked that. The two instructors I've had both work in the fields they instruct in so have some realworld experience. I've also attended other schools. I am an older student and have been impressed so far. I like online education a LOT and find this school offers both online and on site as well as a combination of both in order to get the degree. So far, they receive high marks from me.
