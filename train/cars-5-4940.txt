What I like Love the seperate fans for A/C and engine cooling. Love the fact that it has P/S pump cooler, and Tranny cooler. Style. The towing option has both 4 and 7 prong plugs. Adj pedals for my short wife. What bugs me Defroster vent glare on windshield. Driver door seal rubbed and tore soon after buying, dealer replaced seal as per TSB. Oil gets all over P/S rack during oil change. I know it is a two wheel drive and not made for the snow but I had to drive it a few time in the snow and it practicly gets stuck in a flat parking lot, whith even 800lbs of sand in the back. Maybe different tires could help. Rides somewhat harsh when empty on bumpy roads, but it is a 2500 so that can be expected. Rides best with a load in the back. No tow hooks on a 2500???? Overall I tow a car to several car shows per year. This vehicle has done an ourstanding job. Never had a problem pulling hills in the summertime with A/C on. Car and trailer weigh approx 5k. Can hardly tell the vehicle and trailer are back there. I like the handling for such a big truck, feels secure. I am overall very impressed with this truck and would gladly purchase it again. I know this is an opinion site, but it bugs me when people post UGLY, just ugly, how will that help a buyer in the market for a used truck??? I love my truck but I honestly thought about what bugs me to try to give a somewhat professional opinion to a perspective buyer.
