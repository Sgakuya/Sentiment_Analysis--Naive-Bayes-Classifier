Quito is the standard base for most travelers as they explore Ecuador, and for good reason. The city itself is worth checking out (the colonial Old Town, the Museo del Banco Central) and there are some popular tourist destinations nearby (Mitad del Mundo, Otavalo, Cotopaxi). The Marsical Sucre area of New Town offers a wide array of services for travelers (laundry, Internet access, book stores, banks, nice restaurants, etc.) and is always full of tourists. But, partly for those reasons, Quito seemed more to me like a staging area for trips to more interesting places than a great destination in and of itself.
