I am in the school of psychology and I am really enjoying the program. The school is going through a lot of changes and the clinical psychology program has become a lot more rigurous because it plans to apply for APA accreditation within the next 2 years. There is now a one year mandatory residency requirement in the PsyD program. I have seen plenty of students who have failed the COMPS. You fail the COMPS twice and you're out of the program. The only thing that Capella needs to work on is raising their admission standards. There are some great students and there are some students who are just not DL material. Unfortunately, students who fail or cannot finish course requirements are often the first to blame the school rather than take full responsibility for their lack of progress. Distance learning is tough and not for everyone. Capella is no cake walk. If you're looking for an easier DL degree with no residency requirements, then look at other virtual universities. Capella is not perfect but its a fine school that requires a lot of work from each student.
