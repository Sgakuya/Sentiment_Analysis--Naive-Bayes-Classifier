I'm confused. Here is a man whos ultra-conservative agenda brought about the highest unimployment rate since 1941, created the economic plan, Reagonomics, which increased poverty putting a class of new poor on the streets which consisted of the homeless, unemployed workers and their families, cut the average American's purchasing power by $1000 amid during heavy inflation, made the level of business bankruptcies rise to despression-like levels, TRIPLED the national debt, not to mention the HUD scandals, savings and loans scandals, took money away from hospitals and education, and the Iran-Contra Affair, yet people still give him a 5 rating and claim he is the greatest president of the 20th century? Any person with a rational mind would look at his record and realize that this man was a complete failure as president.
