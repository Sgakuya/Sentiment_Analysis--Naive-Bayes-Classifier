This man is indisputably evil. He has been hanging around Washington influencing things for decades, and none of them for the better. This man posed for photographs with Saddam Hussein in the 80's as the envoy who endorsed the Iraqi leader's chemical and biological attacks on Iran, and then took part in the latest war on Iraq, a war which will go down in history as the single most cowardly campaign ever fought. This man is a psychopathic murderer who paraphrases Churchill, knowing damn well that the average American has no idea who Winston Churchill was (hint: he was the drunken lout whose only, ONLY asset was a good speaking voice) and thus taking credit for that man's witticisms. I cannot even express how much hatred I have for the Bush administration, and Rumsfeld is one of the higher ups in that regime. America should either rid themselves of men like this, or give up hope entirely.
