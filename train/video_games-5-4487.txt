Ok anyone who doesn't know a sim game must be from Mars.. but here is my play on these games. The first time I heard of the sims I was thinking what the heck I have enough trouble trying to control my own kids why would I want some virtual ones to boss around? It took me several years past the initial release of original sims to actually buy it, and then when I bought it, I got it. It's a lot of fun. It's really like having a doll house with living dolls inside and a house that can be expanded and changed at will. I think the actual building of the houses and furnishing is the best and most addictive part for me, and when you look out on the web there are so many sites designed just for custom content and quite a lot of free stuff, that you can never get done remodelling your sim's homes. If only it was this easy in real life... 2 clicks and your room is done with wallpaper,paint,brick anything you like. Most of it is unrealistic when you get to playing, like money is out of proportion I mean you can buy 1 pizza for 40 dollars but a house for 20k fully furnished, it doesn't really make sense and also time doesn't seem quite right, like a person gets up in the morning and it takes 3 hours to get ready for work.There really is no point to this game and there is no ending, it's just supposed to be fun, and this is what it is.It gets boring after a while but then you always manage to come back to it again. Especially when they put out new expansions, it just rejuvenates the game over again.
