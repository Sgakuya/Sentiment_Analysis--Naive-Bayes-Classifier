I recently went to Banana Republic and if it wasn't for a sweater I found on a sales rack, I wouldn't have found anything that I would want to purchase. And, it had nothing to do with prices (which were pretty high). I could have had $500 in cash to spend as I wanted, and all I could have found to purchase would have been the sweater, a pair of khakis and maybe a jacket. Maybe I'm a little too conservative, but all of the shirts and sweaters seemed way too cheesy. If Wiggum's characterization of shoppers is correct, I guess I'm still stuck in high school or college because I would rather shop at The Gap or Old Navy.
