Chriatina Ricci has a type of indefinible quality about her that makes one keep their eye on her no matter who she is on screen with. Could it be those big, haunted eyes, that rather wide, sloping forhead, or that bow-shaped mouth? Or could it be that it is so captivating to watch someone who emits so much intelligence grow before our eyes? True, she doesn't resemble the skeletal actresses we usually see in films today and has said before she was turned down for roles for being too plump (and she doesn't make any apologies or excuses for her beautiful shape); but when you get down to it, it's not that Christina is too plump it's that Hollywood and it's judgements are too thin! I gave Christina four stars because she is still growing as an actress and a person; but I just know that when her process is complete, she is going to be someone pretty amazing!
