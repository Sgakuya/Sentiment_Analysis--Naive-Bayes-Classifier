Movie wasn't bad. The best part of it was the sensuous beauty of Elizabeth Hurley. She's the kind of woman that you want to have handcuff you to a bed and work you over with a fury of feminine dominance. I think both men and women would enjoy that, and this movie gently taps into that area of sexual providence and appreciation. The story is overdone throughout literature and film, but when Hollywood needs a cheap tale as a foreground for Hurley's seducing eyes and enchanting body it will do. They need a movie where an actor like Ed Norton is trapped on a deserted island with her and Ashley Judd, that would be a good foreground. Hurley needs to play a super heroin, she's built right for it. The kind of woman that anyone would like a beating from.
