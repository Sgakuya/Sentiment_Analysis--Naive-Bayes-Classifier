I think Tony Dungy is somewhat underrated and should be given some credit for pulling the Tampa franchise out of its perpetual misery in the mid '90's. I have always had respect for Dungy in the manner in which he treats the players and in how he dealt with his firing after the 2001 season. He doesn't single out the players and belittle them in front of others, but addresses problems in a private forum in a much more tactful manner that most coaches. After Dungy was fired he didn't point fingers at his players or coaches for his teams poor performance in the playoffs but instead shouldered the blame himself. The sneaky, spineless, leprechaun owner Malcom Glazer was not straightforward with Dungy during the season and the rumor mill that Dungy was about to be fired at season's end was well known midway through the season. It's tough for a coach to perform under this type of scenario.
