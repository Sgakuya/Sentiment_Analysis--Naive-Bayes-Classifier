When I purchased a new 2001 Subaru Outback 3 years ago, I thought it was the perfect car for me. I like the way it handles, and I get good fuel economy. Unfortunately, the front driver's side window began to leak air in a noisy fashion, after owning the car for 6 months. Over the next 2 and a half years, both my dealer and representatives from Subaru of America have attempted to fix this problem no fewer than 12 (that's TWELVE!) times, without success. There have also been problems with the dashboard and tailgate that they were also unable to fix. Both this car and my wife's 1999 Forester rattle and squeak worse than a 15 year old pick-up truck. I simply would never buy another Subaru again.
