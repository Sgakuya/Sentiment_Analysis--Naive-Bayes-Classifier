The SJmr200 and the new SJmr220 are the smallest and lightest machines in their class. even when the new batch of LP minidisc recorders came out, the mr200 was still king in size and ergonomics [not to mention kickin' white/orange cholor scheme] photos do not do the mr200 justice! Now the mr220 is the smallest MD recorder on the market and also the one with the longest battery life! the design is not as good as the mr200 IMO, but the trackpad still beats jog-dials any day for ease of use. It's too bad that Pnasonic does not have the marketing musce of sony to brainwash the american masees :p ...not that sony's products aren't good, they are just way over rated!
