After years of C-band (dumping cable to get the big dish) it was finally time to make the move to Directv. I love C-band as it was definately my total freedom to watch what I wanted when I wanted! From east coast to west coast television became a new world of entertainment. C-band does have some limits for multiple viewers, like you your wife! Thus the big dish delima, he who controls the remote controls the show. Only one station at a time is possible without getting into detail! So, after enjoying the control of the remote for a number of years, my dear wife thought Directv (mulit rooms) was the only way to go! She has her receiver and remote and I mine! After just one week we both are enjoy watching what ever suits our individual fancy! She even has learned how to use her very own remote too! Best of all, she made the decision to switch rather that I. Thus, she can take all the credit for our being a Directv family!
