As perfect for the part of Melanie in Gone with the Wind as Gable and Leigh were as Rhett and Scarlett. Olivia de Havilland was a very good yet possibly somewhat underrated actress of her era. One of her best roles was as the vindictive spinster in the film The Heiress (1949) in which she was cast opposite Montgomery Clift. She did an excellent job making the transition from timid but hopeful wallflower to embittered emotionally scared old maid. Other memorable de Havilland films include The Snake Pit (1948), Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte (1964), and Lady in a Cage (1964). I also like her sister Joan Fontaine and thought she did a wonderful job in the title role of Jane Eyre .
