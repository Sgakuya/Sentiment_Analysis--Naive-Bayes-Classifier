I own a new HD READY Hitachi 46 Rear Projection TV. The size is smaller than most projection tv's and the picture is just awesome. I have not connected to a set top HDTV decoder yet but just regular broadcasts are great. DVD is wonderful using componet hook up. You can also easily hook up your home theatre or stereo system easily. I bought my TV from Circuit City, the model is brand new and can be set on a stand or just on the floor as I have it in my home now. I paid only $1999 for this tv and with all the features I felt it was an exceptional picture and a very good price and is ready for future tv broadcasts. You won't be disappointed with the quality and price from this particular set. If you want an entry level projection tv and the others just look to big for your home or living room, you will get a nice size clear picture without breaking the bank to buy it. Go for it, you will not regret buying this wonderful TV.
