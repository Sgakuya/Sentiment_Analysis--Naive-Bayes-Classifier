03 ram 1500 quad cab. My first new truck always drove used honda accords. I have 10,000 miles on it and the rotors are warped. I took it back to the dealer b/c the brakes are covered up to 12,000 miles. The dealer would not replace the rotors they would only cut them. I asked the moron if he thought that was normal to for rotors to warp at only 10k miles. The moron had a comment for every question I asked. He said it was caused by having heavy loads in the bed, i informed him that i haven't put anything in the bed as of yet. He then responded that they were warped b/c we live in a hilly area. So I say to myself did I BUY a TOUGH american truck or some sissy truck. I then asked the moron if the rotors warped again after they cut them at say 15 or 20k miles would new ones be covered under warranty he said no. I then said to the moron do you think maybe there might be a defect with the rotors if it happens again and he said it wouldn't be covered. I don't know of any car that I have ever driven in the hilly area I live in to have a problem with the rotors. Chalk one up for the good old American Car Companies. I will be dumping this truck and go back to the Japs NISSAN TITAN!!!
