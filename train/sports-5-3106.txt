While one of the most unsavory of personalities in the history of baseball, Ty Cobb should always be remembered and recognized as one of the absolute greatest to ever play the game. His competitive nature was arguably the fiercest of any professional athlete, and some have questioned whether the number of stolen bases he had were a result of talent or from the fear he instilled into rival teams from his incredibly dangerous spikes-up slides (which were known to injure more than a few players). Regardless, what can never be questioned is the impact and audience he brought to the game of baseball, and the achievements (statistics) he did earn must be honored and forever respected.
