The start of America in the NE- State with much variety. Boston a most famous city, with much to offer. Cape Cod with its beach's and villages. Great schools and a progressive spirit that is the best of America. A hgh quality state which much for visitor, and newcomer alike. Some complaints here about the high costs of housing in especially eastern Mass. Well NYC and envirions are costly, as is coastal California. So why complain? Mass. by the way is among the top five states for quaility of life for children- and it has a pro envirionmental record that would make most other states feel crummy. It also has one of the highest per capita incomes in the nation. Most towns have excellent educational systems, good police and fire protection and clean highways! There must be some reason why this much maligned state rates in the top 10 - while most states of the south and elswhere are rated so low. Get a life and quit complaining.
