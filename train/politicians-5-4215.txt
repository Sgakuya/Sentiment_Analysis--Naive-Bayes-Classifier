WHY IS A VOTE FOR RALPH NADER A VOTE FOR BUSH? I THINK IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF VOTING FOR THE BEST MAN AND NOT VOTING ONE OF THE TWO MAIN PARTYS. SOME ASK WHERE NADER STANDS ON KEY ISSUES, WELL MAYBE IF BUSH AND GORE WASN'T SO AFRAID OF NADER THEY WOULD OF INVITED HIM TO THE DEBATES. IF ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEIR VOTE WOULD BE CANCELLED OUT IF THEY VOTED FOR NADER ACTUALLY VOTED FOR HIM HE MIGHT STAND A CHANCE. I AM NOT VOTING FOR EITHER ONE OF THE WORST EVILS, I AM VOTING FOR RALPH NADER, AND MY VOTE FOR NADER IS NOT A VOTE FOR BUSH, IT IS ONE VOTE FOR NADER THAT BUSH OR GORE WILL NOT GET. WAKE UP AMERICA, WE HAVE HAD THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS IN OFFICE FOR WAY TO LONG.
