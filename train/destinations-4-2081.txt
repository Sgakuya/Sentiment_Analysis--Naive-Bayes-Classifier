Despite the fact that it is a very polluted country, Egypt is one of the most interesting destinations in the world for travelers. It is slightly unsettled because of the fundamentalist element of the politics of Egypt, but I still think that the country is worth visiting. Cairo is a fascinating city; the Egyptian Museum, which displays King Tut's treasures, is interesting. Outside of Cairo; Giza is very interesting, the Spinx is well worth seeing. Visit the Pyramids in the area, I guarantee they will be one of the greatest things you will ever see. Take a cruise down the Nile River through Aswan and Luxor. You will get a feel for this ancient civilization that way and it is very scenic and relaxing as well. Overall, a very interesting place to go.
