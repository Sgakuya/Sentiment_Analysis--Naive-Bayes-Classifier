I actually enjoyed American Pie 2. I thought it was definitely amusing, and it was one of those movies you went in with low expectations and were pleasantly surprised. Unlike a lot of other sequels, this one was just as good or better than the first. They used a lot of new jokes instead of just redoing the popular ones from the first movie, like some other movies out there (*cough*Austin Powers 2*cough*). While it's not Oscar quality by any means, it's definitely worth seeing if you enjoy the type of movie. If you go in expecting sophisticated humor and an excellent plot, then you're going to be disappointed for sure. But if you expect it to be the fun, silly movie it tries to be, you'll find it does the job well.
