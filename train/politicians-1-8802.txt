I'll try to be brief. Clinton was not impeached because he got a blow job in the Oval Office. Try to pay attention. He lied, under oath, to a Special Prosecutor, appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno, investigating his conduct as Governor of Arkansas in a sexual harassment lawsuit, among many other questionably legal activities during his presidency and before. The primary law enforcement officer of the United States lied under oath to escape a guilty verdict while a sitting President. It's not about sex, it's about perjury! Stacey and middlefinger, you don't miss Bill as much as does Osama, who built his terrorist empire, seizing control of Afghanistan, travelling the world freely, planning all sorts of attacks against the US, including an attempt in 1993 to raze the World Trade Center, and statements after to the effect we'll just have to try again, under Bill Clinton's distracted watch. We knew about OBL in 1986, Oliver North called him the most dangerous man in the world then, Clinton had several chances to apprehend him, and passed because the polls indicated it wouldn't make him more popular. All other attacks against the US went unanswered and OBL got the message, he could hit the US and we would not retaliate. One thing went wrong: term limits. So pine for this lying incompetent all you want, America found its spine again when he left office. Osama is still free, darting from cave to cave, content to send the US voters videotapes. It's only a matter of time for him. But Bill Clinton's law-enforcement issue approach to anti-terrorism strategy cost us 3,000 innocent lives one day not long ago. We really need him back.
