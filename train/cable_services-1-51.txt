Hmm, Comcast is at the bottom of the ratings. I wonder why? If I could have a dish where I live I would get it in a second. Their cable service sucks. Picture quality is very lacking, their programming guide stinks and I have to pay an extra $5 a month to get the special cable box for HD channels. What a rip-off. The way they package their channels in tiers is aggravating because they put similar channels in different tiers so you have to pay more to get the channels you want. Then you will find one day that they have changed the tiers around and you no longer get some of the channels you like, but if you pay more for an additional tier you can get it back. Avoid them if possible.
