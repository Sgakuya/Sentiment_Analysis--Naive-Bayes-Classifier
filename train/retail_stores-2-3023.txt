I order twice through them. First time I order a ring, a very pretty looking. Wait two weeks until it become available and received three of four day later. They did send me e-mail and shiiping was free. What I found out and specifically asked for is the ring sizing. I order 7 1/2 and asked them if they do proper sizing. The sale person assure me they do. Sure enough, I went to my local jeweler and it was 7 1/4. Liars! Second purchase was the same style earring. I order them to match my ring and have them as a Chrsitmas present. I order on Dec. 10, sales person said they will be available in 10 days or sooner. No e-mails, no follow-ups. I call after 10 days was over and they said it would be avaliable tomorro - on 21st and I will get them in time for Christmas. On 24th I call them again and they said earring were not available. I asked why do they tell me they were and I expect them , the sales person reply:"C'mon, it is not the only your Cristmas gift." I call on 27th and they were not available. It took them 3 weeks before shipping them and 6 days to do 2nd day air. Earring come with bent back and stones had gaps between them. So I call again and nobody say sorry, no follow-up, no e-mails. I return earring, get my refund and I'll never shop here again. I would not recommend, not a friendly company, not keeping promises and lying to customers.
