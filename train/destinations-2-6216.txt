I've stayed in Georgia with my uncle almost every summer of my teenage life and I still vist pretty freqently, so I know it pretty well. I'll try to be fair... The Good: (1)Great food! I put on so much weight every time I go to Geogia. (2)A lot of southern hospitality, probably more than you'll find in any other southern state.(3)Atlanta is pretty cool if you don't mind the traffic and crowds. The Bad: (1)Bugs! Bugs everywhere! (Huge too!) I discovered insects I never knew existed when I stayed in Georgia. (2)It's hot as hell in the summer! You could almost faint on the way from your house to your car! (3)The people. Not ALL of them, but MANY of them. Sometimes when I talked to them, I felt like I was back in the 1940s. I guess because I'm white, they felt it was ok to use racial slurs and say derogatory remarks about hispanics, blacks and asians around me. It wasn't. There are even a few small towns, where everyone on the block are a part of (or support) the KKK. It's really scary to me. I can't imagine how scary it must be for minorities. (4) If you don't have a southern acent expect some funny looks when you open your mouth in any store or social area. I got a lot of those... All in all, Geogia is ok. They still have a long way to go, but it's still A LOT better than some southern states like Mississippi or South Carloina. Save travels...=)
