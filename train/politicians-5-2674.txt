As a Canadian - your biggest trading partner and next door neighbour- and, as a former Prime Minister put it, a mouse sleeping with an elephant - we watch your politics closely. I think that the Senator is the best chance that you have to break the Republican Party away from the religious right extremists who captured control under Reagan. Plus he is a real hero, a tough man who stood by his fellow prisoners - and he speaks honestly and openly. This is a great opportunity for all Americans to elect a man who has fortitude, honesty, bravery, and a real love for his country. He is not one of rich generations politicians, not a Kennedy, a Bush, a Gore. He reminds me of a more militant Harry Truman, and a man cast in the mold of great Republican presidents - Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.
