System Of A Down is one of the most innovating and original bands out there. This video just proves how cool they are. I like it when bands invite their fans to come do music videos with them (I myself was to come and do the music video. I recieved a call from a lady who was working with the band and the video and she gave me instructions on how to get to the shoot.) It conveys a sense of appreciation and gratitude for the fans. The video is also really awesome to watch...the special effects are really cool. I love the shots of Serj scarfing down Chinese food with all the fans behind him eating along with him (for some reason he looks really adorable during those parts), and the shots of the band on stage are really tight too. The band is crazy as ever (you gotta love Shavo and Daron when they get on stage and just go wild on the bass and guitar) and I am so glad they are here to share their music with the world...I know their latest CD came out just a month ago, but I already can't wait for thier next one. System, I love ya!
