I've never lived here, and frankly, never much wanted to, but I have visited a score of times on business and pleasure. I like the place. It may be, like someone once said, 20 suburbs in search of a city. But it is also vibrant and alive and interesting in a way that many big cities are not. I'll take the word of Enkidu, who's comments are listed below, as some evidence of my feelings for the place. I have no doubt that it can be a hellhole. I've seen some ugly stuff there. But you can get that in any city, all of it and more. I don't think LA is paradise on earth. Far from it, but it is equally far from the demonizing I see going on here.
