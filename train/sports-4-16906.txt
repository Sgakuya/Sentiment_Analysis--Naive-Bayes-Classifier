I'm going to come to Chauncey's defense on this one. He wrote his comment in September, before the season got underway. He was not alone with his opinion - many football experts predicted that the Patriots would not even make the playoffs this past year. Secondly, when the Patriots won the Super Bowl 2 seasons ago Chauncey's right when he said that they had an easy schedule because they were a weak team the season before. Granted, any wild card that wins a Super Bowl has to really come together in the playoffs and the quarterback must prove to be a leader, however they weren't a powerhouse division winner like the Cowboys or 49'ers of the nineties. These teams each put together some solid seasons even though they had the toughest schedules in the league. Lastly I think Brady is one of the better quarterbacks in the league but not the best - Co-MVP's McNair and Manning are more talented and explosive.
