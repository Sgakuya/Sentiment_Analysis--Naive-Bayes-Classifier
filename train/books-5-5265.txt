I read The Joy Luck Club when it was published over 10 years ago, and then I listened to the story again on tape this week. It's an amazing accomplishment by Amy Tan. The book is based on the lives of four Chinese women and their grown daughters living in San Francisco. It alternates between stories of the mothers' lives in China and the daughters' lives growing up in the United States and the challenges they face dealing as adults with their mothers. I got a real sense of what life was like in China for women in the '30s and '40s, which was interesting, and I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship theme. The book flowed easily and was hard to put down. If you haven't read The Joy Luck Club, I highly recommend it. The movie is great, too.
