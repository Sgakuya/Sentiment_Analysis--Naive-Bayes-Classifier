Minnesota is one of the most underrated schools in the nation. It's ranked as one of the top 1-3 public research universities in the nation. One of the Top 20 Public Univs by US News & has some VERY highly regarded & rated Grad & PhD programs. The Twin Cities is a great place, with tons of stuff to do, even when its cold as heck out(this is when you kick butt on your academics). Anything other than an ocean or mountains, you can find in the Twin Cities, basically. As far as athletics go, no school is as good in both the big time sports, AND the minor sports, both mens and womens, as is Minnesota. Well, Stanford, Texas and Michigan are probably better, but not for long. UMN's on its way up, and fast. Academics, research are improving, and have been for at least a good decade. Athletics were not that great a decade ago, now UMN ranks among the TOP TEN Best Sports Schools according to Sports Illustrated. And its not just Hockey, Wrestling and Golf, but Womens BB & VB, Football and Baseball, and Mens BB will be on its fast road to recovery starting next year(2004-05), so the Barn will be rocking again. All the littler sports are also thriving at UMN. Little known accomplishments, UMN's Cheer Team won a Natl Title and it's Dance Team has won 2 Straight Natl Titles. UMN won the Moot-Court Natl Title, the Ag Quiz Bowl Natl Title, the Food Science College Bowl Natl Title and has had the nations top Solar Race Car program for the last decade. They just finished up raising the 2nd largest fundraising amount ever for a public university & plans are in motion for an on campus Football Stadium, so all is right on the Gopher Front!!! If you are a prospective college student, come join in & share the experience of being a part of a university thats moving on up!!! It's been a fun ride for me so far, & I look forward to the continual climb.
