Best Buy is the ultimate electronic store. They are #1 on the lowest prices for cds. MOst of their other products are the cheapest in price as well. Every product that I have ever bought from there has been quality (computers, printers, games, dvds and dvd players, vcrs, stereo systems, etc.) I have never had a problem with a faulty product. The only problem I have with Best Buy is the fact that they only open about 2 to 3 of the 14 cash registers they have available. This situation creats a 15 to 25 minutes of waiting just to buy a lousy cd. Either each store has to hire a couple more people or get some of their workers to the registers. Other than that negative, the store is great.
