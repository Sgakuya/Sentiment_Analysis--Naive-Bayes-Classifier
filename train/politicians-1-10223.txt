If there's one thing I've learned about politicians, its that often you can find some damning evidence by examining what they accusations they use on their opponents. For example, Bush accuses Kerry of flip-flopping on issues. As a disclaimer, I do not argue that Kerry hasn't changed his mind on some issues (not counting gross distortions by the Bush campaign about votes on omnibus spending bills and tax increases). However, let's look at Bush's record of flip-flops: 1) Opposed the creation of the Dept. of Homeland Security, now supports it 2) Opposed 9/11 commission, now claims to support 3) Opposed nation-building with military, now has 2 intense operations 4) Opposes large federal government, then expands government at near record rates 5) Claims to be a fiscal conservative, then racks up the deficit at record rates, now approx. $650 billion for 2004 (yes, $650 *billion* - social security surpluses should never count. I'll be the first to say that Clinton's admin. only pulled a surplus in 2 years, at $3 and $88 billion, approximately.) He can't blame this on the Democratic Party, with the Republicans in control in both the House and Senate. And he does have a veto, if he'd ever use it. Now, I personally believe that keeping an open mind and realizing that you can change your opinion can be a sign of strength, so long as that change is well-reasoned. Some of these changes Bush has made are understandable, some aren't. One thing that irks me, though, is his refusal to admit that he has ever been wrong on anything. This is but one of many reasons why I believe that Bush, despite his best efforts to try to fool us otherwise, is a man of weak convictions. Another: He has imposed restrictions on federal spending on embryonic stem cell research beyond previously existing lines. The logic behind some of this I believe is sound, as I agree that life starts at conception and abortion is a brutal, barbaric practice. However, there is a duplicity going on here that bothers me. There are two potential sources of embryonic stem cells that should be less objectionable that would open up the possibility to more potentially life-saving research: 1) ectopic pregnancies. There is nothing medically that can possibly be done to save these pregnancies, and removal of the embryo growing in the fallopian tubes is medically necessary. Hence you would not be creating life with the sole purpose to destroy it. Rather, you'd be working to save one life (the mother), while allowing for research that might save others, all at the expense of an embryo that was positively not viable. 2) Fertility clinics. As long as we have laws on the books that Bush apparently has no problems with which require the destruction of embryos after 5 years, we could have another source of stem cells. Those two alone could account for hundreds of thousands of new lines of stem cells. 19 won't cut it. Therefore, even though I agree with Bush in principle on a few issues (abortion, gay marriage, Afghanistan), I find him to be a man lacking in integrity who is serving only to drive this nation into obscene levels of debt while antagonizing the majority of the world and helping to create more terrorists than his policies are eliminating. Does this mean I think John Kerry will be a good president? No. But I can't see how we can get worse.
