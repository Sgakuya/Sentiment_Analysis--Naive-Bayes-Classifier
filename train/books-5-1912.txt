This is the highest rating I can give???!!! This is my favorite comic strip, and I read it almost religiously, or non-religiously, so to speak. Today's Doonesbury was one of the funniest comics I ever saw (if you haven't read it, read it now!). The ones making fun of Big Tobacco are so mercilessly satirical that it's cute. The plays on Hannity Colmes are amusing, and possibly my favorites are the ones making fun of Dubya. The ones with Boopsie trying to get on that foolish TV show Survivor were really good. Garry Trudeau is one of the funniest liberals I have ever read the work of, and I hope Doonesbury is around for a long time. Take care, everyone!
