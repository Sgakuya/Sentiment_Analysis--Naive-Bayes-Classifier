After 4 years of being their customer we had a car theft. they took all info with no problems then it all went to HELL!! the company launched their so called (INVESTIGATION) from the begining the so caled investigator began interviewing members of our family as if it were a criminal investigation then after aprox 3 months the claims adjuster who you could never get a hold of called and said the claim was denied. later we found out they never had any intensions of investigating the theft but to construct probable doughts the local police report stated that the claims manager had spoken with police investigatos expressing their crooked wiews. needdless to say we had no trouble obtaining legal help lawsuit pending. if you were like us esuranse looks like a good deal but you will regrett doing bussiness with these people.
