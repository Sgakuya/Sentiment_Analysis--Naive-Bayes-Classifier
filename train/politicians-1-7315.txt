How can this person call himself a reverend? I hear nothing out of him except racism. He stirs up trouble everywhere he goes. He thinks the answer to everything is to march. How can his followers be so stupid? They believe everything this person says and they live by it. I want to know what business he had coming to Florida to stir up trouble at the site of confusion during the presidential elections. Why is our government so scared to tell him to shut up and sit down for a change. They continue to help him in any way they can and they stick around to clean up the streets after he leads a march,as was the case here in Tallahassee this past summer. They claim they want equal rights. Well,somebody should tell them that they've had equal rights and more for quite a while. They will not be happy until a black is in charge of every department of any workplace and until they rule this country. How far will our government let this go? We get accused of being racists when we speak up for our own race but national TV gives them the opportunity to speak out on how important their race is. This country is going to hell very quickly and all we have to do is take a look around and see WHY! I am very proud to be a white man and I don't consider myself a racist because of that. Of course,to them,I'm a white BOY! To them,there is no such thing as a white MAN and there is no such thing as a black racist. Yeah,right! It's time for us whites to stand up and be proud and make the Afric Unamericans EARN what they get. Let's quit handing it to them just because of their color!
