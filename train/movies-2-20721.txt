One of the most overrated pictures of all time. A bland and flimsy retelling of the second-rate GB Shaw chestnut, featuring two non-singers in the lead roles. That's two strikes against you right off the bat. The score is ho-hum, the plot ludicrous, the acting only passable, and I can't remember the dancing in this film as it was positively unmemorable. Anytime you have your leads talking through their songs (or having Marnie Nixon ghost-singing your part for you), you don't have a musical: you have Recitation Hour with Wallpaper Music attached. Rex Harrison always looks like he's about to pass gas, or just did. And Audrey Hepburn is about as appealling, convincing and attractive as Newt Gingrich. The production values of this big-budget flick are quite good, however, if the art direction and costume design are carrying the show, you don't have much of a show.
