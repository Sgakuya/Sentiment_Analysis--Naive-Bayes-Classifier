A hard living hard drinking classically trained actor who added his unique touch to every role he played. This may come as a surprise to some but my favorite performance by Burton was not in any of his films, but his appearance on the Tonight Show when it was hosted by Jack Paar. Burton told a story that in 1953 when he was playing Hamlet on stage, Winston Churchill attended a performance and seated himself in the front row. Churchill, who was a lover of Shakespeare, knew the play by heart and whenever Burton would speak he could hear the echo of Churchill's growl as he mouthed the same lines. Burton tried speeding up the pace but Churchill followed suit. When he slowed his delivery, so did Churchill. Finally Burton tried omitting entire sentences and when he did Churchill roared in protest from the front row. Burton's imitation of Churchill on Paar's show is one of television's classic moments and can often be seen on programs that chronicle Jack Paar or the history of the Tonight show. Whether you are a fan of Churchill or Burton, his rendition of the story and imitation will bring tears of laughter. After the first act, Burton thought that Churchill had left the theater only to find him knocking on his dressing room door and asking Prince Hamlet, may I use your lavatory? (To pee or not to pee..... that was the question) It must have been a wonderful moment in time for the rest of the audience to have two men of such high stature both performing Hamlet at the same time.
