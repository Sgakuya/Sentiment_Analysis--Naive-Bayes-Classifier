I would never finish listing all the beautiful towns, beaches, and cities in Mexico. I love Mexico for it's rich culture and history, especially the hundreds of indigenous cultures in Mexico. I respect the perseverance of the indigenous in maintaining their traditions and ways of life, I think that is the best part of Mexico. For the rest, I can say that since the early 90's, Mexico has already started to be Americanized with Blockbusters, AMC theaters, U.S. brands, and other commercial trends. I don't mind bringing better technology into Mexico, but I know that national small business in Mexico will have the hardest time to keep up with U.S. firms. At the same time, for the consumer is better to bring a competitive environment for any market. But, what to do when only 2-3% of Mexicans have enough capital to compete with U.S. firms. Well, the lesson to be learned here is that Mexico LOVES TOURIST. Of course, LIKE IN ANY BIG CITY AROUND THE WORLD, you have be cautious with your personal belongings. But, please do not exaggerate or give a bad reputation to Mexico. I hope that in your next trip, after arriving to your destination, you can hear through the airline speakers WELCOME to MEXICO!!!
