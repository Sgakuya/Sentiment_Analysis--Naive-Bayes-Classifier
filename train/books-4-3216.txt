Possibly the best book Stephen King has written. Actually, it's not a book - it's a collection...but all are sung with that same familiar voice, a constant tone throughout each of these tales that makes this collection impossible to put down (especially late at night, when you've got exams or The Big Meeting the next day!). This is Stephen King's first collection of short stories, written during those years when his mind was exploding with bright, new, impossible ideas. During these early years, Stephen Edwin King could not only tell you about a monster in the closet, but he could actually make you beg to hear more about that monster. You will encounter serial killers, vampires, the end of the world, plague, zombies, and more. The most terrible thing about it? You will completely enjoy being afraid. During the early years (such as in Night Shift), King didn't just tell you the story, my friends. He SANG it to you. Of course, this is a King novel - so you're bound to see the word nigger or other racial slurs throughout; which is why I cannot give this book an excellent rating.
