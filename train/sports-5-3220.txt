Besides Stan Musial, Henry Aaron is the most underrated baseball player that ever lived. If you take a good look at his career you'll notice that Aaron could do it all. He hit for average, hit for power, he could field, he could throw, and he could run the bases. And obviously I shouldn't have to mention that he broke the all time home run record. Aaron was without a doubt the greatest right handed power hitter that ever lived, and definitely one of the ten greatest players to ever live, but probably in the top five. Yet despite his accomplishments, Aaron some times doesn't get the credit he's due. The fact of the matter is that people still resent him for breaking Babe Ruth's home run record. Let's be honest here, because Aaron played the vast majority of his career in obscurity (Milwaukee and Atlanta), and he didn't play in New York, he wasn't a beloved baseball icon. Alot of people had (and still have a problem) with somebody whose not a beloved icon, breaking the most cherished record in sports, of the most cherished man in the history of the game. If somebody was going to break the Babe's record it had to be somebody who was also a beloved icon (ie: somebody who played in New York). I personally believe that all the people that writes that Hank Aaron is not one of the ten greatest baseball players ever, are the ones that are offended that he broke Babe Ruth's record or the fact that Willie Mays or Mickey Mantle or any other player who you looked up to didn't break the record. The fact of the matter is that Aaron broke the record, and saying that he doesn't rank up there with Ruth or Mays for not hitting 50 homers in a season is just petty in my opinion. Hank Aaron's accomplishment is too many for me to list, and he probably has the most decorated career in baseball history.
