Racist your are bright you are not. Stupidity and racism abound in your comments. Dean Smith was much more than a basketball coach he help Black People in so many ways. He was the first to to Blacks on a ACC roster. You guys are ignorant of the facts. He has done more for blacks than Coach K a (republican)and his black uncle Tom players ever did. You racists white people make me sick. Grow up, sports are more than just sports. Your ignorance and racism come through in what you post about a true American Dean Smith. He has done more for Black Americans than the other ten winningst coaches in college basketbal and he is a true man of God.
