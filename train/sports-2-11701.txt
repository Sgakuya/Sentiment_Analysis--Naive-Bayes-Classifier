He had some success in DII; but his Owls have been perennial doormats since taking the helm back in 2000. After watching the 44-14 debacle against Virginia (where UVA fans outnumbered Temple fans by 10 to 1 -- EVEN THOUGH TEMPLE WAS HOME!!!!), Temple has maybe 2 (3 at most) winnable games in 2004. Their offense looks so out of sync. I never seen a team run the bowl time-after-time out of the shotgun. The defense missed tackles by the boatload. Temple is so bad, they are getting kicked out of the Big East after this season. Where will they go? No one knows. If Temple still desires to compete as a division I-A team, they need a coach who can keep some of the Philly High School from going to other schools. Bobby Wallace must go.
