This is my hometown, actually, as it is to many of the oher raters of this subject. Many parts of this town, I do not like, but most of it I do. I don't really know how to describe it, when you just go down the aveny with the tram, I get this sparkly feeling inside of me. Is it joy, or is it love? Well, geeze, I don't know. Maybe I'm just proud. Proud to be a citizen of this beautiful wes coast city. And why chouldn't I? It's a great twn, some great people live here to. My family, my friends, my enemies. Just the way home should be like. That's why Sweden will alway be THE country for me, and Gothenburg THE city for me. I don't know anythng else that could complete this rating, but to say---- It's Great!
