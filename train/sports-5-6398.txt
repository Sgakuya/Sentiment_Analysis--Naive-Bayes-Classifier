I've been following Villanova basketball for a long time, and the 2005-06 team is the best Nova squad that I have ever seen. By a lot. I finally got a chance to see them live in their Big Five showdown against 7-0 Lasalle the other night. Nova won by forty. Everything starts with their guards - Allen Ray and Randy Foye have legitimite NBA caliber one-on-one games, Mike Nardi is a deadly three point shooter and quality ball handler, and before Kyle Lowry is through at Nova, he may be remembered as the best of the bunch. There's not a team in America that can slow down this backcourt - a team trying to defend this group will just have to hope that all four get cold at the same time. Villanova's underrated bigs are long and athletic - Jason Frasier is as healthy as he's ever been and is a big time shot blocker. Will Sheridan is an athletic 6'9" and can run the floor and defend. And freshman Dante Cunningham may be the best athlete on the team. Throw top 25 recruit Shane Clark into this mix, and this frontcourt should be able to hold their own against anyone. The difference between this Nova team and other top teams that I've seen this year (with the possible exception of Duke), is the intensity with which they defend. They pressure full court, they never take possessions of, and despite almost always having superior talent, they simply outwork the other team. This team is flat out scary, and I really hope to see a Duke / Nova showdown come March. With UCONN and Louisville on the schedule twice each, Nova should be battle ready come tournament time. I think they're going to win the whole thing this year.
