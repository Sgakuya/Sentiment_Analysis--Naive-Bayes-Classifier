What an fascinating place this is. Sure it's crowded, but there's a reason it draws so many tourists. Nowhere else in the world can you see such a unique concentration of thermal events - geysers, hot springs, bubbling pools of colored mud... In the early 1800s, before settlers knew about Yellowstone, a fur trapper (John Colter, I think), was attacked by indians, and he escaped by running for two days straight through the area that now makes up this national park. When he finally stumbled across a U.S. outpost, he was naked, barely alive, and rambling about a place where steam shot up from the ground and mud boiled in the earth. The soldiers at the outpost thought Colter was nuts, so they called this imaginary place Colter's Hell. Turns out Colter was just describing an area so amazing it sounds completely crazy. I camped in Yellowstone for two nights and wished I could have stayed another week or two.
