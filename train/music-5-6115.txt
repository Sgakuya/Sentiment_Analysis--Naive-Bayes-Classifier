Granted, Type O' Negative are not detailed perfectionists (far from it). Despite that fact, the band is able to create dark and powerful music that is interesting and fun to listen. You get all from them (from huge, meaningful epics to outright silly two to three minute diddies). This album is dedicated to those who have ever loved anyone, and had their heart unanthestically torn out (as it states on the linear notes). We have all been there, and everyone can relate to the lyrics in the serious subject matter (Bloody Kisses, Too Late....Frozen, and Blood and Fire). Like I said though fuuny stuff in there as well (Kill All The White People (four white brooklyn man singing those lines just screams irony), and the great epic Black No. 1 ...Little Miss Scare All). To top it all off, the album includes the best version of Summer Breeze I have ever heard. You may feel guilty doing so, but it's an album that will be loved from any rock fan or anyone who knows that the world does not always shine bright. No Hope = No Fear.
