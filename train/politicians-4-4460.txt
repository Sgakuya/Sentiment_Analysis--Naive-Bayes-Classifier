Alan Keyes is certainly the articulate one. In fact, I haven't seen too many politicians who can think on their feet like Keyes can. Not only that, but he can express his ideas passionately. The only thing is that he isn't a vote getter; simply put, he's more of a commentator than a politician. All the campaigns he's run have been utter disasters; he's the type who doesn't care about the nitty-gritty of politics. He doesn't court supporters, either support me and my ideas or leave is his motto. It's quite a shame because he has the personality to mobilize people. He's a bit too conservative for me on some issues, but there's potential here if he wants to use it.
