Went with my friend on a Saturday night. Definately not the place to go for a quiet dinner. After crowding into the entryway we were herded to what obviously was the family section. We literally had to scream over yelling kids to get our voices heard. I love kids, but I do not want to dine with them on a Saturday night, it was like being at Chucky Cheese !! The too long monolouge by the waiter and the writing of his name on the tablecloth is way too cheesy. By the way, we never saw him again after he took our order. Best part of the night was the bread, the salad was too sweet. Of course I knew what to expect from the entree, the same glumpy processed pasta you receive at all the franchise places, Olive Garden etc. I would spend a little more to eat at an authentic Italian restaurant, that is if there were any left. The city where I live chain dining establishments have taken over.
