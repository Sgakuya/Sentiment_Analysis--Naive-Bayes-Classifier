I think that Dean Smith is one of hte greatest coaches of all time, and I am a die-hard duke fan. I don't think anyone can deny it. But do i think he's the best no. Hes top 5 but not 1 in my opinion. UPDATE to lazyland i'm the entry below you, and thus is your comment about class vs nastyness targeted at me, bc there was nothing nasty about my comment, but the coach k ratings in both current and all time have nasty unc fans saying he has a big nose and suxXXX and he looks like a pervert etc. So i dont think you can classify all unc fans as classy, or all duke fans as nasty, both groups have some pretty classless people.
