This store like most Electronic stores is full of cashiers and workers who know NOTHING about the product you are looking for. Usually you have to search for someone for minutes to even get help, and everything is generally very overpriced. I will say there was a time that Best Buy had great deals on computers in general, but now they are getting just as bad as the rest of the stores. But like I said, the customer service is the worst, but that is the scenario in most stores nowadays, regardless of what they are selling. It kinda sucks to be honest. But I guess these people get paid really poorly. So I can't blame them.
