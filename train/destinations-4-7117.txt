Great place, not as much fun as Naples, but has a charm of it's own. Very historic and it part of the unknown other Norman conquest. People forget that at the time of 1066 other distant cousins of William the Conqueror travelled to Southern Italy (Apulia) and stayed on (so to speak). Robert Guiscard moved on and his sons move on to Sicily. The capital became Palermo and you can visit some of their tombs in the Dormo there. Very interesting place. The Normans are basically newcomers to a very old place. An interesting place. Don't miss Monreal outside of Palermo. In Palermo there is the Cathedral, the Palace of the Kings and the catacombs. Highly recommended.
