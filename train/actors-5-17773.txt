Rebecca Herbst(Elizabeth, GH) is my favorite actress in daytime. Her debth and focus in her scenes is clearly seen, all of the time. The chemistry that she has/had with Steve Burton(Jason, GH), Maurice Bernard(Sonny, GH), Jonaton Jackson(Ex-Ex-Lucky, GH), etc is amazing! I loved the friendship/love between Elizabeth and Jason and cannot wait for them to rekindle that. I also, adore her scenes with Maurice because they bring so much more to each others characters. Like when Sonny was grieving for his lost child, who was there for him? And when Elizabeth thought Lucky was dead, who was there for her when she fell to the ground outside Lucky's burning home? I wish Becky would get the opportunity to have more scenes with these 2 men. Don't get me wrong, Rick Hearst(Ric, GH) is another awesome actor, but, in my opinion, Rebecca Herbst shines way more when she's in scenes with Steve and Mo. And for those of you who are actually saying that she's a horrible actress, I'm sorry, but what show are YOU watching? Cause all I see is class. Something that people who come in here and start to bad mouth the actors and actresses here who work so hard, obviously don't have! JMO
