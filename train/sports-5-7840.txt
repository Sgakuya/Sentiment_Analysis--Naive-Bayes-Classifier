Of all the Canadian big men in the NBA, Todd MacCulloch (you might know him simply as Big Mac or Big Mac Attack ) is among the most feared. He has feathery soft hands but still manages to bang with the biggest of the big boys deep in the paint. 2nd chance shots? Big Mac's all over that. Deceptively slow foot-speed and a lumbering yet somehow effective baby hook? Now you're speaking the Mack Attack's language. Todd Mack and Keith Van Horn are excellent additions to an already excellent Philadelphia team this season. Todd just give me the ball MacCulloch could very well be the beginning of a very looooong 76er dynasty.
