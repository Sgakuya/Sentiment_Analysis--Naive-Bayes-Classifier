Wachovia's policy on overdrafts is quite simple--and predatory. They resort all transactions each evening from highest debit to lowest. They generally pay an overdraft limit up to $500 or $1000 on established accounts. They charge $30 for overdrafts and NSF alike. Also, in the case of reported check card fraud, they will not replace funds until you return a document they mail to you, guaranteeing these funds are out of your account for at least 5 business days after you notice the incorrect debit. You eat any fees incurred in the meantime. Note: you can't seem to get them to sort your transactions from lowest to highest (because they feel your largest transactions are the most important to you), but you can force them to set your overdraft limit to 0, which may cause a large transaction to bounce but allow following smaller transactions to clear without incurring fees.
