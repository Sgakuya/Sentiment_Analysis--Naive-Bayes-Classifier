walmart. its gone too far! there are leaving every store around them out of business and there prices are so low because they buy cheap crap made in CHINA!! I am proud to say that I have only shopped at walmart a couple of times. the amount of people that shop there is disguising! dont they know what they are doing when they shop there?! there supporting the world's biggest retailer and forcing more of the chinese to be forced into working at a slave shop! and dont even get me started with the lack of parking space! so many people shop at this place that we had to park along the street for a parking space!! people, people something has to be done before walmart is the only standing store left in the nation!!!!
