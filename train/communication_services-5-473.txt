First of all let me just say its rare that I will award five stars to any business. I've been a customer for about two years after about a month with Sprint PCS (awful experience). In the two years that I've been an Alltel customer I have been incorrectly billed only once. I was overcharged $10. When I found out I immediately called and I was credited the $10 in the next bill. The customer service reps are very helpful and give you their ID# and call verification #. You don't have to ask for it. How many other businesses do that? The answer is very few. Signal is usually good no matter where I travel...and no, I don't work for Alltel.
