You people should all do your poor Freak a big favor and go listen to Paul Simon's Graceland before rating South Africa. This amazing CD can tell you so much about this country. Lyric(s) of the Day: These are the days of miracle and wonder, this is the long distance call, the way the camera follows us in slomo, the way we look to us all, oh yeah! This country is an extremly cool place, with so much to see and do. Plus, I even learned to speak a little South African (well, I don't know what the language is actually called---if one of you could tell me, I'd appreciate it!). And just like the excellent reviewer Eric the Federalist, who should be on my list of favorite users, said, Nelson Mandela is GREAT! Maybe the US can arrange some kind of leader trade with...forget it. Won't happen. But still, South Africa is anice country. Take care, everyone!
