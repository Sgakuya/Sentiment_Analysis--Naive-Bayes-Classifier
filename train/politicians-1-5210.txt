I used to think that politics couldn't get much worse! I think that if or maybe I should say when Mr. Gore can finally squirm him way into the White House, my heart shall be broken! I realize that most Americans just cannot fathom how to fight this dirty and stoop so low. This election has proven that if you learn all the dirty tricks, or you hang with those who know them, yes, you too can be president! As an American parent, I cannot imagine how to explain this to my children. I have always told them to respect the President. I even managed to eek my way around a pitiful story about Mr. Clintons affairs. But how can I explain to my children that when you give something your all, and come out ahead, it really dosen't matter in our country. If someone more crafty and devious comes along, they will be allowed to steal your victory. If I have to explain that to them, why will they even try to be a winner? I am ashamed to see how government has created a welfare mentality amongst the poor. How it has crippled them into thinking that they cannot provide for themselves. And stolen their dreams. I refuse to let the politics of Mr. Gore steal my childs winning spirit! It is impossible for my mind to imagine the thinking process of anyone of this nature. I was taught when I was young, stealing is wrong...Lying is wrong...to trick someone was wrong! It is a sad day when I am using the antics of Mr. Gore as a negative example of how I don't want my children to act. And this guy will be our President??? Never in my eyes or the eyes of my family. I'm sorry, respect is an earned thing and Mr. Gore and his buddies will never have mine!
