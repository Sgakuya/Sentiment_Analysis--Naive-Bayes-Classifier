On Spring Break my wife and I like to do something special with our 3 granddaughters (ages 7, 13 and 14. We checked the Kansas City Zoo website which stated that there were places throughout the zoo where food and drinks could be purchased. Also that there was a new Orangatang house to visit. On March 13, 2003 we drove 115 miles to visit the zoo. After spending $40.00 for admission we started our tour. Our first stop was the sea lion pool. A large sign stated that there was a show/feeding at 10:30 AM. Since it was 10:25 AM we decided to wait and watch it. We waited until 10:45 but no one showed up. We continued out tour finding that in the whole zoo there was only one place which was open for food and drinks. A group of young children don't do well without snacks and drinks for extended periods of time. Come to think of it a couple of us 58 year old folks don't either. When I read about attractions such as the highly promoted Orangatang House I think about a place where visitors can observe the animals from within the house if they are not outside. Not true. There were no Orangatangs outside nor was there any to get inside the building. Now we get to the monkeys. When I visit a zoo I really expect to see more than 6 or 7 small monkeys about 8 - 12 inches tall. I as deeply hurt as I had told my grandchildren that they would really enjoy their trip through the zoo and they were so disappointed. The Kansas City Zoo has probably lost many possible visitors. I know I won't be back, I am sure my grandchildren won't and I imagine they will tell their friends at school all about the disastful visit to the zoo.
