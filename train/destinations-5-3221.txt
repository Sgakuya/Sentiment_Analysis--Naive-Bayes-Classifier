I visit SD 2-3 times a year. It's probably one of my favorite places to travel to. I love the weather there. As I always tell people, There is no weather. It always seems to be about 75-80; and none of that awful humidity like I experience on the East Coast. It's also a great dining town. My 2 favorites are Point Loma Seafood and Todai (a giant Sushi Buffet). There is plenty to do there if you are an outdoorsy type; I like to jog along Shelter Island or rent a sailboat/kayak. For the family, you got your zoo, wild animal park, and Sea World. My family also loved the humongous Koby's Swap Meet, held every weekend at the SD Sports Arena. The diversity of merchandise and bargain proces are unbeatable. Nearby San Diego (less than 40 minutes away) are great casinos located on Indian reservations. I liked taking in Padres games, but have not seen their new ballpark in Gaslamp yet. The Gaslamp district is a bit overrated. That's the revitalized downtown district with all the nightclubs made infamous by the idiots on The Real World. I found it hard to park there and some of the denizens a bit unsavory. My only other big knock on the city is that the natives are civil enough, but not particularly friendly. The times I visited nightclubs there, I didn't find anyone particularly interesting to talk to. But who cares, I'm married. Once in your life, you must visit San Diego.
