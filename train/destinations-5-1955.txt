Wow, Geordieboy stepped on alot of toes. It helps to have knowledge of a place before you dis it, Geordie. Yes, I am an American and yes, I also happen to feel extremely lucky to have been born here. While we do have our problems, this is an incredible country. We are rich with history even though we are younger than many other countries. Our ancestors died in order for this to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, and for that I will always be thankful. It is great being able to say what I want and watch what I want and listen to what I want and read what I want and live how I want...I don't have to be afraid of getting a smart bomb dropped on me if I walk to the store. And I don't have to worry about my neighbors raiding my home and raping the women there. And I don't have to come home to a shack with a dirt floor that I share with hundreds of creepy-crawlies and water that I can't even drink and toilet paper that can't even be flushed down the toilet (go to Venezuela if you don't understand what I mean). Yes, I'm lucky and I know it!! And anyone who has negative comments about America are just jealous because they don't live nearly as well as we do. Have fun in your Third World hellhole, Geordie. I'd be surprised if you live to see 25.
