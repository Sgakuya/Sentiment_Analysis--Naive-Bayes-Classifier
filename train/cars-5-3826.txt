I shopped around for a LONG time and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I got a GREAT DEAL by choosing a loaded 4x4 V6 XLT. We drive it in both the desert and the mountains (w/ snow and ice) almost daily and it handles it like a champ. I can't believe how easy it is to pass someone on a mountain road... going up hill! The V6 is almost overkill in the power dept. The leather/moonroof and premium sound is the way to go. It's quiet and very comfortable at high speeds. If you're shopping around, PLEASE stop by Ford and test drive a V6 XLT (don't let 'em get you in a 4 cyl.). You'll be very pleased. The price is comparable to the RAV4, but handles the road like a Beemer SEDAN.
