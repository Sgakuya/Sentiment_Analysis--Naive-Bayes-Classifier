the 10 weeks i was stuck here were the WORST in my entire life, the dorm housing is truly GOD AWFUL, the so called floor supervisors are dirty to the core and could care less about people there trying to sleep, more than anything OU Athens is a good ole boys (and girls) club, that is to say the atmosphere is totally immoral and perverse, LOTS of frat boy group RAPES of freshmen girls are COVERED UP, and all the worthless drunks stick together (who else wants to be around them?) HA Not me, the campus is utterly boring beyond the human brain capacity, as again, ALL activites center around being liquored up and smoking cannabis and sinful acts of fornication out of wedlock. as a Christain I belive the HORRIFIC eternal 10 weeks I endured around 'these people' was a test which I passed only thru my lord and savior Jesus Christ.
