I would give the man 4 stars for his performance as president and the 5th star because of his guts and putting the country before his own life and future. He dedicated his life to his country, not his pocketbook and/or ego. Can you imagine a reagan or bush saying and practicing sayings like, If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen or The buck stops here? Some things that he did were not to popular with the bigots and right wing idiots, but they were the correct decisions, as integrating the armed forces. He also was about the only president to leave office as a relatively poor person, not because of the lack of intelligence, as Grant did, but because of his dedication to his country.
