The most interesting story is what a stroke of luck it was that he ever got the chance to start with the Dodgers. Lasorda tells the story that he was about to cut Piazza, a low draft number, and felt enormous pressure to vacate the roster spot, when the starting catcher (I think Scosia) got hurt, saving Piazza from getting cut. Lasorda loved Piazza but was ready to cut him until then. Next the back up got injured and Piazza, given his chance, exploded offensively, as did the Dodgers, and the rest is Rock 'N Roll, he never lost the starting position again. Why they allowed him to leave, I'll never know, but his place in the Hall of Fame is already being prepared.
