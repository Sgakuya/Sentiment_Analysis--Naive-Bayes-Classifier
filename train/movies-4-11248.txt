It certainly isn't the greatest comedy of all time or anything, but it was a very refreshing change from all the other garbage that has been released from Hollywood so far this summer. I really enjoyed Bette Midler and Faith Hill in this movie. Who knew that Faith could actually act? She was very funny as a Stepford wife. And as always, Bette Midler is totally hilarious. I absolutely loved her character in this movie. As for Nicole Kidman, she did ok, but she wasn't very convincing and she wasn't nearly as funny as the rest of the cast. But maybe she wasn't supposed to be. I also thought Matthew Broderick was really cute as he always is. I highly recommend this movie for comedy lovers. Very good....
