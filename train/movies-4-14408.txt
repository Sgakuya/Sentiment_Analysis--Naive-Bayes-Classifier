At the time it came out, I was a senior in high school. This was the only movie, other than Fast Times at Ridgemont High, that we felt was telling the truth. In retrospect, I think it is a bit stereotyped, but it still sends a powerful message about what things were like for people my age with parents that were clueless. The world changed and those that had younger parents didn't have any many problems with the changes, but if you had older parents in the early-mid 80's, it was very difficult to deal with the generation gap. They missed the sexual revolution and had no comprehension of the types of things that their children were facing in high school.
