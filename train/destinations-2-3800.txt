I don't have any strong feelings towards Nashville one way or the other. Nashville is a very unattractive city to look at. the lakes and rivers in the area are filthy and there is a trash along all the roadways. It seems as if people in the area do not recycle and are not bothered at all by flinging cigarette butts and McDonald's wrappers out the window. Another reason why the city is an eyesore has to do with the numerous fast food establishments. Huddle Houses and Waffle Houses dot the landscape. The structures of buildings and the lots are in shabby condition. On a more positive note, the city has some fun bars and clubs and the residents appear more welcoming than in other cities, particularly those of the Northeast and Florida
