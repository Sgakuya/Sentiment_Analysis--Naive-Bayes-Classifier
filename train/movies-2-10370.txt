This film was a dissapointment. 'Callmetootie' had a great analysis so I will just add a few comments. As always, Jack is great and delivers a stellar performance and the film did provide a few laughs.... Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. Most of the the situations seemed a bit corny and the number of cameos from Bob Knight to John McEnroe to Mayor Guilliani seemed amateurish; as if the director was hoping to make up for what the film itself lacked by cashing in on the personas of a few famous people. Oooh look Bob Knight! Hey, he's got an anger problem and he's in the movie too! Ha ha ha! Well, if spending 8 bucks for that is your thing....then be my guest. If your a die-hard Nicholson fan, I would say wait until its on DVD. One to avoid.
