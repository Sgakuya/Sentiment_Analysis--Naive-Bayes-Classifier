Very pretty park and area especially if you enjoy mountain biking and take a ride through Slick Rock. The Arches Park has some great terrain, dusty, dry and very rocky. The arches themselves are wild not only because of their sizes and shapes but their colors. It's like someone cut them out of a mountainside and then placed them on the earths surface exposing all their strata and colors. I was about to say there wasn't a whole lot to do there and don't bother staying more than a day or two but when I think about it there actually was a lot to do...hiking in the park, mountain biking in Moab, rafting down the Colorado river, kayaking, and your only a couple of hours away from some great skiing.
