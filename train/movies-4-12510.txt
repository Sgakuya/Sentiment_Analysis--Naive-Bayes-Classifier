When I first saw the preview for Brokeback Mountain, I cringed. Not because of the gay sex--I'm gay--but because of the Lifetime Channel dramatics. I had to ask myself a question somewhat different than that most straight men would have had to ask themselves: would I see this movie if it did not have a gay theme? The answer was: probably not. It's a rare love story that I enjoy. Neither actor has ever interested me very much, and Ang Lee has proven a wildly inconsistent director, often within the same film (such as the Ice Storm). My partner was more interested in Brokeback Mountain and convinced me to go. Although not a great movie, this was certainly a very good one, with a truly remarkable performance by Heath Ledger. The film is not political or preachy, and it's homosexual characters do not always act admirably. They are human and flawed, sometimes violent and selfish and stupid. But it would take a cold heart indeed to not empathize with them and their situation. Straight men have told me that they have no particualar homophobic fear of the movie's theme, they just cannot relate to it. This is a senseless argument. They might not be able to relate to two men making love, certainly, but anyone can relate to a love that can never be fulfilled, a common topic of so much great art, from Romeo and Juliet to There's Something About Mary. I cannot relate to having grown up African-American in a ghetto, but I can still admire great films such as Boyz N the Hood and New Jack City. Brokeback Mountain is not the best film of the year--or even the best gay love story on film--but it is a very good one, and well worth seeing.
