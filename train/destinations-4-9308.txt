An unusual island,full of cacti,windswept divi-divi trees and strangely shaped rock formations,fine beaches,clear and tempting Caribbean water.Shopping in the main town only average.The absolute highlight for my wife and i,and which will always ensure a warm place in our hearts for Aruba,was our great fortune in witnessing the Green Ray ,a very rare seaside phenomenon,when the last flash of the setting sun on the horizon turns bright,unmistakeable emerald.We'd seen the lovely French film by that name,(a.k.a Summer )but never expected to experience the ray for real.It helps understand your feelings and brings you closer together.A most precious memory.Oh yes,and the Dunes?This is where you can ride your jeep or buggy to your heart's content.
