It is often said that Teddy Roosevelt was the first modern president, and I think this is a fair statement. To begin, one must be careful to judge people based on the times, or in other words, in comparison with their contemporaries. Yes, Teddy might be considered racist and/or sexist by the standards of today, but when compared with his contemporaries, he was progressive, and no one can accuse Roosevelt of thinking small. He acknowledged and (more importantly) acted upon the new reality that the United States was a world power and the responsibilities that this status entailed (eg the Panama Canal and reducing European influence in the Americas). He acknowledged the dangers of extreme capitalism by starting or substantially starting anti-trust measures, but avoided the temptation of over regulation that plagues us today. Finally (at least for this comment), Teddy was largely responsible for the conservation movement, though this has been largely perverted by subsequent administrations (ie there is no need for one third of all American real estate to be owned or effectively owned by the government as it is today, at least according to National Geographic). In other words, Teddy would not be a Democrat today as some of the others have claimed. The bottom line is that Theodore Roosevelt was a visionary for his times and was largely responsible for converting (for good or ill) the United States into the modern nation state and global power that it is today.
