I m Canadian and I m absolutely embarrassed that this buffoon has dictated the country the way he has for as long as he has. He s criminal, corrupt, scandalous, incompetent, slimy and stupid, yet people are blind to his antics. Canada was a great place ten years ago but now the country is falling downhill and much of it is Chretien s fault. PCI is 1/3 lower than it was ten years ago and doesn t even rank in the top fifteen in the world anymore. The dollar is low and the economy is anemic. Don t believe the Chretien s media blitz painting the constant rosy picture -- the economy is always booming . All this is smoke and mirrors. I could go on and on about how pathetic this man is and how he s really ruined Canada s stature, but I ve made my point. I give him one star because no stars is not an option. I hope other Canadians finally wake up and realize what a mess this man has made before it is too late
