Ah, good ol' Wally World! They may have competative prices, but that's about all they have going for them. I find the stores crworded and hard to navigate. Product quality is lackluster and so is their bussines practices. Customer service is average. But store decore is not. Dimly lit, and bland deisgn, my Wal-Mart experience is that of a diary cow being herded into the stockyards more so than the feeling of shopping. However I live in the mid-west so I have the liberty of going to my local Meijer store. Since Meijer pioneered one stop shopping I get better customer service, better product selection, and a beatiful easy to navigate store with top notch design while still paying Wal-Mart prices.
