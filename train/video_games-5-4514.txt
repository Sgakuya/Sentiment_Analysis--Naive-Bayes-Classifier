Played the Sims so much your begging for more? Well then get this exspansion pack. I thought the orginal game was great but it could of offered more building options in my opinion (like diffrent style doors, windows, ect.) Weeeell.. i found that all here! Now you can give your sims houses that Medieval look, or just go all out and crazy on decorating. I even built a little church in one of my neighborhoods. Not to mention there's diffrent characters to interact with, from the Grim Reaper to a Magical Genie. This game also offers your sims diffrent jobs to chose from. Plus some new objects, like magic balls, electric guitars, and flying rockets!! Oh yeah did i mention insted of just one Neighborhood you get 5?! Go get this game.. NOW!!
