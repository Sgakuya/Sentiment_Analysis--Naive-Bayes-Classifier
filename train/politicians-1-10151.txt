Bad president. Used up US treasury money to fund everything from lower taxes to a war! He said many things that never happened, for example, he claimed that he would increase funding for the US Peace Corps and raise the participation by at least a few thousand, hasn't happened yet. This is the kind of international relations we need to be working on, not getting other countries mad at us by starting a war. I think there were good reasons to take Saddam out of power, but I think the war was rushed in to and the US should have waited from more support from other countries, most importantly from the UN. I'm tired of being embarrassed for my country, but unfortunately I can't vote yet. Let's do something we can be proud of, don't vote Bush.
