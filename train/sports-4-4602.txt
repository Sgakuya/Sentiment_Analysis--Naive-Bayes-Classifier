This guy is now clearly in the elite group of the top men's college basketball coaches. He is especially masterful at getting his club to peak at the right time, and this has carried him to at least two of the four Final Four's he's gotten to. What I like about Izzo is his class and intellect. He's a very pragmatic coach who recognizes the talent in the other teams he's up against. This year (2005) he knew he didn't have the best club and he'll be quick to tell you that. But he did a superb job getting to the top level and for at least a half, matched/led a much better NC ballclub. The guy is also a gentleman and a true sportsman. What more could a university want in a high profile coach?
