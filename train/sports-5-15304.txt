(every time you see a dash in this, imagine a swear. i had clean my language up for this site to accept my thoughts and comment on the greatest player ever) The single greatest player or man of all-time. He is the Packers. They should change their names to the Green Bay Favres. He is the toughest, hardest working, and best player in the league by far. vtsciencenerd is a moron. Favre lead the d--n league in touchdown passes with a broken thumb on his THROWING hand. Not many other QB's around the league would've even played. He has never had a losing season and has one of the best winning pecentages of any QB all-time. He has had no reciever to throw to ever (besides Sterling Sharpe for a year and a half) and he has consistently won. Anyone who does'nt give him a five knows abolutely nothing about the game and they should have prosthetic nuts sewn on because they weren't born with any to begin with. Those dumb-ss Bears fans are all giving him a one beacause Favre kicks their p-ssy -sses every year and we always make it to the playofs and they never do. F--k Off Bear p-ssies. Favre could beat you by himself playing offense and defense. Urlacher is a p-ssy. And who was your last QB? Kordell? Yeah that's what I thought. Favre's stats, streak, toughness, bad-ssness, and competitiveness speak for themselves. He is the greatest player, for the greatest franchise, in the greatest league, in the greatest sport on the planet earth. This makes him the greatest man in history. I can't wait until next year when he wins his 4th MVP and wins another Super Bowl, and shows all the p-ssies how it's down. He deserves more than a five, five thousand wouldn't even begin to describe how great the man is. Favre is God!
