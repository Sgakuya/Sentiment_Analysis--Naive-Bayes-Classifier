I had been a fan of wendy's through all my highschool days. Now that I'm in college a freind of mine who works at Wendy's part-time during his summer break, has told me all the things you dont want to know about the fast food you love. He said if a burger is dropped on the floor or is made as a mistake with an order. The manager asks them to grill it chop it up and put it in the chili. By the way there are mice living at this Wendy's!! At the end of the day when its time to clean the grill they put all the left over food particles and grime into the chili also. And they advertise there salads as being made fresh daily, but they don't throuw away salads after everyday, My freind says some of the salads are upto two weeks old. I admitt I have visited the drive thru since, however it's only when I get a craving for a frostie. NO FOOD.
