Tony Blair has done many things with which I do not agree economically. He has abandoned more traditional Labour principles. But he has stood up to the self-hating British left who would kill their own parents if it would erase their own British identity. And he has faced down Islamic madness which threatens to destroy all of Europe and the civilized world. In these dangerous times, when we are all facing our own extinction unless we stand up for our European societies, our European cultures, and our European philosophies, Tony Blair is a true hero for having the courage to defend our way against the barbarians of Islam.
