I'm not actually rating the Antivirus protection. I am rating McAfee Customer service. I subscribed to a whole suite of McAfee PC products. A number of times I have needed customer/tech support. I have tried text message support but I swear it must not have been a real person on the other end because whatever it was kept repeating/rephrasing what I said but still did not seem to understand. [I am a computer professional so I know the correct lingo.] Then the c.s. rep said I needed to call in for telephone support and gave me a number. The number was the same, and only one I had seen on the website. There was a significant fee by McAfee for the call. I called and the only thing I got, before McAfee hung up on me, was a recording that said I had to call the CORRECT number which I could find on the website. GRRRRRR!!! As soon as my subscriptions are up I'm switching to Norton. I've heard nothing but good about them.
