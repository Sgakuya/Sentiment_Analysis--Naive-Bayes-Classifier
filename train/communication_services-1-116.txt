Oh God, where do I begin. I guess I'll start by saying that MCI has over-charged us 4 times and it's like jumping through hoops of fire to get them to fix it. Two out of the three times they gave us lousy phone cards (worth $50 supposedly, but had only 100 mins.) When we cancelled they said we owed $42 and called non-stop and I mean non-stop like 3-4 calls a day, usually while I was feeding two babies- and the account was only 5 days past due! In the end, they made a billing error (always in their favor, strangely enough) and sent us a credit balance. But they were not going to give us the money, they would apply it to our next bill even though we cancelled our service two months ago! I had to call and spend a half-hour getting through and trying to get our money back, some of it which they were trying to keep by saying we were still their customers!!! Customer service is abysmal and nobody has a straightforward answer. I would rather lick the butts of twenty horny monkeys than ever deal with this out of control, money hungry, bloated beast of a company ever again. Can you believe that they still ask me every time I call if I want to reinstate my service with them?! Good God, help them all!!
