If there's one city in France you shouldn't visit, it's Marseilles (sorry Bene!). Marseilles is dirty, dangerous, and there's not much to see or do there. Just a few miles away you'll find the beautiful and wealthy cities of Nice, Montpellier, Cannes, Monaco, and many smaller resort towns along the Riviera, all of them worth seeing. The two nice things about Marseilles are the climate (but it's just as nice elsewhere on the Riviera) and the 'realness' of the place; surrounded by vacation resorts, Marseilles remains a working port and may be the most cosmopolitan city in the Mediterranean-though many of its residents are dirt-poor immigrants. Marseilles has more of a chaotic, spontaneous, informal feel to it than any city I've been to in Europe. An interesting contrast to its ritzy neighbors, at least.
