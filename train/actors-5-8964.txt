How in the world could anyone feel anything but admiration for Sandy Bullock??? Now I admit some of her films are a little cheesy, a little too commercial! But she always carries those roles off and no matter how one-dimensional they might be, Bullock always breathes life into them and helps us to NOT feel like we completely wasted seven dollars on another overcommercialized romantic-comedy! And how could any woman NOT relate to her as a person and/or actress? Here is a woman who has taken the higher path and chosen not to have her breasts augmented and gives the impression to like herself despite what anyone says! So when we as women tire of the same glorified bimbos with their plastic smiles and the same too beautiful seductresses who rarely crack smiles, we have Bullock to relate to with her inner radiance and her laughing snort! Bravo, Sandra!
