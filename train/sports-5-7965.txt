AI is a hard one to pigeohole. No doubt, he is one of the greatest ever to play the game. An incredible warrior who can still put up 40 points despite injuries that would leave others sitting on the bench in street clothes. Some of his incredible inside drives to the basket, against defenders nearly twice his weight, is the best I've seen since Dr. J. He is an incredible athlete; in high school, many observers say he was a better football QB than a Basketball player. AI has come a long way in terms of maturity. I guess the only knock on him is that he has never won a title (though he singlehandedly led the Sixers to the Finals) and his style of play makes it difficult for players to complement him synergistically. He may score alot -- but he damn well shoots alot too. He gets many points by virtue of the charity stripe (which isn't a bad thing). I guess in the final analysis, he is the 3rd best NBA guard in history -- only Jordan and Magic are better.
