Most of these comments are from people who have only visited the French Quarter. New Orleans has a lot to offer beside watching tourists get drunk on Bourbon Street. That is where you'll smell the vomit and pee. And, I'll point out, it is not the locals who are getting drunk and acting obnoxious. If you get the chance to visit, get out of the Quarter and see the beautiful neighborhoods of the Garden District and Uptown. You'll be hard pressed to find a city with more laid back, friendly people and fabulous restaurants, bars, MUSIC!, museums, parks and lots of history. New Orleans has its own attitude and sense of itself apart from the rest of the US. It is beautiful even if it is a little run down. (You should've seen it in the early 90s-it was really bad then.) Though it is hot, hot, hot in the spring and summer, get to Jazzfest for your first visit and see what it is all about. Unless you're a college freshman, you'll probably want to skip Mardi Gras unless you can manage to stay drunk enough to not be bothered by the crowds (and other drunks). I've lived all over the country and my fondest (and most decadent) memories of any of my adopted hometowns are from NOLA. Good food, good friends and good times. I love it!
