Back in 1963, when I was 8 years old, I could not have imagined in my wildest dreams that I d someday stand in almost the exact spot and peer out the same window where Lee Harvey Oswald fired his gun. Nor would I have thought I would actually stand on the grassy knoll where onlookers watched the hideous scene as JFK so cruelly lost his life. More than awe inspiring, the experience of the Sixth Floor Museum was actually one of the most surreal experiences of my life. I also left completely convinced that in no way shape or form was Oswald the only gunman on the Plaza that November day. I saw the distance, the angle, stood on that huge storm drain that was mentioned in one of the more recent conspiracy documentaries as being so large it would have served well as a well-hidden makeshift bunker. It definitely would have worked as they said and most likely did; it was, after all, much closer and the angle would have matched the shots. The massive Kennedy ambition coupled with their not always too wholesome associations most likely created a backlash that the Warren Commission was either too stupid or too scared to see. We may never know the whole truth. But, if you visit this museum, you will see it has its own story to tell.
