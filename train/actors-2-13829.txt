I used to rate her, back when she first appeared in my teenage years as pretty woman etc. But as the years have gone by she seems to have morphed into a sour old crabapple. The characters she plays are all complicated, highly strung woman that never seem to have anything positive that they can see in their joyless lives, and she seems to stalk through her movies shaking her hands and her overly styled hair, while the attidude of ok so I know I'm beautiful and overpaid, lets get it over with already, even though everyone knows I'm too good for my leading man oozes from every pore. She appears to be living off past glories, ie her 90s rep as a hottie. But really, there's only so far you can go on looking like you've sucked on a lemon! Also her rep as a man-eater does her no favours. She needs to lighten up, take a role that pokes fun at her serious image and get back in the running again.
