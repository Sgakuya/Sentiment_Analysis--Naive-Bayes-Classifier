A small state (3rd smallest) That has many subtle but charming and interesting things for resident and visitor alike. To Canada sucks-how you rate CT on the merits of I 95? There are much worse highways in the country for danger and accidents...I 95 yes is heavily traveled- but to rate a state with some empty farmlands and quiet towns on this one road seems rather narrow. The eastern part of the state (The 'Quiet corner') is now being discovered as a great place to visit and live- by X New Yorkers Bostonians and even Californians! Here you will find small towns, rolling hills, farms, and many historical homes. It looks like Vermont- without the cold winters. The route 169 corridor is a fine drive with old homes, churches and wineries- and is close to the ocean, Providence.Hartford and Boston. The rest of the state has a high quality of life, and a broad minded tolerance. The Yale campus in New Haven is quirky,fun and gritty- and exhibits an old world skyline. Hartford has its problems- but is rebuilding. The Connecticut shoreline is beautiful, with rocky bays and fine beaches. Expensive mainly in Fairfield county for housing- other areas of the state are affordable and are near the average nationwide for median home prices.
