On the plus side, the prices are usually right on target, and sometimes a literal bargain. Its a great place to buy most of your canned and boxed groceries, and literally a haven for anyone who needs to buy school supplies. You can get almost anything you want at Wal-Mart. On the negative side, Wal-Mart is a constant madhouse day and night. Unless you go at 6 AM or 11 PM, there is no way to avoid the long lines, the disorganization and something I like to call Wal Mart Rage (similar to Road Rage ). Wal-Mart is also no place to purchase your meats- we have bought bad meat from Wal-Mart bunches of times before we finally learned to just go somewhere else for our meats. In the final analysis, Wal-Mart is basically a one-stop shopping center, and the fact that so many people go there may be a testiment as to how good Wal-Mart is.
