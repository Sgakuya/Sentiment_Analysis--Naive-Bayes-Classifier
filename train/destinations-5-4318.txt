LA is perhaps the most misunderstood U.S. city, and impossible to rate unless you have lived here for several years. Most important to understand is that, unlike most cities, there is no central core: center is everywhere, and nowhere. One night you might be in Hollywood, another in Westwood, another in Santa Monica, another in the Fairfax, and each time you feel you have arrived at the center, but you have not: you have only experienced yet another neighborhood that has its own dynamic and intensity. Don't make the mistake of assuming that the false front and fakery of Hollywood celebrity and wanna-be celebrity is the character of the place: there are ten million people here who want nothing to do with Hollywood: the Hollywood set and attitude seems loud and pervasive because it is what is on television. LA is the most diverse meltingpot in the nation, and probably in the world.
