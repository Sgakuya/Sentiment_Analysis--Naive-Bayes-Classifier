Good guy if you look at it from the western point of view, probably because he was open to the western point of view. I wonder what they think of him in Russia...(if you are from Russia please do comment!)...Was he really the guy who made it possible to get rid of the Soviet Union and open the borders for the people in Eastern Europe to the freedom of the West? Or was it something else, perhaps a combination of events and circumstances? Did Gorby play into these events and circumstances? Was he (un)lucky to have Ronnie Reagan at 'the other side'? Can we also blame him for the miserable state Russia is in now? Or is this something which comes with change (possibly towards free market society?)? Is it once again a revolution (started by Gorby) which marks the history of cold and isolated Russia?
