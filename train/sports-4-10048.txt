I laughed out loud when I heard that the Shock had hired the most hated player in NBA history as their head coach. However.....my laughter subsided when Bill, with help from his star players Ruth Riley, Cheryl Ford and Swin Cash, led the Detroit Shock to their first WNBA championship in 2003. The original Bad Boy of Detroit basketball has one of the better minds in the sport and is always an engaging and interesting personality anywhere you meet him. Overall, for his contributions to the sport, Bill Laimbeer gets a four star rating. Not a bad job for someone known for his surly and nasty demeanor (not to mention his sharp elbows) on or near the court during his playing days.
