They have good ice crem there, but it's a tad pricy and the caldwell,oh location is really wierd. I like the vanilla ice cream cones there, but one time I got a chicken sandwich there and it had this wierd green goo when I bit ito it, I was little and I said eeeeewwww look at the gooooo! ...you would know the rest, we leave the place and don't come back for years, so now I just get ice cream since I do not trust getting regular food there. even thought it was years ago, when I found the misterious green goo, that was in that chicken sandwich!!! thanks for reading this and I hope that you don't find the goo!!!
