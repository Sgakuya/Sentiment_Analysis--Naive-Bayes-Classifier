I can't believe that Kley commented that there is "very little in Memphis to interest civilized people." Apparently, this visitor didn't spend much time exploring a city with such a broad range of culture and history. The Peabody Hotel is a grand old hotel to visit. The Duck March is a tradition with a very interesting story behind how it begun. The Peabody is just a start - after going to the must-see Beale Street, try the National Civil Rights Museum (former the Lorraine Hotel), Sun Studio, or Victorian Village. Learn about the impact of the Mississippi River on the development of Memphis and even music at Mud Island Riverpark Museum. Or see them all on a Ride The Ducks amphibious tour. Go for a show at the Orpheum (many Broadway & off-Broadway shows) or the Cannon Center for music, dance, & opera. Come in May for the Music Festival, the International BBQ Competion, and Sunset Symphony. If you can't find something interesting to do in Memphis you're either not leaving your room or not an interesting person to begin with!
