Nashville's a great place to live and work. The people are friendly and easy going and do NOT fit the stereotypical Rhinestone Cowboy image stamped upon them by ignorants who would rather poke fun at a region than get to know it. Vanderbilt Medical Center rates as one of highest facilities in the nation, musical talent abounds (and not just country); the Tennessee Titans, Nashville Predators, and Nashville Sounds are great attractions for sports lovers; and the shopping, resturants, and other entertainments are equally attractive. Getting around can be a pain in the rear, but relatively few cities have a perfect hwy system...at least we're working on it.
