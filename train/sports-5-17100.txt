Ahh, the Bucs. I moved to Tampa area back in 1998, just when the Bucs were hitting their stride. I liked the brand of football they play from day one: tough defense and a tough running game. This made me a fan instantly. Dungy was a good coach but was not capable of taking this team to the next level. He was just too conservative and the players became complacent in his last two seasons here, which caused them to make the coaching change. Gruden delivered the goods, and was able to do it with a poor running game for the entire season, coupled with weak offensive line play. The Bucs also need to get some speed on offense / WR if they want to compete again next year.
