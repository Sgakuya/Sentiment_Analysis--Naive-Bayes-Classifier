Like this guy or not, he does speak up for a disenfranchised and powerless constituency that doesn't have many public figures championing its rights and needs. If it weren't for this guy, tens of thousands of poor and dispossessed people who are that way through no fault of their own wouldn't have anyone looking out for them, and they do certainly deserve that right as Americans. Sharpton does go overboard quite often and is a bit too fond of political grandstanding, but that's typical of the partisan figures in this country who try to pass themselves off as leaders. In this, he is no worse than Newt, Trent, Rush, Savage, Shawn or any of those other ideologues. He will always be haunted by his mishandling of the T. Brawley fiasco/hoax and his continued stubbornness to come clean about it, but, then again, that's no different from any other political figure who's pulled pinheaded stunts in the past and won't admit to being wrong. If I had a $5 bill for every so-called leader who fits this description, I'd be retired and living in luxury. However, Sharpton is important because he promotes the concerns of people living in the urban areas of this country, and those people, not the parasites, mooches, slackers and losers who live in the presumed Heartland, are the ones who make the greatest contributions to the wellbeing of this country. Urban dwellers fuel the economy of the nation more than those in the backwater, pay more taxes and receive less government largesse, contribute much more to charitable causes, etc., and it is this constituency that is continually short-changed by Washington and usually demonized by the political right. Sharpton speaks up for the concerns of those breadwinners as well as the unfortunate, and he has to be admired for that.
