The only thing disappointing about my visit to this magnificent birthplace of Arthurian legend was that I didn't have nearly enough time to spend here. I did get a chance to experience both the northern and southern parts of the country and could see a big difference in the land. The south seems to be more industrial while the north is more hilly and lush. I especially enjoyed a brief visit to the beautiful little town of Llangollen. There were lots of nice little shops and a wonderful old bookstore above a teashop. The stacks of books start on the staircase and seem to go on and on forever through the rambling old building. The town of Conwy is also gorgeous and has a huge well-maintained castle. Wales has definitely been blessed by nature and is rich in history. I can't wait to go back one day.
