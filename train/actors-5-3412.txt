How could anyone not like Harrison Ford. Sooo many great movies and in a lot of cases I'd hasten to say it's his acting, expression, mannerisms that make the movie as good as it is. It would be hard to imagine someone else playing Indiana Jones, Han Solo, or Jack Ryan in Clear and Present Danger and Patriot games. I do also have to concur with Wiggum though that he is kinda limited and really blew in Regarding Henry, wow was that bad. That's the kinda film you get forced to sit through on a long flight with nothing else to do. I thought he was pretty bad in Airforce One as well.. but overall I'd say more often than not I'll go see a sketchy film because he's in it than I would another without him.
