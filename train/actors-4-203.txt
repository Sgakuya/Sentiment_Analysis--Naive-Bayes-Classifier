One of the first Method Actors, and noteworthy in that. Was truly modern in that he portrayed characters rather than took roles. Very fine job in A Place in the Sun, and The Misfits. The Search was another decent performance and he was riveting in his small part in Judgement at Nuremberg. Also good in Miss Lonelyhearts. However, I thought he was miscast in From Here to Eternity and Red River. Raintree County was a disaster and his performances in both Suddenly Last Summer and The Young Lions were just OK. Too bad this guy had his face smashed in during that 1956 auto accident: disfigured the poor guy, hurt his confidence as an actor and getting strung out on the painkillers didn't help matters much. Clift is more influential as an actor than impressive.
