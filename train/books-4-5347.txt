A friend of mine with great taste in literature sent me this book about a year ago, and, as usual, she was dead-on in thinking that I'd enjoy it. Virgin Suicides (recently made into a movie, too) is the story of a family with five young daughters who all end up killing themselves. Sounds pleasant, huh? Clearly Virgin Suicides is not meant to be a feel-good bestseller. Instead it's a dark, extremely well-written exploration of a powerful, nameless force that grips an unfortunate family. The author wisely attempts no simple explanations, instead leaving readers to draw their own conclusions as to why five middle-class girls living in the suburbs would choose to take their own lives. The narrative structure adds to the mystery, because the story is told by a teenage neighborhood boy who is fascinated with the sisters. You're put in the narrator's position - on the outside, watching anxiously for fleeting glimpses that might provide another piece of the puzzle.
