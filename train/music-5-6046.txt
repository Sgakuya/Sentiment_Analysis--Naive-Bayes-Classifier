Possibly Megadeth's best album ever. From Holy Wars....The Punishment Due to Rust In Peace.....Polaris, it's just one of those perfect albums that should be in every guitar fanatic's collection. Dave Mustaine proves on this album why he the master of speed metal, and honest and sarcastic lyrics. RIP has it all from political and religious views (Holy Wars), mandkind s a whole (Dawn Patrol) tortuous relationships (Tornado of Souls), and of course space aliens (Hangar 18) and magic powers (Five Magics). A bit of both reality and fanasty can be found here. Then of course there's the great guitar stylings of Dave (and Marty Frieedman) in all sorts of forms and stylings. MUST BUT! MUST BUY!.
