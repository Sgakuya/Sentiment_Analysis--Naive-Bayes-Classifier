After owning a Dodge Colt (same car) for 9 years,I decided to buy another...a 2000 Mirage coupe.So far after 35,000 miles I am thoroughly pleased yet again.Great car,great price,great gas mileage and sorta sporty looking too.I would recommend these cars to everybody...especially if they can find a lower mileage example.Mitsubushi dropped this car after 2002 and now the whole darn company is one step from the grave...its in serious trouble.No,the loss of Mirage didnt do it,but for me it has...because I probably wont ever buy what they offer now...without the ability to buy the loyal Mirage Coupe.They did not promote this car properly.I still say it could have outsold the Tercel and posed a real challenge for the Civic coupe..but alas lousy marketing technique by both Dodge and Mitsubishi made the Mirage another AMC Matador (whats a Matador?),the car that exists but nobody knows it.
