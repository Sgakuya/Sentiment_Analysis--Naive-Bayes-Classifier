At first, you'd think that Nickelback were just another new trendy band on short riffs. However, if you listen to their lastest release 'Silver Side Up;', you'll hear some actual substance matter unlike the many teenie boppers and bubble gum punk of today. Granted, most of the songs lyrically are about broken relationships and some form of child neglect and/or abuse (STAIND!!!). Musically they somewhat make up for the same themed songs. Unlike most of today's chart-topping bands, Nickelback will actually use key changes and not stick to one style, or the SAME RIFF THROUGHOUT THE SONG (LINKIN PARK!!). The best examples of this is in the songs 'Never Again', and 'Woke Up This Morning.'
