Texas has a great history, and we're proud of it. Beautiful countryside in the north central, and particularly the eastern part of the state. Great beaches down south around Corpus Christi and Galveston. Austin and Dallas are both great party towns, and San Antonio is wonderful for the history buffs. Yeah, it gets a little hot in the summer, but all the better for hitting the lake. Winter time? It never really gets that cold, though we do have about 2 weeks a year where things ice up. Usually, great weather for whatever you want to do. You can judge the state based on whatever poll you dug up, or listen to people whose entire Lone Star experience consists of catchign Dallas reruns, or you can see for yourself. If we're the fattest in the country, it's only because we have the best food.
