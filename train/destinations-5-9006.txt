I recently purchased an online order for 60 cans of Kayak Long Cut Straight. The online made a mistake in my order and I called them before it was shipped. The error was corrected and the gentleman I spoke with told me that he was a Kayak user until he tried Redwood Long Cut Coffee Flavor and offered to include a sleeve at no charge because of the error. Well folks I just have to tell you that this is by far the best dip I've ever used in all my years of dipping. Redwood is manufactured by the same company as Kayak. But is by far superior in flavor Kayak. It packs just right and has a smooth but quite noticeable aromatic coffe smell and taste. The coffee flavor supplements the tabacco taste without over powering it. I'm now stuck with 60 cans of Kayak and dread having to go back to it. Once I finish of my stock of Kayak I will be dipping Redwood Long Cut Coffee!!!
