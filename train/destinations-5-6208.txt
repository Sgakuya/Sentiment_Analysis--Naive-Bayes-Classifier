Michigan has everything a vacationer could want. There's plenty of thousands of miles of sandy beach for sunbathing, swimming (with no salt or chlorine!), and of course sand volleyball in the summer; a lake (Great or otherwise) pretty much wherever you turn (Michigan is the land of more than 10,000 lakes) for fishing or boating; an abundance of waterfalls in the Upper Peninsula to hike to; one of the largest if not the largest fireworks display in North America on the Detroit riverfront; big city stuff in Detroit such as professional sports, art museums, high quality theatre, world-renowned orchestra; Greenfield Village/Henry Ford Museum; science center; great shopping (mostly in the 'burbs), etc.; many great golf courses (such as The Bear designed by Jack Nicklaus) Of course one must not forget things to do in the other seasons, because Michigan is truly a four season state. In fall, Michigan has some glorious color tours along its many stretches of remote 2-lane highways through hilly terrain often offering panoramic views of a Great Lake. In winter, there's always plenty of snow (the NW tip gets more snow than any place E of the Rockies) which means Michigan is a great destination for Xcountry skiing, downhill (Mt. Bohemia just opened up and is touted as the best in the midwest), ice fishing, snowmobiling, dog sledding, snowshoeing, polar bear swimming :), and snow statue building. In other words, Michigan is a great place to visit. But don't take my word for it; discover Michigan for yourself!
