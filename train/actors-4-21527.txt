She'll never be a classic actress. No way in Hell but still I seem to like this girl! This mostly TV actress has been most known for her 90210 performances. She did play a whiny whore but she could act it. You know you're a good actor when people hate your character because it means you've developed it pretty well. My favorite role of hers though is her work in Charmed as Prue. She shows maturity although she is my least favorite witch out of the three. She still plays a both funny and dramatic character although shes sometimes overly dramatic. Her movie career is less known to me but I still enjoyed Heathers as much as I did Jawbreaker which is pretty much so.
