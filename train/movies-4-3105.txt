A very well made movie. It had a good plot, and the actors played out their parts very well. There were tense moments throughout the movie, and at the end it was very suspenseful. Also, it was nice seeing that most of the actors in this movie were not well known, which made it-for the most part-more realistic. One thing that I do not like is how people are comparing this to the problems with Iraq right now. And they say that they are sensitive to war issues. Of course, if there were no problems anywhere in the world, it would be fine and dandy to go watch this movie. I don't think that it is fair to the movie and all the cast who worked very hard to make the movie enjoyable. But to anyone who wants to go see this, I would definetely suggest taking the time to see it.
