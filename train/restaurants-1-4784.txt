Having grown up on the gulf coast of Alabama I know good seafood when I eat it. Red Lobster does NOT have good seafood. Most of what they serve is imported and frozen even if their restaurant is located a few miles from the fishing boats! If it's a nickel cheaper they will buy it from some third world supplier halfway around the world. The next time you go to the coast, whether in Alabama, Florida, Maryland or Maine check out the local seafood restaurants, the locals will be eating there. The first time out-of-town tourists will be at Red Lobster. Do yourself and the local economy a favor, eat at the local places. Their food will probably be far fresher, cleaner, and healthier that what is caught or grown in filthy conditions in Asia or South America.
