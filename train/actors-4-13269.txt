I like Sharon Stone when she plays a bisexual. I hope she's a bisexual in 'reality' and her lovers are Madonna, Christina Aguillera, Britney Spears, Susan Lucci, Angela Bassett, Piper Perabo, and Dianne Cannon. She does the role so well in films like 'Basic Instinct'. In my personal life I know a lot of bisexual women and I get along better with them then I do straight women in some instances. Sex with a bisexual women is excellent. They know how to probe areas of men as well as women, and I think that bisexual sex among women is the American way. Lead them on in glory Sharon, make America proud and do another wicked movie that contains more animalistic lesbian sex. I think she is talented, intelligent, rough, tyrannical, wretched, deceitful, attractive, refined, and fragile. Sharon Stone does superb work and I enjoy her presence in the art of movie making.
