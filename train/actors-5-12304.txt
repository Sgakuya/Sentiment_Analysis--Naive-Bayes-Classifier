First of all some of you are haters and very ignorant! Just because a person is biracial or mixed doesn't mean they can't represent both or choose which one they want to identify with! She has come a very long way and has steered from certain types of roles. She has worked very hard to prove herself to the public. It is difficult trying to please everyone. Have you ever thought that perhaps she didn't live with her father growing up. That could explain his absence at the awards people! Besides if she wants to call herself a sistah so be it. I bet if she were denying her blackness you would have something to say. She is very pretty (blacks can be pretty without being mixed you know) and intelligent. Those of you who hate are probably struggling to make it in this world and get angry when others succeed. If not you are probably some lil project bunny blaming everyone for your failures. Don't let the glass ceilng hit you in the face on the way up!
