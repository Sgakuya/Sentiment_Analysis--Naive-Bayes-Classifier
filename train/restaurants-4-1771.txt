I like Taco Bell, everyone knows it's not authentic Mexican food-like pizza from Pizza Hut isn't authentic Italian pizza, who cares. It's inexpensive, there's a variety, salads, chicken, beef, deserts, beans & rice. One problem I have is that they get special items on their menu like a few years ago the I think it was called 5 alarm double decker taco-I loved it but they discontinued it. There have been other such items discontinued too. I do also think they could have tried a little harder with the breakfasts. When I was in college I use to love to stop by T.B. for a quick bite I could eat on the way to classes.
