It was great to see her win her well-deserved Oscar for her performance in the powerful film, Boys Don't Cry . I found it interesting that she made only $3,000 for acting in that film- I guess it proves that actors and actresses are at their best when they are paid the least. Her performance in Boys Don't Cry was both moving and powerful. Having first seen her in The Next Karate Kid , I was very surprised that she was able to pull Boys Don't Cry off considering the failure of that film. She also gave a riveting performance in The Gift which solidified her as a major player in Hollywood for many years to come.
