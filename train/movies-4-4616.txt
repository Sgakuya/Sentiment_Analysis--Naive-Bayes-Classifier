I enjoyed this movie about a special little girl. Matilda lives with her awful family that ignores her.Matilda is very intelligent and took herself to the library when she was only four, she was a brilliant child who ends up at this school headed by a horrible principal. She is lucky enough to have a wonderful teacher.{the first person who was kind to her}Matilda finds out she has magical powers to make things move with her mind. Matilda helps her teacher to get rid of the horrible principal {who is also the teachers aunt} at then end Matilda gets to live with the teacher and of course lives happily ever after. Matlilda is well played by Mara Wilson.Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman are both good as her awful parents. A good family movie.
