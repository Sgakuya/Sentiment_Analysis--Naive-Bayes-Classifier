A lot of people mentioned that the car looks cute. I will say the interior looks even better. Plus, I like the cup holders, one push up/down driver's side windows, one push open power sun-roof, white 3D instrument cluster, super comfortable front seats, multi ways of adjustable rear seats, 5 3point seat belts and etc. After breakin period, the car seems that it has gained more horse powers. I do agree that I didn't feel enough power when I test drove the car. Now the car moves fast. 0-60mph is 9sec. That shall beat a lot of sedans on the road. The best of all, the cost of ownership is much lower than other SUV or sedans. First, there is no timing belt but timing chain so you don't need to replace timing belt. Second, it is equiped with Iridium Spark Plugs so you don't need to replace them until it reaches 100,000miles. Third, there is no distributor, nor spark plug wires. Last, with Toyota's reputation it can really save your money and time. If this car came with V6 engine, I would give it 6 stars. It is just too nice to not to have this car.
