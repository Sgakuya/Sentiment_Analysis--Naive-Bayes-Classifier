This film made me think and made me want to move to Canada. It's good someone is out there taking such a critical view of our country. Maybe he's not 100% correct, but he made a lot of ppl think and become more aware who we really are. But I have a couple problmes with the movie. 1) Moore should have reported per-capita violent homicides because of the US's high population. 2) Moore was a hostile jerk in his interview with Charton Heston. (My problem has nothing to do with Heston having Alzheimers. He behaved normally.) In the first part of the interview Moore was nice. He got Heston to express his views on guns. But then Moore got too aggressive when talking about taking the NRA to Denver. If Moore had continued being civil he would've been able to draw out more of Heston's intentions behind taking the NRA to Denver right after Columbine and we would've been able to see some of the twisted thinking behind the NRA. Moore shouldn't've become hostile after Heston welcomed him into his home, no matter how outrageous Heston's views or actions. I hope Moore gets better at presenting the facts. I wouldn't want him to lose credibility. Moore is good for the collective consciousness.
