I own the Nomad Jukebox, a CD-player-sized unit with a 6-gig hard drive in it. It's awesome that I can store as many as 150 CDs on a single player!While it is expensive (approx. $400), consider this: you can easily pay $200 for an MP3 player that holds at best a couple hours of music. I have NEVER understood why someone would spend $150-$300 for a walkman that played an hour of music! But for twice the price, the Nomad Jukebox gives you hundreds of times the capacity. Well worth it! It's also sturdy; I've dropped it a couple times and it works fine. p Two gripes: the PlayCenter Jukebox software they provide for your PC could be a little more sophisticated, and I wish they didn't lock up a third of the player with free music that you can't transfer off it (you can delete it though).
