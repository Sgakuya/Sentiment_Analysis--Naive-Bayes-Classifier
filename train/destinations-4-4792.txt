Yes, this city is as beautiful as everyone says it is - the beaches and mountain peaks are idyllic. Certainly a surfer's paradise. However, it has some of the same negative trappings of many tourist destinations. It is a very crowded city. Also, the restaurants are only mediocre however, especially versus Sao Paulo to the south. There is also less culture, nightlife and in general, things to do than Sao Paulo, being that it's a much smaller city. The open-air market place downtown is highly reccomended; you can get some great bargains there. Also there is a subway which is quite modern, clean and efficient. Overall, definitely worth the visit, particularly if the beach is your prime vacation interest on your destination - hands down, it blows away Cancun!
