I don't know that I can make you laugh, since I find this very unfunny. Blockbuster was a good place to rent when I started. I am a gold member. I live alone, but my first year on REWARDS I upgraded to gold by reason of earning over 100 free rentals. I have seen a deliberate and ongoind attempt to beliberately force the obsolescence of VHS after managing to sell me about 40 or 50. I have also seen register rental coupons replaced with worthless Freebie.com points which are difficult to access and harder to use. But worst of all, despite supposedly resolving this on the phone, I have not recieved my monthly free rental coupons in the mail since last July. I still rent at Blockbuster but less than half as much as I did. You have turned a great family place into corporate poo-poo. (I was nice-didn't use the word that actually came to mind.) I hope you take this e-post seriously. I'm trying hard to like Blockbuster, but it's hard when Blockbuster doesn't seem to like me. Sincerely, Stephen L Miller Athens, Texas
