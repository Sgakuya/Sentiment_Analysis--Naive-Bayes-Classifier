What a piece of crap. Don Henley started out dull and he's been gradually deteriorating ever since. Whatever single from Inside Job they keep playing on the radio, it's enough to make me get off my lazy ass, walk all the way over the radio, and change the station. I don't know if you saw it on the news or not, but several scientists at MIT recently discovered that it's physically impossible for music to be any more bland and lifeless than Henley's music on Inside Job. I didn't read through all the supporting statistics, but the scientists made a very convincing argument. And who are we to argue with science?
