This country is horrible... No, i've never been there. But, I will say this. There was one person I know, a semi-friend from there, that liked it, was a real nice guy, unfortunatly he died in a car accident. On the other hand, there are several others I know from that country. ALL OF THEM, are weird, FREAKS... They have no respect for others it seems like. They stare, and think their tough, in a country that is NOT theirs... Most other culturals I can tolerate without problems, (arabic, asian, almost all europeans) but this country seems to have severe problems drowning it, and MOST of it's people. BTW, those smiles, are left over from the communists...
