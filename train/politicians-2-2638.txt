John McCain could have helped George W. more than he did during the campaign. He always seemed to make one good remark about Bush along with two bad ones. He lied when he said he supported President Elect. You could see it in his face and hear it in his voice. Their were many in Viet Nam that suffered as much or more. Many lost their lives. His story was typical of what happened to many veterans. I have heard the same story from people I know, yet it was never written about in newspapers or books. I also wish he would stop the campaign reform issue. Our President isnt in office yet and the pressures on. If we have campaign reform who do you think will be paying? Did he take the money out of his pocket when he campaigned? Glad he didnt win.
