One of the crappiest bands of the new wave era. And this was one of their typically moronic, flat-sounding, monophonic and juvenile attempts at a record. "Do Do Do, Da Da Da" should have been simply entitled "Do Do," because that would have been a perfect description of the song. "Don't Fart So Close To Me," was a real cautionary tale, but, er, wait, that's "Don't Stand So Close To Me." Sorry folks, my mistake. Skip that. This band had absolutely no clue as to melody, harmony, dynamics, resolution, etc. Their playing was totally undistinguished. Music for the culturally retarded. A product shoved down the throats of the noncomprehending public by the nameless and faceless suits of the record industry. And Stink's fake Jamaician accent is enough to make you barf.
