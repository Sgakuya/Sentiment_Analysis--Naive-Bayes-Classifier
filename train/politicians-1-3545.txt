There's an adage in show business, if you must sin, sin boldly. Another way of putting it -- little evils will get you busted, but big ones will get you the oval office. Clinton sinned in little, venial ways, and the nation turned on him. Now we have Bush, a former party animal and DUI collar who has stolen an election, invited the likes of Ken Lay into his inner circle, and relentlessly pursued a program of turning his own family and oil-industry friends' private agendas into national policy--oil and gas drilling in nature preserves, massive tax cuts for the wealthy, gutting of environmental protection regulations for the benefit of the big polluters, and--worst of all--exploiting American grief, rage, and fear after 9/11 to convince us that what we need is a war, not on bin Laden and the radical Islamist countries who support his brand of terrorism, but on Iraq, a campaign for which personal revenge and oil-lust are clearly Bush's prime motivators. Yet, though as hard to miss as the proverbial elephant in the parlor, the blatantly selfish, self-serving nature of Bush's agenda is simply not being talked about in our national discourse. The great inventor Thomas Edison had a favorite quote, which he used to hang on the walls of his R D labs to remind his workers of the dangers of intellectual laziness and complacency. It read, There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking. This reminder ought to be placed in all the halls of congress and in every polling place. When we fail to do the real labor of thinking, we risk being steamrolled by evil men who are counting on our inattention, knowing that a benevolent smile is enough to secure our acquiescence in the worst of their schemes.
