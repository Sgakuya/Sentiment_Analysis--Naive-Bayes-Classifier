S.O.B's!!!! I was just laid off by this greedy azz bank today...me!!! The bank recently merged with JP Morgan Chase and I can't believe that they eliminated my entire department. Damn bastards!!!!!! Don't feel sorry for me though, I'm kind of glad because this was an awful place to work. Management cares only about the bottom line, not at all about their employees. I got severance pay for 60 days and was told basically that there aren't any other positions I could apply for so I'm azz out. This damn society really sucks because no one seems to care about people, just money and power. Why did these two banks merge? Greed and desire for more power and more money as I said. Kind of like Microsoft and Walmart. Nobody cares about the little guy.
