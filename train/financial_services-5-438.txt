I have a couple Strong funds and I couldn't be more pleased with the investment choice. When I made the decision to go with Strong I had looked into other fund families like Janus and Vangaurd, both which I also liked but since I am a young girl with little money to start out with, I went with Strong since you can sign up for automatic investment plan without an initial investment. With Vangaurd most of the mutual funds have an initial investment of $1000-$3000. Since I have been a customer of Strong for almost a year, I have three mutual funds. All are doing exceptionally well (even in this market). I have signed up for the automatic investment plan where once a month (on the day I signed up for) I have an alloted amount of money taken from my checking account and put into my mutual funds. This is a perfect plan for me. It was easy to sign up with Strong. The customer service has been exceptional. I couldn't be more happy with my decision to go with Strong. They also have a great web site that is very informative and helped me in making my decision of which mutual funds to by. You can down load the application from the web site too which makes that much easier to get your finances squared away. I feel very good about my financial planning with Strong. I hope in the years to come (I am a long term investor) that Strong continues to do as well as they have in the past 10 months.
