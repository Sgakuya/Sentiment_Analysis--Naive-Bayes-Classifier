Tell me, what is the difference between Mr. Mandela and the Extremists in the Middle East. Both use violence, bombs, intimadation tactics and lies to get to their main objectives. Mandela was found guilty of planning to blow up civilian buildings (what hero kills the innocent?) Its true that after Mandela was released from prison hefought for peace and equality. But remember, he had the rest of the world right behind him, watching every step he made. So he could not show his true colours. This is a man who praises Fadel Castro, Bin Laden, and many other born killers. His beliefs are much the same as theirs, its a fact. He is potrayed as a man of peace. Yet when he was in jail, the South Africa government pleaded with Mr. Mandela to denounce violence, and he refused. This man (mandela) encouraged Hate, Violance and Racism towards whites and coloureds in South Africa. It saddens me that such a man is praised for what he had done prior to being president of South Africa. So can someone please explain to me why Mr. Mandela is viewed as a International hero?
