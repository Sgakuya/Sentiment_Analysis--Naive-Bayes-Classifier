There is something so, well, pouty, sickly pale and extremely self-interested about this actress. First of all, though she may have been acting herself silly before she hooked up with Cruise, she was never heard of before she did. (Their entire union smacked of a Scientology business deal to me anyway.) Then suddenly she s Mrs. Tom Cruise and we re supposed to take her professional choices seriously (oh, yes they broke up once she had a few films under her belt - who couldn't see THAT coming!). Well, I don t think so. I simply do not see any grand talent here and her films tend to run on the trashy side. If that s the only thing she can do, even those who watch her now will grow tired of watching her do it in a few short years. There s nothing in Hollywood with a shorter shelf life or more easily replaced than a sleaze.
