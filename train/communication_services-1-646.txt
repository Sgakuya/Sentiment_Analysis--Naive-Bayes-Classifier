I'm only holding out until the stupid contract is up. This is the absolutely worst run company. I moved from NJ to NY and an understatment is saying that it was an unbelievable NIGHTMARE. It was a complete run around on relocating the service. We ended up paying on both ends (NJ and NY) for the same billing period because the Cingular in NY can't access NJ and vice versa. Whenever you call customer service you'de best plan on a total afternoon to do so. I was on the phone, no lie, 8 hours between the two states. It isn't just a matter of relocation, even when we were in NJ prior to moving, if you call you sit, and sit and sit. Horrible service. Then to top things off, when we moved.... we had to lock into another FULL YEAR contract even though our original contract would have ended within two months. To leave now, it's $150 penalty charge for early termination. How do I spell Racquet? C-I-N-G-U-L-A-R
