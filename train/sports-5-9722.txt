The greatest team in the NBA, historically. 16 World Championships out of 19 NBA Finals appearances. Bill Russell, Sam Jones, John Havlicek, Dave Cowens, Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, "The Chief" Robert Parish and many, many others in a great history. Things fell off right after their last banner in 1986 (thanks to Len Bias' death and the ton of career ending injuries they've had since then). They haven't been to the Finals since 1987 when they lost to the Lakers 4 games to 2. The modern NBA system won't allow the Celts to dominate like they used to but there's always hope......I like Paul Pierce, Ricky Davis and Kendrick Perkins alot. Doc Rivers is busting his butt coaching them - that means Danny Ainge needs to get him some players to compliment the before mentioned, preferably a center RIGHT AWAY IF POSSIBLE. I'll always be a fan of the Boston Celtics, one of American sports' greatest institutions. GO CELTICS!
