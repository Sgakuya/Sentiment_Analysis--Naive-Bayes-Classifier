Whoopie is irritating and obnoxious, and she has been involved in a string of crappy films. Cowever, she is capable of a decent performance or two, best evident in her work on tv on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Mooch of her problem comes from her inability to overcome herself: on screen she is Whoopie Goldberg, period. The audience is rarely able to see her as a character, mostly because she is a celebrity, not a real actor. Her HBO specials weren't particularly funny either, and her outspoken politics is off-putting to some. The one performance the MooCow did enjoy from her, apart from the Star Trek stuff, was the small part of the cop in The Player. Perhaps a little bit of Whoopie goes a long way.
