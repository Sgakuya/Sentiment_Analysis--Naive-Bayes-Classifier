i would just like to say that I work for a branch of the Zales company and I STILL buy my jewelry from Whitehall. They are super friendly and they have the BEST prices on Diamonds, some of thier gemstones are overpriced but when it comes to diamonds they have the best selection, the best quality and the best prices. I love all of thier sales people, it is the same in all retail stores, be nice to the sales person and they will be nice to you. ALL of thier diamonds are covered as long as you go in for the inspections and cleanings on a timely manner. At Zales only diamonds over 400 dollars are covered--fat chance on replacing your side stones or diamond chips. I like the Zales Corporation, but I told my fiance to buy my ring at whitehall, not from me, which I think says alot about thier company...
