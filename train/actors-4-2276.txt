Mel has apparently decided to stay behind the camara and says he will no longer appear in movies. It's a shame, as he is one of my favorite actors. He has shown a nice range, appearing in everything from action to drama to romantic comedy, and doing it all well. Man Without a Face was very good, and his directorial debut if I remember correctly. I disagree that he was miscast in Braveheart, and thought he did an excellent job. What Women Want, and to a lesser degree Bird on a Wire, showed he was equally good at romantic comedy. Signs and We Were Soldiers are two more of my favorite movies. Of course, there have been stinkers too. Forever Young was an interesting idea, but not very well done. This wouldn't be Mel's fault, but he didn't do much to save it either. As happens sometimes, they took the Lethal Weapon series for a ride one too many times... maybe even two too many. If I had one criticism for Mel's acting, it would be some of his emotional scenes. The Patriot was brought up, and I do think that is a good example. While I liked the movie and Gibson's performance overall, the scene after his oldest son dies is a prime example of his tendency to... I don't even know. I can't tell if he's over doing it, if he's under doing it. There is something that just doesn't sit right sometimes. It's not in every movie, and it's not every emotional scene, but sometimes he just comes off the wrong way. Overall, I think he is actually underrated. He certainly deserves at least a four.
