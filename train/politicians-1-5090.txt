This is to democrat 4 democracy. Get Real!!!!!! Would you ask for a recount if you already won the State of Florida. By the way he won Miami Dade after the re re re re count. So your has been Mr Gore lost the State of Florida. Miami Dade was the last of the counties Mr. Gore asked for. Bush actually gained 6 more votes in Miami Dade. When he didnt concede the first night, he stood up in front of the American people and said after the recount he would concede if he lost. Well he lost again. After the recount he said he would concede if he lost after the hand count. He lost again. He lied and didnt concede. After going to the Forida Supreme Court 3 times he finally got a state wide recount. If he can go to the Florida Supreme Court then PRESIDENT ELECT BUSH had the right to go to the US Supreme Court. Was their decision right? Absolutely. When someone walks into a voting booth and votes wrong, or twice, or not at all, he didnt follow directions. When you dont follow directions in anything you do, you usually dont get a second chance. Mr. Gore got the popular vote but PRESIDENT ELECT got way more states and counties. He won the election, he won it fair and square. Too bad Mr. Gore wasnt man enough to except defeat after the first recount as he promised to do. But we all know the man is a liar.
