Overpriced... its just a sandwich for god's sake, i'm sure the size of the bread and the amount of meat they put on their sandwich has shrunk over the years! Plus they use worse quality turkey now, this place used to be good, but because of greed you will now pay more for less. A large turkey bacon guacaomole is $10 canadian, and we couldn't even see the guacomole! But the subs come drenched in ranch dressing... to hide the flavourlessness and lack of toppings. And the meat in the sandwich was 3 slices thick, I mean wot a whole 100 grams of meat for $10??? This chain seems to think tomatos and other veggies are made of gold, we are used to subway which allows lots of fresh toppings. Plus why hide your sandwiches from the customers view? Very dodgy. I mean for $10 or less even, you can eat at a sit in non fast food restaurant and have a sandwich/burger served with a side of fries or salad... This fast food place which charges more then most restaurants do for their sandwich entrees, is really bad value for the money and their product isn't even good! At least subway always has 2 for 1 coupons out, and their food is healthier as they use less meat and cheese and offer more veggie toppings even cucumber slices and grated carrot. I hope this chain dies, its a blight on the food landscape.
