JJ Redick is not the best athlet on college hoop, certainly not the best player (not yet), but he is great because of three things, and in that order: Heart, head, and hands. 1. He plays with heart. Anyone who watched the game that Duke lost to Wake has to agree. His last 3 minutes of heroics, after playing the whole game without sitting down, and with the game looking like lost for certain, was nothing but heart. 2. He plays smart, and by doing so, overcomes some lack of athleticism. He won't fly by people on a drive since he lacks the speed with the ball, but he knows that he is a great FT shooter and defenders are weary of that fact. He more often gets passing room for a good assist. As much as I admire JJ, I don't think his success in driving to the basket attest to his ability to do so. I agree that he has improved a lot, and is no longer a pure shooter, but he is able to drive because of a calculated gamble of the defender - compared to his 3's and FT's, his drives are the least lethal. But being a smart player with great work ethic, this will no doubt in futher improved by next year, and he will be the great player he can be. On defense, he does well by reading the offense to bet into passing lane. 3. Great shooting hands. His 3 pt average is not the best, but you can't compare his with someone who would shoot a 3 only when wide open. His 3 pointers is one of the primary weapons of Duke's offense, and defenders (ACC best in nation) knows to shut him down. And the fact that after playing 40', he can still make those guarded 3's and FT's attests to that.
