The greatest quaterback of all time. Played when seasons were only 12 games, and it was much harder to pass than it is now. Had all the major passing records when he retired. His passing rating seems only average now because of rule changes that have made passing easier. Put pro football on the map with his daring play-calling in the 1958 sudden death championship game against the N.Y.Giants. Won 3 M.V.P. awards,and in 2000 was voted as footballs greatest quaterback of all-time,ahead of such stars as Joe Montana and Dan Marino! Was a true leader on the field who called all his own plays. His record of throwing touchdown passes in 47 straight games may never be broken!
