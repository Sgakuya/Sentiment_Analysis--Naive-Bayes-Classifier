Absolutely brilliant album. So many nuances. Ridiculously intricate polyrhythms. Profound lyrics that do not recycle pop emotion, but reflect deep states of being that are only present in true art. many melodic themes explored on the guitar and bass which are exceptionally pleasant, yet not dominating - they work seamlessly with the other instruments to create a balanced sound. maynard's voice is at once soothing and expressing the most intense gut-wrenching feelings. by far the best rock growl out there today - just listen to his 25 second tour de force at the end of The Grudge . danny carey is perhaps the most talented rock drummer out there - crisp, intricate rhythms that accent the music perfectly. I could go on forever...but just take my word for it and BUY THIS ALBUM!!
