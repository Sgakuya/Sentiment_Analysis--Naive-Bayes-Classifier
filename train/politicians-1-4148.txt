I have a real problem with the Ralphman. whatever public good he did back in the day for consumers has been thrown down the drain when he handed bush the election by steeling important votes and making states like florida swing towards bush. He also heavily distorted the truth when he said bush and gore were the same. I agree with liberal activist gloria steinem when she says she's never seen two candidates differ so much on so many issues in such a long time. on the issues of education, gay rights, reproductive rights, environmental policy, sex education programs, and even minimum wage, gore was much much better.. Ralph is a conniving oppertunist, who stole his platform from the socialists, and overall sucks... thank-u ralph ( for your holier than thou attitude, and for putting bush, and ashcroft in power. You liar, son of a-aaggggghhhhh i'll stop here
