Gillian Anderson is the most wonderul actress and person in the world!!! I've idolized her for five and a half years! I've met her six times and five of them have been within the last 7 months. She's truly an amazing actress and has been for all 7 seasons of the X-Files and still is now in the eighth and House of Mirth was the best movie I've ever seen and she definitely deserves to win an Oscar for it!!! She even invited my friend and I to the set and we got to spend a lot of time with her and she was sooo nice!!! We gave her a scrapbook of letters from fans and she sent an autograph to all of them! And about a month after the set, she wrote my friend and I a letter and when we saw her about 4 weeks ago, she recognized us and walked over and hugged us. She's such an amazing person and does so much support for causes like AIDS and NF (which her younger brother has). SHe loves her fans and is always so kind to them. Just look at how she was to us, u can read our stories on our site at http://www.geocities.com/dana_muldur/regas.html She's just incredible and deserves all five stars if not more!!!!!!
