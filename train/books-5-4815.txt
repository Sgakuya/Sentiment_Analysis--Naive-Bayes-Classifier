okay, people need to stop complaining that it was long and boring because although the former is true, the latter is utterly and grossly wrong. the only downside to the length of the novel was that the suspense was at times unbearable. but that's what made the book so d@mned brilliant. the chapters about whaling, though _at_ _times_ a bit tedious, were very interesting and informative of a dead and forgotten craft. there was wisdom on every page, abounding with small inconsequential quotes that were so beautifully true they have made indelible imprints on my mind. there is so much about the book that is wonderful, so that to complain about it's length and call it BORING strikes me, personally, as smallminded and boorish. don't diss the book because you have a short attention span.
