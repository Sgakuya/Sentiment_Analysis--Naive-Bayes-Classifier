Please tell me we didn't forget the nails! I mean, we are gonna crucify this talented, kind, beautiful woman for the use of free speech, right? Incredible actress who has been outperforming most others for over twenty years now. But, hell, like you said...let's lynch her for giving a damn about people who don't have as much as she does. Boy, and I hate to see genuine passion in another human being...how rude! Some of you Bush-whackers are a bit odd. I mean, I could see you displaying this much venom if maybe, well, you had lost. But you didn't. What the hell do you care what an extremely talented actress had to say about wanting you to elect a liar, rather than a moron?
