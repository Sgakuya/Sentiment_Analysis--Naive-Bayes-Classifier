Close your eyes and dream of England. From the buzzing metropolis that is London with its palaces, theatres, parks, the River Thames, London Eye, fashio and internatinal cuisine and 500 spoken languages... a history going back hundreds of years to the broad plains of Salisbury and the mystical Stonehenge to the ancient walled Roman and Viking city of York. Or there's the Peak District full of wild heather and running streams and old villages to the Lake District with it's rolling green hills and freshwater lakes to Northumberland on the rocky northeast coast where Christianity first landed - the ancient monastries. Or the rugged cliffs and sheer drops of the north Devon coast or the ancient mystical homeland of King Arthur - Cornwall - with it's rocky cliff tops and the ancient ruins of Tintagel. The flat fens and wheatfields of Norfolk, the white cliffs of Dover, the university cities of Oxford and Cambridge with their many spires and ancient seats of learning, the spectacular New Forest and Sherwood Forest of Robin Hood fame, or the Georgian splendour of the ancient city of Bath, vibrant reborn cities of Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Bristol, Birmingham....., long winding sleepy canals, HadriansWall - the northern most boundary of the Roman Empire, the county of Kent - the garden of England - with thatched roofed villages and climbing roses.... Close your eyes and think of England
