For years and years I called this my favorite novel; in my twenties I identified with Ivan, the tortured intellectual, with his rebellion against God and a world which permitted suffering. Only later did I realize that Alyosha was the true hero, Alyosha the gentle mystic, the one who understood compassion. His scene under the stars where he gives thanks to the earth that gave him birth ranks as one of the most beautiful things ever written, and I now see that Ivan represented something that Dostoyevsky left behind himself, probably the part of him that died as he waited for the firing squad. (He was reprieved, sent to Siberia, and only after his return did he write his four great novels, C&P, Karamazov, the Possessed, the Idiot)
