I didn't watch her TV program much, so I can't comment on her acting skills. I will say that her talk show is fun and entertaining. But as evidenced by the previous comment on Ellen Degeneres, some people are so bigoted they feel she should simply wear sackcloth and ashes or climb under a rock because she happens to be gay. Being honest about her sexuality makes her nasty..pushing her immorality in front of you. She is nowhere near as vocal about her sexual orientation as Rosie O'Donnell. The reviewer also threw in a crack at Bill Clinton, whom fundamentalists dub as the antichrist. From this point of view, anyone deviating from the white-bread, white button down shirt, conservative Protestant Republican point of view is destined for hell's flames and thus totally worthless. What a shame that these self-righteous types don't seem to take Jesus and the Apostle Paul seriously, who advocated love, forgiveness, and tolerance.
