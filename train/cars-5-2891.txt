Perhaps later versions of the Chevrolet Camaro SS were subpar, but many have forgotten about the Camaros from 1967-69. The Camaros of this era were amongst the greatest muscle cars ever, and the Camaro SS was many teenagers' dream car. Driving one of these beauties to the line was to literally throw down the gauntlet against the car right next to it. And as far as the greatest Camaro year, 1969? This was the year the great dealer-custom Camaros (with the COPO package) came out. Ever heard of Nickey or Berger? Surely, every Camaro afficionado's jaw would drop at the sight of a Yenko 427. In short, the models of this great, bygone era of the Camaros- especially the famed SS- was never again duplicated (nor can it ever be).
