I moved up to Connecticut from Florida three weeks ago to take a job in Groton. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was with the area. Businesses close down way too early and the area has a very blue collar industrialized fel to it. Some may be comfortable in this environment but its just not my cup of tea. The people in the state seem unfriendly and preoccupied with themselves and rather glum overall. I didn't see much of Bridgeport-New Haven except what I saw from the highway and that was enough for me to draw some negative conclusions about the area. I've heard mixed things about Hartford. In defense, there are some beautiful small towns in places (esp. the southeast coastal areas like Mystic and Pawcatuck) but the urban areas and region around Norwich and the casinos have a very depressed feel to them. Of all New England states I like Connecticut the least. Rhode Island has more of a beach environment and more energy than does Connecticut. Get me the hell out of this state!
