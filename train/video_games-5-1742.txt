Whilst KoC is one of the more popular online games, the secret of getting the most out of it is to build an army. The more recruits you have, the more gold you earn per turn. There are several ways of doing this, but you will get there sooner if you have others to help you. Joining a clan is one option. They will look after their own, but you are tied to one group. There are lots to choose from, and you can find many of them on the boards of GUA here: http://www.giveupalready.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=23 This is a forum dedicated to KoC, with lots of advice and help. Another way is to try Link Chains. These are unique and allow you to build your army as fast or as slowly as you like. Again, it is forum-based, you will need to join here http://www.neo.4ever.cc/ but these do not entail your joining a clan or alliance, all you need do is register and then use their chains to build your army to whatever size you feel would suit you. Another option is to find a Clickmaster. This is something which you join, click on all the links of the other members, leave your link behind and hope they click on yours. lt's a lot of clicking in one go, so if you don't have time or prefer to stay in control of your numbers (and your options), you might want to stick with the Link Chains instead.
