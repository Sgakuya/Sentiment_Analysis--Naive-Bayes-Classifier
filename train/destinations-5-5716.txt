florida may not be perfect, but then again, no state is perfect. i live in chicago and have to tell those of you; if you think people drive recklessly in florida, think of this; drivers are 75 to 200 times worse in illinois than they are in florida. certain places may be expensive, but there are plenty of places in central and south florida that you can find a house as low as $80,000. (though i do have to warn you, house prices are rising rapidly in florida, especially south of lake okechobee.) from what i have heard, politics are improving, crime rates are way down in many areas. but other than that, locals are extremely nice, even to the point of waving at me from their cars, even to the point that i even got a hug from one of my waitresses! (how sweet!!!) for florida's hospitality, i'd have to give florida 12 stars! beaches are great, florida has some really beautiful nature and wildlife preserves. not to mention, unlike illinois, florida's services for people with disabilities have improved TREMENDOUSLY over the past 8 years!!! (in 1998, when florida was ranked, it ranked 48th out of 50 for services for people with disabilities, and then in 2002, florida was ranked again and this time ranked 37th out of 50 for services for people with disabilities, and in 2004, 31st out of 50. illinois, by the way, ranked 47th out of 50 in 2004---and illinois was the 7th richest state in the nation!!!) as for summertime temps, they don't get much hotter than in the midwest/great plains; in fact there are plenty of days for instance that it's even hotter in chicago than it is in miami or even key west! (of course, want really hot and blistering temps, go to arizona! ha ha ha! lol)
