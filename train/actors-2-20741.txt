This is the kind of actress that other actors probably hate to be cast with, as she tries to steal every scene she's ever been in, either on TV or in her few movie roles. Her mugging for the camera is quite obnoxious. She can be quite funny, but more often she isn't. Also, even though it has nothing to do with her acting skills, she's one of those Scientology nutjobs. She has denied that AIDS is even a disease, it's more of a state of mind she said. Which is pretty absurd, and calls into question anything else that she utters. I used to like her when Dharma and Greg first came out, but she has been harping on the same string for a number of years now, and I have long since lost interest.
