I loved it. You don't go to Club Med expecting the Four Seasons. But the location, the water, and the variety of activities make up for this place. The food is good, but gets a little old after a while. The dining experience is great however if you are in to meeting new people. Scuba diving is fantastic (the resort course gets you out there experiencing the wall in no time). The trapeze, yes trapeze, is more fun than you can imagine at first. You really do get hooked trying to hit the catch . A lot of people from New York - a lively bunch. And more women than men, more singles than couples. Expect to be a little kooky. It is fun.
