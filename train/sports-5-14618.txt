My 1st hero in life was Roger the Dodger and I really think there is enough evidence proving he is the best QB of all time if not one of the greatest 3 players of all-time. He served his country in Vietnam, Never had a losing season, went to 4 superbowls, Won 10 games in a row and slammed dunked the Dolphins in the superbowl his 1st season as taking over at QB. This is a religious man who loves his country and imagine if he would of played 4 years earlier? Where would dallas be, with 4 or 5 rings in the 70's? This is a man who won the Hiesman when it ment something. Roger was not Captain Comeback for anything. Everytime he played Dallas always had a chance to win. How many people can you say that of today.
