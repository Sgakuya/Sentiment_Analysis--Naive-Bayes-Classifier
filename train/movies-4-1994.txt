Just got through watching this for the first time, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing, and a couple of genuinely scary moments. It leaves some loose threads about the neighbors strange behavior and it does get a tiny bit predictable, i.e., backing from one room to another and turning to find someone right there behind them, or closing a door only to find someone right behind it. That trick has been used a few hundred times, but it doesn't take away nor does it add to this one. The top notch acting of Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford, and a better-than-average screenplay and make this one a cut above the rest of this genre.
