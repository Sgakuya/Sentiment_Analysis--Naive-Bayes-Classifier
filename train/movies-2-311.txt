Oh my God! What a load of bullcrap! I could admit that it has a pretty good action sequence, but it is definitely absolutely the most historically incorrect movie I`ve ever seen! It is rated R, although in my opinion, it should be rated C, as in Cliche. It is so cliche, it`s not even funny. However, my brother and I had fun watching it simply because it was great to make fun of as it went. Some lines are so stereotypical, it`s impossible not to make fun of them. We also thought of numerous alternative endings to this movie. The action scenes were quite good, I could give it that, but the SFX could have been better... much better (esp. the tiger). And were they trying to compensate for poor plot by making each fighting scene a virtual bloodbath? And come on, what acting? How can you even take the characters seriously when the plot is so unrealistic? The script was incredibly flat and predictible, and honestly, so was the storyline. How oh how did I know that Maximus was going to die the first time I saw him? I think its because I have what they call the shine... Which is also the reason I knew that he and Lucilla were gonna fall in love. Braveheart, anyone? A dead wife, a dead son... need I say more? The point I`m making here is that there are already so many movies like that, why add to human suffering by making another one?
