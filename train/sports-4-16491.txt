I don't give out 5s and 4s to players who have only played two games. Ask me again at the end of this season, assuming he even starts another game between now and then. He's done alright, but nothing special. He was a great value for the Steelers since he was a rookie free agent, but not much of a worthy starter in my book. UPDATE: I've watched him play some more and really like him. He's a shifty, speed-oriented runner. He doesn't have much in terms of power though. He needs a power oriented backup, like Jerome Bettis, in order to be really successful. Whether this be a running fullback or a spell back or a combination is important. I don't think I could ever rate him a 5 for the simple lack of power, but he is easily a 4 already.
