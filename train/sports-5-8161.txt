Half-Man Half-Amazing is one of the greatest players in the NBA today! He has so much talent, potential, and he is very unique! What makes him so great is his ability to take a defender off the dribble and just bury them off the jump shot or simply dunking over them!!! Many people doubted him and didn't believe he could shoot the ball and he has proven them all wrong! Vince pulls up and shoots the three so lovely in defenders face or pull up to shoot the fifteen foot jumper! Also, I admire Vince attitude towards the game! I see eagerness within him to learn more and more about the game and to learn from his mistakes. During interviews I always hear him talk about his teammates and how they play together to win ball games. He is not a selfish player! Its all about winning together as a team to Vince! I don't like to compare Vince to Michael Jordan because he is Vince Carter not Michael Jordan! He has already established an image in the NBA and no one will forget Half-Man Half-Amazing!!!! I wish him and the Raptors much luck in the playoffs this year! I know that they will make it far as long as they rebound the ball, get easy baskets, and everyone play on one accord!
