For the last 5 years, I used to drink the same brand of coffee back in my home country (Turkey.) But, I'm here in the US for more than a year now. As my coffee is a very important element of my day, I've been trying almost every single brand out there. They weren't even close! Then when we went to Jamaica for our third anniversary, I tasted the best and softest coffee ever, the Blue Mountain. When we came back from our short trip, I continued my research of Great Coffee. (Of course, by then I didnt know I could find the Blue Mountain Coffee at the World Markets.) One day on my way to the school, late and in a hurry I had to stop by the only gas station on my way, BP. I made a very quick choice and went with the Fat Free French Vanilla. What a blast! After one year and half of experimental search of Dream Coffee, I've accidentally found it! Since then even though I know where to find the smoothest coffee ever and can get it right from my kitchen I'm paying two to three daily visits to the nearest BP station to have my Precious Fat Free French Vanilla cure to start or keep up with a great day !
