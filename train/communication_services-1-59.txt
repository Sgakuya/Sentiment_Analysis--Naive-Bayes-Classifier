Qwest is one of the worst of th Baby Bells as far as customer service is concerned. Have had to argue with second and third-level management just the get hung up on before my issue was even addressed. As for their phone service, I'd have to nerf them again for this simple fact: I live 1 (ONE) block from a Qwest service substation, yet my neighborhood will not certify for DSL for a couple more years at least until they get off their lazy behinds and finally lay fiber. So I get to pay $15.00 more for Cox that is twice as fast at least then DSL (sorta break-even). Now if I can get Cox to properly support those of us who use a router to get the whole house online via the modem....
