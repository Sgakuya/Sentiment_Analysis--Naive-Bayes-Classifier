I have always considered the northeast of the US to be a decaying, dirty, unlivable part of the country. I was quite shocked to visit Columbus and realize how this city doesn't fit that stereotype. Columbus is a large city (1.5M metro) and has all the conveniences of a large city, but feels more like a large town. The real shocker for me about Columbus is the fact that it actually has a good economy, unlike the other countless armpits of Ohio (Cleveland, Toledo, and Dayton). The pro-sports scene is getting a lot better here, the nightlife is always good, and the distinct villages here give Columbus some real style. Right behind Boston, Columbus is the best college town in the country. Ten+ years ago Columbus was a sleeper town, but now Columbus has finally grown up. Mayor Coleman's plan for the future of Columbus makes me more anxious to stay here after I graduate.
