For some moments in life, there are no words... such was the day I walked into the liquor store next door to my work, and Mike (the guy behind the counter) handed me a can of Skoal Peach when he saw me put down the can of Skoal Apple I'd selected. I bought it and back to work, where I handed it silently to my dipping buddy, whereupon we dropped to our knees and reveled in anticipation of the glorius peachy-good buzz we were about to recieve. Don't get me wrong, I love the naturals... Red Man, Copenhagen (with a tiny splash of bourbon, even better), Skoal Straight... and I appreciate the real-manlieness of all those products, but there's just something about Skoal Peach and Apple that is so so good.
