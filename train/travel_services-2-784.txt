First of all I do have to admit the delays at times are downright frustrating (though I had very little delay getting to work at 6am this morning) and the arbitrary closings of certain lines particularly the 6 every damn Saturday drives me up a freaking wall... But what do you expect for 2 bucks? Everytime they try and raise this ridiculously low rate commuters cry bloody murder- meanwhile the unions bilk the system for obnoxious pay rates so these fat lazy asses can sit in a box sell Metrocards and give poor directions. As long as the government runs it and the unions control the system by the balls we will all continue to get crammed into repugnant cattle cars in this poorly run system.
