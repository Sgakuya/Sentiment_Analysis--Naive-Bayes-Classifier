One of the classiest, if not THE classiest NBA players ever. In a day and age where NBA athletes will forsake their franchise and fans at the drop of a dime for a few dollars more and complain they only earn 14 million dollars a year instead of 16, Stockton is one of the few shining examples left of unselfishness, not just in his team play but his loyalty to the Jazz for not very much money. Never complained about not earning what he was worth and he was very injury-free for 20 years and always gave 110%. He made everyone around him better and was a great team leader and excellent point guard. Hail to the all-time leader in steals and assists. The NBA will be a lot stupider and bleaker realm without him playing anymore.
