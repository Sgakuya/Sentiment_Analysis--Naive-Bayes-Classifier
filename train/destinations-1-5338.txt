What I have seen of PA, the state is horrible. I have never met such narrow minded, unfriendly, unhappy people anywhere. It has to be the dirtiest state I have ever been to. There is trash everywhere, the streets, the sidewalks - everywhere. No one seems to care nor do anything to improve it or even pick up their own trash. It is a very depressing place - dont bother going there. If you are looking for Amish - go to Ohio and stay away from Lancaster. The traffic is horrible and there are way too many outlet malls, what does an outlet mall have to do with the Amish community? Nothing. The service in restuarants is awful, no one knows the meaning of customer service nor do they care because they are so unhappy.
