I always liked Paul Neuman. But since i read that he has personally given his support to a no good piece of garbage cop killer by the name of Abu-Jamal. This piece of crap is now in a PA prison on death row. The only reason that he has not drawn his last breath on this earth is because of people like Paul Neuman, who along with some of his Hollywood croonies such as Susan Sarandon, Spike Lee, Oliver Stone John Landis. Just to name a few. Together, these Hollywood marvels are not satisfied in just doimg what they are being paid for, Acting, they find it necessary to come down from their irory towers and interceed on behalf of this puss pot. Hey, I got a great idea for them, why not come to the aid and support of the fine men women who protect their asses every day. Shame, Shame on you Mr. Newman......
