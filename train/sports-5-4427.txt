Frankly, I personally cannot stand the looks like a rat smelling blue cheese Coach Mike Krzyzewski; however, he is clearly one of the best coaches, if not the best college basketball coach today. To his credit, Coach K has generally recruited based on who will be a good college player as opposed to who will be the best pro (as evidenced by the pro careers of the Duke alumni, or actually the lack of same). On the downside, Coach K abandoned his team when he had a loser in the early 1990's (and we will just have to wait and see if his back hurts enough again under similar circumstances) and he has not really been all that innovative; however, these latter points would go against him in an all time greatest list, not this current ratings list. Some comments have claimed that Duke players leave early, but the reality is the exact opposite. Duke players have historically stayed through their senior years (though there have been some recent exceptions), as opposed to a school like North Carolina which has suffered from many early departures to the pros. Also other comments have noted that Duke teams have poise and discipline, but this is actually somewhat of a myth as well. Historically, Duke teams have been very undisciplined and unsportsmanlike in losses, though they have improved some in recent years. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that one cannot argue much with success, and Coach K runs a clean and winning program.
