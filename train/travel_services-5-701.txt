I was really impressed by National's service this week. My husband left his dress coat in a car he returned to National in Nashville yesterday. Realizing his mistake, he called me from an airplane yesterday afternoon to ask me to track it down. (What am I, his secretary?) Anyway, I called the office and explained the problem. I was told that no items had been sent to the lost and found, but that they would investigate and get back to me. Within 30 minutes, they called me back to say that they had located the coat. Apparently they shipped the coat to me immediately because I received it this morning, before my husband returned from his trip. Now that's what I call service!
