You can't study Lincoln and not be awestruck by his ability to knock the legs out from under his opponents with the ease of his brilliant wit. It is by no coincidence that many things he did not say are attributed to him because of their Lincoln-esque nature. Much of what did during the war would not be tolerated in peace then, nor under any circumstance now. But he did what he had the power to do, in order to do what he saw as his solemn duty, even knowing that by doing so he was cutting ever deeper into his own political capital. His dogged determination to find a General to prosecute the war (which he knew that the North could so easily win) kept the South from the improbable task of prolonging it into a political settlement (can you say Vietnam?). Had not his life been cut shoty by the irony of a mad Southerner, I am convinced that a post-war Lincoln would have been better for the South than the soon-to-be-impeached Johnson. His policies would have made unnecessary the Harrison-Tilden election compromise which caused grief deep into the 20th century. An utterly fascinating man, and a giant among the club of 42.
