The best video game system. Ever. EVER! Nintendo 64 is a close second for playing host to Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark. Even though the PS2 was released a good two years before X-Box, it still blew X-Box away with it's already established line up of old generation Playstation games. And I was taken aback to see the X-Box when it came out only to realize that even though it had two years to improve upon the PS2 it still wasn't anything special - same graphics, online play, yet far fewer games. And the Playstation 2 is THE system of choice for anyone who's had their fill of Nintendo's tireless post-N64 efforts to make nothing but games for Kindergarten birthday parties. Since the PS2 accepts old Playstation games, users have access to all old and new games like Grand Theft Auto, Driver, Gran Turismo, and several others that aren't afraid to reach out to older audiences, ones that can handle violence and [GASP!] profanity without soiling themselves. The Gamecube, unfortunately has fallen way short of this. My plans of buying a Gamecube went down the pisser after I realized that Microsoft (micro and soft?, needs Viagra!) purchased Rare (Developer of Goldeneye and Perfect Dark), which means that Gamecube gets shafted so X-Box can have Perfect Dark Zero.
