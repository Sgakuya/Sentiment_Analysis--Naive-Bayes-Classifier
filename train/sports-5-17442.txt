In my humble opinion one of the GRRRREATEST franchises to ever grace the sport. An original AFL team and the ONLY team to go to four Super Bowls IN A ROW! NO other team can lay claim to that. While Buffalo may never have won the big one they had the second-best winning record in football during the 1990s (only San Francisco was better). Tom Sestak, Billy Shaw, Joe DeLamiellure, Conrad Dobler, O.J., Joe Ferguson, Joe Devlin, Freddie Smerlas, Steve Freeman, Joe Cribbs, The Electric Company, The Bermuda Triangle, Jimmy Haslett, Ralph Wilson, Marv Levy, Jim Kelly, Andre Reed, Thurman Thomas, Howard Ballard, Kent Hull, Scotty Norwood, Darryl Talley, Bruce Smith---the list of the red-white and blue could go on forever. Right now the Bills are playoff material but not Super Bowl contenders. LET'S GO BUFFALO!!!!!
