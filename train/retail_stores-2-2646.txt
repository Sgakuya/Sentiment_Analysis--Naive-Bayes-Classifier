I work for a Kroger subsidary store and it is horrible. Kroger promotes its employees to get an education, but when I tried to take a leave of absense to fullfil my manditory studyabroad requirment, they made me quite. They hired me back when I returned, and gave me more responsiblities, but wouldn't increase my pay. Moral amongst employess are pathetic and will get worse. We got all employee funds cut. We have no more X-mas party, we have to pay for our own daily papers, and of course we have to buy are stupid ugly uniforms. Corporate just rolled at a new payscale, which will surly bring in noithing but morons to cashier and sack. At a whopping starting wage of 5.24 an hour and topping out at $8 it doesn't matter how many stupid computer programs or training sessions they put us through nobody works hard when you have no reason to. Finally, prices are a joke along with that Kroger card. After so many years of the stupid card you think things would be a little easier today and people would understand the sytem. That doesn't happen though cause Kroger now runs adds that will not give you the sale price on certain products unless you purchase and addtional $10 of grocerys. Of course if you purches 10.09 worth of grocery's and you scan your card it dips below $10 and you don't get the discount anyways. KROGER SUCKS BAD
