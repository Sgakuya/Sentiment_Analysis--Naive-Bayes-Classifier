Few people can take a really bad movie like Big Business and make it an enjoyable movie experience (not to short change Lilly Tomlin who was also hilarious in this film). She may not have the range of a Meryl Streep or Bette Davis, but along the way she has proven that she has a certain amount of ability to be convincing ( The Rose ). As far as I m concerned her biggest asset is simply that she is one of the most naturally talented people in show biz and that includes her great voice as well as her acting ability. The move to television didn t work for her because, like Nathan Lane (who also bombed on the tube) we re talking way too much talent and energy to be contained or fully appreciated within such a small, limited space.
