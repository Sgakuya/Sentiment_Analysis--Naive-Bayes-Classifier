The University of South Carolina is an outstanding institution for several reasons. First, the choices are endless. As the flagship state university, USC offers majors in over 100 fields, ranging from the Liberal Arts to Business to Mathematics Science. The strongest areas are Business and the Liberal Arts (Gov't Int'l Studies is particularly strong). Other programs, like Chemistry and Engineering, are up-and-coming. Second, the people are fantastic. Everyone, from the admissions officers to professors instructors to guidance counselors, are friendly and ready to help. Fellow students are the best around, with more and more Northern accents mixed in with the Southern drawls (everyone is welcome here!). And third, the weather and location can't be beat. You're a two-hour drive via interstate to the best beaches around, and a two-hour drive to the mountains and skiing. Worth a brief mention is the fact that USC Gamecock athletics are definitely on the rise, with nationally recognized programs in Mens Womens Basketball, Baseball, and Football (plus, you get to see a legend, Lou Holtz, roam the sidelines on Saturdays!). I'm most proud of the 4 years I spent here, as well as the degree I received. The University of South Carolina--a world of opportunity awaits.
