This is the Castlevania game nintendo gamers have been wantingfor a long while. Clastlevania 64 was all right. However, it never could live up to C1, 2, and SuperC4. We use to have to rely on the PS for good C games. The wait is now over. You'll definitely not even think of dropping this game until you have at least beaten it at least once. Even then, that will require many hours spent with the portable one. The only complaint about this game is the lighting. Everything on the screen is very dark from the characters to the backgrounds. Be forwarned to see a place iwth eithera bright light or lots of lights to play this (watch out for the glare as well). Other than that, it's a killer game. Hopefully, they'll soon have a game out like this for the gamecube. Tehn we won't have to worry about that pesky glare.
