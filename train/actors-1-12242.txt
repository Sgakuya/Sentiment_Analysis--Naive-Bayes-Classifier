She's ok, pretty face, no doubt. As far as her acting abilities,she is mediocre at best. There are many female actresses more talented and equally attractive as Halle Berry. Did she deserve the Oscar, for her work in Monster's Ball? I don't think so. All she did was expose herself for all the world to see,and she was adamant about making sure she played those parts, no body doubles used. I think this was not a good decision. I don't see how the movie got anyway with just an R rating, it was plain pornography. She makes bad career choices, like her decision to do Catwoman, which many leading actresses avoided, including Angela Bassett. The movie has turned out to be a total flop. It's a shame to see her have to compromise her integrity and self respect just to make it big in Hollywood. Hollywood has a history of using people and quickly discarding them also the public is very fickle. I think Halle Berry has reached her apex and it's straight downhill from this point onward. She gravitates toward skin parts and at 38, her age is definitely against her. Hopefully she will rise above the recent personal problems in her life,it's true what they say fame cost a lot, it sure has in Halle's case .
