We just bought a 2003 RL and it is the not only the best car I have ever driven but the best car I have ever RIDDEN in . . . PERIOD!!! Do not believe the negative comments about its lack of power, 225 horses aren t enough???? It is assembled like a bank vault and every, button control and amenity works like a fine Swiss watch. The sound system will blow your socks off and just roll up the widows and put on an opera or classical cd and drive, you will soon have tears in your eyes, just like in the film Pretty Woman!! This car is an absolute oasis of tranquility, elegant design and culture in a world of beer and boorishness. Although the manual suggests premium fuel, it runs great on high quality regular. Don t try one or you will buy it!! Forget the Lincolns, Lexus, BM_YUPS, Devilles, Grand Marquis, Mercedes and the like. Try the RL after you have suffered in these and you will understand what fine engineering is all about. The automotive press has given this masterpiece a bum rap but unfortunately who reviews the reviewers? Only small, unknown owners like my wife and I sigh
