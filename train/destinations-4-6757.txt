Idaho has diverse country. In the north you will find beautiful mountains full of pine trees, lakes, rivers, and creeks. Very lush. In Central idaho, near Lewiston you will find wonderfully pleasant winters, the Snake River meeting w/the Clearwater, rural communities, lots of trails for biking and Hells Gate. In southern Idaho well its pretty darn flat and boring but there is always Boise. The further you get down south the closer you get to Utah and yes its a conservative state and there are a lot of mormons esp. down South. Its not expensive to live here either ...you can find a nice house for about 150,000. Not a high crime rate either. They hate people from California though. I am originally from Idaho but I've lived in Washington, California, and now in Germany. I've been through Arizona many times, Oregan many times (my husband is from there) and over to New York and Maryland, and Massachussets recently. I haven't ever been down south yet. I would have to give North Idaho 5 stars because there is something for everyone...Spokane WA is nearby and also the outdoor recreation through the state is just crazy. Southern idaho is pretty dang ugly though...Sorry! Like I said, atleast they have Boise. And I don't even know if you can say much for that.
