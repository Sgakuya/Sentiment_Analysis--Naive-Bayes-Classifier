 b The Plot /b You must be the best pod racer in the galaxy! To do this, you can choose from a bunch of pod racers to start, earn cash for the races that you win, and upgrade your pod racer. b Graphics /b This game has awesome graphics. You see the racecourse in crystal clear detail as you speed down it at 600 miles per hour! The expansion pak adds to the clarity. There is only one draw back though: there are very few details in the walls and the walls can be square shaped. b Sound /b Excellent and pure Sound is included in this game. Star Wars in labeled on every note and rhythm. There are so many sound effects too! From Explosions to Insults, this game has it all. b Game Play /b The controls in this game are amazing! The pod racer can do almost anything including accelerating and braking. There is also this cool booster engine that can blast the pod racer to almost 700 miles per hour! b Replay Value /b There isn't much as for Replay. Once you finish the game, there is nothing to do but start over. b Bugs in the Programming /b I could find no bugs in the game. The game doesn't lockup either. b Conclusion /b Basically, this game is one of the better racing games for the 64.
