My mother purchased a used 1989 Ford Taurus in 1994 with 52,000 miles on it. The transmission became defective the first year. The following year, it stalled during a hot day and left my mother stranded coming home from a trip up north. You would have to put premium gas in it once in a great while, otherwise it will stall if you leave it idling in drive for too long. My sister worked for AAA as a dispatcher, and she said their was a lot of breakdown calls on Ford Tauruses. I was reading a newspaper some time ago, and their was a classified ad for a transmission shop that had a special rates for Taurus and Sable vehicles. My brothers friend is a mechanic, and he even said the transmissions were junk. Everyone i know who had a Taurus, had transmissions replaced. I dont mind the Ford trucks, i am just wary of the cars. I am proud to be a GM man. This vehicle meets the definition: FIX OR REPAIR DAILY! Pretty sad.
