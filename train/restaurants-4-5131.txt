Of all these neighborhood bar-restaurant-grill-sports bar-confused chains that have opened since Cheers was on tv, I like this one the best. While the food is not world-class or fine dining (and is also not presented or touted as such), their salads are creative and delicious and a lot of their other choices are also excellent and satisfying. Next to Chili's this is one of the better operations out there. Unpretentious, decent service, decent value for dollar, and not trying to constantly be all things to all people. A good, solid choice and definitely worth dropping in on if you are in the neighborhood, but by no means a destination location or spectacular meal.
