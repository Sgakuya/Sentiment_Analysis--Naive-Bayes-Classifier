This game is just so fabulous and addicting.At the beginning,your grandfather had been running a farm and passed away of old age.You want to take his place so after awhile your father(who is a lawyer)decides that you can take it over.You get to have your own dog and horse and enter them in races,you can get cows,sheep and chickens.You can grow eggplants,turnips,potatoes,cabbage,grass,tomatoes,corn,3 types of flowers,and strawberries.There are tons of great festivals.New years(where you have to *out-drink* people)gatherings,Cow festivals(get prizes if you have the best groomed cow with really good milk) and thanksgiving festivals(girls who like you come to your farm and give you cakes) and much much MUCH more!You must be a boy,your original name is Jack,but you can name him whatever you want.You can pick between 5 girls to marry.(Anne who likes animals,Elli who likes food,Karen who likes wine,Maria who likes books and Popouri who likes flowers.Each have their own extremely different personalities and you have to pick the right one to marry...now of course you don't have to marry but I find it's better unless its too much work for you.Once you're with a wife you have to stay with her a long time(you can get divorced but then you may never be with another girl)and you have to treat her VERRRY nicely everyday.You can still stay close with your other lady-friends but always treat your wife the best.You can also have a baby who can learn to talk(in full-sentences).I married Popouri(Poe-Poo-Ree)and I have a kid called Sage(It will always be a boy).I am very rich(hehe)and I have 3 cows,3 sheep and 6 chickens.But it won't always be the same.It's you who decides everything that happens.GET THIS GAME it really really rocks.Tonzo stuff to do!I play it every day!Oh and one more thing-Karen(wine-drinking girl) MIGHT move away if you don't marry her...just a note...she didn't in my game because she liked me but it may be different for you.There is so much to do in this game and I garuntee you will love it very much or there is something terribly wrong with you!(hehe)See Ya!
