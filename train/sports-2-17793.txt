Steve Spurrier made some very poor decisions this past season. I really think he was wasting his time trying to start Wuerffel and Matthews; in the position the Redskins are in, he would have been better served to have the rookie Ramsey start as many games as possible, to determine whether or not they'll need to draft a QB in an early round. Wuerffel and Matthews have proven that they are sub-par in the NFL and Spurrier's experimenting with them should have ended halfway though the season. Snyder needs to continue spending money to benefit his club, but he truly needs to step away from all personnel decisions. Other than that, I've always had a soft spot for the Skins, and they have a long legacy of being one of the best all-around franchises in the NFL.
