lived here all my life. great city. alot of historic stuff like forts from the fur trade era. and the exchange district covering some 20-30 city blocks all buildings in the area are 80-100+ years old. traffic is mediocre. no freeways but tonnes of potholes. home to 3 sports teams the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian Football league) the Manitoba Moose (American Hockey league) and The Winnipeg Goldeyes (Northern League Baseball) and former home of the NHL's Winnipeg jets (now phoenix coyotes) summer is the best time to visit as that is when its the hottest and when the city looks beutiful but bring lots of mosquito spray as we have a huge mosquito problem. winters are very cold with temperatures around -25C (-13F). if u like to party winnipeg is the place with tonnes of night clubs and big festives like the winnipeg folk festival and folklorama (the worlds biggest multicultural festival) the fringe festival and spirit fest (hosted downtown at canadas most famous intersection of portage and main for a weekend) and Festival Du Voyageur (western canada's largest winter festival. winnipeg is located in the praries and is somewhat isolated as the closest big city is Minneapolis 7 hours south.
