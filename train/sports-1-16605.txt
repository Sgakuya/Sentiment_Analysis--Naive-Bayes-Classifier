There's only one positive thing about him, and that's arm strength but I'll try to say some other nice things. He can throw the ball really deep right into the safety's hands, so it's more like a punt than a straight-out turnover. He has been a pretty consistent player... or at least a pretty consistent interception-throwing machine. I can't even joke about it any more... This dude sucks. UPDATE: If I were a Giants fan, I'd rather have Eli Manning. Eli Manning will eventually be more than just a "good" NFL quarterback. He has all the tools it takes to become a fantastic QB, he just needs time behind center. Meanwhile, you know exactly what you're going to get with Collins. A quarterback who throws up a lot of interceptions. He was tied for the league lead in 2004 in interceptions. That's not my definition of a "good" NFL quarterback.
