The best young coach in the NFL. Together with Tom Modrak, he has taken a team that was absolutely moribund, and turned it into a contender in just two years. Perhaps more important has been his development of Donovan Mcnabb. While everyone - the press, the fans, some players - shouted for Mcnabb to be the immediate starter, Reid stuck to his development plan. Knowing the complexities of the West Coast offense, Reid brought in journey man Doug Pederson to take the heat for most of year one. This allowed Mcnabb to learn the system and the Eagles offensive line to gel. The result of this patience was a playoff caliber team, and an MVP candidate in McNabb.
