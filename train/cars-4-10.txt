'99 Wolverine Complaints first: 1. No pull or kickstart backup. I've yet to need it, but dread the day I do. 2. Fenders are of poor design. I'm getting the aftermarket exstension real soon. I do alot of hunting and I always have mud slung all over my barrel and bow cams when taking it easy in the back country. 3. Very cold natured. The Good Stuff Bad A-- Ride. I had a Warrior in my younger days and the Wolverine does everything and more. I new when they first came out I had to have one. Everyone I ride with owns Honda Utes. No disrespect to Hondas ( i,ve owned them too) but wont see anyone grabbing my front racks and pulling me to the top of the hill!!! If you can't decide between a sport quad and a utility, this is the quad to have. All the speed and response of a sport and the toughness of a 4x4 utility. No need to get long winded ^ I give it a thumbs up with a few hangups (like no stock hitch) RIDE ON!!!!!!!
