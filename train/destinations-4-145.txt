I was there for only a few days last March. I was attending a conference and didn't have much time for sightseeing and shopping. However, I really enjoyed walking around the parts of the city near the conference hotel. The city is still full of old architecture much of which probably won't survive this decade. There are lots of shops catering to the tourist crowd and the prices are quite high - as one might expect near the big hotels. Bargaining is expected and I did buy a few items that I really like including a miniature table-top laquered screen with six sections, each of which portrays a different young woman in traditional dress. Viet Nam is famous for lacquer, but you really have to watch the quality.
