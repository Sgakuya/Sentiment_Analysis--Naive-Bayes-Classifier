**update- say what you will about the commercial but coach k hardly needs a recruiting ploy, he was offered a lot of money to do a commercial and he did it, i cant blame him for that. In recent years Coach K has never had a problem recruiting the best in the country so I really dont think this commercial has anything to do with that issue.**I think it's completely ludicrous that UNC fans would come here and give him poor ratings. I personally gave Dean Smith a 4 because even though i don't like UNC i don't let that affect my opinions. Coach K is one of the best coaches of all time, no matter who you root for. No matter what kind of team he has to deal with (i.e. a team plagued by injuries, the loss of lou deng, and there number one recruit) he still has great seasons. I came into this year with little hope for my blue devils but Kryzewski has coached them to a 22-4 record. He is an excellent coach and my vote for coach of the year. i understand your point lazyland, b/c everyone wants the under god coach to get it. But i guess the reason i feel this is a special year for Coach K is given Duke's total lack of depth he is been able to accomplish some great things. I didnt expect duke to go that far this year, but Coach K proved he could do more than just recruit the right kids this year, he really coached them to their great record
