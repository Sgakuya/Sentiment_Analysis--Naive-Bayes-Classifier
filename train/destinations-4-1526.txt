So many great metal bands come from here, and so many super hot women. It's funny though, that the country with the world's highest per capita consumption of coffee has so many grumpy people. It must be the months of darkness in the winter, because so many people here are miserable and suicidal all the time. Great food, great beer, and did I mention totally kicka$$ metal bands? Also, Helsinki transit buses sell beer on board, which is awesome. The language is quite pleasing to the ear, which is funny since it is quite closely related to Estonian which is harsh and guttural and nasal and ugly. Finnish is also a lot less goofy-sounding than Swedish or Danish.
