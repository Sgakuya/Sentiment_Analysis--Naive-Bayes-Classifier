From someone who has lived in 9 other states, I have to say if you have a choice live somewhere else. Ive lived in Michigan for the last 7 miserable years, and have been missing the sun of Florida and Colorado, the manners of Louisianna and Texas, the skiing of Colorado and Calgary, and the beautiful mountains of Colorado and Arizona. Yes, there are lakes here, but if you dont mind swimming in 50 - 70 degree water in Auguust than hey you've never have been to the Atlantic in December or even August isn't that hot. People here are very cliquey as most have not ever lived anywhere else and it takes a good long time to make your mark. More transient people live in the other states I've lived so they are more ready to make new friends, and invite you into their groups and circles. Once other thing about Michigan people is they are very busy Maybe I am just missing the days when I would call a friend and say, want to hit the beach? And sure enough, they would be ready in 15 minutes. Here in Michigan, its like this, Want to get together and go shopping? Response: Let me check my calendar. No today I have to bring the kids to soccer, tomorrow basketball, next day Brownies,,, on and on it goes. So, if your planning on moving I recommend finding a nice small church, and you'll find one on every corner, with lots of REformed Christian churches out there, and try to share your thoughts with just a few people, as Michiganders do not like hearing about how cloudy their state is or how many fat people live here. Most of all don't call em Yankees even tho thats what they are. Hey I have a Yankee child born here now. Thats what she is... I'm a Texan, confederate and I don't get freaked out about it.
