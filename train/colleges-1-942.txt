UMUC Online and UMUC in Europe have a lot of problems with providing F2F and online education courses, judging from the many student ratings here, on thecomplaintstation, and from internal UMUC docs posted to UMUCDE@yahoogroups.com. I'd say there's a lot of student disenchantment with UMUC courses and programs, and UMUC administration. It looks like UMUC could use a housecleaner for ineffective workers, and get in touch with the students who have posted their suggestions. All the low ratings of UMUC F2F courses, online programs, and administration in Europe have got to be hurting business. BTW, UMUC's hushing the student group wasn't a very cool thing to do. I guess they deserve the low ratings.
