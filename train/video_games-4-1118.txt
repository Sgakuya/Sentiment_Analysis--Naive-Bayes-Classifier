I'm giving it 4 stars for its intended age group; my nephews loved it at the appropriate age. And the instructions (at least the edition my brothers and I had) made explicit provision for the Rube Goldberg device not working: The mouse goes free! * * * Public P.S. for brayden--same as my private message to him(?): Writing an unspaced word that long makes the page expand horizontally, which means that EVERYbody's comments are spread across, which means that readers have to use the scroll bar to see the first and/or last letters. Can you wonder that your otherwise too-brief comment has attracted 9 Unhelpfuls?
