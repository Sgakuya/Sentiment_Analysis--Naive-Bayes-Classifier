Having lived here for six years, I feel that I can now pass some reasonably accurate comments about the place. Not as developed as Miami, Ft Lauderdale has similar beaches and some interesting nightlife. Parking is generally available on the beach for $5-10 per day and its worth investing in this convenience. The city retains a bit of character but is also now starting to suffer from the over-construction of high-rise properties. These hog beach access and make it look like any other Florida city. Not too bad yet, but... Plenty of places to eat, dance and enjoy on the strip including Howl at the Moon where the resident artists will hammer out your favorites on two grand pianos, aet back-to-back on the stage. The Beach Place and its immediate surroundings are definitely the best hang out place but a trip up and down the beach will reveal many great watering holes including the Spring Break star - The Elbow Room. Further afield there are the Evergalades, Seminole Casinos for the gambling folk and numerous water activities available for all. Highly recommended for a visit.
