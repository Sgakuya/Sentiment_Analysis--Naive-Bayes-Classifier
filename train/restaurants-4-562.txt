I'm not that much of a donut eater (maybe once or twice per year at parties and such), but the first time I had a Krispy Kreme glazed donut, I thought it was pretty good (better than the overpriced/hyped Masshole based Dunkin Donuts), but nothing to warrant the hype it received. When the first store in Connecticut opened in Newington, the drivethru lines were incredibly long, so long that city cops and KK employees had to direct traffic! I figured with a long line and wait, KK donuts are something special. When I received the donuts and tried one, I felt it was good but certainly not worth my 20-30 minute wait in the drivethru line sucking exhaust from other cars. Nowadays when you go by that Krispy Kreme on the Berlin Turnpike in Newington, CT, the place practically looks closed for but a few cars in the lot, but remains open for business. I do not like to eat donuts that much due to the copius amount of sugar used on them. I find it funny all the posts saying donuts are not healthy to eat and contribute to an expanding waistline, well no sh!t, Captain Obvious! And it's not like KK is the only donut chain with overly calorious donuts. Even Dumbkin Dumbnuts stale donuts are high in calories, but with Krispy Kreme you at least have taste! Now whenever I have to get donuts for a party, I will most certainly pass by all the DDs on my way to the local KK and pick up a dozen (of which I have like one or two), and since nobody goes there anymore, my wait in line is 2-3 minutes max.
