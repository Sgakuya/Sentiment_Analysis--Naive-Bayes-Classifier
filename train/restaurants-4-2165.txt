TIM HORTON S - A CANADIAN ICON GOING SOUR I used to be hooked on their apple fritters, but the fritters you get in 2003 are only a pale imitation of the fritters from 2002. They've switched to frozen donuts instead of preparing them in-store! The apple bits are too mushy, there are too few apple bits, the donut is dryer and doughier, until recently they didn't have that nice lumpy look (I see they're trying to make it lumpier, but failing miserably), there is too much glazing on them (they look plastic) and they're a lot smaller - I don't buy them anymore - except occasionally to see if they've made any progress. I wrote them a letter of complaint. Unfortunately it got chucked in the recycling. But from my recollection, the lady who replied told me it's an experiment. I GUESS WE'RE THE GUINEA PIGS! Recently, someone brought a box of donuts from a (NOT TIM HORTON S) restaurant in Belleville, ON, and it had an apple fritter in it that tasted better than the present Tim's donuts. I'd like to switch but their coffee and lunches are really good. Somewhere I read a business article about Tim's, and it reported that the President or Chairman had recently changed. I suspect he's trying to impress the stockholders by sacrificing quality for cost savings at our expense.
