USed to be a wonderful place but economy has been in a death spiral for over 30 years. Outrageous taxation and poor business environment has prevented new bsiness from coming in and accelerated the exodus of population and employers. #1 highest taxes in the nation. Lake Erie Shoreline is wonderful, as are Boston Foothills nearby, winters are not bad and if you skji are pretty good actually. Nice small towns (E Aurora and Hamburg just 2 exapmples) and lots of quaint victorians, but city is a depressing wreck and getting worse. No light at the end of the tunnel, thanks Democarats for putting the final nails in the coffin of this once great region, will the last person leaving please turn out the lights.
