Early in Michael's career, skeptics liked to say that he wasn't a winner and questioned whether he could lead a team to the NBA championship. Everyone agreed that he was a great player, but he just didn't have that something special to win the big one. And, when the Bulls lost the first game of the 90-91 Finals to the Lakers, the chorus only got louder. Well, how quickly things change. Michael is now rightfully regarded as not only the greatest player in NBA history, but one of the greatest competitors in NBA history. Not only was he more gifted athletically than just about everyone else, but he also worked harder than everyone else. He became a consistent outside shooter, was a great defender, and always wanted the ball at crunch time. His shot to beat Utah was a fitting end to his career.
