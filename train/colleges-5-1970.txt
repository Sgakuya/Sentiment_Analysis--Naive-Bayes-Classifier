The University of Oregon is an excellent school for those individuals that are highly motivated, want to take the road less traveled, and open minded. If you want engineering, pharmacy, or veterinary sciences - go somewhere else. If you want Journalism, Architecture, Psychology, Business, Sports Marketing, Political Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Exercise Movement Sciences, International Studies, Women's Studies, Languages, Education, Law - YOU GET THE PICTURE - the University of Oregon has a lot to offer. Additionally, our football team ended last fall #2 in the Nation and our Men's basketball team made it to the Elite Eight. Not bad for a bunch of Ducks! The University of Oregon - Minds move Mountains.
