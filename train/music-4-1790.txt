A pleasant diversion for those looking to veer away from the bash-thrash grinders, treacly-sweet pop princesses, and unintelligible slip-slop for awhile. Hard to describe the "feel" of this disc, as it blends so much in one sitting: blues-laced power chords, down-tempo pop metal, and stream-of-consciousness trip-rock (like Frankenstein sewing together The Yardbirds, Def Leppard, and the Grateful Dead, then handing the amalgam ProTools). Every song keeps an understated continuity about it (no "black sheep" wandering in to slow the parade), but "Warning", "Wish You Were Here", and "Nice To Know You" are the best of the sing-alongs. On MORNING VIEW, Brandon and the lads deliver a steady stream of sonic magma that sears and strips to the bone without the pains of art-house antics and overt politicking. Well-packaged, with placid cover pics, full song lyrics, and disc illustration by the band's own Jose Pasillas II. They've since replaced a member and gone in a more-muscular direction, but this one marks them at their most inventive point so far. A click and a crank that's worth the money.
