A great communicator, an intelligant (by ***FAR***, more intelligent than either Bush or Gore) and, by all appearances, a man of good moral fiber. Mr. Keyes and Mr. Buchanan are the only candidates who show any sign of honor and true allegience to the principals that made our Country great. I believe Mr. Keyes and J.C. Watts should run together for Pres. and VP in the next presidential election. I would love to see the media try to keep them out of site and off the air. I think Mr. Keyes needs to take some acting lessons or somehow loosen up a little to create a more favorable impression on people of lesser intellect. Bill Clinton did not get elected because he had such great ideas, or because of his credentials, but because he was a very charismatic, and fun, kind of guy. I'm sorry to say that most Americans are content with making decisions about a president based on how well they relate to him. I feel your pain and I DID NOT HAVE..... may not be truthful, but apparently many folks felt comfortable enough with Clinton to believe him. This makes me believe that a person of substance like Mr. Keyes, who has a great intellect, will be left out in the cold if he does not work on wooing the touchy-feely-feel-good crowd to which a majority of Americans appear to belong.
