I voted for him and would again. We need someone who cares more about the little guy, the poor, the disabled, the homeless, and ordinary middle-class working people. He could probably do a lot to warn and protect people against ripoffs like certain credit card company practices, too, if he was Prez and in the spotlight. He'd doa lot of things to make the quality of life better for Americans. Many people complain about all-for-themselves kpoliticians and other bigwigs not doing enough to really help people where it counts, but everyone seems to be afraid to take a chance; they just go ahead and vote for the safe, conservative repubs and demos like they always did, then continue to complain. Think different and vote for Nader next time!
