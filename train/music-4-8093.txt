One of his best songs, and certainly the best video he ever did. But seriously, DO NOT PLAY THIS SONG AT YOUR WEDDING! If you play this song at your wedding, I gaurantee that you will be divorced in a year. The song is actually an anti-marriage song. Put simply, it's real; there actually is a 'little sister'. Prior to this song, Billy Idol's sister was about to get married in a shotgun wedding (I believe she was three months pregnant at the time). Therefore, this was a forced marriage, rather than a marriage out of love, and so the idea of a happy, cheerful, 'white wedding' seemed to be an illusion to him. (Just as a side note, you can still see this video at www.capitolrecords.com.)
