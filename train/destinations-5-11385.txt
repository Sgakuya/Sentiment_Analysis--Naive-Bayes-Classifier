This is truly a fantastic National Park. It really stands as an example of what every National Park should be, enormous, untouched, untrampled, inspiring, unpredictable, unending, and slightly threatening. I mean that in the sense that you really feel like you're out there, in foreign territory without a whole lot of recourse if you get yourself into trouble. You're on their turf (the animals) and other than a fairly loose description to the ranger of your expected return time and location no one really knows where you are at any given time. You take these school buses into the park because no other vehicles are allowed. This is a wonderful regulations by which you immediately avoid wagon loads of mom and pop and joey in tow driving through in their climate controlled boxes listening to recorded music and eating cheeseburgers. If you want to see the park you have to either stick to the bus or get out somewhere along the road and find your own way to another point where you cross the road and can wait for another bus to come by. I was only there for a few days and so was only able to explore maybe 1 gazillionth of the park and would love to go back. We were lucky too because we were able to catch a glimpse of all of Denali for a breif second as the cloud cover broke, something the bus driver told us is a pretty slight probability.
