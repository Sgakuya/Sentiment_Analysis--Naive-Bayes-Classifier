this is a strange movie where a young man is hired by this rich guys father to go to Italy and bring him to the states. Tom becomes Dickies friend and starts to get interested in Dickies life. Dickie is engaged to marge {Gwyneth Paltrow} but steps out on her. Dickie is kind of a jerk.In another town tom and Dickie fight Dickie ends up dead and Tom tries to assume his identity for the rest of the movie. and lies to others about Dickies where abouts. He kills a couple more people which shows that Tom is a very troubled mass murderer. Some good scenes and good acting. I did not love this movie,it was pretty good. and there are some beautiful scenes of Italy.
