I too love this mini van. Ours is a 2002 MPV with leather interior. The dual powered doors and door windows are great features. We researched most of the mini's out there and narrowed it down to the Odyssey and the MPV. For our needs, the smaller MPV with a more car-like ride was the winner. Our only complaints are the rotten egg smell from the cat-converter and the placement of the shift lever. I take issue with BigBaby's comment that Ford can build a good car. The MPV is all Japanese except for the duramax V6 engine borrowed from the Taurus. I reseached the history of this engine and it's one of the best Ford has ever built. No so with the one in my Ford Ranger V6 which is truly a POS. My first and last Ford product.
