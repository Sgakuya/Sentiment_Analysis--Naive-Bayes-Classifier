Kobe Bryant deserves major props not only for his role he's playing on the Lakers team but also for facing the adversity of his critics. No matter what he does for that team he gets crapped on for being a showboat or a ball hog. The thing that I respect is the way he just lets people talk but still plays his game the way he has to to get it done. Yes, maybe he entered the NBA a little too early but there's nobody out there that can honestly say that he hasn't more than contributed his share to the success of the Lakers. I think Kobe rocks and I am always looking forward to the Lakers games and to see what Kobe and the Big Man are gonna bring out next.
