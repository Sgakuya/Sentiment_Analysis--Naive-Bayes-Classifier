Uh, Marky? I LIVE in New Orleans, not 30 minutes away like you do. And, I must say that some of the things you're claiming to be lies are actually NOT lies. New Orleans DOES have a high crime rate... now, I don't think it's that New Orleans is worse than other places, but as it seems, big cities tend to have a higher crime rate percentage than small ones. There really IS too much crime... you really have to fear for your life riding on Claiborne Avenue and Chef Menteur Highway. And, New Orleans really DOES have the worst education system in the US. It is not true that most students make As and Bs... a GREAT many fail all throughout school. Now... it may not be the greatest place to live, but for a visit, you're bound to enjoy yourself here! You may have heard of the French Quarter here, a place of great fun, with lots of unique shops around (selling things from T-shirts to good food to voodoo stuff). And there are lots of friendly people throughout, visitors (well, SOME friendly ones at least) and entertainers, particularly on the walk-along Bourbon Street of the French Quarter. And speaking of Bourbon Street, that's a great place for great fun during Mardi Gras, our own little Fat Tuesday celebration of fun and craziness... just hope you don't mind crowds too much! We're also home to the original (now closed) Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits!
