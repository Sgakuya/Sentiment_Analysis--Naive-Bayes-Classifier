Patron is decent tequila, certainly not in the ranks of El Tesoro or Herradura. To me, it has a chemical taste similar to that in Cabo Wabo. And when you consider its price, it certainly isnt a good value at all. I find Patron is favored by tequila neophytes and wannabes, who don't know that there is no Patron distillery. Its basically a marketing company founded by hair-gel tycoon Paul Mitchell, whose buyers take others' product and bottle it themselves. Patron reminds me of Starbucks -- not the best product certainly, though it has somewhat raised the bar from what people are usually accustomed to (Cuervo Gold, the Folgers of tequila)
