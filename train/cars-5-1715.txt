I bought a 2000 Sony Edition Focus after getting in an accident in my 99 Mercury Grand Marquis LS. I was quite surprised in this car from the very start. The engine yeah is small(130HP) but hey it gets you where you need to go. The suspension on this car is just as good as the suspension in my old car. Again since this is a Sony Edition it was a little more expensive but I still got a hell of a deal on it. It retailed for 17,000 and I talked the dealer down to 15,000 w/o a trade it because it was costing them money since they have had the car for three months. I know some/most of the Focus's have recalls buy my car has had no recalls yet which is great. I have had this car for almost 3 months and it was a great purchase i love my Infra Red Sony FOCI:)
