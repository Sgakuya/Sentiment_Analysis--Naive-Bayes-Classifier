I appreciate the raising awareness factor of the movie and that the seriousness was conveyed without showing many scenes of violence. However, the movie makes it seem as if the Hutu/Tutsi problem was limited to that time period and place, though there have been thousands (millions?) more of them killed in Burundi, Congo,and Uganda before and since. Hopefully, this movie will cause us to be more involved in the various slaughters going on in Africa now and what little the US,UN and individuals are doing. savages, expendable as Jews? (from D.
