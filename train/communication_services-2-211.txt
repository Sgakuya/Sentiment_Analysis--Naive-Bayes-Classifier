I am a former Cellularone-Airtouch customer that was converged in the Verizon umbrella. I have found a major degradation in service, quality of the customer care personnel and phone selection since the Verizon change. Customer care is no longer available 24 hours a day. I had alot of service issues (dropped calls, inability to place calls in analog areas, previously digital areas that became analog, etc). Customer service personnel have given me incorrect information that has cost me money. The list goes on and on. I was a big fan of Airtouch and recommended to all of my friends. The jury is still out on Verizon!!! It needs big improvements!!!!
