Basically, I do not have the right to rate Hungary here for I am a hungarian, but I was quite impressed on Bebetigre's note. Come here and see this country (before we absorb into EU) because it has an unforgattable athmosphere. In the nights we all get naked and rape each other in hotel lobbies. For we have not got running water and food, people are stinking and smiling at each other with their toothless mouths. If we are fed up with disorder and chaos we (cell)phones our romanian neighbours to teach us some lessons about cleaning up a city, and behaving ourselves. We are xenophobes, so we hate everyone living on Earth. (Our parliament - bunch of criminals - just enacted that our national anthem has to begin with this line: F**k all other idiots on Earth.) F**k you Bebetigre, I rate you zero. To everyone else, come to see Budapest, I have been to a lot of beautiful cities but none of them could outshine Budapest. If you need help, information on anything, I give you a hand. elchico@reset.hu (for free certainly, I do not need money)
