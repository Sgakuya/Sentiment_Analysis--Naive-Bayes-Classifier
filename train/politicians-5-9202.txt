One of the greatest in Americans in our nation's history. Balanced the budget. Reduced government corruption. Killed the SUSB in a defiant battle with the congress whereby he established the executive branch for what it is today and not a rubber stamper for the congress but an actual check. He was the first president to actually coordinate the direction of government by introducing bills and promoting an agenda from his bully pulpit while using his celebrity to his advantage. He was a fiercely strong-willed American that never backed down from a fight and succesfully confronted the sucession of South Carolina during his second term. He is easily the most underrated president in American history.
