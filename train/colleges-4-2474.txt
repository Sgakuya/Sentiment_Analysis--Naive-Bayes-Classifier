Speaking as a student of UNC-C, I would say that our college isn't too bad. I have no clue what the first user was talking about, we don't have a major crime problem. Given, it IS busy around the university area, but Charlotte as a whole is very busy. I've had great professors for the most part, but the quality of education varies from college to college. We have an excellent competative nursing program. There's plenty of housing, but our housing department is a pain to deal with. It's by far no UNC-CH, but there's PLENTY to do in Charlotte and some of our programs are actually pretty good. I have friends transferring from App to go here.
