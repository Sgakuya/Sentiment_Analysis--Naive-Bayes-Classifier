No matter where someone chooses to attend, it's more than likely they'll end up leaving with an intense emotional attachment to the university, it's surrounding enviroment, and it's populace. The argument: I went there, and there's no better place is therefore, a weak one. I know that Clemson is a fine institution if you have interest in what a land grant college offers, i.e. agrculture, engernering, etc. However, if you look to write the next American best-seller, soundly understand public policy, or make the cover of Forbes by 30, I'd advise you to keep looking. A note on the campus: Yes, it is very green, and yes it is very centeralized; but, it's also very dated and monotonous. So, if you are into variations on the same theme, it's perfect. Clemson is also in the middle of a very small town. Unlike Athens, which has evolved to cater itself to a college demographic, Clemson has not. If you're looking to go out on a date, be prepaired to drive a little bit, that is unless pizza and beer is your thing. Lastly, when searching for a school, be sure to find one who's administration gears their institution to compete on a national scale, not a regional one.
