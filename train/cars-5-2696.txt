As far as pure racecars go, this one can't be beat, from its impeccable suspension to its blistering drivetrain. In a recent test it managed better lap times than both the Corvette Z06 and the Viper GTS. Out accelerates the Z06 0-60. A true street legal racecar. Its 5.4l V8 is rated at 385hp and 385lb/ft of torque, but this has been found to be VERY low, actual numbers are probably well over 400. I swear, 90% of the people who rate these cars are catastrophically retarded... how do they manage to make the Supra the top rated sports car but put a stronger performer like this one all the way down here!? Good grief...I pray no one who reads these reviews takes this site seriously.
