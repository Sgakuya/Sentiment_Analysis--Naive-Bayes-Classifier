This is one of the most moving books I have ever or will ever read. I'm very glad it was included on the required reading list when I was a junior high school student and I hope that it will always be read by future generations. Anne herself was also a young teenager when she went through her ordeal so, reading this book at that age really helps the reader identify with the many confusing feelings, thoughts and fears she was experiencing. In a more personal way than any history book or documentary could do, Anne Frank's diary gives a very innocent and honest first hand account of life in a world gone mad with hate. She was like a sweet little flower trying so hard to bloom in a pile of ashes. And, though all seemed lost, her wonderful loving spirit was not crushed and is triumphant over that awful hate in a very real way. The fact that this little plaid diary survived for all of us to read is truly a miracle.
