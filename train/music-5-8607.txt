What to say? I am devoted Ricky's fan, and used to see all his last videos which are full of colours,flashy, sparkling and glittering with beautiful girls and him looking like a god or at least as an angel. But here is this new video Loaded , so different, so close to real life, black and white, no additional effects just music /which by the way is very good / and story of three friends who try to find some fun. And all of a sudden I started to realize that people in the video have the faces, expressions, they talk, they smile, they are real human beings from the street around the corner.Seeing this video I admire Ricky Martin even more for being so brave to step out of cliche of all those sweet, most of the time unrealistic videos, which we have been bombarded lately.Just the small comment at the and - Ricky has again shown his acting skills. Video Loaded is excellent.
