Here's a true story about Cracker Barrel in Florence, Kentucky. Recently, an eleven year employee was FIRED for eating a BISCUIT. It's true. Singled out and alone, this young lady was asked repeatedly if she knew of employees STEALING. Confused and scared, she felt the inquirer wanted SOMETHING--ANYTHING. This same employee always worked holidays and double shifts as needed. In 11 years this employee HAD NEVER CALLED OFF. She was always punctual and frequently guests commented on what a hard worker she was. Guests even brought her CHRISTMAS GIFTS over the years because she was always recognized as a great, helpful worker. BUT, perhaps Cracker Barrel realized that they could hire someone for less money and avoid the three week vacation this young lady had earned through her years of hard work. So, finally, when the inquirer asked if she had ever taken anything, the young lady said "I ate a biscuit once." SO SHE WAS FIRED. It's even listed on the dismissal form along with the price of restitution of .50 cents. In her innocence, and because of her reluctance to point the finger at others, she failed to say how EVERYONE eats biscuits. No one even HIDES it because while employees know they have to pay for their meals, they GIVE biscuits away and THROW away countless biscuits at the end of the day. If you are familiar with Cracker Barrel in Florence, be aware of the absence of the long term hostess and how she was UNFAIRLY treated. BETTER YET, BOYCOTT THIS LOCATION.
