I liked Buenos Aires. It is a very European-type city. The food is good enough. Nice steaks if you know where to go: La Brigada 5495 San Telmo in that really old neighborhood near downtown and Puerto Madero. The people are very beautiful. If you like to watch people or leer lecherously at people, this may be the place for you. Prostituion is common. Be careful when going into strip joints. Personally, I'd avoid it altogether, but if that is your thing, go in a large group. If you don't expect to be presented with the bill for some girls drinks. I haven't experienced this first hand, but was warned by the locals. Buenos Aires has a great night life. But it is really a early morning life as things don't really start cooking until midnight. By midnight I am ready for bed so I missed most of this. The hot clubs get too packed for people like me. I am not into queueing for a few hours to go into a super loud dance club and it be too busy to get a beverage let alone actually speak to someone. When I was a young man, I'd have been all over it. It was just the sort of thing I liked back then. Crime is a problem like all other Latin American cities. If big cities are your thing, this is a nice one. I liked my time there.
