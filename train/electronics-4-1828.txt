Even though PS2 doesn't have the incredible graphics as Gamecube Xbox, Sony still has the market cornered. The wide selection of games, and PSOne compatiblity will keep the Playstation nameplate around for a long time. I rather have a blast playing fun and awesome games on a PS2 then be bored but play a game with awesome graphics on Xbox or GameCube. The addition of playing DVD's sweeten the deal. There's so many classics on Playstation like GTA vice City, Grand Turismo, and the list goes on. If your into Sport Games however, maybe PS2 isnt for you. Gamecube has awesome graphics and well for sports EA makes em for almost everyone. Forget XBox all together, Microsoft has enough money and makes enough junk that Xbox may have been it's first and last entry to the video game market. Sony is the definate winner, with the technology they put into video games, can go through their whole product line-Computers, Tv's, ect.
