The negative hippie comments below are stupid. There are a lot of conservatives on campus. It has great science programs, etc. The politics of the city are silly, but that has nothing to do with the campus. And the perception of the East coast? Generally if you go to a top 50 college, employers are more concerned about how you did there, what your activities were, and what your personality is. College prestige in general is overrated. As long as you go to a top 50 school, you will be just fine (and if you are smart it doesn't matter where you go). That said, I found Berekely to be a bit too large and impersonal. It's great if you like an urban atmosphere, but if you are looking for an intimate college experience, I wouldn't recommend it.
