Cute movie. A very busy woman doctor is in a bad accident. Her apartment is subletted by a nice man. She appears to him and wants to know why he is there. At first it is assumed that she is a ghost. He is the only one who can see and hear her. We find out later that she is not dead but in a coma.drama is added to it when her grieving sister decides it is time to pull the plug. He has to convince the sister to keep her alive. the end is somewhat predictable. Reese Witherspoon is good as the woman trying to get back to her body and saving her life. and Mark ruffalo is fine as the guy who tries and helps her. No big surprises here, but charming movie.
