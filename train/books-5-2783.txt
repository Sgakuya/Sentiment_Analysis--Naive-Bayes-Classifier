Although this is not the type of book that Bill Bryson is noted for; and placing the book in the 'History' classification is stretching the point to the extreme, unless one considers a total 'history' of the universe to actually be history, I would recommend this book to nearly anyone who has a brain, and even a little curiousity about the origin and operation of everything around us. (One exception - Creationists and Intelligent Design advocates need not read further.) If you've ever wondered what makes you and the world around you 'tick', yet have been overwhelmed by scientific explanations, this is the book for you. Written to make complex subjects easily understood by those of us not born with Einstein's gifts, this book is probably the best on the topic of general science (even though it is billed as 'History') that I have ever read... and believe me... I've read a lot!!
