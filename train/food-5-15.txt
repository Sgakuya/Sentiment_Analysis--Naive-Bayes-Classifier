This is my favorite brand of ice cream. It has quality, great taste, a nice creaminess, and (when on sale at my grocery store) it's only $1.99 !! My favorite Premium flavors are Vanilla Bean, French Vanilla, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, Choco Mint Chip, Cookies 'n Cream, and sometimes the Peanut Butter Ripple. I'm originally from Lancaster County (PA) and would get this often. :) Luckily I can still buy it in DE. I personally love it simply in a bowl (slightly softened) without any toppings. It also makes great milkshakes, too. Use the Vanilla Bean flavor as a base flavor if you're adding candy bars to make homemade Blizzards. The Peanut Butter Ripple flavor makes a good base for a Butterfinger Blizzard. Enjoy.
