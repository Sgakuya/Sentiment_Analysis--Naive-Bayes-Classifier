Granted, Musharraf is not a democratically elected leader, but the world needs him now at the helm of the leadership of Pakistan. His support for us in Afghanistan has been invaluable. Democracy is an important institution, so I hope that he does follow up on his promise to have elections next year. But a cross-cultural examination of the situation in Pakistan needs to occur as well. This country is not the same as most Western Democracies are. In Pakistan, like most 3rd World countries, the military is very strongly established. If a politician does not have the support of the military, then they do not have the support necessary to maintain power. If Musharraf falls, there will be a power vaccum and the result will be the takeover of that countries government by fundamentalist forces. We definitely don't want that to occur. I understand why Musharraf had to take over by coup; the previous government was woefully corrupt and the economy was stagnant. Some may say that the ends do not justify the means; I would say that personally myself, but people also have to understand that there is only so much corruption and incompetence that an economic and political system can face before it falls to averse forces. Musharraf is at least trying to work within a democratic framework, which is key. And he is supportive of the War against Terrorism; it was tough for him to do this considering the political climate in Pakistan. He is taking leadership, which is something Pakistan hasn't seen in a while.
