Some advice before playing Fallout 2. First of all SAVE often especially when you think you're about to do something potentially stupid. Often enough events you trigger or set in motion will have effects on you later on. This RPG surpasses the original in many ways. The music is superb and the graphics fully fulfil the dark noir essence of the game. This is one of the very few ruly non-linear RPGs out there. Gaining levels is incredibly satisfying because you can actually gauge what kind of effect it will have on your character rather then it simply being a superfluos excercise of leveling up for the next boss. Addictive, fun and just generally brilliant just remember to THINK before you act as like life (which this game resembles better than most RPGs) whatever you do could have immeasurable effects on you.
