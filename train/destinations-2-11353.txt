St. Louis is already a weak city for any reason, especially tourism, so you must be pretty desperate to come here for gambling. But three of our casinos are on riverboats. The Casino Queen is the most classic looking standard double-paddle wheel with an onshore hotel. The Alton Bell is a smaller version of the Queen with an ugly paint job. The Admiral is a silver, streamlined, post modern boat that is about fifty years old and is permanently moored, but is a St. Louis landmark. The other two biggies, Harrahs and Ameristar, are large ugly corporate casinoes way out in the county. Harrahs made a big fuss because they didn't want to build a casino on the Mississippi or Missouri, but on land instead, while Ameristar is on the Missouri but doesn't have a boat. Worse is that Ameristar replaced the St. Charles Casino, which was another attractive steamer.
