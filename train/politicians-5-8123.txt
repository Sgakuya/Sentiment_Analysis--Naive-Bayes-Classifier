John F. Kennedy was killed because he was doing his job, unlike some of his successors (George W. Bush for example). More specifically, his brave decisions, such as not supporting the CIA on their endeavor concerning the Bay of Pigs invasion (the Bay of Pigs wasn't JFK's screwup, it was the CIA's) when he told them he wasn't going to to begin with. All his actions as President were based on the Constitution and ALWAYS with the best interests of the American people in mind. He was killed by the Illuminati (aside from the two shooters at the grassy knoll, they hired a Secret Service man named William Greer to fire the fatal head shot while driving his vehicle) while visiting Dallas on November 22nd, 1963 for the same reason Abe Lincoln was killed 98 years earlier: he had ordered the Treasury Department to issue and circulate interest-free money contrary to what the Federal Reserve was and still is doing: loaning money to the government with interest thereby driving up the national debt. President Kennedy wanted to eliminate that problem and it got him killed by the people who run the Federal Reserve. It was a massive conspiracy and it is still affecting this country to this very minute what happened to him. JFK was the last president to be truly in charge and at least four of his successors have participated in covering up who really had him killed: Nixon (with the Watergate scandal), Bush Sr., Johnson and Ford. Money and power are the roots of all evil and his assassination is solid proof of them. Do your research, somehow come up with an unedited full length copy of the Abraham Zapruder film, buy the book "Behold a Pale Horse" by William Cooper and the truth shall set you free. Thank you very much and God bless America.
