I hate to bitch at 'Tawn. Buuuuuuuut. And I do support all my Carolina guys. Buuuuut! Where did you go to school, son? What is your problem? Where did you grow up? My point is, 'Tawn should be ashamed of himself! WHY AREN'T YOU GIVING THAT LARRY HUGHES IDIOT AN EARFUL?! You went to Carolina, son! - what is wrong with you?! Bitch him out! Put him in his place! It is obvious the coach isn't going to do it! I just went back over the whole game on my DVR - Hughes took 15 ill-advised shots! some went in, but if they didn't..........Anyway, be like you were at Carolina, and put that dumbass, one year of college, punk in his place! Ya'll won tonight despite him, and you know that. So, why aren't you telling him? I remeber when players used to get on their misguided teammates - especially Carolina players! You never see a guy give his teammate an earful anymore - sometimes they shouldn't, but in Hughes' case, it could be the best thing for him and the team. Good game 'Tawn. That was a huge STEAL and SHOT you hit. However, as good as you were tonight........the Bulls should have gotten swept if not for Hughes' selfishness. And as a Carolina guy, you have to chew a dumb, poorly coached in college..........well, you gotta chew him out, and let him know the deal! Where did you go to school, son! You know better! Come on, man, you were raised in Charlotte, NC. Get it together. Your play doesn't shame us, your not getting after your teammates does! Come on! You sure got after them in college, and those results were good to say the least.
