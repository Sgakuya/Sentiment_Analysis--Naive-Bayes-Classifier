If you like toppings blended into your ice cream or frozen yogurt, you'll love Cold Stone Creamery. For the uninitiated, there's a step-by-step list explaining how to order posted on the wall, which is a good thing because there are so many options. Basically, what you get is ice cream, frozen yogurt, or Italian ice blended with one or more mix-ins of your choice. The server scoops out your ice cream, flattens it with the scoop, and then mixes in your topping(s). The final product is kind of like soft serve. I opted for coffee ice cream with Butterfinger, and it was delicious. The coffee ice cream was excellent, not too sweet and slightly bitter, and the Butterfinger was a scrumptious addition. If you like the Blizzards at Dairy Queen, you're sure to be satisfied with Cold Stone Creamery.
