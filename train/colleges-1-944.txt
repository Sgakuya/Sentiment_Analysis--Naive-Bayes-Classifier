What is UMUC's point in Europe? I surveyed the courses that start on Monday 23 AUG, and found many canceled, 1/3 to 2/3 at Army posts canceled or remain pending, while at Ramstein and Spang more are marked as'Go. Some posts have no courses marked 'Go'. Further, what is the point of a UMUC brochure listing courses, when they don't offer many new courses, or only a fraction of those listed in the brochure. It's the same courses, and the same professors adding little new to what they said last year, or the year before. It's the same planners in Heidelberg too. They say if you don't like what they offer go to DE. That's not a helpful solution. Nothing against DE for thoe who want it, but I'd like a classroom learning experience. I think both Army and Air Force folks here in Europe want better from the planners in Heidelberg (who probably should retire to make wayfor more innovative management). That's what people say here, and even the local ESO agrees. Get with it UMUC. You make a lot of money off of us, so start giving back some quality. And, by the way, the Army needs to get over the eArmy thing. Like UMUC, eArmy too seems like such a scam.
