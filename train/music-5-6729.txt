one of my all time favorite albums. i have been a deftones fan scince 95 when they first came out, and they never cease to amaze me. there isn't a bad song on this album. i think this album is the deftones most evolved one. adrenaline was more of a hardcore album, around the fur was their experimental album and then white pony was the bands sound evolved. its great how they can put out three albums, all different, and still not have a bad song.white pony is more mellow, with songs like pink maggit and digital bath and knife prty, but there is still songs like elite and korea to show that they can still be hardcore. the track with maynard is great to. i have the limited adition white pony with the song the boys republic on it. for anyone who has not heard this song, i suggest that you borrow from a friend or download it, cause its a great song, one of my favorites on the album. i can't say its my favorite album, because that always changes, depending on my mood, but this album is amazing. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!
