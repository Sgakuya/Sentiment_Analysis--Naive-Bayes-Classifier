I'm surprised that the Yanks were the eighth ranked team on this poll. They are certainly better than that. I will admit that while Chauncey's controversial comments about the Red Sox got under my skin, I really don't see Boston winning the AL East. The Yankees lineup is too strong this season AND the Sox should have done everything in their power to hold on to Todd Walker and they didn't. There is no infield in either the AL or NL that can compete with the Yankees even with the loss of Soriano and Johnson. That left side with Rodriguez and Jeter is brutal on opponents and behind the plate, Posada has a decent arm but is especially known for hitting the long ball. I'm still not sure who will now play firstbase. Probably will be Giambi. They should be fine at second base when the season begins. Last year the Yankees were exposed somewhat in rightfield and that may be a concern this year. Concerning the starting rotation, Kevin Brown is not the pitcher Andy Petite is by any means. Brown's got almost ten years on him too. I really don't think the loss of Clemens will affect the team that much at this stage of his career. The issue will be the depth of their starting rotation. I beleive their bullpen will bounce back. Mariano Rivera had an off-year for him (on-year for anyone else)last season. With his work ethic and amazing pitch location I think he will recover from last season and have a phenomenal year. And as long as the Yankees spend $225 million on their payroll they will ALWAYS be the team to beat. Sure, they'll tease their opponent and lose the first game or two of a series but then they'll bounce back and win a 20 inning game. At this point it's lights out for their opponent as they become completely demoralized. Favorable calls from the umps and some lucky bounces are the trademark of the Yankees
