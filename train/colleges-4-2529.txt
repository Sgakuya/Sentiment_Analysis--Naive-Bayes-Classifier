Grad: VA Commonwealth or just plain old VCU is a good school that allows you to be yourself. Too many of the classes were opinion oriented, Springer style is what I called it. I grew up in RIC and watched VCU grow and grow into what is starting to resemble a world class University. Some challenging classes too. Used to be RPI (Richmond Prof. Inst.) an outreach of William & Mary (public ivy). Richmond's big enough to impress country folk and small enough to slow down big city folk so they can concentrate on their studies. A campus without walls, VCU sits a mile or two west of downtown in The Fan, Richmond's version of Greenwich Village. A lesson in tolerance and diversity. No one (well almost) leaves VCU judging a book by its cover. Lots of intellectual guests and school sponsored lectures, often controversial. Not your average school. More liberal than conservative. More unconventional than traditional (try U of R). Very urban. If you need a lot of structure and someone to tuck you in at night, don't go to VCU. Alpha Phi Alpha has an excellent chapter ther Theta Death Rho (1973), they run things on campus and try to keep things smooth. Personnally I smoked too much pot while at VCU, but still got an excellent job after graduating (thankfully I've stopped). Good business school, new engineering school, basketball prospects looking good (NCAA this yr. -- curse Wake Forest), drugged up sexual minority art majors, some frat houses -- big parties, good racial balance & relations, no football jocks (VCU's football team has NEVER been defeated), great FUTBOL team, great tennis, have baseball. Did I mention Theta Death Rho: A FRATERNITY IN A FRATERNITY!
