We bought the car new in 96. It worked good for about a 3 or 4 year period of time, then it seems like every single thing on the car broke. It was just problem after problem for about a year period. After some huge bills it stabled out a bit (probably about 4 or 5 major fixes). I took it off-roading and it worked great. The 4 wheel drive is awesome. This truck has plenty of power for what we do with it (mainly towing our boat). Now, I'm still not sure if it's problem free...because on the last trip i took it on it had the check engine light (and all the fluids were good) then it turned off halfway through. FORD=Fix Or Repair Daily...but now since we've practically replaced every part, hopefully it will work for a little bit longer. I do like how it drives though.
