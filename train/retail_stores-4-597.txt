Personally, I don't shop at AE but I think the store is alright. The only items I've ever purchased were 2 pairs of jeans that were on sale. They were decent... though I've hardly ever worn em since I bought em. The finishes were cool, but the denim was thin and cheap (That seems to be an unfortunate trend with most jeans these days). Anyway, I've found their employees to be really friendly and helpful without being annoying. I don't really like their style (not really into that faux vintage, prep school look) but compared to other stores at the mall, AE seems like a pretty good value to me. I'm not surprised that AE's sales are up while A&F's are plummeting.
