1/17/05 - Birds are looking good. Not going to get overconfident however - see my comment from two years ago to understand why. 1/19/03 - It's hard to express the disappointment that Eagles fans are going through after getting pounded by the Bucs. This was supposed to be the Eagles' day. They were a team of destiny playing against a Tampa Bay club that they had smothered in the previous two years. They were playing the last game ever in the infamous Vet, and the home field crowd was to be a potent 12th man. The temperature was frigid - just where the Eagles liked it, and just where Tampa Bay had proven itself to be unable to compete. But even in all the hype leading up to the big day, there was an undercurrent in Philly that this was all to good to be true. That Philly is a cursed sports town, and that the team's franchises will somehow find a way to screw things up. Now, once again, we are left with the hollow wait till next year, and with the sinking feeling that if we can't get to the superbowl this year with seemingly all the cards stacked in our favor, how will we ever get there?
