As the other comment noted, Symantec Act! is great for those in sales for keeping track of suppliers, customers, etc, but the program also works well for other professionals. Essentially, Act! is a contacts management system. The user inputs name, address, etc into the fields, but the user can customize the fields for whatever is needed (eg spouse, children, etc for that extra personal touch). Once the information is in the database, one can flag each contact for birthdays, anniversaries, reminders for annual meetings, etc. Act! will also generate form letters and keep track of the duration of phone calls, etc. While there are other software packages that do many of these same things, Act! seems to be the standard, and online address books are not as powerful or as secure.
