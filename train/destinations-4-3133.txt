Just spent 2 months here, visiting some friends at University of Toronto. As has been said, Toronto looks like it has a high quality of life. There are some gorgeous women here. Funny, almost everyone I meet is from somewhere else in the world. There are some cool shops and bars mostly on the Queen St. and College. Yonge St. is the main drag. Disagree that this is an average American city though. It's seems much bigger than most and with less slummy areas. This place has some huge clubs but nothing compared to London. This is not quite a New York either. Only US city that I have been to that seems somewhat similar might be San Franzsisco or Chicago, perhaps ?
