No country or anything at all for that matter is, has been, or ever will be perfect. But so help me god, we are the closest thing to it (except maybe canada, because they have a better healthcare system) All of the people from other countries that are ignorant about america (not necessarily stupid but ignorant) who talk so bady about it, i have a question for you.... If we are such a horrible country, then why are there probably thousands or millions of people from YOUR country living here now? There isn't a country in the world that doesnt have people who have left it for america. Sure, we have problems, gas prices are skyrocketing, inner city schools are failing, and the economy is a little sluggish. But you name me one country in the world that doesnt have problems? Thats right, you can't, because there isn't!!! The US has a diversity, culture, history, and community that whatever country all of you haters live in will never come close to having. Not because whatever country you come from doesn't have any of those things, but because EVERY country has their own versions of those things. When people form other countries make negative hate comments on the people of the united states, they are making negative hate comments on people from all over the world, so they must not be human.
