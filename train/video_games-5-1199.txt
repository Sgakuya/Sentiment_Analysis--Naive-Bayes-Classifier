Just writing this brings back memories. Ok, while playing Spoon (we spell it in singular form, but all well) make sure you a)use plastic spoons, and identify them with numbers from 1 to # of players b)get the first-aid kit ready (there have been incidents with blood) c)make sure you play with a LOT of people, somewhere like a few dozen and the best part of all... d)each round, place the spoons farther and farther. First it's all about whoever can grab their arm out the fastest, then you hide them under the table, then across the room, into the hallway, and out the door! place them into neighbors houses (ask for permission) and across the street, so players have to run for them. Remember, whoever gets spoon #1 places them in the next spot, and is the only one who knows where they are. Try scattering them really far away form each other. And if you REALLY want some fun, place them blocks away, and (heck, why not) across cities! Then it turns into the Amazing Race with SPOONS, and players have to choose whether to take the bus, or bike, or car!! Good times, good times.
