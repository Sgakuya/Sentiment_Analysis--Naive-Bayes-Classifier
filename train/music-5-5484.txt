THE record, and we're talking analogic. For people my age it was THE clarion call to music with rocks in! Blood, meat, bones, music that was sound and movies and doors to another universe! That exclaimed, there were defects, but who cared? I was in a poky club when I first heard them play trhe thing and I still say Tony Iommi guitar wasn't great, but Ozzy's wails! And the athmosphere! And the power riffs. You could hear the voice of the future pulling the past with it. An amazing experience. Every time I put this thing on and trhere are teeenagers - it's 2001 now - around, they go crazy. As I did. No t many records do that. Damn few, if you ask me. So, one of the very best.
