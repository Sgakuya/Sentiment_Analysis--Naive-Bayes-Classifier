As a Tarheel, I'm a bit biased, but even with that said, Dean Smith easily deserves a five star rating. Smith was hired after the University of North Carolina was put on probation, yet he built the model for a clean and successful program. One that not only won on the court much more often than not, but also graduated its players. Smith's teams almost always finished in the top two spots in the ACC and reached the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament during a time when the competition was much stronger than in prior eras. Impressive as his record, Dean Smith is also responsible for several innovations in the college game (eg the four corners, tired signals, and the run and jump defense), and his also credited for pushing for the racial integration of Southern universities.
