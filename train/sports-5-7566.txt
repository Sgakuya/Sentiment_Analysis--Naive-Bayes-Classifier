Karl Malone is probably the best power forward ever. He is one of the hardest working NBA players ever, his body is still a work of art and his skills have only diminished slightly (most notably his jumping abilities and quickness) even though he's almost 40 years old. On the downside, along with John Stockton he is the primary reason whey the Jazz never won a championship. When the game's close, 99% of the time either or both of them have always choked. Also, the selfish bug has gotten to him the last 8 years or so, he doesn't want to end his career in a Jazz uniform (for the sake of a needless and futile championship quest) and he's kind of a moronic, right-brained, nonsensical opionist who's always contradicting himself; also, he's somewhat of a jerk. But he's still pretty cool, I actually like his big ego. I just wish he would retire, NOW, alongside John Stockton.
