The republican politican I have most respect for. I watched his historical speach directly at CNN: What a thrill! I loved each second of it, the coolest was the crouds that didn't want to stop applaud! James Jeffords will surthenly not become the Republican candidate in the next president election, but it would have been could if he would! Then I think even Al Gore, Jesse Jackson, Hillary Clinton, or whoever will become the Democratic rival, will have serious troubles with winning the title! I admire Jeffords a lot wish him the very best for the future! An old saying tells us that Honesty last the longest . I'll change it a bit to fit the current situation: Braveness courage last the longest!
