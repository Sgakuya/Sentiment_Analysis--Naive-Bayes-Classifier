Good to Great state-with many caveats-which prevents 5 stars. What makes California great is its climate, the coast is temperate and has no extremes. There are rugged coastlines in the north and south, with famous beach's in the south. There are mountains and forests and deserts providing a diverse and beautiful environment for outdoor fun and exploration. Glittering cities like LA and SF. A progresive population that is forward thinking. What does take the luster off is very pricey housing- esp. along the coast, too much traffic in the major population centers, super high costs of living, too much crime in some areas, poor schools in many areas, and too wide of a gap between the rich and poor. A great place to visit- and live (especially if you are rich or have the skills to make lots of money- if not it can be a struggle.
