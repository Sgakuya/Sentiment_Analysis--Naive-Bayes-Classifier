Im 14 goin on 15 and i have a honda TRX450R. Ive been ridding since i was 3 and racin since i was 5. My honda 450R has a Youshimara TRS pipe,ITP tires,Elka Suspineson,Pro taper bars,etc. This is the most advance machine i have ever rode. I have about 8000 in parts(im serious i asked my dad)I have not been beatin by a Yamaha YFZ450(not sayin they are not powerful) and not any 250R`s. I cant wait to race some one with the new sukuki quadracer 450. To see some of my pics go tohttp://www.pymatuningholeshotraceway.com/ Now that Honda put eletric start on the 450 its stupid because eletric brakes all the time. Plus eletric is for women i NEVER wanted eletric even when i had my eton 90 i used the kick. Eletric is for women real guys use the kick.plus if u race eletric ways u down.
