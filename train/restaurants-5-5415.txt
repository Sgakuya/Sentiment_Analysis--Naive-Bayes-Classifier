Ah, you know, it's funny how you'll often take something for granted, and then you realize when it's gone just how you miss it... that's the case here with Shoney's. Not that it was a GREAT restaurant, but it was good, and cheap... and cheap. The one where I live closed down a couple of months ago (Why, I wonder, since it was always crowded...), and I don't expect to be travelling a quarter tank of gas just to go there, but it was a good place to eat, for what it was--a cheap restaurant. Perhaps most love the place for it's breakfast bar, which contained both good food, and some pretty bad food too... of course, since some of the food was very good, that's all that really counts... not like anyone ever forced me to eat one of those dry biscuits.... The place had good dinners too, including a good, though expensive compared to other things on the menu, steak. Not the world's greatest steak, but good for the price I should say. Also, they always come out with good desserts, some old, some new (I loved the key lime pie). And so, while some may not care for it because it's a cheap restaurant, accept and enjoy it for what it is--a cheap restaurant. Hey, if you're tired of the regular fast food, it's good for a change of pace. And if I had to choose between this or Denny's, Shoney's cousin cheap restaurant... there's no doubt in my mind this is the one I'd go to.
