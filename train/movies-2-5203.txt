What the F**k is this. The damn movie wasn't even made in japan. It's and American spin off of yugioh and it sucks.4 kids can not do anime . All the characters look oily and the promo cards for the movie sucked and this is all coming from a diehard yugioh fan. damn why did they make this movie. The only thing I enjoyed from this movie was seeing yami get stabbed in the back by peten the dark clown, seeing kaiba get kicked in the back by the toon gemini elves and seeing Joey get shot in the ass by injection fairy lilly. Also all the characters yell more than usaual and really sound like they have to go to the bathroom. It is no longer time to duel IT IS TIME TO DIE . I wish this movie would die.
