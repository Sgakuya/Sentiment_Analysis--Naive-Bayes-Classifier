I am a cerealaholic, and am beginning to see that I go through mad obssessions with food. At one time, Froot(not to be confused with fruit) Loops was my cereal of choice. Now, I think it's spelled wrong because there is no fruit in the cereal that relies on the sugar and dye for it sales. I have never made any distinctions between the colors. A good thing about this cereal is that it is the only one whose powdery contents at the bottom of the box I have ever not reluctantly allowed into my bowl. A Warning: Eating absurd amounts of these will make the stuff we are embarrassed to deposit in the toilet at another's dwellings turn slightly green with a mysterious green radiation circling. Also, it will look very unfiberlike. The once pleasant memories are how I give this cereal its five.
