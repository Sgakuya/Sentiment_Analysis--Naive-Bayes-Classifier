Toronto has some of the best qualities of New York and London but in a slightly smaller city without all the annoying race talk (New York) and class talk (London). If the world knew how many times Toronto posed as New York/Chicago in American films, music videos and TV commercials, they would realize why some of them are so disappointed when they visit some US cities. For a population of about 4 Million, there is a huge variety of clubs, restaurants and bars. Toronto is also very clean and well-organized. A first look at Toronto can make it appear very decievingly plain but Toronto is an extraordinairly diverse city with more cultures/ethnicities than anywhere that I have ever been. Despite all those good qualities though, Toronto loses one star for some of the more prissy and stand-off-ish city dwellers who are beginning to think that they are god's gift to the world before they have truly defined their city in a world context.
