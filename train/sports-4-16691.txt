The Bus needs a tune up. Famous Amos is a great backup, one of the best pitch hitters in the game, but he needs help with a consistent passing game. Plaxico Burress is a punk, but he's got talent. Across from him is the hard working, dependable Hines Ward. Will Maddox lead the Steelers to the promised land? Probably not without help from the underachieving defense that was so overrated at the begining of last season it was a joke. Bill Cowher is a great coach, but his players need to get over the flop from the Titans kicker. If they dwell on it, they'll do the same thing the Rams did on Vineteri's field goal: IMPLODE.
