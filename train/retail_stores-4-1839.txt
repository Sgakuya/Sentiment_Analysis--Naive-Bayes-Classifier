Alright, Wal-mart has everything you need and the lowest prices. And most are open 24 hours, I love it! I am so thankful for Wal-mart because they give me what I need. I can deal with the frenzied cusomers, occasional long lines and untidy store because I am thrilled to find all the things I need at a reasonable price, and in one store. It is very important for me to get a good deal and find the things I want. I guess that I tend to shop for things that are frequently not carried in other department stores, or for the wrong price. At Wal-mart you always get the low price. If you can't stand all the people, noise, and disorder then shopping at Wal-mart will surely give you a headache. Check out the website in that case.
