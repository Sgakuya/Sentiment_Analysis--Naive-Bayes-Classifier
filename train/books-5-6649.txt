If you're into Fantasy, this is simply *the* book to read. There is nothing like it, no matter what the covers of other books may say ( Comparable to Lord of the Rings etc). Tolkien had been working on his subcreation (the fantasy world of Middle-Earth) for forty years before LOTR was published, giving it consistant history, geography, mythology, languages, etc, etc, making it believable like our own Earth. Then he used his intimate knowledge of the English language to tell his story in the ways of a master storyteller, at all times choosing his style of writing after the content he wanted to express. There ought to be a category 6 - absolutely fabulous - only for this book, that's the only way to give it full justice!
