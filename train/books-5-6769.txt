Originally published in 1965, Dune is a must read for science fiction fans and a strong recommendation for all others. For the uninitiated, the book was inspired by Frank Herbert's involvement with a project to halt the proliferation of sand dunes in Oregon and examines the political intrigue of a futuristic world based on feudalism and how the competing houses fight for power and influence. The House Atreides (which is opposed by House Harkonnen and the Emperor) is given control over the desert planet Dune, the sole source for the spice Melange. With this backdrop, the reader is sucked into the politics, social forces, religion, mysticism, environmentalism, and complex intrigue of the characters as they weave schemes and counterplots. With the theme of a rare and controlled commodity, Dune reminds the reader of our contemporary world largely run by oil. While Dune is essential, the rest of the series is forced and can easily be skipped as other comments have noted. On a related note, one should not allow the original Dune movie to sour interest in this book as the film was a poor representation of the novel; however, the recent series produced and broadcast by the SciFi Channel is excellent. Dune won the first Nebula for Best Novel and shared the Hugo.
