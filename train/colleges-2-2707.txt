I attended the Irving one. The labs have up to date computers and good, when you can get one thats not frozen. They also updated there electronic machines to the latest,(oscilliscopes, function generators, new telecommunications lab, that kinda stuff). Sometimes the students teach the teachers, then the campus is one two story building, they charge you an arm and a leg for everything. I will admit though, some of the teachers did care alot about the students, and the student teacher ratio was very small. But the worst thing is the male:female ratio is like 64:1. Oh, and those dang commercials really bite. But on top of that, its suppost to be a Private University, but yet it says institute!
