old school coach-what's not to love? very good motivator and wins no matter where he goes. Texas is lucky to have him in the state to show them what REAL COACHING is all about. Neptune214 i take it your a mets fan huh? I have lived in Oklahoma all my life and don't give a crap about the cowboys but they did hire a damn fine coach. Oklahoma jealous of Texans? puleeeeze keep your cowboys,astros,rangers,mavericks,insert losers name here next...see a patern forming here? Texans assume they can buy any championship as long as they have cash-btw....how 'bout those Astros...heard Clemens is still a great pitcher...HAHAHAHA, or was that Piazza getting payback?
