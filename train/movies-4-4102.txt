My absolute favorite movie as a child, and actually enjoyed the 'new' version with my children. You people who are trashing this movie are not seeing it in the eyes as a child.. which the movie was meant for. Every kids' dream is to visit a world of chocolate..it's a fantasy. As far as bad acting??? Hello?? Have you not ever watched any other 'old' movie? In it's time, the acting would have been thought as being truly great, the concept genius. In years to come, what we now think is excellent acting, astonishing effects and masterfully thought out, will seem like drivel. Willy, you're still number one in my books.
