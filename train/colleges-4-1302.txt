I wouldn't mind having a degree from that place, only because I know people would respect it. I'm sure, however, that Duke is just like any other school and that you get out of it what you put in. As far as the kids being snobs: Well, I don't like the pause in conversation they all leave after telling you they're going there. It's like they're waiting for loud applause and a pat on the back. Nope, it's just a school. I personally won't go there because I don't want to watch my parents eat pinto beans for four years straight just to send me there. Also, I enjoy life just a little too much to spend such a great portion of it studying. I know someone that goes there and spends four hours a day outside of class studying. I want a good education, but I also don't want to remember the prime years of my life as studying for things that didn't help/interest me.
