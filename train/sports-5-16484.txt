I can't believe I've never rated my favorite football player! Nevertheless this is the guy- the rock solid center for the New York Jets who's made 6 straight pro-bowl appearances. He's probably the fastest center to ever play the game reinventing the position with the ability to pull on down hill tosses for Curtis Martin. He stands about 6'4 and weighs in about 300 but plays much stronger- and is as tough as a bag of rocks. Last year when he broke his right hand he played with a cast and snapped with his left. (and conveniently used the club as a weapon while only being flagged once...LOL) Though this year it seems he's lost a step at the age of 35 he's still the best in the league hands down. I proudly where his jersey every Sunday. A true work horse.
