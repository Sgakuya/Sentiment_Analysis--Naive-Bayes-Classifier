Hmm...5 stars are as high as it goes? That's crazy! Anyway, Vince is the best player in the NBA. He shoots lights out from anywhere on the court (unlike Kobe) and is the best clutch player ever (unlike Kobe). He doesn't whine about anything (unlike Kobe). He's not a selfish player by any means (unlike Kobe). He is a natural leader! And I truly believe he is under rated! If everyone in the building wouldn't jump on him when he touches the ball...he'd average 50 points a game! Comparing him with Jordan or Kobe is dumb! MJ had Pippen and Kobe has Shaq...Vince has nobody to take the triple teams off of him! One of these days he will have someone and that's when all hell will break loose! In conclusion...BEST PLAYER EVER!
