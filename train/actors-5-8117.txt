Bette Davis once said; Until you're known in my profession as a monster, you're not a star! Perhaps that one quote summed up Hollywood in the 30's and 40's. Perhaps Bette knew better than most actresses at that time that to be able to control their own careers, they had to be considered bitches. She has played so many differrent roles from the sweet spinster Charlotte (Now, Voyager) to the devious Regina (The Little Foxes). Of course, she gave those roles and the eighty plus others what they called for (sweetness, fear, meanness), but one thing never wavered: her strength. On the screen, it seemed as if no matter who she was standing next to, Bette Davis always stood taller!
