Well,obviously todays Niners are a mess thanks to salary cap hell but as far as all time,hmm lets see,only team with a sparkling 5-0 superbowl record,winningest team the last 25 years and the team that spawned 2 of the 3 highest rated qb's in history (guess who?)Too many nfl records overall to list. I'm just not even gonna comment on what some fools on this poll wrote like the guy who made up excuses for the lack of real compotision and Steves horrible rating against winning teams,lol. Just not acurate. Any Raider or Cowboy fan will post such illogical crap,usually. What the Niners have accomplished speaks for itself,there really isnt any arguing it. I mean,they were just shut out for the first time since 1977 a few weeks ago...yet another record they owned and one that will never be topped.
