The comparison of Pistol Pete and Jordan isn't fair...I agree that competetively, Jordan was the greatest player of all time. His sheer will is beyond anyone else's. But Pete played the game on a level that Jordan couldn't understand. Pete was someone who wanted to be the Mozart of basketball. He redefined the limits of the game, and turned to the unknown for his basketball genius. Jordan had his moments, but Pete lived in the zone of basketball, where his creative impulse took over any drive towards victory. It wasn't solely about entertaining an audience, instead it was a fulfillment of his incredible artistic passion for the game--making it more than just a game.
