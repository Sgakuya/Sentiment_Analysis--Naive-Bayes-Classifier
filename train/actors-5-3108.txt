I love Russell Crowe as an actor. He isn't the prettiest thing in the world. But is excellent at what he does. I have always enjoyed him. He is also a favorite of my sons too. But I saw the insider just recently for the first time. which is odd for me. Usually I go see movies right away with my favorite actors or actresses. Well, I saw it 4 nearly 5 weeks ago. I still haven't smoked. And you know, I smoked between 3 and 4 packs a day. but watching him do that interview and talking about what they do to tobacco. I put out my last cigarette. So that says how good an actor he is. It had that much impact on me. thank you Mr Russell Crowe, you really changed my life for the better.
