Too bad we can't rate him 100 stars (to offset the people who want to rate him 0 or negative) It's a damn good thing the supreme court upheld the law so we could have our rightfully and properly elected president. Here's what I think. Bush is defending our nation. Gore would have tossed up the white flag in the wake of 9/11. A strong millitary is good, a weak one is evil. Republicans are good, Democrats are evil. Rednecks are good, liberals are evil. Gun owners are good (except criminals), gun control activists are evil. Straight people are good, gays are evil. Bush is good, Clinton/Gore are evil. Beautiful women are good, N.O.W. is evil. The private sector is good, social programs are evil. People who support themselves are good, lazy welfare recipients are evil. Pro-life is good, Pro-choice is evil. Mothers are good, abortionists are evil. Need I say more why Bush is the better choice? I haven't had any nasty messages from anyone in a while. Did everyone fall of the edge of the earth or something?
