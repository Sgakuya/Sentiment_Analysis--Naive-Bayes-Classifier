NYY = Evil Empire... ;) Yeap, Yanks have had a great history, and have had many great players don their striped uniform. Have won many games, many series, many World Series. However, while I admire them for all of the above, I simply do not like, respect, nor care for them as a team. Why? When you watch them and/or their fans, its like they expect the games to be theirs, that the rest of the league owes them something. Sorry, I'm an underdog kind a guy. And it has always been the Red Birds [I'm from StLouis area], Red Sox, or White Sox for me. And to top it off, my doc said that I'm actually the sane, intelligent one here... ;) Wait, what was that sound??? Oh, that was the sound of the Yankees sucking wind after blowing a 3-0 lead... the first team to ever do such... tsk tsk... toooooooo bad... ;)
