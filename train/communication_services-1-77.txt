I can't begin to tell you how horrible these people are! First, they lied to me about what my monthly local charges would be. when I discoverd that the charges would be greater than what they quoted me, I cancelled the service and switched back to SBC. I kept my long distance service with them, though. I continued to be charged for my local service for 8 more months! Every month I would call when I received the bill, and every month they would tell me that my case was caught up in their computer and not to worry about it. Then, every other month, I would get a disconnection notice for not paying my bill! It was only after I involved the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio that they finally took care of my bill. THEN...just last month, I was told that my long distance service with them had been terminated. I called and they told me that, in fact, they had terminated my service in error, but that I would have to reapply (i.e. do the credit check etc.) to have service reapplied. I told them they were out of their minds if they thought I was going to do that and promptly switched to another carrier. PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE!!!
