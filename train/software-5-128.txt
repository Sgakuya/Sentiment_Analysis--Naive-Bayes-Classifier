Since I have never used a competitor to Quicken, I cannot comment on how the program compares with Money, etc; however, with that qualification out of the way, Quicken appears to be the leader in personal accounting/finance for a reason. I have never had trouble getting Quicken to do what I need, the program allows for the user to classify transactions on several levels, and the software is relatively intuitive. On the downside (as others have noted), Intuit has poor customer service, at least with their online help (eg FAQs). I am also having some problems converting some old Quicken files to more recent editions which suggests some limited backwards compatibility.
