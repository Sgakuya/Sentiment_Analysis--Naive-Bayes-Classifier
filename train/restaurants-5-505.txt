Man do I miss Wendy's. Living in San Francisco I have found very few fast food restaurants, and even fewer Wendy's. Why do I miss this restaurant? First of all, the burgers are the best in the business. They taste like they are made from real, quality beef and are juicy and thick. If you are feeling especially daring, push yourself with a triple with cheese - not only will it taste amazing, but you will feel an intense feeling of satisfaction if you are able to put down this mountain of beef and cheese. The potato bar is outstanding as well. If you are feeling a little on the healthy side, get a baked potato with broccoli on top. If you don't feel like going overboard on the health side, get a baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese whiz, and bacon - not quite as healthy, but oh so tasty. In terms of beverages, Frosty's are always an outstanding choice. And finally, if you are a little short on dough, grab a couple of junior bacon cheeseburgers for $.99 a pop. Dave Thomas is a hero of our generation - and Wendy's stands as a tribute to his greatness.
