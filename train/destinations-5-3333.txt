One of the most unique spots on the face of the earth. A city with so much atmosphere you can literally feel it seep into your bones. The St. Louis catherdral is awe inspiring. Crusty buildings line the Bourbon street area and Spanish moss drips from the ancient sleepy trees lining the sidewalks. Hot, sultry, deep south but still retaining a hint of European charm and sophistication. New Orleans is a town of stark contrasts; saints and sinners, artists, musicians, cathedrals, brothels, mansions and shacks. Unlike a living history museum New Orleans is a very much lived in peice of history and walking through its streets gives you the feeling you are actually walking through time. And, once you visit you have no trouble understanding how everyone from musicians, to authors, to world class chefs have been able to draw their inspiration from this oddly captivating city.
