I am currently a student at Colorado Technical University Online. I have attended classes for 14 months now and will graduate in November of 06’ with a degree in criminal justice. I have been completely impressed with my CTU education, however I warn those who lack discipline, organizational skills or dedication to stay away. The classes are fast paced and require the student to spend hours reading and doing homework. Those that I know that have struggled at CTU thought online learning would be a piece of cake, requiring little effort, it is just the opposite. I have attended a “brick and mortar” university as well as CTU Online. It requires much more self discipline to be successful going the online route. I have experienced just as many slackers trying to complete a degree at CTU Online as I did when I attended a physical campus. Your education is what you make it, effort is the key ingredient. I would recommend CTU for serious students only. Michael
