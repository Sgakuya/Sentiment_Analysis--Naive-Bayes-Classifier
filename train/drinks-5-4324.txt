The only drawback to drinking Ardbeg is that it ruins you for any other scotch. I had tried single malts but always preferred Johnnie walker black for its woodsy and light smokey character. I had longed waited to try a Johnnie Walker blue and one night after years I had the chance. The only trouble was that earlier that evening I tried an Ardbeg 10 year old scotch. You will never be able to appreciate what a scotch can taste like until you have an ardbeg. This scotch has a signature aroma, taste and lasting finish that will forever linger in your mind. I had the taste of peat in my mouth and sinuses for hours. Later that night we tried a Johnnie Walker blue. I anticipated this moment for all that I had heard and how I had loved the black. Guess what. Nothing. It was wasted on me because the Ardbeg raised the bar so high that no other scotch would be able to do it. This is the best, peatiest,smoothest scotch out there. Have it neat and then try it with a dash of water to help bring out the flavor. See which you prefer but beware, once you try Ardbeg you can never go back.
