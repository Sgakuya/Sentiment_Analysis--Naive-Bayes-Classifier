My first visit to 'Le Cite' was partly involuntary - As part of a party tour largely comprised of Americains like myself along with a peppering of Aussies and Canucks. My initial response to France as a forthcoming destination (we went directly to Paris after an easy border crossing) was basically one of reservation not because I'm one of those conditioned Americans who have a negative perception of anything Fran√ßaise because they've been told they should but because I hadn't been particularly intrigued by French culture. I was aware that Paris was a wonderful haven for free thinking American expats even before the Beat era but I dismissed that as old news. However, as it turned out, Paris was perhaps the highlight of that trip. Not only was it an overwhelming and quite interesting city but I had a blast there with lots of fine, humorous memories in tow after my departure. Paris has real character - a rare trait among North American cities. My second visit was definitely more down to Earth but rarely have any places that I've been to seemed better the second time around anyway. On that second trip, I was able to inspect Paris with a more discerning eye and I spent more time in real Parisian places, not just say, the Montmarte. I'm convinced that Paris still retains much of the magic that literate Americans must have felt there long ago.
