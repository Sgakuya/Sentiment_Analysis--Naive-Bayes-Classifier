Boys for Pele is different from any other albums I've ever heard. Tori Amos can pull of a whiny voice, without coming of as whiny. The songs are all very low key and most are accompanied by the piano. The real break out in this album has to be Professional Widow (Armand's Star Trunk Funkin' Mix) which is a very energetic and emotional song. Other good songs are Mr Zebra, Hey Jupiter, Talula, Not the Red Baron (based loosely on Snoopy) and Father Lucifer. IF you're looking for an album with a lot of beats and energy, look somewhere else. But if you want an album with soothing, weird and beautiful music, look here.
