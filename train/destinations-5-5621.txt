Massachusetts- the birthplace of America, and the American dream. Basketball, Volleyball, and yes Baseball were all invented with 30 minutes of each other. I have lived in the western part of the state all of my life, and the places and people never cease to amaze me. It's not fair to say everyone in Mass is stupid or w/e because they have an accent, I certainly dont. Damn straight we're arrogant, we have to be in order to put up with inconsiderate, ignorant, narrow-minded right-wing nut jobs, like some of you are. If you have never been here, then you do not have the right to judge me or my fellow citizens, and in return i will not judge texas (coughs)...I'm a masshole, and damn proud of it! p.s the other 49 states owe us for...idk, the nation they live in
