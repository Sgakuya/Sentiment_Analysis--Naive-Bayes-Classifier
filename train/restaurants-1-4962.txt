The rating by Munchie makes me laugh. Just because OG is a restaurnt is why it should be better than your mom's cooking. One thing I find very funny these days is that people expect mediocre food and service ina restaurant - why? Because most people eat out way too often. When I was growing up, going out was a treat, which is why restaurants were usually good and a bad meal at a restaurant (not including fast food) was a rare thing. Olive Garden is one of the chains I despise the most. They do not cook anything at your local OG; it is all prepared in a central factory and then reheated at your local OG. If I want factory food, I can always go eat in a cantine. OG is the worst of the bunch and makes its living by offering mediocre pseedo-Italian food for gluttons at low, low prices. I nearly died laughing when they started that ad campaign about a cooking school with Mamma So-and-so in charge in Tuscany! Hahaha! Their food comes from laboratories, and like some cheap wines have never seen a grape, their food has never seen a chef, just guys in lab coats!
