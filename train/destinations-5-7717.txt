Baseball! The way it was meant to be. Not all this crap with millionaires complaining about how they have to go on strike. This is baseball the way it was meant to be. You don't go to Fenway for sideshows, you go to Fenway for the national pastime. The place has character -- the Green Monster, the bullpen jutting out into rightcenterfield, even the obstructed view seats, the bleachers, the asymmetric field. And, even though I hate the Red Sox, their fans are amazing. The team wins a World Series about once very 100 years or so, and the fans are still loyal, and you know it from the moment you step into the storied park. Seeing a game in Fenway could even make a baseball fan out of someone who hates the game.
