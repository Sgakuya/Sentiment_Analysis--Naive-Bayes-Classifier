This about an almost 4 to me. It is a good well acted movie. A young man dates a 30 something woman who has two kids. Her soon to be ex husband is unhappy with her dating this 20 year old. He trashes the house that his wife lives in and the boyfriend Frank comes over to help her. Frank gets shot by the enraged husband. YOu do not see him get shot so you do not see how he gets shot Only that the husband is the accused. The parents of Frank are heartbroken to lose their only child. The last 20 minutes is interesting about what happens to the soon to be ex husband. and the last three minutes made me think about the whole movie. This has some good parts, Sissy Spacek and the man who played her husband were both good in their roles. the only thing is it was kind of slow moving and a bit boring in parts. I l liked this okay but was glad I waited for it to come out on video.
