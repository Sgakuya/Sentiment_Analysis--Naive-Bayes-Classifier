My friend and I were really poor one day but we were starving. We had just gotten an Outback in our town, so we thought we'd give it a try. We had not heard anything about the prices beforehand. We go and sit down and start looking at the menu to realize that just about the only thing we could afford would be to split an appetizer. We each had about $6.00. We ordered a shrimp appetizer for $10.00, plus tax. We figured for $10.00, it must be decently sized. It ended up having only 6 pieces of shrimp! We each ate our 3 and left, still starving. I have been since then, after recieving some gift cards to eat there. Still wasn't that impressed, but hey, it was free this time.
