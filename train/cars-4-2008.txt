I never really cared for corvettes untill i bought my 1977. It was a basket case when I brought it home but it's one heck of a project car. Parts are readily available and the thing is a dream to work on. Sure it's small and it seems I have to work on somthing every time i take it out for a drive but isn't that what I bought it for? Most of you guys import so called sports cars would run on the exhaust fumes my machine puts out. I may be nearing old age at 46, but I'm not fat or balding! One things for sure you drive this car and people will ask you questions about it. Much like a blond, you can't really appreciate one till you have it!
