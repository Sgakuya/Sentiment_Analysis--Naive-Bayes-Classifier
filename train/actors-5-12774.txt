To put it bluntly, she is absolutley beautiful with a touch of class and charisma. Is she overated as an actress, too early in her career to tell. She won an oscar and has defined her ability to portray an English woman. Since Shakespeare , has she challenged her acting ability--No--but she has kept working. Duets allowed her to work with her father. Wouldn't you do the same? Have we overlooked strong performances in Hard Eight and Great Expectations? --she played the heartless character, Estelle, to the tee. Her future in this business is completely up to her. I believe that the only wave that would slow her down would be her strong desire to settle down and start a family. Too bad it won't be with me!!
