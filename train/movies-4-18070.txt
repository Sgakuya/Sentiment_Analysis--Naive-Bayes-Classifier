Kathy Bates and James Caan both performed very well in this movie. The concept of the movie was very unique. Misery is not a gory horror movie by any means. What places this movie as a horror is the suspense and one of the worst possible scenarios you could wind up in. Caan has a horrible car accident during a snowstorm and is nearly killed(in this case it would have been a more favorable outcome then the series of events that follow). As he regains consciousness under the care of Bates he realizes his legs are broken and he's stuck in the house with a psychotic Bates who is hisnumber one fan. Action packed ending when Caan attempts an escape
