Mary-Kate and Ashley are both very talented. I somewhat prefer Mary-Kate over Ashley though, because she seems more real and down to Earth. It may just be her roles, but she's more sarcastic and I like how she plays her roles. She can be both sporty and girly, wheras, Ashley, I believe is so used to playing the girly roles, it's kindof how she acts automaticly because she's done it so much. They both do an excellent job in all their roles , though I find they are way to made up for the ages they are actually playing. Even when they were like 13 and 14, they were made up to look 16. It's ok now, because they are 17 or so, but it's all good.
