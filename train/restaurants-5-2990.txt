I recently dined @ the Friendly's restaurant in Webster, NY. The food was good, the icecream was awesome, and the service was outstanding. The restaurant was VERY busy, but by the aura the staff gave off, you could tell that they were 'in the zone' and really enjoying thier jobs. After a short time there, it was obvious as to why. Around the corner came the manage, and he was FLYING!!! He had a huge smile on his face, and his arms full of plates of food. He delivered the food, made a quick joke,and was off again, but not without taking the the time to say hello to us, and truly make us feel welcome & wanted. It seemed like only seconds before he was back around the corner... with more food, and another big smile. It must be true, what they say, that the boss sets the tone for the workplace, because his enthusiam & teamwork were evident in every worker there. I have never seen ANY manager work with his people as hard as this man did. Hats off to you sir! I sure hope that your employees truly appreciate having a boss like you!
