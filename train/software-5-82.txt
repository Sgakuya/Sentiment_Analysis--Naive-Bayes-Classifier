Excellent software for kids! Not only are they entertained by Bear and his friends, they are also introduced to educational and fun games. I am amazed at my 3 and 4 year olds' ability to manipulate the mouse and play these computer games. The games on Bear's Sense of Adventure explore the five senses. Kids love the adventures while they learn how to use different ingredients to create a finished product. The graphics are top quality which make it even more entertaining for the kids to follow Bear and sing along. Not only does this software introduce kids to the computer, it also stimulates creativity and imagination. I highly recommend it for young children.
