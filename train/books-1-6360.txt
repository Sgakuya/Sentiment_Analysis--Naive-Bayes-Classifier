A shallow and thoroughly racist analysis of the state of the culture in European-dominated nations. Buchanan's major premise is that our culture is being ripped asunder because Caucasian women are not having enough children. His minor premises are no better. Buchanan misses the wark by quite a wide margin on every front on which he comments. There is morality without reference to the mystical or mythological - Buchanan just doesn't get that. Women are painted as selfish and/or immoral for not wanting farm-family numbers of offspring. What poppycock! Culture is not the sole province of Caucasians; a premise which Buchanan repeats ad nauseum. Speaking of nauseum - don't read the book unless you want some!
