I thought t-mobile was one of the greatest going on 4 years with them. But after THIS experience that has lasted almost a month, I can TRUTHFULLY SAY that T-Mobile is one of the worst moblile services ANYONE can have. Calls get disconnected (even some to customer services), the people at customer services are rude unprofessional, and t-mobile will be sure to bill you for something or another (WATCH YOUR BILL FOR ANY FALSE ADDITIONS). My account had been charged OVER $100 for calls that "T-Mobile's system could not read" reading NMB UNAVAILABLE, and those calls use up your monthly minutes. It turns out that the number was my fiancee,another T-mobile customer, of whom i refered to get the mobile service (so we could talk "free mobiletomobile"). But apparently T-mobile doesn't read their own customers numbers!! and i'm getting charged for, (customer service quote): "an ovbcious SYSTEM error"! I paid what i normally pay for the month, and they said that that will affect my credit score, even though it's not the customers fault. I have had to file 3 ABR disputes, and this 3rd one better be the charm, because I'm out. Sign up with verizon!
