i drive a '00 2.0 5-speed gas jetta. this car is really cool. you can tell the engineers really thought outside the box here. it's evident in the way the hood opens, the trunk opens, and so on. the trunk uses hydraulics instead of a lever arm which takes up space. therefore, this trunk is quite big and has a lot of *USABLE* space. the sound system (monsoon) is great. i don't like having to go all the way to the trunk to make cd changes. my gripes: the window on the right felll off the track. i took it to the dealers who fixed it up. now, the oil pan needs replacement. this is $350. i got my car used, by the way. finally, this car is fun to drive. but, i'm skeptical about its reliability.
