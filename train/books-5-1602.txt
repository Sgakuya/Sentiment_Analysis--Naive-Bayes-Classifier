Published primarily during the 1980's, Bloom County is my personal favorite comic strip and should be considered one of the best ever. After the strip hit its stride and the characters were developed, Bloom County simply had no equal during its run. For the uninitiated, the comic strip (written by Berke Breathed) was set around a group of eccentric human and animal characters in rural Bloom County. Among the fan favorites were Steve Dallas the scheming lawyer, Opus the good-hearted penguin who was always in fear of the lurking walrus, and Bill the Cat who never spoke a word but could answer our greatest questions by perpetually coughing up hairballs. Bloom County did tackle a few political matters, but never in a militant way as Doonesbury so often does. I do think that the strip was faltering in its latter years, so Breathed was probably correct in ending it before it collapsed completely. Long live Billy and the Boingers!
