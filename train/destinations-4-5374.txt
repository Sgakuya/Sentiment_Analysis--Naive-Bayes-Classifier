I moved here by choice from New Mexico BECAUSE of the coller, rainier weather. Nothing against New Mexico, but I enjoy colors that go beyond 17 shades of brown. It is so comfortable around here (in western WA specifically). It's true that the drivers and traffic problems are awful. The state's political inclinations amuse me--60% of the state will always vote for cutting taxes and at least 60% for more government services. This means at least 20% are seriously mathematically challenged (no wonder we use the lottery so successfully...) Still, the people ARE friendly and I enjoy it here. I'm amazed at one thing though--how often I've noticed Washingtonians love to berate their own state. If it s*cks so bad, why do they stay?
