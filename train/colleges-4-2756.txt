I received my BSIT from UoP in 2003 and I am now pursuing my MBA. I have taken several courses online and found them more difficult than the classroom environment. However, I am more of visual learner and prefer the classroom anyway. My experience thus far has been pleasant. I have received two promotions since I graduated and I personally feel that I am a better writer. I don't think UOP is for everyone, whether that is because of the cost, teaching format, learning teams. etc. I think UOP is critized mainly because of its untraditional format. Generally, people who do not understand change or do not like change tend to resist (not saying that is bad either). It is all what you put into it. In my time at UOP, I have seen people get by doing minimum and that is true anywhere you go. Success is not necessarily measured by the degree on my wall. Always give 100% and you will receive a hundred fold return!
