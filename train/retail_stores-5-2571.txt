Albertson's is by far the highest quality grocery store in my town. We have Smith's (a large chain here that has jacked up prices, unless you use their club card--- they're not that impressive to begin with), Macey's (a warehouse much like Food for Less...feels like you're shopping at the government food pantry), Wal-Mart (who's prices are great, but buying perishable foods there is a big mistake!! We've bought brand new, moldy sour cream their produce is always awful! One time, all of the zuchinni was black! Plus, we always bring home swarms of fruit flies with their produce). Albertson's has the best quality dairy, meats, produce of all the stores in my area!
