I drove through Colorado on a roadtrip across the US and this was definately the most beautiful state I came through. Driving around Grand Junction was amazing with very colorful mesa's and valleys. After that I came through a dramatic canyon over the Colorado River with steep walls on each side. The Rocky Mountains were breathtaking. I would love to come back here to go skiing. Denver is a very nice city and it seems to have a lot going for it and is becoming pretty trendy. Eastern Colorado pretty much resembles it's neighbor Kansas with wide open spaces and prairies but that just adds to the diversity and multitude of scenery that you can find here.
