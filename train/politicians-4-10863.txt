UPDATE: His shameful vote against the confirmation of Condoleeza Rice indicates maybe he's not a moderate democrat, after all. Very foolish, made him look like a yes-man to the liberal wing-nuts like Boxer, Kennedy and Kerry. His nay vote assured her the highest total of negative votes for a Secretary of State in over 100 years, sort of like the first cannon salvo over the bow. ADDITIONAL COMMENT 1/27/05: Lance, Flick, we're gonna need another chair for Chalky. Are there any more cigars? ORIGINAL COMMENT 11/16/04: As of this writing, one of only two democrats in the top ten. The top 50 spots absolutely dominated by republicans with the most shrill, liberal democrats dominating the bottom 20% of the list. Evan Bayh has been a moderate influence in the Senate, following in his father's footsteps capably.
