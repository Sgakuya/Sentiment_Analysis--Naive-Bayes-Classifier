Breakdown is certainly a better suspenseful thriller than one would expect it to be. I for one was quick to dismiss the film because the plot seemed typical and overdone. However, Breakdown really surprised me. Kurt Russell plays Jeff, who along with his wife is taking a trip cross' country from the east coast to the west. Out in the middle of the desert, their car breaks down. Russell's character lets his wife go with a seemingly nice truck driver (the late J.T. Walsh) to find help, but his wife doesn't return. What follows is a thrilling and suspenseful ride that is sure to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. A solid cast, plot and general atmosphere puts Breakdown over the top as a thrilling and suspenseful ride that climaxes with an exiciting and explosive ending.
