I have searched for years, trying different cigarette blends, for the perfect cigarette. While Nat Sherman has not yet received perfection, they are the BEST domestic brand. The packs come in rectangular boxes - Shrink Wrapped on the outside. Inside, a plastic sheet is folded over the contents for an extra level of freshness. Ten cigarettes rest on top of a parchment that either has ordering information (for cheap cartons) or describes the blend. Ten more cigarettes rest underneath the paper. The blend is strong, smooth, and aromatic. The taste completely fills one's mouth. Being King-size cigarettes, one finds it easy to inhale. Whenever I smoke Nat Shermans conversation is easy. People approach me when they see the odd packaging and are curious about the product within. Since I am a generous person, I'll invariably offer one of my cigarettes and I love to see people's reactions. Again, these are very strong cigarettes. Marlboro Reds, Kamel Reds, Gauloise, Krong Thip, all pale in comparison to this superior blend. For those of you who only buy American, and for that reason you've stuck with Marlboros or Camels, this is the blend for you... Pure American Muscle. The price may be high (about $5-$6/pack), but the luxurious smoking blend and the sanguine temperament instilled by these cigarettes more than make up for it.
