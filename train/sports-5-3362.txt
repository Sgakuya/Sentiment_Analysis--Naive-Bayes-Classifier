The comments here are interesting. It's clear that no one who rated Clemente ever saw him play. One rater calls him the Sammy Sosa of the early 70s. Both good people, their games had little in common. Another talks about him having run into a lot of walls. Let's really compare the games. Clemente played 1/2 of his games at Forbes Field. There are no Forbes Fields left in the majors. Massive outfield, dwarfs anything around today. Huge foul ground. Incredible amount of ground to cover. I remember Maury Wills hitting a gapper to right-center at Forbes. Clemente one-hopped it bare handed near the warning track, stopped and through a strike to the plate to nail Jim Lefebvre running from first at the plate. Not just your average through, he threw it on the fly, and it was so low, and so accurate that it could have taken off the cutoff man's head. Best right fielder I ever saw, and a great hitter, too. If he hadn't played at Forbes, he'd have been viewed as a 5-tool player.
