I fear all these positive comments must have been left by employees of CVS...oh, wait a minute...probably not, because that would actually require WORK. Maybe it is just the CVS stores in the DC-Metro area, but I have NEVER had so many issues with one store. I actually dread going in there. Besides the obvious nusiance of items being marked as on sale when they are not (they are not so good to change the "CVS Bonus card special tags), the pharamcy actually LOST my perscription requiring me to have to go through the hassle of contacting my doctor to get another one. That is just one of the many, many examples I can give! Its to the point I actually DREAD getting my perscriptions filled.
