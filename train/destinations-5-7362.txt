i find it funny that Americans are calling French people rude. Talk about your basic pot calling the kettle black scenario. Paris is a fantastic city and the people are no more or less rude than people in New York, Boston or Philadelphia, even Chicago really. I suspect you people are speaking broken or no French, and are behaving like Americans typically behave, like we own the world, so some French probably take offense. But the sights to see have been mostly mentioned already: the Louvre, Seine River, Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower,etc. Paris, along with New York,Washington, London, Tokyo, Moscow and Rome, should be on your list of cities to visit before you die.
