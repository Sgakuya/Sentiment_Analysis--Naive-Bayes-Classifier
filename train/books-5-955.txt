I write this on the eve of the release of the 6th book of the series, which I'm almost nervous to read. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an amazing book. I will admit, I got a bit irritated at the beginning, which was about 5 chapters of complaining, but then I realized that before my eyes, Harry had become a teenager, and, well, teens are angsty. After thinking about this, I realized that this really is an important part in making the story move forward, and Harry grow up. They can't stay innocent little darlings forever. In addition, he is also dealing with what happened at the end of the previous year, which would be difficult for anyone. This book also evoked a lot of anger towards people you were meant to love, most notably Dumbledore, which was very strange after all this time. Once I got through the first several chapters, (during which I was a little worried that the story would never start) I found this book as easy to read as the rest of them, and just as enjoyable. I can't wait until tomorrow, HBP has got a lot to live up to!
