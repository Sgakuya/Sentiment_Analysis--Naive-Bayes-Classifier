To paraphrase Chevy Chase, We're the U.S., and you're not! The best, brightest, most wonderful nation on this planet, BAR NONE. We are the most successful nation in the history of this planet. What other country can boast of having people leave all those other insignificant nations and come to this one?!? We are the red, white and blue, and those colors don't run, bay-bee! We were founded of the idea that we can kick a-s and do things that we as AMERICANS want to do. If you don't like it, then LEAVE! We only want can-do people in this nation. We are the symbol of progress. We are the shining beacon of hope that ALL countries envy. They mock America because they know WE ARE RIGHT. We are ideally located on this planet. We are the be-all and end-all of civilization. We are the alpha and the omega of culture. We are the nation of democracy and the right to do whatever we want to do. We are omnipotent, and that's the way it is! We always will be! And I'm proud to be an AMERICAN, where at least I know I'm free! Sic semper tyrannis, semper fi, and remember 9/11! GOD BLESS AMERICA, BAY-BEE!!!!!
