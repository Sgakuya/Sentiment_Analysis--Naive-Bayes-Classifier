I hate the guy. The world would be a much better place if he was dead. He appears really thick but either is actually clever or has some smart speech writers, because his xenophobic, old testament rhetoric is just what appeals to so many dumbass rednecks who think america should rule the world. Anyone who still thinks he is a good president, I'll just say this - Iraq. I have just been reading some other people's ratings - didnt know whether to lagh or cry when they went on about his 'integrity' 'honesty' 'morality' 'christian convictions' etc. he has no qualms about screwing up the world for everyone else. He's mean, sneaky and a bully. His bigotry and neo-colonialism know no bounds. I simply can't express how much i hate him.
