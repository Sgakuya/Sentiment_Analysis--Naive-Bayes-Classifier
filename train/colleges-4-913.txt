DeVry University is a great investment. The school is going through some transistions as far as their student services is concerned. The undergraduate and graduate programs combined last year under the name DeVry University. The administration is diligently trying to combine the resources of the school to support both segments of the student body. I'm a graduate student at the school and the education I get is extremely relevent. I can't overemphasize that enough. The school gives students a knowledge base that makes them extremely competitive in the corporate world. The instructors really do have hands on experience in the areas in which they teach. I've received valuable advice from many of these real world professionals that I know I couldn't get at a traditional school. The drawbacks of the school is the poor customer service and relaxed admissions standards. I often have to call multiple times to get a request taken care of. The relaxed admissions standards comes from the school being a for-profit school. It often leads to poor group discussions or slackers as group members on group projects. I'm sure all colleges have their share of slackers so that shouldn't dissuade anybody from attending the school. Bottomline, DeVry is an institution that is focused on career development by teaching professional skills for career-oriented students. If you are interested in having a marketable degree from a school that is recognized across the nation then DeVry is the place for you. If you absolutely have to have a football team, pep rallies, and all the other mindless activities associated with college, I suggest looking elsewhere.
