Hi From South Fort Worth!, (cases ,24 -16.9FL oz Deja Blue) I am mad as hell at Deja Blue! !.My Mother is fumming!.Deja Blue has QUIT putting the Sports Spout Cap on !. That is one of the main reason we bought Deja Blue, because of that Sports Cap.Now they are putting on the screw on cap. BOO !.I PRAY that more people will protest this with me. I have looked at other water and they don't have the Sports Cap.That is one reason I have not tried these other waters.When driving a car, I can reach over with one hand and open the Sports Cap an drink. I can't the screw on caps.If the bottle gets knocked over,less water will come out of the Sports Cap and make a mess then that screw on cap.I AM JUST SO MAD. I don't even mind paying,say 50 cents extra for the Sports Cap Spout per 24 to the case as how I buy them. Don't get me wrong, I love the water and give it 4 1/2 rating. The one star rating pertains to that new screw on cap.In closing, I do hope others will join me and protest. I will e-mail the main company that owns Dr. Pepper and also Dr. Pepper itself that bottles it.----------------Donald Atkins
