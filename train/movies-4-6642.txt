Midnight Cowboy was a controversial movie when it was first released in 1969, mainly because it dealt with issues of homosexuality and prostitution. Today, if censors were to snip a few scenes here and there, Midnight Cowboy could easily pass with a PG-13 rating. It's basically about a young Texan named Joe Buck (Jon Voight) who leaves his hometown for the Big Apple, hoping to strike it rich as a male prostitute for wealthy female clients. He miscalculates the already numerous supply of prostitutes in NYC and is forced to turn tricks for male clients. As his dreams and life swirl down the drain, Joe Buck befriends a small time con man named Ratso Rizzo. Together, they dream of escaping from their bleak existence in NYC for the sunshine of Florida. Sadly though, Midnight Cowboy does not end on a happy note. Brace yourself for a heart wrenching and at times depressing movie. Midnight Cowboy shows us that things don't always work out as we had first planned.
