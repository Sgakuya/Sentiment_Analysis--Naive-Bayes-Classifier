First of all, I only gave UOP a "1" because there was a "0" as an option. The experience at UOP has been nothing but a hassle. The staff is extremely unprofessional and unorganized. My story is one that has probably happened to other people, and it involves financial aid, or lack there of. I recently left the military and began using my G.I Bill for college. When I enrolled, I opted to use my military money to pay for classes, but signed up for financial aid to defer the payment until my G.I. Bill took affect. When my government money began to come in, I called the university to see what needed to be done. I was told multiple times that because I was approved for aid through the university, the G.I. Bill money was mine to keep for personal use, and I was covered for eight classes. After being told this several times, I thought that things were in order. WRONG! I was recently handed a bill of almost $6,000.00. The woman responsible for this was apparently discharged from the university, but they will not take the hit for this terrible mistake. So, after hearing negative stories about some of their programs not being accredited, and actually reading on the internet that they do not offer accredited online courses, degrees, or programs, this has shown me that the University of Phoenix is nothing more than a criminal hoax. Everyone, do yourselves a favor and do not even entertain the thought of attending this apparent college.
