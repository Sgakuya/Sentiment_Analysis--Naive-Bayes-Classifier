Overall, Desmond was a good college football player. But not great. Sure he made a few spectacular plays, but he wasn't always consistent. Now don't get me wrong, he's one of the most electrifying returners to ever play, but that doesn't make him a great receiver. Yeah he made an amazing catch against Notre Dame, I was there. But i still dont think you can call him the best to ever play. And to the user uofmsparty, how can you say he was better than Anthony Carter!? And you shouldn't even be allowed to comment on this because you cant use the words U of M and sparty (d-bags by the way) in the same sentence! If you're gonna name anyone the greatest to ever play, its Anthony Carter! Where do you think the tradition of the #1 at Michigan came from?! Hello!? King Carter! Carter the Darter! Anthony Carter for God's sake! P.S. to brady is 1 tommy frazier was a quarterback at Nebraska! Idiot!
