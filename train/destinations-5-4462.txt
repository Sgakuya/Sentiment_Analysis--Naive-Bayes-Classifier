Let me start out by saying that I really like Atlanta. I moved here to go to college from upstate NY. Atlanta is definatly a young city. I wouldn't be surprised if all the people bashing the city are 30+ with no life beyond their cubicle. As a college student I've had a blast here. The sun is always shining, its warm most of the year. Crime is only a problem if you are dumb enough to venture into the ghetto after dark. Traffic sucks, but only if you live outside the perimeter in yuppie towns like Alpharetta or Stone Mountain. I don't know why people complain about the smog... not once in 4+yrs of living here have I ever even noticed it. Atlanta has tons of clubs, bars and places to eat; great sports, and as a whole... very friendly people. I've made a ton of lasting friendships with great people. That being said... I can understanding the griping of the old folks. Atlanta is a party city... and unfortunatly booze and dancing dosen't mix well with your metamucil.
