Hey I'm as big a F*R*I*E*N*D*S fan as anyone can get but i'm sorry schwimmer fans I just CAN'T stand the guy!! he is just SSSSSOOOOO damn annoying!! ok ,ok he has his funny moments on F*R*I*E*N*D*S that I have to admit (even though I hate it) BUT have you seen his movies? they TOTALY suck! The Pallbearer was the most BORING movie in the world! but his acting in that movie wasen't that bad! but in Six days seven nights that was terrible acting! and in Apt Pupil very bad acting! and what's up with that mustache EWWW that made him look even worst then he already does!! and I didn't even watch half of Kissing a fool! I'm not even gonna talk about that!! As Ross he COULD be ok but as anything else? not a chance!! I think his career won't be as good when F*R*I*E*N*D*S is over,unlike his cutest cast mate Matthew Perry who has a truly great futur in showbiz, whitout a doubt!! and I HATE the way he thinks that he is all that cause he isn't one bit! anyway I just wanna say F*R*I*E*N*D*S rules and long live Chandler Bing!!!
