It bothers me that women cannot get over this guy's good looks and give him 5 stars for his acting abilities. Brad Pitt is definately an above average actor, but he is not that great. However, he does have range, first playing the wild guy JD in Thelma and Louise , and then going on to star in the whacky cartoon movie, Cool World , then moving onto the inquiring rookie detective in the thriller, Seven , and more recently, as the romantic crook in The Mexican . I give this man props for his acting ability, but there is something about his personaliy that sticks with every role he plays, denying them a certain amount of believability.
