Walter Payton, Sweetness, had all the intagibles to be a good back. He wasn't good though, he was great. I think it's unfair for people to say Emmitt Smith or some of the other more recent backs were better. Let's remember early in his career, Walter played on some garbage teams in Chicago. It wasn't until Ditka got there when he really became more well known, but he had already been putting up Hall of Fame numbers despite the lack of his team. He's probably the most complete back ever. He was a hellacious blocker, a great reciever for key situations, and he could throw a pretty spiral. Although he wasn't the athlete, Jim Brown was, he made up for with heart and determination. I was deeply saddened when he died at such a young age. A void that may never be feeled, in the NFL. A great man, and the way he went out, with the heart of a champion. Damn shame, he didn't get a TD in the Super Bowl. Best running back, ever.
