I am at a lack of words to describe my animosity and hatred toward Reggie (being an avid Knicks fan). Coming off screens, if he gets touched, he goes flying to the ground, doing some stupid acting job. Two horrid memories I have embedded in my mind are when he went off for 25 points in the fourth quarter of game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals at the Garden, including several 3-pointers, and when he scored that birage of points in the last 16 seconds of game 1 of the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals at the Garden. I just don't like the guy's attitude, but it is admirable that he is the leader in all-time 3-point field goals.
