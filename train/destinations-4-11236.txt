Bar Harbor really is a great place for a family vacation. Even the drive up is enjoyable especially if you take Rte.1 up along the coastline. The town of Bar Harbor itself is, thankfully, not too large and overblown despite the summer tourism and still retains that local small town rustic feel. Acadia National park is right there (it might even engulfs Bar Harbor but I'm not sure about this)and you can spend hour hiking, rock climbing, exploring, sailing, and mountain biking along the old carriage trails that go one for miles and miles and were once the roadways of the Rockerfellers, Astors, Morgans, Carnegies etc. of the turn of the century. I could go on for hours but basically it's a nice clean, beautiful place for a family vacation and really for just about anyone that enjoys the outdoors.
