I love Helen Hunt's work. My ultimate dream would be to meet her in person some day. She seems like a great person.I love her acting, the thing I have noticed about her is that she really does tend to stick to the parts where she is in a situation good and or bad with a male. She is good at it though, and if it is landing her more movie openings and giving me more chances to see her then it's fine with me. I need to see pay it forward, to see her paly the alcoholic role which is a change. I wish her luck and hope she continues to dominate the movie industry as the lead best female actress. No matter if she is not rated that way by Hollywood I still do.I would love to meet you some day Helen!
