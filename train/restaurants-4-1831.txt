I really enjoy Taco Bell when I am in a rush or dont have a lot of cash. I can stuff myself for about $2. Where else can you do that? I know it isnt authentic, but it still tastes good to me. I especially like the MexiMelts (althought they charge way too much for them these days) and the Baja Chalupas. My main gripe is why do they put all the beans in one spot then all the sour cream in the other end so you get a mouth full of one thing? They need to mix the ingredients up a bit when they put them in. I also wish they used better quality meat, but I know they'd charge a lot more if they did. They also try to rip you off on occasion with the amount of fillings they put in. The pictures on the menu lie. They used to advertised the 9 layer burrito as being a full pound of stuff. I went in and got this wimpy looking flat tortilla and I made them get out the scale and weigh it. When the manager saw what they did he apologized and gave me a new one.
