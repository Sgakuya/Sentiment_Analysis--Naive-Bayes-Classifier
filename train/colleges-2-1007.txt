From an academic standpoint very good, but a thoroughly miserable place to be. Actually takes a sort of sick pride in its high suicide rate among students. Also, undergraduates are generally ignored by professors and graduates compete for attention. The neighborhood is not that bad, but it's surrounded by neighborhoods that are and you better learn quick where you should and shouldn't go (you never want to go West of Cottage Grove, or even to Cottage Grove for that matter, South of the plaisance or North of about 51st is pretty questionable though it's harder to draw a line there), and it is very hard to get out of Hyde Park to anywhere better. In short if you view college as a Darwinian competition and want to do nothing but read for four years then it's a fine place. Otherwise there are a lot of wonderful schools in the midwest that aren't nearly so cutthroat or depressing.
