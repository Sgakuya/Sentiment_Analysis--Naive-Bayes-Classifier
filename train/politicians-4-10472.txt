No politician is perfect, and I don't agree with everthing our president does, but I do respect him. Let's face it, he is still cleaning up the mess left by the Clinton crew...let's see...oh maybe he should negotiate a settlement with Saddam like Ole' Bill and his cronies did back in '94...so they can build nuclear weapons like their buddies, the North Koreans, with a signed agreement and all...oh and while we are on the subject of nuclear weapons...hasn't it just been reported that the Iranian government is in the later stages of developing nuclear weapons...he told the truth when he declared these three rogue nations the Axis of Evil ...problem is no one has had the ***** to say the truth about these countries in the past, that's why he gets into trouble...oh yeah and the fact he doesn't bite his lower lip might have something to do with it as well. Oh, and the UN...what is up with the French? Talk about a head trip...I am sure we are going to find out the real reason why they don't want the US in Iraq...and it certainly isn't for humanitarian reasons. I don't want war...but I also don't ever want my children to witness another 9/11...we gotta do what we gotta do.
