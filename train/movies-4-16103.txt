A very well-done movie about high school football in small-town Texas. Right off the bat, you'll notice the unconventional camera techniques that really add to the artistic feel. Friday Night Lights differs from other sports films in that it focuses less on the football games themselves (you'll notice relatively little of the first few is shown) than on the town's tense, obsessed atmosphere and the personal struggles of the characters. This makes this an ideal middleground for football fanatics and those who have glimpsed only a game or two and are unfamiliar with most aspects of the sport, such as myself. Overall an above-average film that had the audience at my showing on the edge of their seats during the suspenseful climax and cheering by the time the credits rolled.
