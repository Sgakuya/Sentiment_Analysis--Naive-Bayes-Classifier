I don't dis LIKE the Illini team. The fact is I am a die hard Carolina fan. I will always be. I got so much bull because they beat us the other day. Any heels fan knows that we lost 7 players this year. 7. That means UNC isn't great this year, but the fact that we only lost by 4 points to number 12 in the league personally to me means that the Illini team is over rated. I don't mean to be harsh, but if Illinois wants to keep a good record and be highly ranked, they need to blow away the small teams, but still beat the big. The heels aren't bad this year, but they aren't going to be ranked. So Illinois needs to learn how to win, or else they will NOT be a contender in the championship game. GO HEELS!
