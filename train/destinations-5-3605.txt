Santa Fe is a fantastic place to visit any time of year, but my favorite time to go is the summer because of the gorgeous weather and the spectacular sunsets. I especially enjoy checking out the galleries along Canyon Road and exploring the downtown area. The Museum of Folk Art, the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, and the Santa Fe Opera are all worth the trip. Another good reason to visit Santa Fe is the fantastic New Mexican cuisine. Try Cafe Pasqual's (especially for breakfast), Maria's Kitchen, and Tomasita's. If you're willing to spend some money, the Coyote Cafe is outstanding. Even if you don't visit Santa Fe in the summer, you can be sure to have a wonderful time.
