Washington is beautiful, the Pacific Ocean, the Puget Sound, the many, many lakes and rivers, the endless forests (until the gov't lets them cut all the trees down anyway), mountains that tickle the clouds in the sky, deserts, plains, apple orchards, wheat fields, cattle, horses, small rural towns, large cities, Canada to the north, Oregon to the south, Hawaii a 5 hour flight away, what more could one ask for? It has it's problems, what state doesn't? But, aside from the odd earthquake (WA is on several major, California type series of faults) and a forest fire, it is a good place to live, taxes are way too high for services rendered, don't know why, and the ocean is way to cold to swim in without all sorts of top notch wet suits, but it is pretty to sit and watch, and smell and walk your dog along the beaches. Does tend to be cloudy a lot, but hey, that is the colder ocean off the coast, so at least you don't have to worry about hurricanes!
