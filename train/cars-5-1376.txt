My girlfriend bought a 2000 Jetta TDI a few months ago and she and I both agree it is a fantastic car. It is very roomy, very comfortable, it has a huge trunk, a full size spare, it rides incredibly smooth, and is very very quiet. Furthermore, she commutes 60 miles each way to work and wanted something fuel efficient and the TDI gets about 60 miles per gallon of diesel on the highway and this makes an incredible difference when you're driving 600 miles a week beleive me. Christ with these gas prices I wish I had a diesel too and these diesels aren't like the diesels of old they're quieter, more powerful and they burn cleaner as well. Another cool thing is the entire engine is encapsulated in this plastic casing under the hood so when you open the hood you have to pull off these plastic lids to get to the engine, battery etc. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to buy a TDI, I thin VW are fantastic cars that are wll priced and give an exceptional amount of performance, value, efficiency and comfort.
