I left Puerto Rico 11 years ago (no work there). Since then I have returned about 8 times (vacation and visiting family). I was in Puerto Rico last week for 5 days with my family. Rented a car at the San Juan airport - later return the car because it was full of roaches. The auto renter (well known) gave me a lot of buts in returning it. Stay in a Parador in the western part of the Island - had to leave to a hotel because of the intolerable conditions of the room (rate $90.00 a night). Went to another hotel (well known) - last day there was no water. Had to fly back home without a bath. Puerto Ricans in general have gone from very friendly to very rude. It is very sad. I studied Engineering in Mayaguez (city in western part of the Island). My daughter is finishing her industrial engineering degree here in Florida. She found the Island to be third world. She was born on the Island (as my wife and other children). I don't blame the people. I blame the Puerto Rican government (not the United States government its easy to blame someone else for your problems) for what they have done to the Island and it's people. There is a lot of politics. If I were not Puerto Rican - I would never go to the Island as a tourist. People go on vacation to enjoy themselves and be treated with respect and kindness. This, Puerto Rico has lost. For those that have indicated that there is nothing wrong Puerto Rico, please visit other places - not New York City, Chicago or Miami. You have to see that tourist come from everywhere not just from these cities.
