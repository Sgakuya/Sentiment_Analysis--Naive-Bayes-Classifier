I stayed here for 5 days and I have mixed opinions on it. On the positve side I thought the layout of this hotel as far as restaurant, food court, shops, casino was probably the best I saw in Vegas atleast from the hotels I saw. The food was great at the Sherwood Forest Cafe. As far as buying beverages at the Excalibur shops I would advise you go to Walgreens or CVS because it very overpriced. The views from our room were spectacular. From our room on the inner section of Tower 1 we had great views of New York, New York and the strip. When I was in Vegas I got the chance to see the MGM Grand, Mirage, Cesar's Palace, Mandalay Bay, The Luxor, The Stratosphere, and Treasure Island I would say Excalibur is head and shoulders over them as far as kid friendliness goes. Very friendly at the front desk. The room I had was on the 28th floor and I wasn't very impressed at all with the design of the corridors. They were very dark and dreary. The standard two bed room was nothing special. The shower had nowhere to store shampoo so you just had to put it on the floor of the shower.
