I was born in Orlando and lived there for about 14 years. It definitely fits into the category of "a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there." In exchange for a very nice 3 month winter you get 9 months of unbearable heat and humidity. There are way too many tourists who can't drive and are very rude. When I left Spanish was almost becoming a necessity. Now that I have left the housing market has exploded and it has become a very expensive place to live, which eliminated one of its major attributes. Also, now that we have entered an active hurricane phase, insurance is going to only get more expensive. It's really disappointing to have to make such negative comments about my home state.
