I switched from full flavored smokes many years ago and my personal preference has been for a white paper filter cigarette as opposed to a brown paper type such as Camel Lights. For years I smoked the brand True and only recently switched to Parliament Lights. I noticed right away that there was no bite to the back of the throat and I found it to be a smooth smoke. I cannot in good conscience recommed smoking to anyone who does not smoke but for me I have found Parliament Lights a change for the better. Cigarettes are no longer 30 cents a pack as they were when I began smoking and Parliament's buy one get one free offer makes it a little easier on the wallet.
