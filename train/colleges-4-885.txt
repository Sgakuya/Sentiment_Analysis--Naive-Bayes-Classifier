After working for a while I thought about getting my MBA. I looked at a lot of different information and only knew I didn't want a public/city school and one that had low student fees. I also wanted to know the material front-and-back (unlike my undergrad which I kind of muttled through) because I knew that would make a big difference especially if I was going to make this investment. At the campus I attend in Manhattan, we have a lot of diversity -- which isn't true at some of the other big name schools. The professors also help me out whenever I need information or a tutor. Point blank, I sat in an office for 2 years surrounded by Ivy leagues degree holders, and the only thing they were good at was manipulating their bosses for a pay raise without actuallyu doing any meaningful work. Check things out in reality and you'll get the truth... for what it's worth!
