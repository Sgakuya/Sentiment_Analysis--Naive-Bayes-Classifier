The home of my mother and the country that has contributed the most to global culture; the engineering genius of the Romans, the scientific genius of Leonardo, Alessandro Volta etc, the Renaissance, music of Puccini, Verdi, Vivaldi etc. Tastiest cuisine on the planet. Classic architecture in beautiful towns and cities. Great wines such as Barbera, Chianti. The most glamorous football league in the world. Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Lamborghini and Moto Guzzi. Valentino, Gucci, Prada etc. Beautiful scenery from the Aosta valley down to the Amalfi coastline, Capri and Sardinia. My only beef is that I wish Italians back in Italy appreciated all this more and didn't leave old fridges etc by the roadside and throw up dodgy buildings all over the place. Politically incorrect or not but I will say this. Sit down outside any cafe in Rome, Verona, Turin , wherever and you can get a crick in the neck from gazing around at the huge numbers of elegant and gorgeous women.
