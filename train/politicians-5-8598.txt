President Reagan was the greatest preident of the twentith century. He comanded respect and got it, even from democrats. He unified this nation with his strong charachter, dignity,honesty and class. I felt safe under his watch even with the menace of the evil empire . We all knew he wouldn't sell himself to other nations like China. He brought stability back to this nation and made the US respected world wide. I would rather have a president who once acted in B movies instead of a president who acts like he belongs in a porn movie. I have the deepest respect for President Reagan and thank him for all the great things he did for our nation and for the world. I am sad to see him in the state he is in but even now he has dignity.
