Aaron Lewis is a very talented musician and songwritter. He brings nothing new to the table really except his music is about something real. Life,love,family,freindship and heartache. This video captures the feel and sheer emotion of this song completley. You feel Aaron's regret and loneliness. We can all relate to the feeling of the one you let get away. This video will get you thinking. About the past. It'll bring up the hurt you tried to push back. The styling of this video is breath taking. I am amazed at the contrast of each individual shot. This is one of the best videos out there at the moment. The most shocking thing about this outstanding music video is the fact that Fred Durst, the worst lyricist alive, created this masterpeice. If this video comes on do yourself a favor and watch with an open ear and moind. It has probably been a while since you've seen this good a video.
