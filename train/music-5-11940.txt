 Say my name, say my name ! I love Destinys Child for the simple reason the group does have talent. Their harmonies combine beautifully. For the scrub who said that they weren't capable of writing their own material... did you know beyonce co-wrote some songs on their new survivor album? did you know she and kelly co-produced many songs on the album? I thought so! Those girls sing from their hearts as well as their diaphrams. I guarantee if you heard them do their own rendition of the negro spiritual I've been changed ...which I also sing...you would have my foot in your mouth! Kelly, Beyonce and Michelle have God given gifts of song and not one person around can't say that they're not leaving their mark in the industry. I wish Destinys Child much success and as for the haters..When you find room in your puny little lives to talk down about someone who has more money, more talent and more popularity than you, it just shows lack of intelligence. Plus if you weren;t dissing so much you could probably achieve something meaningful in your life also.
