I like Arnold movies. I know that considering myself a serious movie goer is harder having said that, but this movie needs a good deal of work. I just cannot figure out why Arnold can't make another hit. His performance in True Lies was credible, and it was also his last hit. This one just doesn't come close to anything I'd ever want to see again, and I blame character development (not that there's any in an Arnold movie) and lack of serious action. I'd also like to know how much Robert Duvall was paid to be in this piece of manure. His range as an actor is impressive, but his inability to make a good decision about which part to play is too aparent.
