I'm glad I don't live in Massachusetts, because I'd be embarassed to have him representing my interests! He's an old, tired, burned-out Mr. Potato Head who clearly got away with murder after driving the car off the bridge and doing nothing to save Mary Jo Kopechne. Since when does someone forget to call 911?! Honestly! Just another Kennedy family trait of lying and deceit and paying people off and getting off! I think it's time for the people of Mass. to get a clue and send ol' Teddy shuffling back to Cape Cod where he can sit around and wonder why he's such a joke. Also, another good thing is that he provides great comedy material- I like on Conan O'Brien when they have his whole giant head fill the TV screen! If nothing else Ted has been a good source for laughs because he is a prime example of how the American Dream can fail miserably!
