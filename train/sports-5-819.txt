The Phillies paid a boat load of money to get him, and got one hell of a player. As the Phillies clubhouse begins to self destruct under the leadership of Larry Bowa, Jim Thome is literally the only thing keeping the team afloat. He seems to be involved in virtually ALL of the team's offensive production, and seems to homer in 2 of every 3 games as the stretch run approaches. With the media, he has been a pillar of strength - refusing to take the bait and torch Bowa's negative influence on the team - instead playing peacemaker and setting an example for the Burrell's, Rollins', and Tyler Houston's of how big league ball players are supposed to act during a penant race. I would place him second only to Barry Bonds in terms of importance to his team. He deserves better than all the BS he is having to deal with in Philly.
