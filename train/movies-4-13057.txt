It is a horrible crime for as much as I watch movies, that I have never seen the Godfather until this weekend. I finally made the 3 hour commitment to watch it and I am happy I did. First, I am a huge fan of Francis Ford Copella. He is a great director and this movie is an example of his talent. The acting is equally impressive with a great cast (Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Marlon Brando to name a few). The story line is also captivating. The mob fascinates me and this movie shows the whole spectrum of the mob from the inside and out. It shows the family, the crime, and how other people precieve the mob. I really got into the movie right from the opening wedding scene. I can't wait to move onto Godfather II. It is a classic drama movie and I am so happy I finally watched it.
