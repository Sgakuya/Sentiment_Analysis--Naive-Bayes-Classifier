Not changing my rating. Think he'll be a NBA flop, but still give a 5 because I don't care now. I have not been able to afford the internet for months now. I kept scrounging to pay the bill since November, just to speak up for our boys against you idiots. Now I can save my money. I'm through. Say what you want. WE LOST TO SANTA CLARA! WE DON'T PLAY AS A TEAM! Bring out all your big guns. Doesn't matter now. ANOTHER BANNER IN THE RAFTERS! And that's 5 - not 4. 1924, baby! So, have at it. Find the negative. Say what you will. We're the champs, baby! And I will never see this site again.............unless I feel the urge at the library.
