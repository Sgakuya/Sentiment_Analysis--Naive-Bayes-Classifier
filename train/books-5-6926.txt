The wheel of time is one of the greatest fantasy sagas ever written. Some have said that the charecters are one-dimensional. I don't see how this perception can come about. The main characters are not just motivated by good or evil. They are influenced by greed, jealousy, selfishness, politics, personal gain etc. to name a few. Ofcourse there are bound to be some characters who are set irrevocably in their paths and will not be swayed. But this is a fantasy series and this genre has always had such characters. Besides real life is full of such stubborn people. This is a great series that will take up hours of your life.
