Good movie for both those of us who grew up watching John Hughes movies in the 80s and the legion of Sandler fans from the 90s. It is set in the 80s, has the formula of every classic Hughes movie and is filled with the splendid sounds of that decade. Drew Barrymore almost comes across too cute in this movie (in all meanings of that word), but she draws the line just enough to make any guy watching want to have her as his girlfriend. Adam Sandler is best playing this type of loser character that does not have some crazy accent, learning disability, super demonic power and so on. He is best just playing the lovable loser turned hero of the movie like he does in the Wedding Singer.
