Domestically his riegn was a disaster (he cared little for England, in fact he even offered to sell London if someone would offer a fair price) but he was certainly a decent warrior. After having betrayed his father (on request of his mother) and ascending the throne, he popped off to the holy land for a bit of crusading (and to his credit he captured Jerusalem twice and negotiated a truce with Saladin which made it easier for Christian pilgrims to get to the region) until he learned that his little brother John was conspiring with the French king Phillip II. On his way back to England he was captured and imprisoned in Austria but when he did return to England he crushed an attempted coup by John and took back the lands that Phillip II had taken in his absence. He died in 1199 from a crossbow wound (which ironically he had introduced to Europe). Before his death he begged forgiveness from his dead father and asked he be buried close to him so he might seek forgiveness in another world.
