Wow, somebody beat me out requesting good old Horny Tims on RateItAll. Good job, whoever. There's a reason why when you throw a brick in Canada you hit at least 12 Tim Hortons. They have the best coffee of ANY coffee francise on the planet, as well as their diabolically good Boston Cream doughnut. Their recent addition of sandwiches is a bit of a bust as far as I'm concerned...they're too generic in taste and construction. But the chili...yum! They have a very interesting attitude towards the designs of the actual restaurants, as well, with no one layout being the same, but all are very openly laid-out and pleasing to the eye. All hail Tim!
