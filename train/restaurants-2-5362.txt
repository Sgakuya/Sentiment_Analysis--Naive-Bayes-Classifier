Poor Friendly's just ain't what it used to be. It's one of those forgotten restaurants of my childhood. A place we used to look forward to going to and they have just slowly taken themselves out of the picture (or been squeezed out by competitors) and haven't kept up. It's one thing to not keep up the restaurants and get stuck in a decorative era (which they did but have started to change finally) but it's another to have the food and service fall of the map. I probably haven't been to Friendly's more than 3 times in the last 4 years and all three of them have been different Friendly's over the last 6 months and each and every one of them had terrible service, long waits just to get a sundae while there were few people in the place. It was so bad my girlfriend was getting worked up and filled out a card, which I should add is such an unsatifying form of complaining (very unfullfilling), and we seriously almost walked out of the place. If it wasn't for nostalgia and their ice cream these guys wouldn't even exist anymore and it's doubtful I'll give them another chance even for that.
