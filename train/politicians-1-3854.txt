What is it? I just don't get the feeling that he could handle it when under real pressure and especially with foreign statesmen. Al is right, he has slanted judgement. But I guess I do too. I was raised by a low class working mother who worked 3 jobs so I could go to college and make the family proud. I don't see a bright future with Bush in office. I see myself working ever harder to keep up with the Jones, and scrapping at the corporation world to get afoot. Meanwhile, I run daily to keep my Immune system and mental health more elevated but despite my efforts at self preserverance the enviorment gets worse and when I go to order a salad from the local market the person behind the counter can not give me the right change because Bush supported gov gave vouters out to children who opted out of traditional school and now goes to a school whos administration has no standards or can not afford the certified teachers or cost of becoming accredited under the new ed system that Bush intends to creat. I don't know but I looks so glummy with Bush. He discounts youth or at least I never hear him speak highly or hopeful of us. I want change at local levels he wants to do it but how? This makes a big difference because he can say it all he wants to, but the plan is what matters. I don't like the idea of anyone going into Alaska either!!!!! I think that pure greed and if he and his big corporation buddies get in there it's over with. Say hello to your sassy up town wildlife in a box, served somewhat hot with cute little shapes of evergreen trees and grizzle bears that will be extinct due to all the waste from drilling. Ok yeah his family is great and they except everyone from around the world and enbrace diverisity, why didn't they ever host a exchange student? I'm voting for Gore. Enuff said.
