Although there was a good amount of blood, I did not find this movie to be excedingly grotesque, and I know that one of its bloodiest scenes was left on the cutting room floor. However, on this note I shall defer to others rating this movie because if you are concerned about the blood before watching it, you probably will find it to be disgusting. While the movies effects and scene dressings were rich and well produced (the battle sequence was superb), the plot is quite simple in nature, and the final outcome very predictable. However, there is a comforting quality to predictability, and the story evokes feelings of the needs for revenge and freedom in the viewer. Additionally, the fight sequences are very well planned and executed with the exception of the tigers which are too digital in nature.
