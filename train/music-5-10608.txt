I love Let Go. Every song was catchy and I listen to the whole cd through-usually I get bored and skip to the next cd. Not here. I listen to them all. Complicated is the catchiest song on the album but it can make your ears and head scream for relief after about 10 listens or so, as you wonder whether any other song can possibly get this one out of your head. Sk8er Boi is the worst song, by far. Oh, it's good like all songs on this album, but it has its moments. Like, her songwriting can get just plain embarrassing. 'He was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious?' and 'He was a punk, she did ballet, what more can I say?' are especially awkward and make you wince and hope no one else was listening at these points. But overall Let Go is very wicked awesome and is worth a listen. Just beware of Sk8er Boi and you'll be OK.
