iluvseanmay...you're eloquent as always...and scottery4 that statement could not be any less true. this year there are some talented players of course, but not nearly as much as in prior years. This years squad has had injuries with Shavlick Randolph, Sean Dockery, David McClure, Reggie Love They also lost one of their best starters Lou Dang to the NBA. Their number one recruit Sean Livingston never showed up. Every one thought these guys were going to have a building year and not go too far. INSTEAD Krzyzewski coached them to be ACC champions and gain a number one seed. There is a reason this man has more NCAA tournament wins than any other coach EVER, he can coach a team to adapt to any and all problems they may hit along the way.
