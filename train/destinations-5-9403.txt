Stunning! The art, the building itself, the stunning excess. The entire experience bespeaks a world view, power, wealth and pietistic blindness so far removed from the frame of reference of 21st century man as to be a journey to another planet. It is difficult to think of another site that at once incorporates such grandeur and that stands so clearly for the unfathomable chasm between the lives of the nobles and the serfs in pre-twentieth century Russia. Prior to touring the Hermitage I had a friendly debate with a senior official in the Rusian Foreign Ministry regarding the institutiuon of serfdom while dining in his home in Moscow. I was against serfdom; he was for it. I only wish I'd had a fresh view of the Hermitage and Winter Palace just prior to our discussion.
