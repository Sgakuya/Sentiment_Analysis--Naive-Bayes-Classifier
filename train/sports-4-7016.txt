He was a great player, but why is this guy untouchable? Does anyone remember when he yelled at Scottie Pippen when Scottie made the game winning shot instead of passing it to Michael? Or the time when he slapped Steve Kerr during a practice. When the Bulls played the Jazz in the finals, Jordan clearly shoved Brain Russell and made the game winning shot. The ref was right there, but Jordan got the "superstar rule." Do you know why Michael Jordan recently wrote a book and went on the show 60 Minutes, it's because for the first time, Jordan wasn't in the spotlight. He missed the attention, and I'm sick of people acting like he's a god and I'm sick of people acting like he's a choir boy. I know I might get flamed for this, but I think the best NBA player ever was Bill Russell. He was on the greatest dynasty b-ball team ever, he was even a coach, and he dominated the sports world at a time when blacks weren't welcomed.
