This is just a really great place to go to school! I'm sorry for the folks who can't stand it that we don't have our own football stadium... so you just need to walk the 10+/- blocks to a real pro football stadium, boohoo! The academics are really important here, and I think professors and students both take it seriously. However, the campus is full of fun stuff to do and really great people to do it with! And you can't beat Minneapolis for a great time unless you are in Chicago, NY, Boston, etc. It sure blows away Wisconsin or Michigan!!! So my advice is if sports is your life, stay home and watch ESPN4, but if you want to have a great college experience... come check out my school, the University of Minnesota!
