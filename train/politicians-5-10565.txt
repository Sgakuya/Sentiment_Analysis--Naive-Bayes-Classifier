I was not surprised to read negative opinions about President Bush due to the controversey surrounding the election. However, I was surprised to see negative comments posted after the Terrorist Attack committed on Tuesday September 11, 2001. This is not the time to whine and complain about who are president is. This is the time to stand up tall and defend the man who is our president..no matter if you voted for him or not. He is our leader and we need to unite and stand behind him especially at this time. On the day of the attack, I received my Newsweek in the mail. On the cover, GWB and the question about the validity of his presidency. Is this what we choose to show the world? We need to eradicate the division and come together. For the most part, that is what I have witnessed; faith and support for President Bush. This is not the time for you immature whining. I also hope that high profile people who have denounced Bush in the past will keep their mouth shuts at this time. In order to recover from this tragedy both physically and spriritually we must come together and that means we support the man who is our president, and that man is George W. Bush.
