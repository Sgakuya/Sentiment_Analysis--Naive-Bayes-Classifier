I didn't like this film. Instead of being shocked I was rolling my eyes in sheer boredom and looking at my watch as the minutes slowly ticked by at what can only be described as a poor cinematic lukewarm attempt at a thriller. Penelope Cruz and Robert Downey Jnr saved this film from spiraling into complete oblivion. Although I do like and respect Halle Berry a lot I could only laugh at her attempts to look scared, she just simply didn't convince me that what was happening to and around her was even remotely real. There were some good ideas from the story, but I failed to see any of this blossom into what could have potentially and easily been the best thriller of the year.
