It seems to be the general consensus that Vivien Leigh was destined to play Scarlett O'Hara. I completely agree and believe that few actresses, if any, could have done a better more believable job. She looked and sounded exactly like the spoiled southern belle turned survivalist that Margaret Mitchell brought to life in her epic novel. It's kind of ironic to think that over the years the fact that she did such a great job in this coveted role somehow managed to eclipse almost everything else she did after that. This is unfortunate because she actually had quite a range as an actress and was probably among the most gifted talents of her day. One of the better-known examples of her great ability is her unforgettable performance as the troubled Blanche Dubois in Streetcar. For a long time those were the only two parts I identified her with. Then, not many years ago I discovered an interesting film I had never seen before - Caesar and Cleopatra an adaptation of a George Bernard Shaw play to film she did with Claude Raines in 1946. This was not only an entertaining movie in its own right, but also a good showcase of this actress's outstanding ability at character development. The metamorphosis from the innocent, almost childlike Cleopatra to the older, wiser and more cynical one is brilliant in its subtlety. And, it is so complete that it is almost as if the character is being played by two different actresses. Apparently she suffered from Bi-Polar disorder and this may have been where she drew at least some of her ability to change so completely on screen. Whatever the case, she certainly had that ability without question and it made her one of the more fascinating performers with a screen presence unlike anyone else.
