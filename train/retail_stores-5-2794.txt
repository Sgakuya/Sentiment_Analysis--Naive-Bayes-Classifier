I have been dealing with Fred Meyer for almost 11 years. I had just been in to Fred Meyer to buy, non the less, milk, diapers, and bread, when I remembered it was my wife's birthday the next day. I had a full work load and did not have time to do any shopping. So, I pushed my cart full of groceries into Fred Meyer Jewelers and started looking. I met this wonderful sales associate Dee. She smiled, greated me warmly, and treated me respectfully. I was not well off at the time, and could only afford very little. But she did not seem to mind and took time to show me several small pendants in the under $100 range. About a week later, and my wife was wearing the nice pendant Dee had picked out, I received a thankyou card and a birthday card for my wife that Fred Meyer had sent me. Ever since then, I have only shopped at Fred Meyer Jewelers. They care about the little guy as much as the guy with all the money. Thanks Fred Meyer for making me and my wife feel special. I may only spend $100 to $300 each time I go, but they remember my name ask me how my wife and kids are doing and always care. Dave-
