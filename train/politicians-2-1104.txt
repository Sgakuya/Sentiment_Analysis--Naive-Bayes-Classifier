Ignoring his politics, for the moment, the guy seems pretty inept at the cut and thrust of Realpolitik, even (perhaps especially) within his own party. Has been repeatedly handed golden opportunities to defeat a government which has elements of palpable corruption, and hasn't been able to get the job done. If he becomes Prime Minister in 2006, that may turn around, but right now he looks like a bug on the windshield of Canadian history. As to his politics, he seems to spend so much time placating the warring factions in the motley band of opportunists that make up his own party, its difficult to get a grip on exactly what they are.
