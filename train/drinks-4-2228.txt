I didn't expect to like it so much, but the only word I can use to describe the blend of lemon, pear, and ginger flavors is artful! The first thing that hit me was the lemon - so much so that I'd feel remiss not to cite its likeness to lemonade. But there's more to it, than that. While the zing from the lemon & lemongrass is rather subdued, the ginger steps in and gives it a subtle kick. Pear rounds out the flavor and gives it a bit of body. There are a few other ingredients (orange, licorice, and a variety of herbs), but I can't readily pick out their specific contributions to the mix. At 140 calories per 13.8 oz bottle, it's not a very a good choice for dieters (though that's better than you'll do with a corn syrup-sweetened tea, and this has fruit juices). Those sensitive to caffeine or otherwise limiting their intake of it will be glad to know that it's decaf. This also makes it a fine evening beverage.
