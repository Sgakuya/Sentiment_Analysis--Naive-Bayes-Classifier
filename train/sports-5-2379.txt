I've always been a diehard Padres fan. I love this team, no matter how well or poorly they do. They do frustrate me, however. They have great talent but get rid of fine players, trading Ben Davis to keep Wiki Gonzalez. The Padres had Bubba Trammell, and he drove in 93 runs without even playing every day; yet they traded for Ray Lankford to platoon with him, ruining Trammell's confidence. Look at Bubba's ratio of at-bats to RBIs and on-base percentage--it's higher than Nevin's. And the Padres have a potential 15-20 game winner named Clay Condrey; he was great two years ago. Last year Bochy promised him a place in the starting rotation, yet on opening day, Condrey came in to pitch in relief. Without even one start, Condrey was demoted. Why? Then after pitching one inning here and there, Condrey got a few starts and began some games with a few innings of great pitching; because he was used to pitching one inning in relief, he got tired by the fourth inning of his starts and then got knocked around. He has so much potential but lost his confidence and ended up with a high ERA. Howard and Tankersley would also be good if Bochy showed some confidence in them, instead of going with retreads like Charles Nagy and Ismael Valdes. The Pads have their best catcher ever now (Hernandez), and Khalil Greene will be excellent. I think Burroughs will be a consistent 300 hitter and so will Nady if they give him a full year. Peavy can be great one day. This team has much potential.
