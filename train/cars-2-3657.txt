Anyone for some 'lemon'aid?? We certainly have the lemon! We have a 2002 X5 4.4, bought brand new, and had problems with it starting day one. We regret buying it. Lots of little problems with it, but since they are 'minor issues', nothing we should be upset about. It's an expensive vehicle to have several minor issues. A few examples: electronic seats, mirrors, climate control malfunctioning, one door slightly different color (already had it repainted), windows go down whenever they want, rust on running boards, doors don't lock all the time, rain sensors work when they want - this is just to name a few. By the way, did you know you are not supposed to take a BMW through a car wash? At least not ours - due to sensitivity to high water pressure. Have to admit, it is nice to drive, but so are alot of other vehicles. We expected a lot more from BMW and are extremely disappointed.
