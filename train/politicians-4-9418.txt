Zachary Taylor was not president for that long, but he was an execeptional general in the Mexican-American War. His short presidency was actually during a very critical time in our history. The years before the Civil War were very charged; debates between North and South and East and West were occuring. I honestly think that the entire period during the mid-1800's was the growing pains of a new nation. It's very difficult to govern a country with many competeing interests. To make matters worse, America, as a fledging democracy, had no other country to follow in example. Our leaders were playing it by ear. It's funny to note that there was a high turnover rate with presidents during the 1850's. Either they died like Taylor or they chose not to be in the national debate, like Pierce. Nobody really wanted to be president because everyone knew that eventually some really hard decisions would have had to have been made. In my honest opinion, Presidents Fillmore, Pierce, and Buchanan never could nor had the desire to go with their gut . Lincoln made the tough decisions that had to be made to preserve the Union. More than likely, had anyone of the following three presidents had been in the White House instead of Lincoln, we might have a Confederate States of America. Taylor may have been a good intermediary, since he was a Southerner and was kind of neutral concerning slavery. He was also very popular in both the North and the South due to his performance during the Mexican-American War. He may have been able to avert the Civil War by making the tough decisions only a general could make. Unfortunately, the Civil War did come to pass.
