Nader has continuously awakened our souls to the obvious wrongs of our government. I applaud him. I now need his help in attacking a problem. I'm appalled that city, state, and federal employees are penalized when it comes to receiving their Social Security benefits. I taught high school English for 25 years and will have worked for 10 years in the private sector prior to my retirement. I just learned that my Social Security benefits will be offset 2/3 ($1,000 benefit would be decreased to $666) because I worked as a teacher at a state public school. How is this fair to those of us who have served this country's children? I have written letters to my congressman and senators and now I want to help create a grassroots movement to have this federal law changed. I need help on how to go about this, so of course, I immediately thought of Ralph Nader. Do you have any suggestions on how I might tackle this issue? Dona
