I would have to say that I honestly enjoyed this movie 'because' of the sex scenes, and if I may be more candid -and I will, I like the gay lesbian sex scenes the best. I love it when two women have each other. I say god bless it. To me two, or three, or four women sexually satisfying each other is excellent. It's the American way. I say Go girls! America wants 'Basic Instinct 2', but this time Hollywood more lesbian sex scenes! I want the cast to be Sharon Stone, of course (she's the main psychotic sex master), Vanessa Williams, Gina Gershon, Famke Jensen, Jennifer Lopez, Uma Thurman, and Piper Perabo. Now that would be an entertaining movie, and the storyline could easily be developed into a legitimate tale of wicked women binding together to assume control over certain elements of the high society LA community. I am being a bit humorous, yet serious. I think that a lot of women, not all mind you, require that feminine touch from another woman. Their inner feelings are touched differently and are toyed with in a dominant, yet gentle, fashion from one woman to another. A lot of times you will hear some stupid man in a bar utter something like, She wants to be with her? He's drooling over a blonde somewhat heavy girl kissing the ear of a cute little redhead, much like a tiny sex kitten. Of course the little woman wants a one night stand with a somewhat larger dominant female. It is the new taste, the new odor, the new passion for women to be set free on the 'element of freedom' in America. Most women nowaday's seem to be weary of men, and I can understand why. It's easier and more comfortable for a woman, a pretty woman, to go out and pick up another woman, bring her back to her place and have casual sex. Men's ego's are just going to have to adjust, as well as my own. It's tough, but real men can handle it. See this movie, it's more than educational.
