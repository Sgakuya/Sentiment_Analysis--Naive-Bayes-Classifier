I dont know whats wrong with all of you who have said Maurice is anything but a fantastic actor. He is the BEST! To say he looks off camera at cue cards is the stupidest thing I have ever heard in my life. The guy can act better than anyone on TV or movies, for that matter. He has embraced the role of Sonny and NOONE could ever replace him! And if Maurice wasnt a great actor he wouldnt have won an Emmy nor would he have so many nominations..and he is deserving of each and every one of them. GH is doing great in the ratings and I guarantee you that if left the show, the ratings would go downhill fast. And I agree with what others have said...Maurice is a wonderful person and I applaud him for speaking so openly about his manic depression. If only more people had his personality, maybe the world would be a better place! Oh, and he is GORGEOUS!!
