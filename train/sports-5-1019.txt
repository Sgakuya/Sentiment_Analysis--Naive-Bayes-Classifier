His +.600 OBP, is obscene. One of the three best players of all time. Who cares if he's a jerk, he's not a jerk to me or any other fans. Who does he tick off? The media. That's fine with me, he's not supposed to make friends. He broke a single season record (IBBs) before the all-star break! Think about that. You people who hate him are blinded looking for excuses. He's hit 30 or more HRs for 14 straight years, when he was a young normal sized player and while he's aged and become larger. He's the same size as Brett Favre and like most people including myself, he's gained 30 lbs since he was a rookie. Until he tests positive, he shouldn't be tarnished by rumors and admirers of Babe Ruth who can't stand to see Bonds break another one of Ruth's records (Most HRs by a LH).
