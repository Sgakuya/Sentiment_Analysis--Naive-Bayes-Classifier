This movie was not what I expected at all, but in a good way. It was heart-wrenching and realistic, but very depressing. It didn't gloss over the issues that would need to be dealt with in this type of situation. Being a single mother with an ex-husband, I found myself thanking God that I don't have to go through the hell of having a physically abusive ex. The screenplay didn't wimp out and get preachy. The end was a brilliant twist that you really wouldn't see coming, but would feel that you might do the same thing givin the same circumstances, which makes you think a lot about who you really are as a person. This is well worth seeing, but not if you would like to walk away from it in a jovial mood.
