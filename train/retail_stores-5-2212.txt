(Rating based on 2 locations in Gainesville, FL) I've never even heard of this place until I've moved down here, and once you get beyond childishly snickering at the name ( . . . oh, what, like YOU weren't thinking it? Come on . . . ), it's actually a really decent place. CLEANLINESS: 5/5. I have no complaints. PRICES: 4/5. Way more reasonable than Albertson's, but, well, it's hard to give it a "5" after shopping at warehouse stores all my life. SERVICE: 5/5. Yeah, I know the Deli guys are SUPPOSED to give you samples if you ask. But, I'm not used to them OFFERING, and they'll give you samples just to see if you like the thickness of the slices. Not that I'd be that picky about it, but it's still a nice gesture. And cashiers and baggers in the front are generally pretty nice. SELECTION: 4/5. It's okay; nothing extraordinary, it's good enough, though. OVERALL: About a 4.5 out of 5. It's a place that I can feel comfortable shopping at.
