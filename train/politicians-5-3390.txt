Thank God for George W. Bush. W is the right man, at the right time, in the right place. He has courageously and steadfastly dealt with more unforeseen crises in this country than perhaps any president aside from Franklin Roosevelt. Faced with the rabid, seething hatred of him by the left, enforced by Hollywood stooges, the major media outlets, millions of dollars spent by George Sorros and MoveOn.org, as well as slanderous allegations made by the likes of Dan Rather, he survived. He did so because he is a man of principle and conviction, and the majority of Americans know it. Perhaps thats why in my 50 years, I cant remember any president, aside from Nixon and perhaps Johnson, whom have been so hated by the leftist elitists. This indicates to me that he must be doing something right. Just the thought that 9/11 could have happened under an Al Gore presidency gives me night sweats.
