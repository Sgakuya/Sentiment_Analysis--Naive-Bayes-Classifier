Wow, I loved this country. I was surprised to see how It looks like a western state, and also kept the oriental culture. Istanbul is full of history, you can see 500 year old wall, a 1500 year old building and a skyscraper from where you stand. I didn't like some of those old building being used as stores and shops though. It's really amazing that the city sits on 2 continents: west part is on Europe and Eastern part is on Asia. I don't really know much about the asian part, but great history, food and shopping on the part where the ancient city of Byzantion used to be. If you go west and south of Turkey, you'll see lots of beautiful beaches and landscape. the night life is better than msot places in the U.S. i saw lots of German and English tourists, a lot of russians too. The guy at the hotel told me that Turkey attracts a lot of Israelies, too. Turkish people are really nice and friendly, but not many who can speak english. I'd say they are similar with Greeks, but for some reason Greek don't like to hear that. I guess it's because some historical reasons. I didn't see any bad comments on Greeks from Turks though. I guess some bad comments on this forum come form Greeks and Armenians who are still sore about whatever happened in the past, which I don't know about much. From the eyes of a tourist, great place,great people, great food, and lots of history form different periods. oh, there's no camels in Turkey, and they speak Turkish and use latin alphabet, not arabic as I thought before.
