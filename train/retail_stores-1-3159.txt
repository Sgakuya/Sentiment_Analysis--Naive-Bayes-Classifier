gullible-gingercake-thekickbacksutta-wesside310- Bravo folks!!!! You guys speak the truth-- frogger20190, maybe you should go back to 90210 and get an education on fair customer practice. Whithout reiterating the sentiment all all the above(intelligent) reviews--NETFLIX is losing money (I constantly listen to financial news) so I assume their CEO (a few months ago) decieded stall practices would save the company a ton of loot-- as for me, I'm frustrated to the point where I'm leaving them (only after 2 months)-- I still will have the blockbuster 14.99 month one movie at a time plan and belive me I take advantage of this--I average 25 movies a month-- GOOD DEAL - PS, I love this site -- steve (not really so wild) lol.
