I don't know about this movie. I was entertained for the whole 3 hours (which in my book is way too long for any movie). I thought the acting was really good. Heath and Mel were great looking as well as believable in their parts. The history behind the movie was a great lesson about the Revolutionary war that is not given enough attention in schools. There was just so much going on throughout the movie. The plot was so thick. I am guessing there were like 25 mini stories going on and I never got confused or anything but it was just too much. There were also a lot of cheesy one liners. Granted, you have to have one liners in a movie like this but I started laughing outloud since there were so many. For as much cheese in the Patriot, I admit I totally got goose bumps more than once during the movie.
