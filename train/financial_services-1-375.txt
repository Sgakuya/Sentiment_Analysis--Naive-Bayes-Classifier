I am not familiar with this agency, and that's not the point of my rating here. I am only rating the pitfalls of this industry as a whole. Seriously reconsider using ANY debt-consolidation entity if you care at all about the appearance of your credit rating. Debt consolidation is an eye sore on your credit report, and will remain so even after your debts are paid off. Future creditors will look upon the usage of such agencies as risky financial mismanagement. Check out creditboards.com and do a search in their forums. You will learn of more wise alternatives from the regular types who hang out there. Peace out!
