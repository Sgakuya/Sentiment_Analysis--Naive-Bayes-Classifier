think about it.. if it wasn't for arkansas you would not have no wal-mart, no dillards, no allens canning company, no post cereals, no winchester or daisy rifles... i could go on and on and on.. before you judge the state badly think about all the things you wouldn't have if it wasn't for this state.. being a native of arkansas and now living in denver.. it was kind of an insult to have paris hilton and nicole richie look at the bad side of it..in closing, just remember that arkansas is not a place of redneck beer drinkers playing the banjo watching the grass grow.. it is a place of industry and the home of one of the best darn presidents this country ever had!
