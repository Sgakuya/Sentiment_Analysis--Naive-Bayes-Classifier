I wish I could rate this country 0 stars. The only reason why I'm giving it a 2 is we have domestic issue problems and our government is not committed to helping our suffering. ... There's nothing special here. We're not the greatest nation in the world and we're certainly not the last best hope of man on Earth. We're one of the most selfishly developed nations on earth. We give only 3/10 of 1% of our gross national product to healing the wounds around the world. We don't have a universal health care system, environmentalism is not a factor, and we certainly aren't interested in foreign aid. You can get the death penalty if you steal candy in a grocery store and the poor aren't getting enough social services for whatever problems they're suffering. ... We're not the foremost proponent of peace either. Our military is becoming imperialistic because our US troops are building prisons in Iraq when we shouldn't be there. Who are we to police another country? That is none of our business. We don't have people who even put human rights in the forefront when it comes to our foreign policy. The list goes on and on and on. If I had to be a leader, it would be in another country. The United States of America only caters to countries that have money and merchandise. Any country with a right-wing government is an ally with the U.S. I'm sorry if I offended anybody, but I speak the truth from the bottom of my heart. But please, don't sympathize with me.
