Al Gore, may not be the most dynamic politican but his ideas are sound, and his tax plan makes so much sense. He has strong views on most topics, and is clearly more capable than Bush to lead the country. I will agree Bush comes across as funnier, but he runs one of the weakest governorships in the Union. Did you know that the state legislature meets only every other year in Texas? How do you expect him to be able to work with the Congress. Gore is a progressive thinker, and he has a plan to save social security. Any of you young people out there, may not care, but you better pay attention, and realize Gore is only your only hope to save Social Security.
