I am so impressed with the behavior of the republican party during this elections problems. They are conducting themselves with such dignity and pride unlike the democratic party. Gov. Bush really has to be conmended for the actions of himself and his party. Everything politicians do and say teach the future leaders of this country lessons. The democratic party is teaching our children poor sportsmanship and that the people really can/t count on them caring about what it is that we really want. If people did not take the time to read carefully the instructions on how to vote in the state of florida and rushed through the voting process then their vote should not count. Obviously it did not matter to them to make sure they were voting properly. The actions on the part of both parties should really be teaching the voters something about each president. I for one beleave that Bush is going to be the president that really cares what we the people want. Where Gore is really only concerned with winning or loosing along with the entire democratic party. People should have learned a lesson thru Clinton and his actions while in the White House. His behavior sure did teach our children some lessons in lieing and deceitfulness didn't it. Our president should be a person that stands above and his actions should be honest, respectful, and above all teaching our children lessons about morals and convictions and loyalty. That is not what President Clinton did and that certainly does not seem to be the path that Gore is taking either.
