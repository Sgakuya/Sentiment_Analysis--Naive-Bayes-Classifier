A beautiful state. Most of the people there are nice and hardworking, and there certainly are some beautiful attractions, espescially when heading furher into Upstate New York- Niagra Falls was simply breathtaking. This state also has much historical significance, as the battle at Saratoga Springs, which marked a turning point in the war with American victory, was fought here. NYC is home to Madison Square Garden, the world's most famous arena and the Statue of Liberty, not to mention the Empire State Building. The courage and dedication and bravery of all Americans really rang true on September 11th and the subsequent days. A great place to visit!
