Lays Limon Potato Chips! For years I have been slowly giving up the potato chip crave. I had done so successfully until.......being on a road trip and by accident trying one Limon chip. Well, needless to say that I have searched hi and low here in my state (Ft.Lauderdale,FL) and it seems that the only way I can get this flavor of Lays potato chips is to get on a plane and fly 3,000 mile to California (some parts of California that is) and get the....I can't just have one, or for that matter one bag...chip. If Lays is paying attention to this message....could you please get them down to Florida, the Latin community and I'm sure others would love it! Again, it was all by accident and I and the many who I have not so graciously shared my chips with agree. You've got one heck of a product. But somehow you are not marketing it right in a state that would welcome it! Samples at local grocery stores would help. You've got an excellent product and you don't even know it! Okay. I've spoken my peace. Sure hope you are listening.
