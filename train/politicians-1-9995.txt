I do not understand how people can be so stupid. This guy has ruined everything and people still voted him back into office just because he stands up and says 9-11 and God. I respect people's religions, but you should not vote for somebody because they talk about God all of the time. When people thought that gore would win in 2000, they said that the anti-christ was coming. When Bush weasled his way into office, they acted as if they had forgotten all about the anti-christ. And another thing: How well can someone lead the country when they have an I.Q. less than that of a 5th grader, they rely on their daddy for everything, and they used to do cocaine?
