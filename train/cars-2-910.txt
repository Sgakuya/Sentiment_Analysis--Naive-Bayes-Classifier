The Kawasaki 1100 STX DI: Last summer I bought my wife and I a pair of matching 1100 STX DI s. When there not in the shop there great! about a total of four (4) months last summer. Fast smooth ride. I bought this pair because my wife is deaf and I didn t want to have to worry about her trying to use a choke so the fuel injection was the ticket. The Ski was supposed to have auto protection on all systems. That is not true. The exhaust system has plastic parts and a 10 mm hole that the water is supposed to go through to cool the noise dampening system. When this gets clogged by any small and I mean small piece of any thing a rear plastic baffle melts down no engine warning no auto shutdown, smoke billowing out of the seat and front. All I could think of is fire is not far away. (14 gal of gas onboard.) and my wife sitting on top of it. Kawasaki position is that this is not a warrantee part. So all of the automatic safety stuff is not worth what you have to pay. I would not recommend this as a new purchase. After warrantee the 10mm hole can be widen to a reasonable size. The Kawasaki people not my dealer would do nothing about it. Customer service sucks and there web sight only sells accessory. All you get is some punk telling you O well The ski s spent more time in the shop last summer than out about a total of four (4) months. The dealer has a hard time getting parts. I have no reason to recommend them. You will keep them safe in the repair shop and apparently Kawasaki doesn t care. After talking to several mechanics Yamaha has a very tolerant cooling system. Yamaha most likely will be my next set of ski s. If you do buy the STX 1100 STX DI get two so you have something to tow you back in with. Alex Ayotte Crawfordville FL
