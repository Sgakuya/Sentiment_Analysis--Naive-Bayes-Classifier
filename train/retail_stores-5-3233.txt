People that have problems with Blockbuster will have problems renting videos anywhere. Bottom line, return your item on time and you won't have a problem. 9 our of 10 of you probably have a bad attitude and want something for nothing. Also, sure, there are bad employees everywhere, not just at Blockbuster. Just because you have a bad experience at one store does not mean another one is the same way. Another thing, who cares if you don't rent there anymore, millions of people still do, so your money will make no difference. None of you are taking into account that there are tons of Blockbusters and the company will never, I repeat, never go under no matter what quarrles you may have. In essence, Blockbuster must be doing something right. You people represent a minute number of video renters, overall Blockbuster is great!!! Go to Hollywood or Premier if you don't like us!!!
