Boston is one of the great ones. It is one of the oldest cities in North America, and has tons of history, from every single stage in american history. It was important durring the colonial days, the revolution, and the cival war! It is just a great down to earth city, with nice people and great architecture. There is also a lot to do on Beantown. Some areas of Boston are a little strange though and have this whole new age thing about them, which really isn't my taste. One thing i really like about Boston is it's mix between blue and white collar, that makes it a very ideal city. As for the climate, i really don't have a problem with the cold, so i have enjoyed visiting Boston durring all seasons. It is a pretty expensive area though, so i don't think i will ever live there.
