I've only been dipping since like april and i can't even go through a can a week....i'm not that hardcore. But when i try something new, i try all flavors possible. i've tried every single skoal flavor except natural and classic. I've done bandits, and pouches. i like pouches just because they are so easy to use and throw away and you dont have to wash the rest of the tobacco out. Skoal wintergreen pocuhes 4 sure........i want to try those new apple pouches, but i cant find them anywhere. vanilla is good, apple is good. the problem with peach is that it doesnt pack well at all, hard to keep together in your mouth without it spreading all along your lip line. Cherry is the weakest and you do not get any buzz at all. i've tried everything possible and skoal has the be the easiest to use, but doesnt pack as well as grizzly or kodiak. FROST IS THE BEST THING EVER kodiak will knock you on ur ass. it was the first time i chewed and i almost fell down and fainted, but for some reason i still continued to dip....wierd huh? i'm quitting after 8 months of only chewing 3 cans total. i always give the rest away to my friends, because i know if you keep using it, you basically die automatically.
