A lot of people don't really know a lot about this area. Rochester is very diverse and is broken up into several areas. Here's the 411 on them: First off, Greece, my part of town. Greece is NOT inhabited by a bunch of greeks, most of us have italian, irish, or german ancestory, but our three largest high schools all have greek names (olympia, athena, and arcadia) Many streets have greek names too. Greece is the 3rd safest community in america, and has the biggest mall (greece ridge center) on the east coast. Next, the city, the city is frowned upon by many of my fellow suburbanites who think it is all crime ridden run down ghetto. but thats not true, downtown has an a bit of an identity crisis, and the southwestern part of the city is pretty bad, but east of the Genessee river, and up by the lake, it is mostly nice neighborhoods with lots of historical victorian and craftsman style homes. If the city had a better school district, it would be my dream to buy a house on Oxford street. There is also Irondequiot, which many people think of as really kind of white trashy, but they aren't, they are just very Italian! Gates, just south of Greece, is the white trashy part of Rochester. The easternmost areas are the more upper class places; Brighton, Penfield, eastern Webster, and especialy, Pittsford. This area is where most of the yuppies live, that is where most of the new construction in Rochester is, and the average annual income is 88k a year, with most families making more than that. The people aren't really snobby though, which is a good thing. All together, Rochester is probably one of the best communities for living (hence the official slogan). We are one of the only metro areas with over 1million people in the country to receive an All American City award multiple times (the latest being 1998) for being a great place to live. And i believe it.
