Today I had a bad experince with our local Captin D's. When I went to order my food the employee kept interupting me, when I finally got my order placed I had to wait for almost 10 min., it wouldn't have been so bad if they had of been busy, but there was not one car in the parking lot. When I finally got my order, I asked the young lady working the window if there was tartor sauce in the bag, because they never put any in there. She said yes and slammed the window. So I set there and made sure that my order was right I never moved. My order on the reciept was right, but half of the food wasn't in the bag. So I asked them where the rest of my food was, and the manager got really hateful and said that it was all in there, but it wasn't because I took it all out and looked in it. They not once looked in the bag. Basicly they stood there and called me a liar. Which pissed me off. I finally just told them to keep my order and give me back my money, that was when the young lady at the window made the comment about it being ridiculous. I saidyes it was ridiculous because my reciept says that it was right, but for some reason the cook couldn't get it right. It looks to me like they would make sure that their employees could read before hiring them. Needless to say I will never be back at that Captin D's. The employees as well as the managers need some serious help. DON'T GO TO THE CAPTIN D'S IN SEARCY ARKANSAS.
