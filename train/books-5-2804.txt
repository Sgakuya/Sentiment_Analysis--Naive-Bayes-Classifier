Shelby Foote writes some of the more insightful perspectives on the Civil War. He is simultaneously sympathetic for the Southern point of view (which, considering he is a Mississippian, is not at all unusual) while showing a unique understanding of the Union perspective. Foote writes in a style that is not defensive but is open-minded and acknowledges atrocities and egregious errors by both sides. I freely admit that my sympathies lie with the Union-Northern perspective, and that I am an unabashed Northeastern New York State liberal-strong central government kind of guy. My ancestors fought with the Ohio and Iowa infantries against the idea that states can up and leave the Union if they feel like it. I scoff at the notion that some, uh, Rebs still feel they live in the CSA, and not the USA. The ones that make me chuckle are the ones that claim they live in occupied Tennessee or Occupied Virginia, and while they are within their right to feel that way, that's not the reality of our world today. This is 2001, not 1870-Reconstruction era. Dixie is a way of life for Southerners. Great! But Dixie is also a cup. (Just teasin', all you touchy Southerners. Lighten up. Just a small Yankee joke.) Seriously, I love the South. It's a completely different way of life than up here in New York. Foote also recognizes this, too, and takes pains to differentiate between the South and the North. And, no, not all Southerners are rednecks, or KKK'ers, or backwoods trailer folk who appear on Jerry Springer. (Only the ones from Nawth Cay-lina, Arkansas, Ella-bawma, east Texas, Kain-tucky, and Saaay-owth Cay-lah-nuh. Chill! Just kiddin'!)
