J.J Redick is an excellent basketball player. His shot is not just luck as a lot of people like to say. He practiced that shot ever since he was little, and continues to do so. He plays a great role on the Duke team. His free throw percentage is truly amazing, and more college players should concentrate on that. If you have watched him play, you will notice that he has really improved on his defense. At times when his shot was off, he knew the only way he would play, would be defense and to work hard. Sure he isn't a Chris Duhon or Shane Battier when it come's to defense, but he can hold his own. So many teams put their best defensive player on J.J., and just about everytime he still make's those three's. Face it, people only hate him because he truly is talented. Plus if you look at him, he doesn't really stand out. He's 6'4 with a medium build so it seems as though he would blend in more with screaming fans, then on a basketball court. People just can't except that. So, yes, J.J. really and truly his talented along with his other very gifted teammates. He would not be the player that he is if it were not for Duhon, Ewing, Deng, Randolph, Sheldon, Horvath, Melchionni, all his other teammates, and the great coaching staff. Also, it is his love for the game. GO DUKE!
