There's no place like California. Very different and unique place-not becasue it's trying to be different, but because it just is. I would say any area of CA is worth visiting if you get the chance. Don't believe what people say about LA-it IS a worthwile place. You just have to know where to go and what to do. Don't base your whole LA trip on the Hollywood Walk of Fame alone or anything. The less touristy attractions are reccommended (as well as the touristy attractions). And if you go to LA determined not to like it (like a lot of people do) then you probably won't. I personally like LA better than SF (LA is much more exciting, and surprisingly, less snooty in my opinion. SF people are so stuck up on being SF ) But overall, the state of California is a great place.
