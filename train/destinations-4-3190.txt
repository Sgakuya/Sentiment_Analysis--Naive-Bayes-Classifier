San Diego is, overall, a very nice town. Very relaxed environment overall. If you don't have to commute to the suburbs, your time will be much much nicer because like most California cities there is a huge traffic problem. The air is fresh and clean though, due to the near-constant ocean breeze. Forget about snow - it rarely gets below 40, even in January. In fact, you'll see people walking around in shorts in the middle of winter! Being on the Mexico border, there are lots of illegal immigrants. Positives: like I said above, the best weather in the nation, beautiful area, nice beaches, laid back environment, economy is good/fair, lots of outdoor activities, good Mexican food Negatives: Segregated - if you are south or east of downtown, you are most likely in a poor/black/hispanic neighborhood. If you're north of 8, you're in whitey-land. Traffic is terrible during rush hour. It can get quite hot (100+) in the summer in the inland areas. Very expensive to live there, although not nearly as expensive as NYC or SF. The city is on the verge of bankruptcy. Public transit is not convenient and is essentially pointless if you have to go any considerable distance. Very suburban environment overall. Chain stores everywhere you turn. Although there are lots of negatives to SD, I give it 4 stars simply because there is no other place like it
