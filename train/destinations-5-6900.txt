Mississippi is a favorite target (especially by those who have never been there) because of its admittedly negative history of racial violence. Even I used to criticize the place. But today, after visiting it, I can say that attitudes there have CHANGED since the civil rights era.... People are also more open and honest about the racial problems that still do exist. And blacks and whites interact (professionally, socially, and more comfortably) on a deeper level than in most other states. I've lived in California and Oregon-- those bastions of tolerance and liberalism-- and found that racism is more prevalent in those places, it's just hidden beneath the surface. Most Americans would rather bash the Southern States than consider racial issues in their own backyards..... Anyway, Mississippi does have some nice spots, including coastal Natchez, historic Vicksburg, the Windsor Ruins, and the beautiful Natchez Trace. The thunderstorms are amazing and the evenings are pleasant. The finest fried catfish, crawfish and greens can be found there, and, of course, in Jackson, the best and most authentic Delta blues in the world can be heard, in a welcoming atmosphere.
