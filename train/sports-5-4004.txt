The one thing all who added their (often but not always) misguided criticisms about Smith forgot about: previously, you had to win your conference tourney to even be invited to the NCAA tourney. Just think if Smith coached all his teams in the new era. He would have more final fours, more wins, more accolades, and plausibly more championship rings. Its hard to deny Wooden the "best of all time" label, hell, he was a winner. But Smith was also, and he was an innovator. Coach K is catching up with him very quickly, but much of his coaching is a product of what Smith revolutionized. If he does, in fact, break the wins record (or Knight for that matter) it is confounded by the era in which they coached. I think Dean is the best coach of all time, but I am a UNC grad. I admit that does create bias. But I DO respect the other greats, and acknowledge that this conversation/debate does have merit; you can make an argument for any of the following: Smith, K, Knight, Calhoun, Boeheim (if you buy into the match-up zone creation), Wooden, Rupp, or Phog Allen.
