Sex in a bottle. If you are basing your taste simply on the country of origin, rather than your taste buds and gag reflex (or lack there of when it comes to grey goose), you're a moron. Gee, I would much rather have crappy vodka that makes me gag from Russia rather than really smooth, nice vodka from France... yeah, that makes sense... Okay, okay...I've gotten 11 not helpful marks on here, so my opinion must not be clear. I LIKE GREY GOOSE. I think it is a great vodka without the usual harshness of regular vodka. Even premiums like Stoli and Skyy can be hard on the throat and stomach, but Grey Goose has no such qualities. In my OPINION, it is a great vodka. A bit pricy, but worth the money if you can afford it. There. Happy now?
