Bruce Springsteen's compilation release Greatest Hits (released in 1995) is an uneven representation of his career. The track list doesn't include anything from his first two full-length efforts (eg Blinded By The Light), heavily favors the period of his most commercial success (eg Dancing In The Dark and Born In The U.S.A.), has some notable omissions from his latter years (eg Tunnel Of Love), and includes some previously unreleased material (eg Murder Incorporated). The end result is a package that will only satisfy the most casual fan. A better option for most fans would be The Essential Bruce Springsteen (2003). Nevertheless, in my opinion, no greatest hits package should be on this list as a compilation cannot really be compared to regular releases and does not represent the concept of a full-length effort.
