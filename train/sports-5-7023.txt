Jordan was the greatest basketball player to ever grace the face of the earth. And contrary to what some people on this site say, he could pass the ball and his ability to make other players better, on top of his obvious scoring abilities, is what makes him the greatest player ever. Also did I mention his Defensive Player of the Year Award. I believe there are players nowadays that have many of the physical abilities that jordan did, such as kobe bryant, but kobe can't lead a team like jordan could. Jordan made Scotty Pippen an amazing player, without jordan he was good at best. No one is currently better then jordan, and no one has ever been as good as jordan. He is the greatest.
