Considering the antiquity of the cast, it was pretty kewl...! All of the male actors have been my favorites over the years. Wasn't quite sure just how Ol' Clint Eastwood and the crew were really going to pull of a for real space fight in view of their age factor. By the bye, I watched Space Cowboys on DVD...and on my Sony TV and Home Theater w/ recording studio speakers... It got so damn real at times when they were out in space it got spooky...! Further, due to the realism of DVD...I found myself sitting the very 'tip' of my viewing area. Donald Sutherland was a pretty kewl dude and James Garner ...they all pulled it off. Well worth seeing....after all.
