I agree with the person that said that most of the people that leave negative feedback are very ignorant. I also believe that Wachovia is making a lot of money out of these ignorants that don't understand that they're not supposed to buy more than what they deposit. It is true they end up paying $120 to $600 a month in fees. They basically work for free & give away their paychecks to Wachovia. Now unfair practices that Wachovia does have: - Unavailable funds fee: you have $40, you make 4 purchases with your checkcard of $10, $10, $10,& $11 each. You should only be overdrawn $1 and you think you will be charged $30 only once. WRONG!!!! they will charge you $120 in fees, because all purchases were on hold and your available balance was $-1 when the transactions were processed. You just paid $120 for being overdrawn $1 and for purchases that totalled $41. This is way better than any credit card rate. Good job Wachovia!!
