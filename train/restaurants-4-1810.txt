Having worked at Taco Bell in high school and college, I can tell you that the posts here are flat wrong. All of the meat is pre-cooked and then re-cooked before it is used. The meat bags can't be ripped open with your teeth...you'd burn the hell out of your face when 200 degree steam shoots out. Not to mention that the meat bags a heavy duty. You need metal shears to open them. The feces in the meat thing is what is called an urban legend. Every town talks about it, but you won't find it documented anywhere. All the rumors aside...Taco Bell is one of my favorite fast food places. Sure the food is low quality but the taste is good and the price is lower than any burger hut. My problem with them is that they have changed their flavors over the last 20+ years. When I was a kid, there was a certain delicious smell to Taco Bell. That smell is gone. The cheese used to be finely shredded fancy cheddar. Now it's big, fat, chunky shredded cheddar. The meat has lost some of its zing too. Nonetheless, still a good place to eat late at night. I used to love making my own concoctions when the store would close. I'd load up a burrito flour tortilla with about a half pound of chicken, a half pound of steak, lettuce, cheese and a huge scoop of rice. I'd finish it off with two ladles full of Mexican pizza sauce (salsa and Taco Bell red sauce combined). And they always wondered why their product count was low at the end of the month. Hmm.
