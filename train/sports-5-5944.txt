J.J Redick is by far one of the best players to ever come into college basketball. Not to mention his unbelieveable leadership ability. During the offseason he basically decided that he wasnt good enough and he went out and did something about it, took speed and agility classes, got his team up @ 6 every morning and ran with them, and i know for a fact that during practices J.J. is constantly encouraging his teammates. Yes, he could get a better on defense but really..he isnt that bad on defense to begin with. Ya he gets scored on, who doesnt?! Michael Jordan get's scored on, Lebron James, Tim Duncan..they all get scored on. He's an amazing player with the mentality that you are not going to stop him. Leave him open for the three all night long and he'll take it. And once you cut off his three, hes just gunna go around you and drive to the basket. He knows the game and he knows how to play the game. It is obvious that J.J. Redick is one of the best college players to ever play. And being able to put up with the taunting he receives at almost every arena,expect Cameron, and being able to drown it out and play his game, how many players do that as well as Redick does? Who saw the segment of him on ESPN when he talked about all of the hatred from fans he gets. Its horrible how cruel some of these people are. Making a T-shirt with JJ on the front saying I want to name my kid JJ Redick and then on the back say And beat him every day. Or making signs towards his 13 year old sister about having sex with her. What human in their right mind does that? And for all of you who think J.J. Redick is horrible and doesnt do anything, what are you thinking? Do you just not like him because he goes to Duke, because hes as good as he is, or because maybe one of your friends doesnt like him so you are just gunna say ok J.J. Redick sucks when you know nothing about basketball? i guess thats it.
