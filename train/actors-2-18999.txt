I'm glad that he's bringing up topics that really need to be discussed, but at the same time, I'm a litle concerned about why he's doing it. From what I can tell from looking up various sources online (both for and against M. Moore), he seems to either exaggerate or fabricate facts , and sometimes uses techniques that may be misleading. I'm glad that he brought to light the plight of the GM workers in Flint, MI, but then several sources note that, despite the film being lucrative, he hasn't made an effort to help the same people that he used in his film! I'm hoping I'm wrong here, but it just doesn't seem right to exploit a town's downfall, make a lot of money out of it, then not give anything back to the people? Moore criticizes the media's bombardment of fear on American society, but the film's visuals (for Bowling for Columbine ) are similarly shocking and seemed to be used to illicit the same horror response that the same media he criticizes uses as well. Moore brings up many important issues that need to be discussed, but I'm wondering if he's doing it for the right reasons. I encourage people to look up more information about these movies and about the filmmaker--in doing so myself, I'm finding out a lot of interesting things (noting that many sites are going to be biased in either way).
