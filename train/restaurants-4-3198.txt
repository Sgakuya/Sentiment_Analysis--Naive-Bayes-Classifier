I love pizza. Pizza is one of those foods for me that i can't get sick of. Uno's is a good family style pizza place that has some really good deep dish pizza. The pizza comes in a pan, not on a sheet, the crust is so thick (about 2 thick). It tastes so good going down but you're lucky if you can finish your second slice before you start feeling the rock forming in your stomach. It is really good pizza, and good service. I feel better about myself if I eat Uno's instead of Domino's. It just tastes more fresh. They also offer other entrees besides just pizza so it gives everyone an option if they don't want pizza.
