Scarlett Johansson is one of the most incredible actresses to appear onscreen in recent years!!!!! She is a dynamic, vibrant, and intelligent woman who is well beyond her young age. I have no doubt that this young lady will win an Oscar within the next two years. Recently, I had the opportunity to see her on a talk show appearance on the Craig Kilborn Show & was more than pleasantly surprised. She is definitely someone who has something to say and is not your usual Hollywood airhead or one of Hollywood's psuedo-intellectuals. This girl is for real and is very, very powerful- a real thinking person. She is a throwback to the 60's & 70's when people questioned what they read and saw. She is someone who is aware of her surroundings and will make great contributions to whatever causes she believes in. There is no doubt in my mind that she will make a big impact in films and elsewhere. If it were possible to give her a 10 star rating then I think she would deserve it. Not since the late, great Jimi Hendrix have I seen someone with real genuine talent combined with grace and humility. Scarlett Johannson is definitely on the rise so let's be on the lookout for her.
