I am currently attending Western International University. Western International University is a branch of University Of Phoenix Online. I have been attending this university for 6 months now and have had a wonderful experience. I attended Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, which is a great school, but it was extremely difficult to find time in my busy schedule to attend class. It was a 25-minute drive, if you didn't hit traffic. Finding parking was a challenge and I was tired all of the time. Having a career and attending school full time is overwhelming. I did not take the easy way out. I just explored my options. The option to go to school when I want while obtaining an accredited degree was unimaginable; however, available. Transferring from ODU to University of Phoenix Online was the best thing I have ever done. It is very challenging. One must have self-discipline to attend this university. There is a lot of writing and researching involved. It is not easy whatsoever; however, it is convenient. Regarding financial aid, enrollment, and academic counselors, there have been no issues. Financial aid is something that you pretty much take care of yourself through the FAFSA website. The financial aid counselors are just there for guidance. My enrollment counselor explained the positives and negatives of the university. She explained, "This is not for everyone". She was very honest and helpful. She did not bribe me with her words as some have stated. My academic counselor was too good. Honestly, he called too much. I felt like I couldn't keep up with him. I'm sure that some of you have had bad experiences as with anyone, anywhere. For example, department stores, car dealerships, airlines, etc. Just because one employee misrepresents a company, doesn't mean you should bad mouth it. Everyone deserves a second chance.
