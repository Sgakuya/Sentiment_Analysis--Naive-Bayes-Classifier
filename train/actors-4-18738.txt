He directed one of my favorite films of the early 1940's, Out of the Fog. It's a small film, with an intimate feel. He elicited outstanding performances from the cast, especially character actors, Thomas Mitchell and John Qualen. However, the climax gave me a bit of a jolt. It seemed so wrong. Then I read that censorship problems dictated the choice of endings. Too bad! Mr. Litvak also directed Olivia deHavilland, in one of her greatest performances, in The Snake Pit. The plot is dated now, but their combined talents, as well as others in the technical field, make it well worth one's time. Another excellent job from Mr. Litvak, is Sorry, Wrong Number. Barbara Stanwyck is superb as a woman suffering from psychosomatic illness. Can't reveal too much, because it might spoil your viewing pleasure. Burt Lancaster, Ed Begley and Ann Richards lend solid support. Anatole Litvak directed other popular fare. His body of work is not great, but he had me involved..in those three, in particular.
