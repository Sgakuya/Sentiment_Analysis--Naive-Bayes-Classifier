This section is for baseball players all-time, not current. Rickey Henderson is a surefire first-ballot hall-of-famer. He astoundingly holds the major league record in the steals category (by a vast margin) as well as runs scored. He has had an amazing career and is still playing decently despite being over the age of 40. When Henderson got on base in his prime (which lasted quite a few years), it was literally a walking double. The guy stole over 100 bases in a season. That's not only is a phenomenal individual stat, but that potent base running is a great catalyst to aid in the victory of your team. As his career ends, he will be the sole holder of several all-time records; and that folks is why Henderson is one of the best players in the history of the game and the numbers back it up.
