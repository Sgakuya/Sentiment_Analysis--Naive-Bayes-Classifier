(Orig. Comment 2/28) As an agnostic who has not read this part of the Bible and with only a very basic understanding of what happened, it was a very interesting movie. I view this movie as a person's interpretation of a religious text (in this case, Mel Gibson's interpretation), and it won't be without bias. As a movie itself, it was beautifully done, artistically an excellent movie. The dialog was done in Aramaic and Latin, which definately added to the movie (subtitles were added, so if you're picky about it, don't watch this movie, you'll just complain). It is to be expected that a movie about a man suffering a horrific torture such as crucifiction is going to be graphic, but I wasn't prepared for the torture scenes before it. The day I went to see it, I heard on the radio that a woman died of a heart attack while watching the crucifiction scene--after watching it, I can see why. The movie was drawn out at parts, but understandably it was done to illustrate the agony and pain that Christ had suffered in those final days. Overall, however, it was a well-made movie. Nevertheless, I encourage those with faint hearts to NOT watch this movie, and even those who aren't still might feel their stomachs turn at the horrific depictions of torture. (Addition, 4/18/04: I've had more than a few conversations, mostly at work, with those who have reacted extremely strongly to the movie, mostly positive. Problem is, they haven't actually SEEN the movie. Say what you will about it, but it's hard to judge something when you haven't seen it before; it's like judging a person who you've never met before. I can't respect the opinions of those who judge without seeing it first.)
