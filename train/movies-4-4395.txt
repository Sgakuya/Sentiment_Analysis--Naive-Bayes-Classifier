Cute movie. Picks up where the first one stops. Fiona and Shrek are invited to Fiona's parents castle. they are a king and queen of the land far far away. when they get there the parents are dismayed to see Shrek is an ogre and so is fiona. the king wants to put a stop to the marriage and gets the fairy god mother to help out.{she is evil and her son is prince charming} Puss in Boots ends up being friends with Shrek {he is one of the best characters in this movie. Antonio Banderes is great for the voice} there are some funny scenes and a good ending. do not leave the theater when the credit start rolling or you will miss a surprise half way through the credits. good movie not quite as good as the first. well done though.
