I'm from Minnesota and saw Jesse when I was a kid wrestling in my hick town and it brought some life here so I got a kick out of him then.Ya,when you get older you realize he was just a bulked up guy on roids and wasn't legitimate and I guess the same goes for him being the governor where he had disfunctions.I liked him on his radio talk show before he became governor because he told it like it was and didn't hold back any punches.''No pun intended.hehe! Anyway,he did some good things like giving tax rebates and fighting with the democrats to get their way all the time and I loved it when him and his wife walked out of the Wellstone Memorial to magnify that fiasco.He was outspoken,too revealing and bragadocious about personal matters,embraced Castro on his Cuba visit and got the twin cities train plan off the ground which will bankrupt Minnesota so he really stunk up the place on alot of fronts here.I think he had the chance to do and look much better than he did and he wasted a great opportunity for a 3rd party candidate to succeed more than he did.Talk about ego,he complained about the made for t.v.movie based on his life and the movie glorified him to look much better than he actually was.He will be ever known as Governor Turnbuckle in my mind.Well,he beats all the democrats ''socialists''that were ever governor here anyway.We have a Republican,Pawlenty in office now and I am impressed with him.He's the best I have seen running this state and we are gradually losing a bit of our socialist way of doing things here.
