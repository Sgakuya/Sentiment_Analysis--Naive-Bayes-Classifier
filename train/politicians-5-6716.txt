I admit, this rating is a little high, but it is in response to those of you who are giving 1 as your rating. Anyone who is no racist or a die hard liberal can not listen to this man and not at least respect him as a intelligent, very articulate man. With his current race for president Al Sharpton is forcing the currently lame democratic party to focus on liberal issues rather then just constantly cattering to the GOP. I'm tired of Democratic candidates coming out and pretty much being just moderate democrates. The only way for this party to retake the government is to seperate it self from the republican party. Al Sharpton understands this, and stands up for this. Whether you agree with his opinions or not, you have to give him some credit and respect him as a positive leader of the African American community.
