I've noticed how people have commented about Robert's lifestyle and have included that in their ratings...so what if he has life style that you don't agree with, his acting speaks for itself. Robert is a brillant actor. He has evolved into a brillant veteran actor and has proven that he can not only accomplish his greatness in comedies, but also seriousness in very touching drama's. He knows how to get into character and can actually act the role. Robert is an actor in demand. His peers respect him as the brilliant artist that he is. I'm sick of people interperting his personally life as his talent. Before you comment and put down an actor, make sure you are judging him for his talent and his accomplishments not for his personal lifestyle.
