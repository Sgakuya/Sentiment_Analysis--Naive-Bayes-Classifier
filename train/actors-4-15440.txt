I think that she should put more life into her acting, for example some of her scenes look a little dull. Her lip singing video in the valentines episode was corny, just as the rest of the episode was. But the one where she's dancing to some Kiss Me song puzzled me. She had to dance in the part but looked like she didnt want to. I dont know why but I could really see her in a horror movie, it might suit her style more since she's outgrown her character so much. I forgot to mention that because thats really whats causing the problem. In the period when she had the straight hair I thought she was really good. Shes still pretty good now but shes declined a bit because shes getting too old to be the sneaky and witty Ruthie she used to be.
