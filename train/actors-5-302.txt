Another wonderful, gifted and very versatile actor. I have always heard that Richard Burton had a tendency to get extremely wrapped up in his work and actually fell in love with many of his leading ladies (the most famous of which was, of course, Liz Taylor). His voice alone was probably enough to convince most of them that they were also in love with him. Whether that remark is or is not true doesn t really matter now. The fact remains that his many very well done roles prove that in his profession he was very believable as anything from a spiritually confused Roman soldier ( The Robe ) to a dysfunctional, wimpy husband ( Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf ) and just about anything in between.
