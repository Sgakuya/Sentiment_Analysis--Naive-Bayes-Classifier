Chasing Amy is my second favorite film set in Kevin Smith's beautiful View Askuniverse. It tells the story of a young comic book artist (Ben Affleck) who along with his best friend and inker ( Jason Lee)( you know, the guy who just traces?) are enjoying underground fame with their comic The Adventure of Blunt Man and Chronic , who are of course based off Jay and Silent Bob. Things are going great until our young artist falls for a lovely lipstick comic book artist lesbian. (????? realism? Not in the View Askuniverse) Anyways, he falls in love and the story goes from there. Has some very comic moments as well as some moments that could have been heart breaking if it weren't for Joey Lauren Adam's infinitly annoyingly high pitched voice. Jay and Silent Bob put in my favorite onscreen apperance in this one. While some might not be open minded enough to understand how great a scene this is, because Silent Bob has more lines than Jay, this scene is pivitol to the film and is great because it gives more character and unveils part of the mystery of one of my all time favorite characters, Silent Bob. His monolouge is great and speaks from Kevin Smith's own experience, so it is only fitting that Silent Bob give the speech. Some people are too in to technicalities. One of Kevin Smith's finer films only out done by his best film, Clerks and leagues above Mallrats, Dogma and Jay and Sient Bob Strike Back. This is an evtertaing and sweet movie. Some say the end is sad. I say it is realistic and very true to life. Even if the girl isn't a lesbo. HIGHLY Recommended.
