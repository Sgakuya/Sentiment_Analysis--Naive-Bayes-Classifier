My Mother always used Campbell s cream of mushroom soup in all types of wonderful and mouth watering recipes, so it was understandable that when my brother first married and his wife fixed Campbell s cream of mushroom soup for lunch he was a bit confused. The truth is, their soup can make a meal in a bowl, but most of us enjoy having at least a sandwich with our soup. I find that most of these soups however, (no matter what flavor) are a bit too salty for my taste. But Campbell s also offers a line of their wonderful soups that contain less salt, now these are the ones that fit my taste. I love to use their cream of mushroom soup in rice, or to help make a creamy mushroom gravy.
