A lot of people think that Kate believes she's better than every other actress in Hollywood but that's not true, she said herself in an interview that she DOES need some work on her acting and her screen-performances and admits that she's not as good as the other actresses out there...but she soon will be. Yea, I agree with some of you...she hasnt impressed me THAT much in both 'Almost Famous' and 'Alex and Emma' but I do think she has wut it takes to be a better star...I just can't believe how beautiful she is...lol well, she DID get good genes from her mommy...but neway..shez still a good person inside and out, shes really down-to-earth and cares about her family a lot...so I give her a plain ol' gosh damned 4!!! haha...
