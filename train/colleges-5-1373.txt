What? Northwestern isn't all that! I looked at that wannabe Ivy League school when applying to colleges and thought UVA (and U. Chicago) was so much better. UVA is so awesome that it was the only college I applied to. In fact, it's the only school in the entire world included in the United Nations World Heritage List, along with the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China. Founded by Thomas Jefferson, its cornerstone was laid by Presidents Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, who comprised its original governing board. Its alumni include Woodrow Wilson, Edgar Allen Poe, Robert F. Kennedy, Katie Couric, Tina Fey, 8 current U.S. ambassadors, both the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the Director of the FBI, plus the current presidents of Pepsi, NBC, WNBA, CNET, and the American Stock Exchange. It's graduated more Rhodes Scholars than any other public school (and Northwestern by the way). The first time the term Public Ivy was ever used it was by the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winning author, William Faulkner, to describe The University of Virginia. UVA rocks!
