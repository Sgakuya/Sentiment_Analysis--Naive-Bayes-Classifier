I have a 1996 Ford Windstar that just blew the head gaskets at 80,000 (5,000 over my extended warranty!!) while being serviced at the local Ford dealer for another unrelated problem. Of course, they had no idea how this happened and deny everything. So I brought my broken van home and got it repaired at a local independent shop as the general manager of the local Ford dealership was thumbing his nose at me. The van drives great and is safe and roomy, but Ford has treated its customers very poorly and therefore everyone I know will be informed of Ford's customer service and reputation in standing behind their products. This was my first and last Ford product. Good luck Ford on handing out all of those new PC's...i hope your employees log into www.fordwindstar.com and check your products out!
