This man was brainy, very academic. He was also global minded, which seems to be one of the reasons Nixon used to admire him so much. But while I admire his intelligence, I would have been totally opposed to the League of Nations had I been living back then. And Wilson made the League the centerpiece of his whole presidency and eventually, his whole life. He would not compromise on any of the details, and (fortunately, in my opinion) the whole League of Nations thing failed to materialize. I'm sure that's what destroyed his health before his term of office was over. If he hadn't been so obsessed with that one thing, he would have had a far greater presidency, and could have enjoyed it more.
