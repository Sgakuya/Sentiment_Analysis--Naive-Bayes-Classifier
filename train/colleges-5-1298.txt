I will be a freshman at Duke this fall. Since I obviously can't give you my opinion on what it's like at Duke since I haven't started yet, I'll tell you about my experience in choosing a college. I applied to Harvard, Yale, University of Texas, and the University of Southern Cal in addition to Duke. I visited every school but Southern Cal, and found the admissions officers generally disinterested and the faculty unengagable. Duke, on the other hand, went out of its way to get me to come. They sent me free tshirts, professors called me, the admissions committee wrote personal notes, and the school even paid to fly me up to visit. Every prof was eager to meet with me in person, and when one of the profs bought supper for one of her classes while I was there, she invited me to attend. The classes I sat in on were absolutely amazing, and I found myself wanting to take notes even though I wasn't a member of the class! I have found Duke to be an amazing school that is still of the same caliber of the Ivies, but quite a bit more personal.
