When all is said and done concerning college basketball coaches, one name will stand alone over all the others: John Wooden. The 'Wizard of Westwood' was the epitomy of coaching, embedding in his players the importance of teamwork and consistency on the hardwood. He also stressed the value of perfecting defensive and offensive fundamentals, as his teams seemed not to have any conceivable flaws. Not too keen on flamboyance, Coach Wooden was a modest man who did not seek the limelight; and at the same time, showed the utmost grace and decency to all UCLA's opponents- win or lose. As for his coaching record, neither an 80.6% winning percentage and winning ten NCAA championships define the man completely. Rather, it is the respect he still garners today from those who are in or simply follow college basketball, which define him best. Undoubtedly, John Wooden was the greatest coach ever in any sport, and is the measuring stick for which all other great coaches of all sports will be measured until the end of time.
