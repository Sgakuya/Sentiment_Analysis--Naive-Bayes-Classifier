One source of amusement for me during Clinton's term was how vilified he was by the Republicans when he was, at best, a moderate Republican himself, so far as I was concerned. Clinton was no great progressive. NAFTA and welfare reform and an increasingly repressive War on drugs were all initiated under his tenure. And yet you couldn't help but cheer him on, considering the mountainous, expensive wall of crap that the Republicans tried, with increasing desperation, to throw at him. Whitewater? Travelgate? The murder of Vince Foster? Chimeras. Fantasy. The alleged party of fiscal responsibility spent God knows how many millions trying to nail Clinton on all this and more, without success. The best they could come up with was his lying about his sexual chicanery, which essentially was a matter between himself and Hillary. Like I said, I was never a great fan of Clinton's while he was in office, but if you match him up against what we've got in there now, he assumes a stature that's almost Lincoln-esque.
