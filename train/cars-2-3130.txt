For the love of god, please do not buy one of these!! Not that I think it's ugly, and the warranty is excellent (10yr/100k mi), but after only about 15k miles it drives/rides and overall feels like it's ten years old. Did you hear me?!?! I HAVE A CAR THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S TEN YEARS OLD AND IT'S NOT EVEN PAID OFF YET!!! Oh, not to mention, I took it to the dealership (Ray Huffines of Plano) to get a new tire and when I got the car home the wheel cap had fallen off. I still can't get anybody to return my call - you suck, Ray! By the way, I drive like an old lady. I'm trading this piece of garbage in real soon.
