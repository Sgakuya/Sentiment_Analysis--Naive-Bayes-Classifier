Since i'm the same age as Natalie, I can look back on her earlier films and remember that her characters always intrigued me. However, I never realized that she ws the same girl until Episode 1.I later discovered that I liked her as an Actress and model because of the way she plays her roles. She always seems to be a girl that needs someone to help her, but no one ever does, so she ends up helping herself.This causes me to think Man, I really wish I could be there for her . I think all of her movies install this same feeling, and that's why I think she tantalizes so many men. Her pictures even give me this feeling, and if that's not being a good actress, I don't know what is. My only quarrel with her is that I wrote her a fan letter and never got a reply back. She probably gets a thousand letters a day anyway and it's pretty selfish of me to dock her for that. So I'm not going to.
