So much judgement from the left - aren't these the people who keep telling the 'religious right' thou shalt not judge. So much name calling! I guess the left's love is reserved only for themselves and those who agree with them. Anyone who disagrees with Bush's tax cuts should sign their refund checks and send them back - put a personal note on them - Dear Mr. President - I want you to keep this money in the federal treasury. I don't need it. Then, on April 15th, if you are going to get a refund, just send the IRS a note - 'Dear IRS, please keep my refund - I don't need tax relief, in fact, I'll send you extra'. I'll reserve my opinion until his term(s) are over. In the light of history, I don't believe he'll lead us into any more chaos and trouble then did the previous president - whose seemingly only concern were what the polls looked like.
