I LOVE RC Cola,I cannot tolerate Pepsi or Coke,sure don't understand the hype.If for some reason I cannot find RC,I will drink Faygo,but never Pepsi or Coke. My local Krogers had a sale on 6pks,buy 10 for $10,they ran out so fast I didn't get there on time,I've gone back sevseral times with my coupon,but they don't normally sell 6pks.,I've asked them to start selling it that way,but they don't. A short story-when I was a child,my parents owned a neighborhood store,the RC came in wooden crates,my brother would build his home made carts and racers out of them,he was about 5 and didn't know that wheels needed axles.He hammered wheels on,when he drove from the top of the hill,the wheels would fly off,but those crates held up. I've often thought about writing the company to say thank you for a superb product,your other products are great too.So-thank you
