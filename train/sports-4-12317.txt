They're going to slip this year. Norm Chow is a genius; he single-handedly turned Carson Palmer into the Heisman winner last year. However, Matt Cassel, Matt Leinhart, or Brandon Hance will not come close to replicating Palmer's 2002 numbers. With Sultan McCullough and Justin Fargas gone, they're going to leave the rushing to freshmen like Reggie Bush and LenDale White. I like their recievers; not just Mike Williams but Keary Colbert, who should surpass Kareem Kelly's 2002 performance. The heart and soul of the defense, Troy Polamalu, is gone, and the defense as a whole, though strong up front, will not be as good as last year's outstanding unit. The schedule looks a little brutal as well, with trips to Auburn, Arizona St., Notre Dame, and Washington. They'll have trouble putting up 10 wins.
