I understand the attachment some old timers might have with the Mustang in their desperate attempt to hang on to youth but otherwise the Mustang is completely irrelevant in 2001. To start off, the current Mustang is THE ugliest piece of s**t to hit the road since the AMC Pacer and then some. Second, it ain't all that reliable nor refined and third its not that fast. I'll be taking a Honda Prelude or Toyota Celica GT thank you very much. Who cares if the Mustang is a domestic? Sentiment and patriotism doesn't work with me. I personally don't care if the Mustang is from Ford an American company, the fact is there are much better alternatives out there that happen to be imports!! BOTTOM LINE: Mustangs are a dime a dozen and are nothing special.
