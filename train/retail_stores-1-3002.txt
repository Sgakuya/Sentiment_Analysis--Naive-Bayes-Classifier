Terribly unprofessional. Went to look for an affordable engagement ring as I'm a student with no income. The salesjerk kept pressuring me to get a kay charge card even though I repeatedly insisted I didn't want to purchase anything I couldn't pay for on the spot. He also suggested that the ring I wanted was cheap and I should spend more or my girlfriend would not want to be with me...the insensitive jerk cannot understand the price I pay for med school tuition...30,000+ a year as I explained to him...anybody else would understand why I can't afford more than a $1000 on a ring...the imbecile was more concerned about his commission than the satisfaction of the customer...the pressure and BS he fed me were unbelivable...he tried his best to make me feel inferior and purchase something I didn't want. I will go out of my way to never return to that place again.
