Probably about 65% of the flights I've flown on American have been delayed or cancelled. I've missed connections, camped out at airports, the works. Several of those times I've been late due to unexplained problems (not for mechanical or weather reasons). The reason I keep going back to them, you may ask? The prices and the locations. American has pretty competitive prices on a college student budget, and they go pretty much everywhere you might want to go within North America. If I can save a lot on an airline ticket, it's worth a few hours of delay. (Sad that these are the choices, eh?) Besides, almost all airlines are plagued with the same problems as American Airlines these days. The whole airline industry needs a makeover, but American is about par. I've usually had good customer service with them. Their frequent flyer program is decent too.
