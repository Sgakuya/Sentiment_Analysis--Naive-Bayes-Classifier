I would have to admit to be a bit partial as this is my hometown. It's not the greatest of places but you could certainly do worse. We have some sighting that could be worth your money. Like Liseberg (the biggest amusement park in Scandinavia), the soon-to-be aquarium and Slottskogen. My personal favorite is the last one although if you're looking for tropical animals, apart from birds you probably wont find what you're looking for. About the hospitality thing; How do you feel when a bunch of strangers invade your streets, taking pictures, looking on in amazement or disgust, huddling in guided groups, making huge queues in your favorite stores and (many of them) behave rudely towards the locals. I mean, who doesn't get annoyed by that? And about the racist thing. Most of us aren't racist (I hope) unfortunantly the ones who are ruin it for everybody. Although us (supposedly)being racist towards southern european confuse me, I know many of us (including me) have prejudice towards them I don't think it's about rase. You read in articles and monologes that for example italians and french are casanovas, that irish love to get drunk or that all russian women marry men through mailorder. This doesn't apply for all people but it's hard to fall out of a pattern. And as far as I know many people associate Sweden with porn, vikings, elks and blonde, blue eyed, big-busted bimbo airheads. Would that make them racist? If it wasn't for us 'welcoming' George W. Bush to this town it would've gotten a five. But what can ya do?
