I took a few courses at Capella and found it to be a substandard experience. Capella is nothing but a diploma mill. Yes, I've seen some people complete both master's and doctoral programs there; however, these people had little, if any, experience in the real world and had very little to contribute to course discussions. After my poor experience with Capella University, I would not recommend it to anyone who desires a real education - find a traditional school for that. When you met a Capella graduate, ask them just what their experiences were before they completed their program - often, you will find that they have almost no real world experience. If you want to buy a degree, Capella may be your choice, if you want an education, find someplace else.
