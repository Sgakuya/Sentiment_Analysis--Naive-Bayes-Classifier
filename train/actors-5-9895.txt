Glenn Close is a wonderful actress. I suppose what I like most about her is her ability to make her characters so believable, no matter what she is doing. I was actually scared of her after I saw Fatal Attraction - that was VERY VERY intense acting on her part. She had me convinced that she actually was a psycho. I also thought that she was the perfect choice to play Cruella De Ville in 101 Dalmations - she fit the role perfectly, and she was excellent in that film. How about her whacky role in Mars Attacks! ? I thought that she was also wonderful in Air Force One as the Vice President of the United States who is forced to lead when the President's plane is hijacked. In the final analysis, Glenn Close is a wonderful actress who has an amazing amout of depth and range, and is one of the best around.
