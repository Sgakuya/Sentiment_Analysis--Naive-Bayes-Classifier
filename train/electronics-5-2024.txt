Known also as the Ultra 64 and the Fun Machine, this classic system is up there with the Nintendo GameCube as, simply, one of the best ever. The Nintendo 64 is simply, a classic system. True, many Nintendophobes critized them for sticking with cartridges while Silly Sony moved onto the CD-Rom format, but these cool, grey carts will always hold a place in my heart. They are durable and have absolutely no load times. The Nintendo 64 saw some amazingly innovative concepts, including four controller ports, a memory expansion pack to improve graphics, the analog control stick and the rumble pack to get a little shakin' goin' on. The games were also some of the greatest. Super Mario 64 remains an awe-inspring uberclassic, and was the first 3D game I ever truly experienced. Mario Kart saw a sequel and everyone's favorite plumber-and-princess-rescuer branched out to Golf and Tennis in two amazing sports titles. The incredibly-addictive Super Smash Brothers series also saw its birth here, along with the ever-cool Mario Party series. Pokemon moved into the 3D realm with the 2 amazing Pokemon Stadium titles and the oft-overlooked Pokemon Snap. Donkey Kong, Kirby, and Zelda also saw a return. Paper Mario also saw Nintendo's first original RPG in years. Third-party support was a contented issue with the Nintendo 64, but it produced some great games like Electronic Arts' Beetle Adventure Racing and Konami's classic International Superstar 64. For me, the fun machine will live on.
