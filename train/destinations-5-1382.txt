Despite the fact the Philippines has one of the most corrupt governments, Filipinos/-as are a proud people with a colorful history. Filipinos themselves are a diverse group, having been influenced first by indigenous Malays and later by other nearby Asian nations, not to mention the influence of Spain and the United States, which brought Catholicism and capitalism, respectively. All of these influences contributed to the unique-but-beautiful identity of Filipinos/-as around the world. And just to mention, I am a Filipino American who is extremely proud of my heritage- and I encourage others to learn about my ancestral country.
