My reaction after viewing this film was disappointment. There was not enough laughs to sustain interest in the movie. My impression was that the producers thought OK! We've got Carrey. We don't care about the script. Or, Jim will carry (no pun intended) this movie himself . The notion of a person not being able to lie is interesting in itself, but the opportunity was lost. This is clearly shown in the irritating, condescending soundtrack which tries to paper over the comedic cracks, and the out-takes which are apologetically, it seems, tacked on at the end. The only really funny moment was when Carrey was in the lift with the new secretary - and he couldn't lie! The rest of the film is a transparent formula of divorce, courtroom, and family issues which is gentle enough for a evening with your granny and your neighbour's kids but not quite funny enough for the rest of us.
