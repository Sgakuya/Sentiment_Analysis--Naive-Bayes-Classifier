Updating PBeavr, the Owls finished 1-11 in 2003. They lost to a 1AA team (Villanova) and couldn't even draw fans at the new ball field. The Owls lone win was against Middle Tennessee State (Who???!!!) and they blew a 25 point lead to hang on by 6 points or something. They did lose a couple close ones and nearly upset Va. Tech. But 2003 was more of the same. Temple was not always as pathetic as everyone thinks. They appeared in the first-ever Sugar Bowl. I was fortunate to be at Temple when they were pretty good. I saw the 1979 Owls actually get to play in a bowl game, beating Cal in the defunct Garden State Bowl. They were bowl eligible in 1991, but did not get picked. The sad fact is that while Philly and the suburbs turn out a lot of great high school players; very few commit to Temple. Still, Temple turns out a surprisingly high number of NFL Players: Joe and Dan Klecko, Tre Johnson, Stacey Mack, Paul Palmer, and Randy Grossman (TE for the great Steelers temas of the '70s) are a few I can rattle off the top of my head. Temple will be leaving the Big East this year. Essentially, they were kicked out by the Big east because they were underperforming both on the field and the box office. The greedy Big East simply gave them the boot because they want a school that can generate more coin (like UConn). No one really knows where they will go after that. My bet is Conference USA.
