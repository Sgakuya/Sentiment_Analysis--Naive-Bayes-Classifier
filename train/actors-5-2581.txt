As a fellow Marylander, of course I would like Edward Norton. With just 15 movies to his credit, Edward Norton is already making a name for himself in Hollywood, and is well on his way to greatness. Norton gave a riveting performance in his film debut, as murderer Aaron Stampler in Primal Fear. Norton's performance was phenominal and provided a perfect introduction of his talent to the world. Norton also gave a decent and slightly amusing performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Norton gave an espescially riveting performance in American History X. With his amazing screen presence and ability to capture the audience's imagination and keep their attention, Norton is able to effectively communicate the emotional struggles of his character, and the philosophical evolution that he undergoes. His performance as the heroic detective on the tail of a murderer in Red Dragon was also good, as well as a comedic role in Keeping the Faith. It is clear that Norton is a very talented performer, and arguably one of the best in Hollywood today.
