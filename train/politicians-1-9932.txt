George W. Bush has divided this country more than any President before his time. Just read the comments on this message board. And what mystifies me is the people who give the man a deserved one star rating have come up with solid reasons why the man is unfit to run the country. And the neo-con, brainwashed sadsacks give that gave him five stars just repeat the same thing, without proof of his great (or even adequate) leadership: He's a Christian, he's stopping terrorism (really? I haven't seen any proof of this), he's cutting taxes (sure, for the rich), he's "for the USA." Dubya's supporters here are full of names for those of us who simply question his leadership (too many names to mention). At this rate, the USA will not be the world power in two years. The rest of the world views us as war-mongering bullies. Dubya has deep-seeded corruption in his administration. In his defense (and this is his only defense), he may be blind to a lot of it. When you come down to it, Cheney and Rove are really running this country. Bush and his entire posse needs to be impeached from the White House (not just Bush--imagine if Cheney were running things--a loose cannon would be an understatement). So, you Bush supporters better come up with more solid proof of him being a great leader than "he's a Christian," "he's for the military," "he doesn't take s--t from other countries," "he's cutting taxes," "he's improved the economy." And for the record, I'll restate his severe weaknesses: An unjusfified invasion of Iraq. Not going after the mastermind behind 9/11 (Bin Laden). Could care less about the environment. Could care less about the middle class and lower class (as Hurricane Katrina proved). Authorizing illegal wiretaps. (No wonder Orwell's "1984" is being banned in certain high schools). And by the way, I have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks in my life.
