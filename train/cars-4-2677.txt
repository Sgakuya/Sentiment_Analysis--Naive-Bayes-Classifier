First off I Give respect to American cars such as the mustang, but I have yet to see a mustang step sideways at 70mph and pull a Hiyabusha with a 16g turbo. I was ridin in my buddy's highly modded 97 eclipse gst and we were following a supra and the hiyabusha turbo. As they got onto the highway they laid into and the supra stepped sideways, while the hiyabusha got the jump the supra quickly started pulling the bike. We were doin like 130 and the two cars were almost out of site. I'd like to see a mustang beat that supra. My buddy's talon tsi awd is like a 12 sec car. Lets see a mustang do that for under 10 grand
