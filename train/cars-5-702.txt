Great bike for the money. I cracked up when I read some guys review written in August of 2000 saying it would wear out in a year of racing. Today is 1/28/01 - guess he has a crystal ball. Tell you what. I've got over 700 miles on mine since last July all in the mountains, 95% rocky muddy, technical single track. Lots of climbs, lots of great fast, technical downhills. I've worn the paint off the frame where my feet rub, crashed it enumerable times, ride it HARD. Attack. Extremely competitive. This bike has held up great. Broke the stock chain several times and replaced it with a SRAM p99. No more breaks. The Bontrager pedals that came with it were terrible, replaced with TIME Atac - great move. The Bontrager Jones are exclnt tires, they hook up well on everything I've ridden on - tried other tires when I wore my rear out - went back to Bontrager Jones. The frame is great if you want an aluminum hardtail with some pretty good components - you'll want to upgrade a few but this is one good bike - either this one or the Fisher Paragon - thisi s the best bike for the money I think - quick. tracks well. tough. climbs great.
