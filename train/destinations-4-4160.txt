Baltimore may or may not be a nice city to live in (I lived there years ago, for about three months), but it does have some great attractions (Inner Harbor, Camden Yards, Fells Point, Fort McHenry have already been mentioned by other reviewers), but it also has a couple of unique attractions like being the home port of the USS John Brown (an operating WW II Liberty ship), and the B&O Railroad Museum. Restaurants aplenty (some good ones in Little Italy, adjacent to the Inner Harbor). Good seafood (even though I'm not normally a seafood fan, I'll go for it in Baltimore), and there are still a couple of great Jewish kosher delis close to the Inner Harbor as well. Not a bad place to visit.
