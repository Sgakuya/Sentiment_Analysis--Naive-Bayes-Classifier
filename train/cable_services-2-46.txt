It's nice being able to record shows w/ DVR. HOWEVER, you would think that in this high-tech era, Comcast would have figured out some basic desires of their consumers. My biggest complaint: I can't set a show to record daily or weekly. Oh sure, Comcast CLAIMS I can, but in reality, it's a huge pain in the rear. For example, I like the Daily Show, and want to record it every day. But setting the Daily Show to record as a "series of recordings" means that I am stuck with a DVR recording of every syndicated episode every day. (I come home to 8 daily shows, and have to go through deleting them all. There is no option to set a show to record ONLY at a specific time. HELLO??? Even OLD SCHOOL VCR's had this simple function!
