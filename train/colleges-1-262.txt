My thought is this - simple supply and demand. What potential value could there be with a degree where 98% of the applicants are accepted. Keep in mind that while comparing the Standford acceptance percentages there are many, many very smart applicants who don't even apply since they know they aren't in the top 1%. In essence why waste their time. The UP on the otherhand takes anyone who can pony up the dough. That said, my opinion of UP is that there is little value associated with a degree from this institution. Sure in comparison to no degree at all this would be preferable. The lingering thought in my mind re: someone with a UP degree would be Why didn't they get a real degree?. So in keeping with the addage 'there is no free lunch' the value of a degree program which accepts anyone is marginal at best.
