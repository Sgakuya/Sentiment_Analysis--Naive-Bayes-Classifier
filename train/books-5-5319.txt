This is a non-idealistic view of human nature. The main character, the kid, wanders without moral compass, guidance, or emotional connections throughout the dusty, desolate Old West. Another character, judge, often described as nude or partly nude lays bare the duality of human nature. On one side he is curious, scientific, inventive, erudite, and philosophical. His other side is emotionally bare, cruel, and self-serving. Most people in the story lead anonymous, gray, and dusty lives - nameless except for a tribal, ethnic, or worker label, or the word savage. These anonymous masses who cling to their uncivilized world, are often the victims of the countless murders and savagries. Every town and acre of land in this story, every freedom and restriction has been ransomed with human blood sacrifices. The inescapable fate of humanity lies in its true nature, its violence. The characters move through their miniature world of the Old Southwest and Mexico under the eternal and endless darkness of the universe. The humans are indeed small and at the mercy of their fate, and this is what binds all of humanity and history together. It is interesting to note that there are no real female characters, so either females have had little to do with the fatefulness of human events, or they possess a nature at the opposite end of the savage brutality that controls the male action in the story. Perhaps this further solidifies the dichotomy of human nature. Frank and gruesome, this novel is fascinating commentary on human nature and human history. The events and characters are not so very different from our own modern era.
