Ralph Fiennes is one of the top five greatest living British actors today on stage and screen. He changes from role to role, and each time you believe that he -is- the character down to the last flick of the eye or shift in voice tone. Is he scarecrow Oscar or sleazy-looking Lennie? Count Almasy in The English Patient whose obsession drives him to destruction? or the psycho Nazi in Schindler's List? haunted Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights? He is all of them. This is an actor who cares about honing his craft above money. He takes months off to tour in Richard II and Coriolanous, and receives rave reviews. Does he sell out to box office Hollywood? No. He is about Acting, with a capital A. He follows in the tradition of Olivier and other greats. And the man is gorgeous. One English Patient, sizzling stare from this sexy man, and you are a goner.
