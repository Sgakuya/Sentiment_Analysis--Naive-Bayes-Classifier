Champ Bailey got beat time and again last season. He even got schooled by PEERLESS PRICE, who has been such a horrible underachiever he got cut by the Falcons this offseason. If you're supposed to be the best corner in the NFL, you should be able to take on Peerless Price. I really liked him whenever he was in Washington, but his terrible season last year in Denver makes me question how good he really is. I'd take Pat Surtain, Samari Rolle, Sam Madison or Chris McAllister over him easily. He needs to do more to live up to his talent and his hype. Many people say that it's all just because of the new enforcement of the 5 yard rule, but even if that's the case that will continue to be the case until they change the rules, still making him a liability in man coverage against taller and faster recievers. If he has a down season again, I'm rating him a 3. UPDATE: After watching him play and play well even with a dislocated shoulder, I'm very impressed with him. However, he also pulled a hamstring. I wonder how long he'll be out...
