Released in 1984, director and screenwriter John Hughes brought the world Sixteen Candles which works as a time capsule for the Big 80's highschool scene. For the uninitiated, the film follows the tribulations of Samantha (Molly Ringwald) the average sophomore who has grown weary of the attentions of boys her age and pines for the school hunk (Michael Schoeffling). To make matters worse, her family has forgotten her sixteenth birthday since they are busy with her sister's wedding preparations. The movie is filled with colorful characters which reflect adolescence, clothes and music of the period, including appearances by Anthony Michael Hall as the irrepressible geek, Joan Cusack, John Cusack, Jami Gertz, and Gedde Watanabe as the Asian exchange student Long Duk Dong. The bottom line is that Sixteen Candles is a period film which remains funny and applicable today notwithstanding the period clothes and music (which remains classic).
