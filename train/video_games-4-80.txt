Unreal is all about graphical splendor. The graphics are the best I have ever seen, unsurpassed by even the most current games (most of which use the game's incredible engine, as well). It is a great answer to Quake. It looks fantastic with or without a 3D accelerator. The vistas are beautiful, the monsters are clever, as are the weapons. About the only bad thing in this game is the slow loading times. It takes five minutes to load a level, even with a 3D accelerator. Some levels only take that long to beat! And the load times get longer the further into the game you get. Other than that, it is a great game.
