One of the most terribly overrated books I've ever been assigned to read. The allegorical nature of the book could have been very effective if it weren't for Golding's in-your-face attitude about his own work. It was more like Golding was saying Ooh, look! I'm a genius! Look at what a brilliant, profound allegory I've written! Other writers, like Shakespeare or Joyce, know how to leave their hidden messages under the surface, so that they are lying there waiting to be INTERPRETED by the reader. But in Golding's book, the symbolism is only superficially interesting in the first place and comes off as pretentious crap. As for the simple story on the surface of a bunch of kids trapped on an island, it just couldn't hold my interest. The only worthwhile (and genuinely frightening, I might add) moment was Simon's hallucination after putting the pig's head on a stick. I suppose there were some other bits and pieces that were worth reading, too. But overall, it's simply a tedious book with a labored and pretentious message . I'd rather read Orwell. I won't say I wish I'd never read it, but it's just not as brilliant as it pretends to be.
