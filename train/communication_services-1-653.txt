They are the epitome of world class unreliable service!! I got a phone so my children could call their mother. However, my kids had to stand in the front yard to get any sort of signal! Ridiculous. Calls to NO-customer service were fruitless - they don't guarantee service according to their contract. This inept comany has an obligation to provide a reasonable service just as I have an obligation to pay for the service. It is completely unreasonable to expect a customer to stand in his front yard in order to use the service for TWO years. The bottom line is that they don't care at about their customers. They haven't scaled properly nor at all in response to their snappy marketing. Marketing is all their good at, it seems. I did not pay for a service I could not use or count on. They suspended service. I protested the ridiculous early termination fees and have yet to hear back from them. I have now taken my business AND dollars to Verizon and have truly found a reliable and good service - and my kids and I don't have to stand in the front yard in the rain or snow or dark to have a call. Verizon is the largest cell phone carrier. They have almost 2x the number of customers as the #2 provider (ATT), yet Verizon has the LOWEST numbers and LOWEST rate of complaints (see recent consumer reports). I see why they are best hands down. DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE before signing on to any other provider's service or contract!!!! I love my Verizon service but know that since cingular handles their own protests (the fox guarding the hen house!), they will surely deny my request and bill me for all their silly fees. Anyone up for a class action law suit?
