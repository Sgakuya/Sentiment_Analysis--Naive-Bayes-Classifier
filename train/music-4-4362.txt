First off, DoomCraft is a queer. On to the review! 4.5 / 5.0 Stars- Very Good O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits ia the latest best of compilation released for the 'Smiths, in suit to the former compilaions Greatest His (1980) and Big Ones (1993) . As with the former two, O.. documents Aerosmith's biggest hits, while including a few classics in the mix. I think it does a great job of anthologizing Aerosmith and their genre transformations, from blues-influenced rock, circa early-late 1970's (similar to Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, etc.) to their more mainstream pop-rock phase, circa mid-1980's-early 1990's (similar to Warrant, Fastway, etc.), to their techno-pop/rock, circa 2001, to their current pop/rock. In conclusion, a great addition to any Aerosmith fan who has not previously purchased Greatest Hits or Big Ones , whom I would highly suggest O, Yeah! to. If you already have purchased the aforementioned or if you are a serious 'Smith fan (such as I), I suggest that you consider purchasing this. A Great Compilation
