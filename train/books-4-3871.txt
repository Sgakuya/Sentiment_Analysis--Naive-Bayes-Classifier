Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is a classic novel, that was way before its time.Twain was genius with his sarcastic and dry humor of the book overall. Yes, the book had some controversial moments, but in the society we live in now, what he wrote is nothing compared to books on the shelves these days. I will admit when i first read this book i was shocked that they used the n-word so much. But the tale, he was telling was that of a young runaway boy and you saw through his eyes, and the way Twain made his characters spoke made you almost feel like you right there on the raft with Jim and Huck. But,back to the controversial aspect of the book, is it really that bad? Now, Twain did show the sides of slaves and how they were treated and how they had to leave their families, Twain didn't make racist comments towards slaves or anyone, if he was poking fun at anyone it was at everyone. More he made fun of society and how hypocritical everyone can be. But, in the end this book is classic masterpiece.
