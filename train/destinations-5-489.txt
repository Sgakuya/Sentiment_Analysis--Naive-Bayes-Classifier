We visited Ocho Rios October of 2002. My husband and I were spoiled rotten at the Jamaica Grande Renassaince (St. Ann, Ocho Rios). We stayed for a whole week and loved every second of it. The staff was amazing, fulfilling our every need. The many restaurants and bars were out of this world. The all-inclusive package was perfect. We were eating great snacks and wonderful meals whenever/wherever we wanted (not at selected restaurants or times)! Dunns Falls was beautiful. They video taped us climbing it. The tape is great, with Bob Marley music in the background! The sunset cruise was unforgettable. The snorkeling at the Grande was amazing! The tour guide for the Grande picked up live starfish for me to hold and took many pictures of me in and under the water! He even gave me a sand dollar (that he found while we were snorkeling) for a souvenir. By the way, the snorkeling and ride to the reef were free with the all-inclusive package! It really does make a difference where you stay. The Grande was such an awesome experience that we are going back this year with all three of our children!
