HOLY COW! I too am a manager of Whitehall Jewellers in Merrillville, IN and I am so shocked to see all the bad things that had happened to many customers. I have been in jewelery for over 14 years and I know that it is had to make every customer happy. But many of these complaints are of service not nessary product. I understand that many complants are easy to be fixed if only customers and employees work together to better the situation, and not to have either party fly off the handle. Over the years I have had every complaint under the sun but i can say 80% to 90% of them were all fixed and those customers still shop with me and Whitehall. No company is going to be 100% in problem salving but we can only try. To all of you who had poor service I apoligise for the company to all of you who have had great service thank you. More people call or write to complain and very few do that to praise. Douglas R Brown Manager 121
