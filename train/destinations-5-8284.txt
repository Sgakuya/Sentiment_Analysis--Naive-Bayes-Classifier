Disneyland is really fun. For all you idiots that moan about the long lines, all I can say is that it's like that everywhere and it's not really a 'nightmare.' To quote some: Oh my god! Long lines! How will I ever survive? Fetch me some water! Long lines come with the ride. It's a package deal. If there weren't lines you be in and out in a minute anyway and then you fools would complain about how Disneyland is to small and easy to get through and they rip you off. Get over it. For those that can enjoy America's happyland, Disneyland holds many thrilling and crafty experiances in store. My favorites rides include Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn, and Indiana Jones. Those all combine fast-time action and interesting themes. Disneyland is probably the best theme park in the world save Universal Studios and they have really good churros.
