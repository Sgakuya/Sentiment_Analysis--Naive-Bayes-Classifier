A film that celebrates Scottish Pride and the spirit of defiance against medievel English tyranny more than historical accuracy. As others have written, the nature of the oppression against the Scots was reasonably accurate and probably even understated. There are books and articles available on William Wallace and the Scots Common Army. According to most, he was an extremely large man. He was not a commoner, but a lord and a knight in armour to boot. He hated the English and defended his own lands - rather than any notion of a Scottish nation - against them very successfully. He was a very good general. He did defeat the English at Stirling (actually Stirling Bridge), but it was certainly no annihilation - the English Northern Army was about the best in the world, at the time - they were not a bunch of ponces. The film was still pretty ground breaking, particularly the battle seens, which spared nothing and no-one in the depiction of the horrid brutality of medieval warfare.
