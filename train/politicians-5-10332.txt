I am deeply concerned about the sheer hatred shown by leading members of the Democratic Party toward George W. Bush. The people of this country who repeat this hatred as their polictical mantra care more for party politics than they do for our country. November 22, 2003 we were reminded of why John Kennedy went to Dallas -- He was hated by so many people (because he was northern and Catholic)there and he wanted to mend fences. Remember what the govenor's wife said to him right before the shots rang out? Now we have people from Massachusetts(among others) uttering exaggerated, hatefilled things about our president partly because he is from Texas. Ted Kennedy, of all people, should have more respect for this nation and the safety of our president.
