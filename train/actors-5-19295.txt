One of my favorite all time actors, from his days on the Rockford Files up to the new TNT western he is starring in this month. Tom is like a comfortable old pair of shoes, you can slip right into his movie or tv show and know you will see a whole new insight to a mundane character and make you wonder if you are overlooking someone in real life that has the same qualities. There is a human quality about him and I admire him for his approach to Hollywood scene and his ability to stay above tawdry publicity. He makes a perfect cowboy, politician, baseball player or p.i. depending on what the role calls for and he can nicely assume that role to make us believe him. I appreciate his rare appearances and seek him out whether it is video, movie or tv. I am anxiously awaiting the new Louis L'Amour TNT flick. Thank you Tom for all the good times.
