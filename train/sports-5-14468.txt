As a high school player, he was not allowed to practice contact because he injured too many of his teammates, he only played games. Played both ways at Univ. Illinois (Center & Linebacker) winning several All-American designations. He played in the NFL (replacing All-Pro MLB Bill George) with what we called passion, in those days, today it would be referred to as psychotic, violent aggression worthy of a felony charge. Jim Brown (whom I still regard as the truly greatest running back in NFL history) hated him more than anyone else in the league. That alone earns him the designation of greatest linebacker of all time.
