History has shown Dwight David Eisenhower to be a good President and an able administrator. Looked on early as being somehow unremarkable (like Ronald Reagan had been shortly after he left office), Eisenhower has risen in Presidential rank. He was influential and forceful in defending the Constitution, especially during the admission of several African American students against the threat of violence by both by citizens and a segregationalist Arkansas state government in 1957 at Central High School in Little Rock. Perhaps not the most pro-active President there ever was, Eisenhower greatest legacy might have been the appointment of Earl Warren to the Chief Justiceship of the Unted States (though he is said to have been largely disappointed by the Caifornia Republican's liberal stances on criminal cases).
