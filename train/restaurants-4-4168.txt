We went for the first time to P.F. Chang's and enjoyed it very much. The atmosphere is especially pleasant - attractive murals, interesting lighting, comfortable seating. I ordered VIP Cantonese Chicken, which our server said was his favorite item on the menu, but I was disappointed. The presentation was beautiful: 1/4 roasted chicken accompanied by shredded cucumber and onion. Unfortunaately, the chicken was very dry and the pancakes that came with it tasted like raw flour. My husband's moo goo gai pan was excellent though. And the wine list is outstanding, especially for people who like to order by the glass. I've never seen so many by-the-glass selections. We will definitely return to P.F. Chang's, but I'll choose a different dish.
