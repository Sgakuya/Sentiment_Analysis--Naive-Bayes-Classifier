Anyone who can bring an 5-11 team to a NFC playoff appearance is an awesome coach.The running game is #1 with over 170 yards per game.The passing is good on the QB's part but people love to criticize vick.The reciever are so-so and the TE and RB are outstanding.His defense was good but now has slipped.The pass defending is poor and makes me sick.The fact that Rod Coleman made to the pro bowl is strange but he did have a good bit of sacks but not much pressure has been put on opposing QB's.Keith Brooking and Deangelo Hall have jobs despite Brookings lack of sacks he has had a load of tackles.He looks like Brian Urlacher on the field, he either makes or is around the tackle.Hall's INT's have sort of been given to him but i like him as a player, the 1 decent pass protector on the whole team.
