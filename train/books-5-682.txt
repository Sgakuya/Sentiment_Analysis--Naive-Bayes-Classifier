The fourth book of the series is when I feel the series is no longer one for children, at least very young ones. I had a reserved copy and picked this book up the day it came out, and barely put it down again (literally) until I had finished it. It was amazing. Books very rarely cause me to cry, but this one did at the end. It is amazing to see how much Rowling has progressed as a writer, and Harry and the gang as characters. The emotions are real, and increasing in complexity with age. This book keeps you guessing until the very end, and it is a real toss-up between this one and the 5th one for my favorite. A must read.
