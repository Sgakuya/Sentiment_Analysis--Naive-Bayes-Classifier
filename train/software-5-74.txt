Unfortunately I haven't played either of the CS Geography games, but I've played the History, Math, and Language ones, and let me tell you, they're terrific! It got me through my worst years of school and made learning fun for me. The animation is terrific, and it makes learning really fun! It has adjustable difficulty levels and can be admired from a game standpoint as well. My only gripes are that the History game (my favorite one of the bunch) isn't as historically accurate as it should be, but it points out the small discrepancies that are made in the manual and corrects them. I would recommend this to all kids who are having trouble in any of these subjects, or who want to brush up on them. They're entertaining and educational.
