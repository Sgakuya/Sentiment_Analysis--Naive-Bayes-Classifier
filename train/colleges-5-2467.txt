The University of the South, located in Sewanee, TN is a nationally ranked liberal arts school with a College of Arts and Sciences as well as a School of Theology. The University is owned by the Episcopallian Church, specifically diocese of the South. Sewanee is known for its committment to small class sizes and a lot of one-on-one interaction between faculty and students. It is quite common for faculty to have students over for dinner in their homes. Sewanee also prides itself as an institution that does not inflate grades. (See U.S. News and World Report.) Only about 25% of Sewanee graduates graduate with a 3.0 or higher GPA. This does not mean that Sewanee students do not have an academic apititude. Rather, it proves that Sewanee values hard work and A's are only given for A work. With a student body of about 1300 students, Sewanee offers a wonderful four-year undergraduate program that involves a sense of community and a reverence for the Honor Code. Sewanee graduates have very high acceptance rates into Medical and Law schools, as well. If you are in the market for a small liberal arts school Sewanee is worth a close look.
