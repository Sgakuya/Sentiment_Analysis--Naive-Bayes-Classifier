* new season, time for a new rating: 39 wins and 8 losses as I write this review. 10+ games ahead of their Eastern Conference rivals, Cleveland and Miami * While I'm somewhat concerned about the two losses at the hands of the Jazz earlier this season, an honest mid-season assessment still shows the Pistons to be the best team in the league, and I think this trend will continue until the end of the season when Detroit winds up with 65-67 regular season wins ( barring injuries ). The playoffs will be brutal, but I also think they will pick up the franchises fourth NBA title when they beat Miami in the ECF and eventually go on to defeat the Spurs in six games at the NBA Finals. Pistons own, nuff said!!!
