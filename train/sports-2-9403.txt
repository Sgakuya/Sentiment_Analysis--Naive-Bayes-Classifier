As a player, somewhere between a 4 and 5. A great defensive player with a score's touch. As a person, a big fat zero. This dude has been a nuclear detonation waiting to happen over the past couple of years. He was starting to act bizarro earlier this month when he asked his coach for a month off because he was tired after recording a rap album. But the Detonation in Detroit takes the cake. While there were a few drunken dudes in the stands that exacerbated the situation, nothing exonerates Artest from the stupidity and brutality of attacking fans nearly half his size. NBA commish David Stern acted appropriately and suspended him for a year (he'll lose $5M in Jack). Artest's immaturity and selfishness also destroyed any chance for the Indiana Pacers to contend this season. He now overtakes Latrell Sprewell and Kobe as biggest A-Hole in the NBA.
