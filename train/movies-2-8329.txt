I expected this movie to be far better than it actually was. People told me Dogma questioned organized religion in a unique and funny way, and I've enjoyed other things done by Kevin Smith, so I anticipated a great movie. But Dogma is a dud. The movie does discuss religion and it is irreverent, but the dialogue tries unsuccessfully to be deep, and the exploration of organized religion is superficial and sophomoric. Even worse, the movie just isn't funny. I can handle shallow, but at least make it funny shallow. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon deliver uninspired performances, as do most of the other actors in the overcrowded ensemble of characters. This movie isn't worth a $3 rental, even if you're splitting it with four other people.
