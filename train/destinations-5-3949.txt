Miami is the best city in the U.S., even though it may not seem like it is U.S. I have lived in two larger cities, Philadelphia, and New York City. Those cities do not compare what Miami has to offer. Miami is probably one of the most international and cosmopolitan cites in this country. There are people from all over the world here and we all get along. Of course there is crime here, what large city doesn't. Chicago has the honor of being called the most violent city. As for the weather, were else in the continental US can one go to the beach in January besides South Florida? Where can you play a round of golf in late December? Any suggestions? So for those of you that say Miami sucks, you to to visit again and really explore what the city has to offer. You have to open your mind and see how different this great American city is!!!
