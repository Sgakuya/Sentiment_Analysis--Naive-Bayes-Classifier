I think most of the people who comment on her weight are exaggerating or just ignorant. Just because someone is skinny doesn't mean that that person is anorexic. Anyway it's amazing how many people write with such hate. Perhaps thay have been hurt or burned by an Ally? As for Calista Flockhart, the actress, she does fine work. Judging from her filmwork and televison work, I see that the idiosyncratic behavior on Ally McBeal is truly just acting. Ally McBeal is a character who is very human. We hate her and we love her. She can be annoying and she can be adorable. She is very much like each and every one of us. So, to the people who can't stand to watch: perhaps you can't stand yourself either.
