DN3D is one of the games that put this genre on the map, the other being the weaker Doom series. Duke gets the edge due to its more creative level design, along with its toungue-in-cheek attitude about the preceedings. Our hero Duke Nukem provides a hilarious running commentary as you play, and is provided with more creative weapons with which to dispatch his foes. The levels also really lend themselves to multiplay, which is a must if you really wish to explore the fun this game has to offer. Historically speaking, the greatest FPS game, and indeed one of the greatest computer games in general, ever created.
