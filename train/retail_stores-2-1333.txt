In a recent business decision, Macy's is greatly expanding their presence because its corporate parent has decided to rename most of all of its other department store brands to the better known Macy's name. As such, the department stores of Lazarus, Rich's, Bon, Burdine and Goldsmith's will all convert to the Macy's name in January 2005. These stores already have the Macy's name visible in some way. We have several Lazarus-Macy's by me, but I'm finding smaller store competition having better selections in clothes. Though housewares is more appealing, things are overpriced overall. I'm also finding their service to be a little too in-your-face than I prefer. Thumbs down.
