A couple of salient points on Mantle. Yankee Stadium's left-center field fence was 454 feet, and about half his at-bats there were right-handed. Breaking in with NY, with the stigma of being called the next Joe D put added pressure in the beginning of his career. Injuries certainly stunted his accomplishments but so did his lifestyle which was not oriented to post-injury or post-surgery recovery. Mantle once said when I batted, I wasn't just trying to hit a home run every at-bat. I was trying to hit the longest home run anyone had ever hit, every time I picked up a bat. He tried to pull everything, which accounts for a high strikeout total, was pitched around often, which accounts for his high walks count. He came the closest of any player who ever lived to hitting the ball out of Yankee Stadium (about 18) which nobody has ever done. (Sidenote: While acting as hitting coach for the Yankees, after Mick retired, during spring training, Yogi Berra was also an ass't coach, Mantle missed a game and there were 3 streakers during the game. Berra ran up to Mick the next day and said, Mick, ya shoulda seen 'em, three of 'em, jumped out of a car by 3rd base, ran across the field, jumped over the fence by 1st base and drove off. Mickey said, well, Yogi, were they guys or girls? Yogi answers, I dunno, they had bags on their heads. )
