Hearts is my card game of choice, and it's definitely one of the more skill heavy card games that I know of. Good players are able to dodge disastrous hands, and bad players often get the queen dropped on them even with good hands. Card counting is a big deal in Hearts, and those who are able to keep track of what cards have gone by will thrive. Unlike most games, Hearts is all about the avoidance of points. Each heart is worth one point, and the Queen of Spades is worth 13 points. The game is played in a serious of tricks, and when the first player goes over 100 points, that player loses, and the game is over. A nice twist to the game is that if you are somehow able to take ALL the hearts in a round, you are rewarded by being able to subtract 26 points from your own score, or adding 26 points to everyone else's. This is called shooting the moon.
