halle is the most beautiful women in the world without make-up,she is a natural beauty.she has done every part in a movie a person can do and most actors cant not do what she has in their careers lifetime and at her age what she has accomplished for other black actresses,i feel she has opened the door for more roles for black women.im the mom of four mixed kids and i know what she has done for my girls self esteem and seeing her overcome all her problems with men and still going on and being who she is teaches theses girls of our generation now not to let color in the way and not to let a man push you around and she wasnt afraid to come out with it. i feel she is a role model,my daughter wants to act and is a very pretty girl i hope she is as lucky as halle, also halle helped a friend of mine who was on a soap oltl, when she was only in a pageant and halle was the judge in 95, halle helped her hooked her up with n agent and her first job was on a soap she say's she owes her whole career to halle.She has so much respect and love from oprah that must be something for halle, everyone loves her and when she won that oscar i knew she would, i cried when she and oprah cried she was well desereved of it and not due to color her talent is amazing and she should be recongnized for itnot just her beauty only.i hope to meet her one day myself and my daughter to who loves her so much.halle you got it going on.anyone you thinks less is jealous. kelly
