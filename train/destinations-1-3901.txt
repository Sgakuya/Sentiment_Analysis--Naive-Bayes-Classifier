i've read most of the reviews of the town of pittsburgh on this page, and i have to say i do not enjoy it there really. i go to pitt which no doubt is a good school but i don't even consider pittsburgh to be a city. i expected too much going there. downtown has about 20 stores and closes too early. they have an alright club scene if you're over 21 which i'm not. but even if i do go out i can't get home cuz the busses stop at like 1:30! it has some real nice landscapes which are fun to look at. somebody said there's too much to do in pittsburgh if you're the fun-seeker. honey, i have looked i have traveled there's no good chinese food, nowhere to shop, nowhere to get good candy, no kids outside playing, no people outside after dark. it's the the twilight zone. how do people live there. i would never be able to take pride in being from there. it's the worst.
