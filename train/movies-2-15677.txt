I have recently revized my opinion on this film down to two stars after further reflection. A good movie doesn't force the story along, and unfortunately this one does. I would be interested to know how much dramatic license was taken wit the story, but I thought the plot was interesting. This would have made a better HBO movie. The relationship that apparently develops between Deniro and Gooding is not well developed on screen. Instead, the viewer is forced into feeling that some special bond between the two existed at the outset. Some of Deniro's conduct as an instructor is virtually impossible to believe, and the breath holding contest was as well. Additionally, the character who develops into the bad guy toward the end has almost no background, and the climax was a let down.
