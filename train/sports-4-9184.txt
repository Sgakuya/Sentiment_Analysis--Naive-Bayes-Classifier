On paper, Houston has the tools to be the NBA's top 2-guard, well deserving of his recent $100 million contract. Blessed with textbook form, Houston can shoot off screens, off the dribble, from a standstill, while moving, you name it. Aggressive to the basket, he also will show ability in the post against other 2s, and is a good pick-and-roll player. Now that the positives are out of the way, let me explain why Houston doesn't deserve anything near $100 million. His defense, which scouts thought was improving as recently as 1999, has quickly become just a between-possessions passtime for Houston. A nice guy off the hardwood, Houston translates that into a total lack of intensity on it. Counted on to bring the Knicks to contender status in 2002, Houston instead led them to their worst record in years. It's time for Houston to decide if he wants to be a good player or if he will go to the next level.
