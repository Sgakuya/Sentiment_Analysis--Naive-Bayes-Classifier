Issel was one of the greatest college basketball players ever, not just at UK. If there were better players, Mr. Superchevy, please say who. Possibly Pete Maravich, but he didn't have the all-around game Issel had, Issel had a much more illustrious NBA career. And his off-court persona is not the least bit questionable. Dan Issel is a consummate gentleman. The incident in Denver, where he called a fan a drunk Mexican, came after the fan in question , who should have been kicked out long before, had been yelling at Issel mercilessly the entire game. It should be noted that Issel did NOT yell a racial epithet at him - for someone who was understandably upset, Issel showed amazing restraint.
