I disagree with the notion that Tommy Lee Jones plays the same role over and over. I think Jones has more than proved his versatility. He's had a long and illustrious career, playing both dramatic and comedic roles. Of course no one can forget his performance as the relentless U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in both The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals. However, Jones is not just limited to playing the hero. He did a good job in the Steven Segal action film Under Siege, in which he played the bad guy. Equally riveting was his performance as the homosexual Kennedy assassination conspirator Clay Shaw in Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK. Jones' best performance was probably in Heaven and Earth. His performance in that film proves that Tommy Lee Jones can hold his own in deep, dramatic roles. However, let's not forget Jones' rather comedic roles (i.e. Natural Born Killers, Men in Black, Batman Returns. Other good Tommy Lee Jones films include Rules of Engagement, Double Jeopardy and Volcano. The bottom line is that Tommy Lee Jones is a good actor who is very versatile.
