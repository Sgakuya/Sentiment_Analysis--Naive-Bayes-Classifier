Vincent D'Onofrio is so good because he does not play the same role twice. Also he absorbs the character he plays and there is no trace is Vincent D'Onofrio in the role. He is brilliant, mesmerizing, and will hold your attention everytime. Check out his brutally, emotionally honest and scarey performance as Gomer Pyle in Full Metal Jacket, watch his dual role in the sci-fi movie The Thirteenth Floor, watch him bring Conan the Barbarian author Robert E. Howard to life in one of the most romantic movies The Whole Wide World, see his humorous turn as Edgar the Bug in Men in Black, see his poweful, edgy peformance as Pooh Bear(you'll hardly recognize him) in The Salton Sea, watch his heart wrenching Emmy nominated performance on Homicide Life on the Street one of the best hours of television ever. and watch him every Sunday as the brilliant, too smart to be a detective Robert Goren on Law Order Criminal Intent. This is just a few of D'Onofrio's work, but once you watch him you won't keep your eyes off him and he'll prove he's one of the best actors of our time.
