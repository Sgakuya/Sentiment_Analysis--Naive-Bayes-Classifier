I disliked Cruise intensely when he first appeared on the scene. The cocky pretty boy thing got tired real quick and I was unable to discern any genuine talent under the tiresome facade. I thought he ruined Color of Money. The Top Gun thing was nauseating. However, just when I was about to write him off, I saw him in Born on the Fourth of July and was forced to revise my initial impression. He does have talent. He doesn't display it often but it is evident in at least some of his pictures. I thought he was the best thing about Interview with a Vampire, a movie that I wasn't particularly enamored of. The unfortunate thing is that I think he is too willing to slide on his image and only occasionally shows off what he's really capable of. Which is a shame. Unlike fellow aging pretty-boy Brad Pitt, Cruise can really act when he finds a role that interests him. The sad thing is that he doesn't find such a role nearly often enough, which may say more about Hollywood as an institution than it does about him as an actor.
