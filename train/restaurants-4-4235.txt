I don't know what makes my mouth water more, the Baby Back Ribs commercial or the thought of an Awesome Blossom (if you don't know what an Awesome Blossom is, I feel very sorry for you. The best way to describe it is, it is a HUGE onion ring that you get to pull apart.). What better place to take a family that can't agree on what type of food to get? Chili's has everything. They have salads, steak, ribs, mexican type fair, and great appetizers. Sometimes it can get exhausting trying to please everyone in a group and Chili's is the solution. The food is not gourmet but it is still really good. You get big portions and fast service. It is the kind of place I get cravings for.
