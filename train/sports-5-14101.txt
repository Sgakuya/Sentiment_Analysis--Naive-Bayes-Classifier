well well well, a subject near to my heart.what can you say about the guy, he was just a WINNER! in our country, we celebrate winners, and we don't tolerate losers. to that dan marino fan, i'll i can say is SCOREBOARD! [you don't remember super bowl xix do ya? - didn't think so] all dan marino fans forget that game. he got outplayed and outperformed by his peer. not to say dan was chopped liver but for a guy with all his talent [hof indeed] he never got to another super bowl. joe went another two times and NEVER lost, not threw a SINGLE interception. joe's the guy you'd want in a foxhole, marrying your daughter, your son growing up to be like. he's our generation's jack armstrong. living in the bay area all my life, he like a GOD to us, never mind the rest of the country. he could run for mayor of san francisco and nobody would object [heck he could do no worse than willie brown] imagine he could go into any bar or restaurant in town and everyone would pick up his check, although he wouldn't WANT that because he's just joe. THAT IS WHY HE'S LOVED HERE! to me he'll always be the greatest.
