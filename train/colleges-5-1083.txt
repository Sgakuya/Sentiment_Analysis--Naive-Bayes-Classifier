In response to Cartecay's earlier posting, I googled Cornell University and Suicide rates and found the article which she references at: www-tech.mit.edu/V120/N6/comp6.6n.html Apparently, Cartecay did not read the article too carefully, as it clearly states: Cornell has a suicide rate of about 4.3 per 100,000 student years for that time period, far below both MIT and national rates. MIT's suicide rate, by the by, was 14.6 per 100,000 student years. I would seriously hope that your child's reading skills are more impressive than your own, especially if your son or daughter apply/applied to Cornell or peer institutions. As a proud Cornellian, I can confidently say that Cornell is one of the most amazing colleges that any student could ever attend. Yes, suicides do happen at Cornell, but you know what -- they happen at college campuses all across the country. Cornell, like any university, does not exist in a perfect bubble where suicides don't happen. Any college has positives and negatives, but I firmly believe that Cornell is a wonderful institution with an overabundance of some of the finest students, professors, and resources in the nation. Cornellians are, as Cartecay states, too smart to believe whatever you're told. However, we're also too smart to believe the advice of someone who is obviously clueless about the true nature of Cornell and its students.
