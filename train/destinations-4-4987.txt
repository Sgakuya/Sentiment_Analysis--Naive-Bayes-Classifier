Nice state- with really two regions- the progressive better heeled south, and the less sophisticated and poorer north. Southern Maine is a great place to live- with some great towns and small cities. Low crime rate and few traffic problems make it an ideal place to retire or raise a family- close to Boston (less then 2 hours) Great arts and shopping, beach's and resorts. The central coast has great and historic towns like Bath and Ellsworth- close to the rugged coastline and national parks. Coastal Maine also has a milder climate then areas inland. Northern Maine is very remote with few towns and is mostly forest and lakes. A great place for campers and hunters.
