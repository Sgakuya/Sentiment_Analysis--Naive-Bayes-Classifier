You know, I excpect more from Weezer. I have enjoyed every single one of their videos until now. Yep. Sumo wrestlers. Great. WHAT THE HELL? This is entertaining? I don't know. I just thought Weezer was more creative than that. Videos like El Scorcho and Say it ain't so kick this one in the ass. And those video are just of the band! The reason those are better is because it was done creativly. The camera work and the presentation of the band is much better. This video mkes Weezer look almost like a glam band. Their older videos had a more home made and low key feel. This looks like it could have been a Blink-182 video. I love Weezer and I am a huge fan. This video just isn't what Weezer used to be.Rather disapointing.
