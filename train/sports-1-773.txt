Frank Thomas is Exhibit A on why the public thinks that athletes are spoiled. Here is a guy who signed one of the richest contracts in baseball only a few years ago. He certainly deserved it at the time. Now, not even half-way through the contract, he is saying that his nearly $10M contract just doesn't sit well in his stomach. After all, with guys like ARod, Jeter, and Manny signing huge deals, he deserves to have his contract renegotiated. Meanwhile, what about the two years (1998-1999) where Thomas had off years? The White Sox didn't go to him looking to renegotiate his contract. How about you just sit down and shut up, Frank? UPDATE: Hey Frank, now that you're injured and out for the year, how about renogiating your deal?
