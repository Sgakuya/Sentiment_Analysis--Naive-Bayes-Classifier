i became a fan since seeing something the lord made He was excellent! He was Dr. Blalock. Since then I have seen all his movies. He IS the person he is portrating. He will get the emmy as well as SAG, golden globe for his portrayal. He was great in all his movies - even the bad ones- he was the only believable and perfect person in it. His accents are incredible!!!Too bad he has never won an Oscar - he should be in more american movies-- I always search to see if he is -what is hollywood afraid of him making our actors looking bad? I mean Really, a lot of the actors who one are not nearly the actor he is. Please get him to do more american movies. Harry Potter films do not show him enough. He needs to be the entire film - like something the lord made. I love him in all his films
