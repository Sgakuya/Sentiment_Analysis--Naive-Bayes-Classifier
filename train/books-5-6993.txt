Okay, I finally forced myself to keep reading past the introduction of everything. And after referring to the index many many times so that I could distinguish meanings of words like Arda, Aman and Ea, I finally got to the meat of the story and it is indeed as entertaining as his other works. In fact it flows quite a bit faster than LOTR - a book I might not have been able to get into had I not read the Hobbit. Though it's funny, you'd think Elves in LOTR like Elrond would be less judgemental of Men, considering the history of Elves with the likes of Feanor. But I must admit, these books are so engaging that I'm compelled to daydream up characters for myself.
