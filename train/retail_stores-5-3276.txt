I have to disagree with the comment here that questions how well Blockbuster employees are trained. Anyone who rents movies at the Blockbuster in West Farms/Farmington, CT knows exactly what I'm talking about. This one guy in particular, I can say with utmost confidence, knows more about any given film -- its plot, its cast, its inspiration, how thick the lens was that it was shot through, etc. -- than that film's own director. From the early 007 movies to the most feminine of romantic comedies, this guy is THE authority. There is no genre that he couldn't write a book on. And he is not shy about sharing this wealth of knowledge with the ignorant masses, either, even if it means harshly scolding customers who describe movies to each other inaccurately. (He once broke a grown man down to tears for misconstruing the premise behind the movie Bottlerocket .) Obviously, his is a special case, where such rules as customer knows best simply don't apply. He is the connoisseur of connoisseurs and anyone who crosses him, beware. Hats off to Blockbuster training, if in fact Blockbuster training is to thank for this type of expertise, which no video rental store should go without.
