People can call him socialist if they want but there is a reason that he spent more time as president than anyone else. He had tremendous foresight callimg on the congress to appropriate funds to begin strengthening the military well before Pearl Harbor. Using fireside chats he was able to relate to the people and was more open than any other president. The WPA and TVA along with the CCC created many utilities, hospitals and schools still in use today. Unlike welfare today FDR had the people earn wages instead of taking handouts. This country is lucky that he risked being called a socialist by showing compassion instead of allowing millions to die.
