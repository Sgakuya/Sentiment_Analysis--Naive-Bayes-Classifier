Depending on your point of view, he could be the best president since FDR or the worst president since Hoover. The only problem is that America is separated like never before amongst those with political views. You can tell straight from the charts here. Most people voted either 1 star or 5 stars for Bush. Hardly any in-between. The reason? People who vote 5 stars believe we should either stick by our president or because he has good Christian morals. Those with 1 star hate the president because of either his Christian morals or the stupidity of the Iraq conflict. I think that the media is just giving a negative insight on him. He is a fairly decent president, he just needs to be given a chance.
