In my seven years of banking with AmSouth I have had only one error on my checking account statement. As it turns out the error was due to poor record keeping on my part. If I use an ATM at another bank I get charged $1 but it is hardly necessary as there are AmSouth branches throughout the state of Florida and I believe they are in GA,AL,TN, and possibly SC as well. The times I go in to cash checks the tellers are extremely pleasant and over the phone as well. If you are looking for a large loan I'm not sure what their service and interest rates are like but if you live in the South and want to maintain a checking account its the perfect bank. I'd stay away from Wachovia and especially Bank of America for your own sanity.
