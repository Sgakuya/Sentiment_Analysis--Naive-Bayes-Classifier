My birth certificate says Baltimore, MD. My death certificate will say ____, WV. West Virginia is an extremely safe state with extremely scenic views, breathtaking outdoor activities, kind, gentle folk, homely feeling small towns, and a very low cost of living. I am quite different from those in the main stream money making I 95 stretch of cities and towns. I need to live in an area where I can walk into an Applebees restaurant and see smiling faces instead of groups of girls rolling their eyes at me as soon as I walk in the door. I need to live somewhere where elders don't scold me because I chose not to go to college. I need to live somewhere where more of the land around me is fresh, clean, green, grass opposed to miles of plastic bottles rolling around my tires and clouds of smoke burning from factories. I went white water rafting in WV for the first time last week. My boyfriend and I were training with the nicest group of strangers I have ever met. I love their accents. I miss it so much I cry sometimes. I wish I could give this state a 10 star rating. I wish people would stop saying this state is an inbred state when they don't have anything to back it up. I recommend everyone to visit this state at least once in their lifetime. You will be amazed at this state, so very different from all other states. The Texas commercials say Texas is like a whole nother country, but I would say this is more true for WV. Hicks more down south are cruel to outsiders unlike WV hicks. They are forever welcoming. Every place else I have been to in the world has either mostly people who are rude to me or an even mixture of nice and mean people. Not one person in West Virginia was rude to me. Not a one. WEST VIRGINIA- The home of the nicest hicks in the US!!!!!!
