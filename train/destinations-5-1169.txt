A great country in many respects. For one, possibly the most progressive social policies in the world: relaxed attitudes towards drug use, porn, prostitution, sexual behavior, and much else were all pioneered here, and THE LORD IN HIS WRATH...hasn't blown up the dikes and drowned everyone. Well, maybe HE has better things to do, or maybe HE APPROVES of people who don't scapegoat and persecute and torture others to assuage their own fears and insecurities. Either way, the rest of the EU is following Holland's lead, Canada too, and maybe US people could learn something here. Basically, Holland is a nice place to see what the future looks like (everyone will be riding bicycles, that's for sure). The only black spot on Holland's record, as one poster noted below, is its shameful treatment of immigrants. But Holland is such a nice place that everyone wants to live there, so the line has to be drawn somewhere. France and England, with their more liberal immigration policies, have become the home-away-from-home for many terrorists; there is good cause, nowdays, for keeping some people out.
