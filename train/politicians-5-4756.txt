Since he assumed his role as Speaker of the House in 1999, Dennis Hastert has been an above average Speaker of the House who I have come to respect. He rose from the cornfields of Illinois to politics, even boasting a 16 year teaching and coaching career at a public high school before being elected as Illinois's Congressman. I respect his willingness to work with both parties to try and get things done to better the lives of all Americans. .....Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of bitterness. They can be found in an environment in which we trust one another's word; where we generate heat and passion, but where we recognize that each member is equally important to our overall mission of improving the life of the American people. --- Dennis Hastert.
