Harding is remakably underappreciated in American history. He was a man who was able to do many things in the short time he was in office and even before. Harding brought America a sense of uplift after enduring the horrible Great War. He called it normalcy. He probably meant something like normality but what he meant was really much more. Americans knew that then and normalcy remains part of our lexicon. He was also the first President to say that he supported the possibility of anti-lynching law. This shows that he was a man who had compassion for humanity. He was a leader who created what has been called the smartest cabinet in history. The people who appointed were the very best of their time. Also consider the post-war military treaties that would serve as blueprints for weapons reduction decades later. He was America's Uncle Warren and his time in the whitehouse is undervalued.
