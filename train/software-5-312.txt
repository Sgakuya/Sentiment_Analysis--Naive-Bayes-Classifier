This is a somewhat unclear title, seeing as their are two major variants of the Mac OS right now -- OS 9, and the completely different OS X. I'm talking about OS X. While it isn't perfect, it's a damn good operating system, especially if you have any kind of a Unix background. The Mach kernel and FreeBSD core give you access to the whole universe of fantastic unix tools, but the GUI wrapper around them makes for a very pleasant day-to-day computing experience. And it's a much more open, legally less restrictive OS than Windows -- if you're interested, you can really get under the hood and much around with it.
