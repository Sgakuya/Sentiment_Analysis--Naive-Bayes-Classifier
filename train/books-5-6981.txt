Tolkien could not have created a better story. It deserves to be in the personal library of every reader. If you liked The Lord of The Rings or The Hobbit, and still want more of the wondrous world of Middle-earth, then you must add this to your collection. Without this story, youll never fully understand the world of Middle-earth. You can read it once, then twice, then again, and each time you'll find something new, a new way to look at it and each time youll come closer to knowing the literary genius of J.R.R. Tolkien. This book is not just a story about one person, but its an entire history of Middle-earth, from its creation, to the coming of the elves, to the fall of Morgoth. It takes you through thousands of years, thousands of lifetimes, from the beginning to the end, this is a story that will last longer than life, as it took a lifetime to prefect and compose. It teaches the history of Tolkiens fantasy world in a way that it sounds as if it came directly out of an ancient scroll or books that was written as it happened. It tells the infamous events that were not explained in The Lord of The Rings, such as the creation of orcs, the coming of man, creation of the Silmarils and the defeat of Morgoth.
