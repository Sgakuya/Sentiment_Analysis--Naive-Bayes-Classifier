A tremendous leader!!! I find it humorous that current Republicans do cartwheels over the slightest bit of leadership shown by George Bush (who I believe has done a decent job) yet continue to denigrate FDR, who led the nation and the world through a much more dangerous and precarious time. While Hoover ignored the millions in the street (believing doing nothing was the best plan of action), FDR vowed to try something, and if that didn't work, try something else! His programs, vision, and leadership gave people HOPE, and eventually our nation got back on its feet, not only becoming economically solvent, but a world power as well. His support of England, at a time when isolationist fervor was high in this country, was in hindsight both courageous and absolutely the best thing to do for our ultimately security and freedom! He, like Churchill, was a great war time leader. FDR, the right man for a challenging time!!!
