I'm 58 not a big guy or strong either. Two years ago we went looking for a bike to ride. Bought a great Kawasaki 750 Vulcan...too little we found out. Test drove a Suzuki LC 1500 and a Honda Valkyrie. Drove the Suzuki first. A little hard to handle going real slow, and when my wife said hit it there wasn't much there. Next was the Valkyrie. Smooth was our first impression. No tingles. Handled great at slow speeds, then Patty said hit it. The next thing I saw was her feet at eye level and boy does she grip hard when she flying off a bike! WE fell in love. Bought a 1998 Tourer in mint green and black with 4,000 miles on it. Last summer was a 3,500 mile trip from the heat of the Texas coast to Colorado. This summer was a 4,200 mile trip up to Montana and back through Yellow stone. These bikes are super smooth with all the power anyone needs short of drag racing. I can easily right mine by backing up with it. Tires are another matter. Dunlops wear out at 7,500 miles! I hear Avons are longer lasting but slip a little in the rain. Chose you battles. Get a new seat from Ultimate Seats, and sheep skin for a super comfy ride. One of the best things about a Valkyrie is that it looks like a motorcycle. Goldwings are great rides, but they are covered with plastic rocketship designs.
