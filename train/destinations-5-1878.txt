THE USA IS THE BEST. Sure there are a lot of things about the country that aren't good but so what, every country has some negative points, and even with all the bad things the US is still the best place to live. Say whatever you want about the US, people still seem to keep on moving here now don't they? People from all over the world still continue to flock to our colleges in large numbers don't they? People all over the world still listen to our musical artist and watch our movies(even those who don't speak English). When was the last time you saw an English-speaking American blasting French or Russian music in their car...um never! People still borrow/copy things from our culture. You can talk all the crap you want at the end of the day the UNITED STATES ARE STILL THE BEST!
