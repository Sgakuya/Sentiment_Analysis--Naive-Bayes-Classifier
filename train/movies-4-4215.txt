Monsters inc. is cute movie. we saw it today at the movies. this takes place in a Monster town. sully the big monster and his friend Mike work in a factory where it is the monsters jobs to scare kids{they go in through the bedroom doors} at night. if they succeed, the screams gives power to the town. One time a door gets opened and a human girl nick named Boo gets into the monster town through her bedroom door. Now Sully has to get the tiny child back home through her door. It turns out this is not such an easy job. there are some good comic scenes in this movie with the usual good guys and bad guys. We enjoyed the movie. It is not quite as good as the Toy Story movies.yet this is a pretty well done computer animated movie.
