The GMC Sonoma is a nice S.U.V but if you are looking for a rating just for this GMC please don't look at this one. This is a rating mostly for General Motors. Stand for General Motors! I can't say this enough but people don't want to do this. People would rather buy Toyota or Scion or Honda from the Japanese who don't like us over here in America because we droped the Atomic Bomb on them years ago and that is also the reason why the want their autos to take the number one spot in sales from General Motors! I think the big reason for Americans buying Japanese autos is that most of us think that the Japanese are the only ones that make compact Autos. That is so false! General Motors has been making compact cars. General Motors makes the Saturn Ion and the new Chevy Cobalt and more compact cars that are easy on the gasoline. I don't think a hybrid S.U.V or hybrid car has been made by General Motors yet but their is another American Automaker that makes a hybrid S.U.V and that is Ford(they make the Ford Escape Hybrid). Sometimes General Motors is a little slow meeting the demands of car buyers but we also have to look at our self and say our we making to many demands for General Motors to follow? I have a Pontiac Bonneville and I have never had any problems with it. The new GM cars are reliable and refined(the best feature of the new GM cars is On Star Service). So stop buying Japanese autos and say no to Toyota and Scion and Honda and any other Auto made by foreign Automakers who just want to take your helping hand away from America.
