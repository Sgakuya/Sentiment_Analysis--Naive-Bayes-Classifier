This movie was good because it was starting to look more modern. I've always noticed that in the original series of Star Trek, things never looked real ie they tried too hard to make the ship look futuristic eg with their hexagonal doors and the multi-coloured lights, orange and green walls. Plus the aliens didn't look real especially since the foreign aliens could speak perfect English with an American accent! You could tell that the Andorians' antenna were made of cardboard. Plus the 'Klingongs' looked more like humans. But in Star Trek six, things began to look more real and the Klingongs looked like Klingongs (with their rotton fruit like apprearance of their heads!) Overall, the story line was OK.
