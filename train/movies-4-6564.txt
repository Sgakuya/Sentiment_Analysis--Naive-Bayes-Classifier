This one is interesting and emotion-packed. The intensity is in the dialog, not so much in a lot of action. It is James Dean's best performance. It is also Natalie Wood's best performance, and I think Natalie Wood is great to begin with. The only real flaw (as some of us would see it) is that it doesn't promote much respect for authority, as the title obvioiusly indicates. But I don't think it so much promotes disrespect as it does just try to show some of the frustrations some young people apparently felt. In fact the counselor, played by Edward Platt, was a strong and positive authority figure that managed to stay one step ahead of Jim (James Dean). It is a unique movie for its time.
