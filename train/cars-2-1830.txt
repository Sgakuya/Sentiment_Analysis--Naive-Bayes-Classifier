With cars as dull and boring as the Century, it should have been Buick that got the axe and not Oldsmobile. At least Olds' was trying to be hip and moving with the times, reflected in such promising vehicles as the Alero, Intrigue and Aurora. All three have engineering specifications that are on par with the imports: multivalve DOHC engines, independent suspensions and technological goodies like the OnStar navigation system. Only time could tell whether the new Olds would have prospered or not and GM cut its chances short. Buick on the other hand is really out of step with the times relying on the monotonous chrome waterfall grill as its common styling theme and the 3800 V6 from the 1960s as the engine of choice in all its cars. Lord, I can't even tell a LeSabre from a Park Avenue without viewing them side by side! Park an Aurora or an Intrigue beside a Regal or LeSabre and there's no doubt as to who has the better product.
