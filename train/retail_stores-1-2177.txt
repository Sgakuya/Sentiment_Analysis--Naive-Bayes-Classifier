DO NOT BUY ECS MOTHERBOARDS!!! I bought 4 of them from Fry's a few month ago for my office network. They all crashed frequently and it took a while to figure out that the motherboard was the cause. Since they come in a package deal with procesors, you cannot return them after 15 days. If you are lucky enough to diagnose the problem, disassemble the computer, put the motherboard back in the origional box along with all the crap that came with it and return to Fry's within 15 days, they'll send you back home to get the processor as well, otherwise no refund. Last week I bought another ECS motherboard, this time a different model, with the same problems. Before you call me stupid, check out your nearest Fry's, they have ECS boards stacked up to the ceiling, and a just a few boxes of a different brand scattered around, all with a "returned" sticker on them. They only offer ECS motherboard/processor combos and if you want just the processor, you can buy it elsewhere for less. Stay away from GQ CD or DVD R's also, unless you collect plastic coasters. Just don't buy anything from Fry's and you'll be safe!
