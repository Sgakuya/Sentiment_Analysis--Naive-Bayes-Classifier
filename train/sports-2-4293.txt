To all you people who think Tubby is a great coach, yeah right! Tubby has been there 7 seasons and 4 of those seasons has lost more than 9 games, not quite up to ky's standards. Does he think he can carry over timeouts to the next game. Tubby, YOU CAN'T!!!!!! Let's talk about Saul, he couldn't have started for any other team in the country, yet he started for ky. Wonder who his dad is? The bottom line is: TUBBY LOSES THE BIG GAMES. Well he did win the championship game his 1st year. I could have coached that team to the national championship, they made the final game the previous 2 years, what has he done since??????/
