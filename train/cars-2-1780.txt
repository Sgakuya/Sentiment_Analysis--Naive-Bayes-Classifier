The Cavalier is seriously outclassed and outdated when compared to the competition. For starters, the current model was last redesigned in 1995. In that same time, Mazda's Protege was redesigned twice and has been further refined for 2001. The Cavalier borrows on dated engine technology and features cheap interior plastics on the dashboard and trim. The Cavalier is neither particularly quiet or refined. Yes, it does offer many features for the money but the sum of the Cavalier does not equal its parts. It lacks the high quality feel found in the import compacts. Superior alternatives to the Cavalier (or Sunfire for that matter) include the Honda Civic, Mazda Protege and the Nissan Sentra, all of which offer better styling and something the Cavalier can't: long term reliability.
