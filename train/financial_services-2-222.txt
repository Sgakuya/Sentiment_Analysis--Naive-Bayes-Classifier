I'm thankful that I don't have a credit card anymore. I tried to get a credit card through BOA and was told I didn't have enough credit! Now, I paid off a house and a car, and I don't have enough credit???What's up with that? Oh, well, it doesnt matter anyway and I have more money left in my checking account to use on myself instead of paying on a credit card. Also, I am a former boa employee. I worked in the credit card division. I always treated my customers with kindness and respect and concern. I got called every name in the book and some days, every call I got was a complaint. I was constantly screamed at and cut off every time I tried to speak. I am not dumb and I am not unkind. Just to let you know, as a customer service rep, our hands are tied on a lot of things you ask us to do. I'm sick about that because of all I've gone through in my life. I, too, asked for help and big businesses told me *so what?* If I had my way, I would've helped in any way I could. Please remember next time you call, not everyone there is mean, cruel, disrespectful, dumb....but, they have one less caring employee-me.
