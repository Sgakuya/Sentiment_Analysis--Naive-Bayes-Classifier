For those of you who have had a bad experience in spain, we apologize, but Madrid, Barcelona, and other big cities in spain don't have as much crime rate as other cities like rome or athens. It all depends on the time and place you were at. Most people don't like spain because we speak spanish and they see us as Spics whcih is a racial remark against hispanics which are the Spaniards, ITALIANS, FRENCH, Santiago De Compostela which is the burial of St. James the Apostol. In the central part of the city you will find Castles, Roman Ruins, Moorish ruins, and more. And the south of spain is probably the best, which has tons and tons of Moorish architecture such as one of the greatest Mezquitas' in the world,one can be found in Cordoba. Now for those of you who are against bullfighting, read this: All of the bulls which are used to bullfight, lived their lives like kings. All of their lives before being killed, they spend in happines. Once the bullfighter is ready to kill the bull, he kills him humainly and instantly and the bull doesn't suffer much longer. In america, they treat their livestock with no consideration. If you go to this webpage: http://www.meetyourmeat.com you will see some of the most horrific seens you will ever see. As far as the ETA terrorist group goes, Spain is 100% against them. Plus the Basques aren't just in spain, they are part of france and spain. plus, ost of the people voting on this forums are other europeans from the UK or Italy who don't get along with other european nations because of their soccer teams or what not. trust me, if you go to spain you return with more than you expected, because most people don't know spain, but in my opinion it has more interesting cities to see and more culture than the rest of the european nations, because it was under the domination of various tribes such as the celts, iberians, vikings... visigoths, moors, romans, greeks... etc.
