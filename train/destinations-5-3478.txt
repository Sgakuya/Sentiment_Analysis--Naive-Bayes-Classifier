Boston is a wonderful city. It's a great place for the college-aged person. The night life is exciting, lots of concerts and shows to see, plus you're right in the middle of history. It's neat to see the older structures sprinkled amongst the more modern one. The Freedom Trail is a must do, which goes through Quincy Market and to Old Ironsides. You should also visit Cambridge and see Harvard and M.I.T, and definitely make sure you catch a show of Blue Man Group at the Charles Playhouse. Oh, and I've rarely run into a rude person. Most people are friendly, even toward tourists. One drawback is the traffic. I've driven into downtown Boston a few times, and hated it. However, you don't need to drive. Boston has a wonderful subway system, the T, which will take you everywhere you want to go. It's fast and clean.
