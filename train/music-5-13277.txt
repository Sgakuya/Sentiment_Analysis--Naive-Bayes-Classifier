FIRST I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS BY TRIPLE SIX IS THE PHATTEST CD ON THE HYPNOTIZE CAMP TO DATE. THE BEATS ON THEIR ARE SO ILL LIKE ON IM SO HI AND BARRIN YOU BITCHES AND FU*K YALL HOES , I MEAN YOU CANT EVEN FADE STUFF LIKE THAT.AND THE LYRICS ARE OFF THE HOOK TOO ON JOINTS LIKE SIPPIN ON SOME SYRUP AND JUS LIKE US AND WHERE DA CHEESE AT (PROPS TO KRUNCHY BLACK FOR THAT HIT), YOU CANT TEST WIT LYRICS AS PHAT AS THAT. BUT THE TIGHTEST SICKEST TRACK BY THREE 6 EVER HAD TO BE THE SONG WITH THE WHOLE HYPNOTIZE POSSE IN IT M.E.M.P.H.I.S. I MEAN T-ROCK JUST GOES OFF IN THAT HIT. THIS CD JUST PROOVES THAT THREE 6 DOESNT GET THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. LIKE WHEN LORD INFAMOUS HOLDS IT DOWN WITH ONE OF THE TIGHTEST VERSES ON THE WHOLE CD IN MAFIA NIGGAZ I ASKED MYSELF 'WHY THE FU*K WASNT THIS SONG A SINGLE.ITS ALL GOOD THO, IT JUST LEAVES FOR MORE SURPRISE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LISTEN TO IT.IF YOU WANNA KNOW WHO RUN IT, GO OUT AND GET THIS CD AND YOULL FIND OUT HOW TIGHT DJ PAUL,JUICY J,LORD INFAMOUS,KRUNCHY BLACK,KOOPSTA KNICCA, AND GANGSTA BOO REALLY ARE.
