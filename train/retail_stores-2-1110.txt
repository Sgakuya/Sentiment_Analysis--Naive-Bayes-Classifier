I went to the one in Corpus Christi, TX. I totally hate the employees that work there. I went in to look for jewelry with my sisters. My sister takes a long time to decide what to buy. The employees thought we were stealing because they kept looking at us up and down. The weird thing was is that they never asked us if we needed any help. They didn't talk to us once! Hello! If you think someone is stealing you are supposed to give them customer service and ask them if they need help! The selection of stuff is great for punks/goths. The store is also too small. I will never will go into that store ever again because of the sucky employees. From now on I will only shop on their online website.
