Baltimore isn't paradise, but it's a better city than its ranking on this list would indicate. The public schools are lousy. There is high unemployment. There's lots of poor people. But Baltimore's bad image stems mostly from its unusually high rates of violent crime. It is so notorious for these that it has spawned an entire cottage industry: the 'gritty/realistic' books (later turned into TV shows) Homocide, The Corner and The Wire, all by former Baltimore Sun reporter David Simon. Besides these problems though, there is a lot to love in Baltimore. It is a beautiful city, with many attractions and an amazingly low cost of living. The food is some of the best you'll find anywhere. It is close to NYC and DC, and just a couple hours away from beaches to the east and mountains to the west. What makes Baltimore special though is its character and charm. American cities smaller than the very largest (NYC, SF, LA, Chicago) share a sad lack of urban identity-minus a lake here or some mountains there, they all look and feel much the same. This is not the case with Baltimore: every neighborhood is different, every neighborhood has its own unique character: Fells Point, Canton, Mount Vernon, Bolton Hill, Hampden; every one of them is like a world of its own. Baltimore is certainly worth a visit; you may even fall in love with the place and move here-I did.
