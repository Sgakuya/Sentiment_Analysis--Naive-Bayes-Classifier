After analyzing every conceivable performance measure for NFL quarterbacks, I conclude that Joe Montana, John Elway, and Johnny Unitas are the top 3 of all time - the NFL's QB Triumvirate, the Top Tier of the Elite. When all is said and done, other NFL quarterbacks come close (Graham, Young, Favre, Marino, Starr, Staubach, Bradshaw, Baugh); but Montana, Elway, and Unitas - each in his own incomparable way - are unsurpassed in what they accomplished on the gridiron. Raw statistics are one important measure, but they are not the final arbiter, not the true measure of greatness. Fact is, it's not hard to find other quarterbacks, some not members of the Hall, whose ratings and passing numbers look better than many of the 21 Hall of Fame greats. But who won more Super Bowls and performed as superbly in the big games than Cool Joe? Who won more NFL games, more championships combined (SB, AFC/NFC, divisional), and more comeback victories than the magician Elway? And who was a superior field commander who played the game with more grit and grandeur than the great Johnny U? If we have eyes that can see beyond mere sentimental favoritism, uncontestably we will see that Joe Montana now stands at the pinnacle of the Hall of Fame Elite. Johnny Unitas once stood there, but can we seriously doubt Montana's new reign? As for Elway, we will be hard-pressed to find another Hall of Famer who played the position with more athleticism, competitiveness, power, and endurance. Come on students of the game, let's learn how to interpret the signs of true greatness.
