In light of the current despair amongst our societies democrats, well?... Why is it that Jesse Jackson is appalled by this outcome? I belive that the gravy train of diversified power to all of the democratic support groups will finally run out of steam with the departure of Mr. Bill. The fact that Al Gore addressed the nation with his view that the U.S. Supreme Court was in the wrong further shows the disregard of this Nations Constitution! This election has raised my awareness that the instrument of election that was put in force by our forefathers is infallible. It has allowed the voice of the people, that are truly tired of this wayward administration, to be heard. If we had a popular vote system, it would be business as usual for another 4 years. I am unaware what is in store for the new administration, but I am bracing for further antics by the disgruntled donkey party. Should the economy falter after our current dictator leaves office, I would only assume that one of the former support agents has kicked the final balancing leg from the economic table. Oh, and Jesse?...Go back to reading your bible! The verses regarding brotherly love are still depicted there!
