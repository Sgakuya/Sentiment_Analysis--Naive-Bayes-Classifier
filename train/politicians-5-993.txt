At least Fox is consistent with what the Mexicans want, and this is one of the main aspects that describes a great leader: Represents its people and defends what they believe. I'll hardly believe that Bush has max 60% of the Americans on his side, and even your own people describe him as unreliable and biased (cfr, Krugman). Who can be smart enough to start two wars simultaneously and have half the world against him? What impresses me the most is Bush's manicheism: If you're not with me, you're against me. Since Saddam is 'evil' and you don't want war, then you're 'evil' . I'm most certain that even Martha Stewart is in shock.
