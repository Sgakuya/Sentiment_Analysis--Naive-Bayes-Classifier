Sure, CSU may not have had a dominating history, but since arriving in 1993 Sonny Lubick has made the Rams a competitive, respectable program. Sadly, he will probably retire soon and the Rams will likely go back into mediocrity unless they can pull a rabbit out of their hat and get either an established coach or a diamond-in-the-rough (types like Urban Meyer, Kirk Ferentz). But for the time being, let the good fans in Fort Collins enjoy the success that Coach Lubick and the Rams have brought to them. And as a CU hater, it really feels good when they beat their 'big brother' (going 3-3 against them in the past 6 years is no easy feat).
