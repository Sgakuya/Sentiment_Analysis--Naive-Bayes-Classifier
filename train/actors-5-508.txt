John Wayne will always be remembered. He was a legend and legends don't die. Wayne's movies contained variety and appeal. He always got the girl and always got the bad guy. John Wayne also did all of his own stunts which I think is great. Wayne has something to offer everyone from war movies to comedies. True Grit will always be a classic and the searchers. My favorite ones are Rio Bravo with Dean Martin, McClintock, and The Quiet man. All comical films but have have deep meaning to them as well which alot of todays movies are lacking. John Wayne died before I was born but I grew up on his movies and I prefer them to anything on television. He shared eveything he had with the world even though his mother never seemed to love him or support him he still went after what he wanted. Nothing stood in the way of The Duke!
