Maurice is the reason I watch GH. I adore Steve, too, but Maurice....what I would give to spend the day with him! I was reading some of the bad comments people wrote about him. I don't understand the mumbling comments..I've NEVER had a problem understanding a word he said. Maybe the ones who think he mumbles either have a hearing problem or they are a little slow....or a lot slow. As far as him constantly reading the cue-cards...yes, sometimes you do see him look off set. And when he does that obviously he's reading cue cards because there is absolutely NOTHING ELSE outside the set to look at. There aren't any other things he could be possibly looking at out there...and I HIGHLY DOUBT his loving family is EVER there to watch him do a scene!!! I'm sure at times he does look at the cards...do you know how much these people have to try to memorize in one night? Maybe the 1-2 rating people should go on the set of GH for a day and see how things are done...maybe it would change their narrow minded tunes about MB. One last thing, some people that rate him as "bad" are refrencing Sonny and hate Maurice for it. News for you people, Sonny is his character....must be the GREAT ACTING that makes you dislike him! He's a great actor and easy on the eyes!' Thanks Maurice...keep up the good work!
