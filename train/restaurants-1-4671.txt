I've never understood the tremendous hubbub about all of these slow food restaurants (with the exception of Friendly's and Applebee's). They not only have sub-par food, but slower service, strange tables, waits for refills, higher prices, bad music, boring TV selections and the requirement to leave huge tips. The fast food restaurant is a much better setup, in my own opinion. My one visit to Friday's will certainly be my last. Their chicken fingers paled in comparison to Chick-Fil-A, KFC, Arby's and even Dairy Queen. Their french fries are horrific and easily stomped by any fast food restaurant. Combine this with cigarette smoke, alcohol served, unstable tables, slow service and high prices, I would recommend you never eat here!
