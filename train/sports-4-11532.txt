Good coach in that he took a morbid Pitt prorgam that had run itself into the ground and built it back up to respectability. Pitt isnt the power it once was, but they are no pushovers anymore. Harris has done some good work at Pitt and was fortunate to get Larry Fitzgerald to play for him a few years back. This is a school with a proud Football history and is located in an area that appreciates hard-nosed football and produces quality players. You can take this job and run with it and for the most part Harris has done just that. He needs to improve his Bowl reocrd and he needs to cut down on the close call games played against weaker opponents. He wins most of his games at the end of the day and Pitt Football is relavant again so he gets Four stars.
