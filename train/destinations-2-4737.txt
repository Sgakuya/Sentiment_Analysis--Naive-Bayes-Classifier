The only good things I can say about Salt Lake City is it is in an amazingly beautiful setting with striking mountains at it's doorstep. Also it is a very clean city, probably one of the cleanest I've ever seen. Otherwise I could not believe how painfully boring SLC really is. I walked around downtown really making an effort to find some atmosphere or something to do and there was nothing! It's just a generic city with a lot of modern sprawl, cookie cutter housing and chain restaurants. If your coming here, skip the city and head for the ski resorts or the magnificent national parks that the beautiful state of Utah has to offer.
