I don't own a Jeep but have driven them often ( Jeeping is a popular summer activity in the Rockies). It is still the best off-road vehicle; it can go anywhere. Also good in bad weather. Now the bad part: on-road it is bumpy, noisy, and uncomfortable. The seats are not very supportive, the brakes are only adequate, and the engine is geared low, so any kind of sporty driving is impossible. And of course, the Jeep is top-heavy; don't try any rapid maneuevers or you will roll over. All that said, I still have a fondness for the Wrangler. It has a rugged quality that makes me want to head for the mountains. And it's a convertible (always an advantage)! As an off-roader or a short-distance highway commuter, I love it. But I wouldn't want to drive one everyday, especially on long interstate journeys. To own one as an only car, you either need to be young or very tolerant. For anyone else, this a specialty vehicle, not an everyday commuter.
