For the uninitiated, Contact deals with a fictional first contact with extraterrestrials in the form of a message received by radio telescopes. The message contains the blueprint for a mysterious machine. As the various characters and power brokers vie for control over the project, the reader is faced with philosophical, ethical and religious questions. Though I am not a particularly religious person, I thought Carl Sagan (an atheist if memory serves) treated religion with remarkable respect in Contact contrary to another comment. My favorite scene dealing with faith and how it relates to the human condition was with the pendulum. In this scene, a hardcore scientist is faced with the reality that there is always some kernel of doubt. The bottom line is that this book was a nice contemporary take on contact with extraterrestrials in that there was no flying saucer but rather an encrypted message from the heavens. Contact was first published in 1985.
