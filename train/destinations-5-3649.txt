Quebec City is a magical place. It has a European atmosphere that is uncomparable anywhere else in North America. The French ambiance is truely authentic here and it feels very festive. I love the quaint old cobblestone alleyways, galleries and boutiques. Old Quebec feels like a village from another place in time like a storeybook. Also worth noting is its acess to Montmorency Falls and skiing at Mont Ste Anne. This place is as enchanting to visit in winter as it is in summer. If your an impatient and hurried person you will probably feel there is only enough to do here for 24 hours. If you have an open mind and embrace the joie de vivre that exists here you could spend several days here and go home with wonderful memories.
