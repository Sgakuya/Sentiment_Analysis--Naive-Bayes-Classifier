I ought to give the creature a rating for two things: a 2.9 as a president and a -1 as a human being. If I could not rate him but just leave a comment, that's exactly what I would do. I am not a crook , eh? I'm falling on the floor laughing. Even if he hadn't fowled himself up in Watergate, the man was just a bit too conservative for me, okay? Sorry, Richie, but I cannot give a high rating to a man who was so inscure with himself that he has to burglarize the other party to feel content, who lies to the entire country on national TV, who chose some pretty screwy running mates, and who overall was just a, as ellajedlicka21 puts it, a lying crook. Take care, everyone!
