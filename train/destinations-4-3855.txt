I really like this city. Being located in Alberta it has its fair share of redneck loudmouth idiots, but far far far fewer than Calgary or Red Deer. The mountains are quite far away, but the river valley running through the city is breathtaking in the fall. Since Edmonton and Calgary like to pick on each other, I will join the fray and say that of the two, Edmonton has the better quality of citizens, which makes a tremendous difference if you have to live there for any length of time (gorgeous scenery becomes dull and unnoticeable after awhile). There are a lot of great parks and bike paths; you tend to forget you're in a large city most of the time. The only thing wrong with Edmonton is that it often feels like one gigantic suburb. It sprawls forever and ever (kind of like Calgary), but there are freeways and stuff so it never takes much longer than twenty-five minutes to get anywhere. It is a surprisingly cultured city as well, and I'm not talking cowboy culture either. As an afterthought, West Edmonton Mall is worth checking out, you could easily spend an entire weekend there, but once you get used to it it becomes just like any other mall but with waterslides and rollercoasters and dolphins. I am not from Alberta so I can truly objectively say that Edmonton is by far the superior city to Calgary, period.
