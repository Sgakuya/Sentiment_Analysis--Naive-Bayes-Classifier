Back in 1968 this was required reading in junior high. It is also one of my favorite movies of all time. I love this book but what I recall most is my English teacher announcing to the entire class that there words in the story that might bother me. Great, being the only black kid in class I knew what that meant (the N word). I am sure she meant well but I spent the next few weeks feeling uncomfortable and dealing with uneasy looks from my fellow classmates. If only the teacher had not made such a big deal out of it. I probably would have be more comfortable reading it. During discussion time I sat there quietly. Too bad. I probably could have given some insight from a black person point of view. It is funny that the class we never got into the meat of the story - people of different skin colors getting along. I have reread this book over the years and still find it an incredible story of love, courage, inner strength and compassion to your fellow man.
