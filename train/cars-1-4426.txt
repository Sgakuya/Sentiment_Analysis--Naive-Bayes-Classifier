Have owned a 1995 Ford Windstar since 1996. Have had to replace the transmission due to a faulty part (forward clutch piston) and replace head gasket due to manufacture defects. Ford is unwilling to take any responsibility for the repairs and has left us with the bill. Both are not reg. maintenence items and should last the life of the vehicle (according to Ford). We phoned Ford many times to plea our case just to get something like, Ford stands behind all of their products, but because your warranty has expired, there is nothing we can do. All in all, we have put almost $3000.00 into this pile of @#$%, but we cannot afford a new one. Also, the dealers do not want any 1995's because of all the problems....so we are stuck!! Don't buy a Windstar...looks like the Honda is the way to go!!
