I was not a stoner or anything in high school and I was pretty surprised when I went out on a limb back then and bought the double album (which almost cost me my entire paycheck for the week of my part-time job - but I still had money to buy beer for the weekend) and fell in love with it. Pink Floyd? What was I thinking? You need to be on grass or acid or some whacky vegetable to like this stuff, right? Wrong. You do not need any of that stuff to watch the movie either, although I suppose it helps. Great songs that are all over the place. It turned me on to the classic 'Dark Side of the Moon' and later some more experimental early Pink Floyd like 'Animals'. Unbelievable mind-blowing stuff. Where is Sid Barrett now? In junior high, I remember some high school guys coming in at the end of gym class at preaching the evils of drugs. The one story that they relayed to us was about Sid Barrett, the original leader of Pink Floyd, being locked up in a looney bin in the UK with only one brain ceel due to his excessive drug abuse. One brain cell, man that is amazing... I believed them and remember that story to this day. Pretty funny how I am sure that these 2 huge Pink Floyd fans probably got busted for dope and had to come profess the evils of drugs to us young and influential 8th graders freshly exhausted from a hearty game of dodge ball. Bob Geldolf was spectacular in the movie 'The Wall'. I think if you press 'Start' on your VCR and when the lion roars at the opening of the movie 'Grease' and you simultaneously hit 'Play' on your CD player with 'The Wall' in the stereo, you will end up with a god-awful mess. Check out the record and I guarantee that you will be entranced.
