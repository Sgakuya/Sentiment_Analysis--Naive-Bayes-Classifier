THE best RTS game EVER to be published. Miraculous and brilliant story; Excellent game play; Three (3) original totally different in units, buildings, building strategies, fighting strategies, pros cons, themes(...), races; Great cinematics (for its time); Superb Multiplayer (maps,speed,ladder); Full and superior maps campaigns editor; Wonderful expansion pack (BroodWars) Few bugs; ... Considering the fact that this game was released in the beginning of 1998, I can confidently state that StarCraft [Blizzard Entertainment] has very few flaws. As was mentioned before, the pathfinding is truely a main flaw in the game, although it does not lessen the game's value much. One of the earlier comments stated that It is surprisingly retro in its unit management scheme... {by 'umma6039om'}. It's true, but if you consider the fact that the game was realeased three years ago and check out other RTS games of that time, you will see that most of those games have these flaws. Furthermore, it was also stated in an earlier comment that ...it is hardly revolutionary. . True, StarCraft is NOT a revolutionary game, BUT it excels it almost any aspect. Additionally, I do not think that a game need to be revolutionary to be great. It is, however, highly desirable for a game to be revolutionary, although it is not the main requirement for game to be considered as a 5 stared, or even a classical, game. Some people I know have never played this game since they considered it another RTS game . Well, I want to say to them and to all of the other people who think like this - try it, and you will not be sorry, even though it is not a new game. Shachar .G. Israel shacharg@netvision.net.il
