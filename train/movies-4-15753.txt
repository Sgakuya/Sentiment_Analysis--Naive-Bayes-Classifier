Surprisingly my whole family sat down to watch this and it managed to entertain everyone. One of the most unique storylines I have come across in a family movie as of late and one that while it keeps it's Disney sentiment, it doesn't drown in syrup. Robert Duvall and Michael Caine put away their normally acclaimed roles to play gruff but sweet uncles. They perform well as usual although Caine's southern accent was less than believable. Haley Joel Osment has clearly been doing some growing up and his performance was quite good. There are tender moments that are touching but the best part was the quirky plot and a good ending.
