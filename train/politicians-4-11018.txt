I give this great man a 4 only becaue he is a freshman senator, but a good one at that. Also, he could easily turn into a 5 star rating. He is you classic story of a poor black man, although lived in Hawaii, is dad was a Kenyan goat farmer, and he went onto achieve, academically...what no black person has done before, and became the editor of Harvard Law Review. He is a rising star, and a future presidential candidate. Chose to serve his people of Illinois instead of taking a bigger paying job for a corporation. He, so far, has been a great public servant, and I hope he continues his trend. Thanks, "skinny kid with a funny name." You are a diamond in the rough.
