Much has been said about the greatness of Jim Brown and rightly so. His stats (rushing yards, yards per carry, touchdowns, etc.) are formidable when compariing him among the all time greats, but it is the intangibles that, to me, separate him from all others. The most glaring point is that he only missed on half of one game (due to a broken wrist) in nine seasons. Considering the amount of punishment he received, that fact seems inhuman. Opponents knew he was coming and they were met head on by Brown; he dished out just as much as he received. And their playing days were when football was brutal in its tackling styles. The reverence in which other players, players of hall of fame caliber, speak of him should be noted. Deacon Jones has openly said he did not like tackling Jim Brown. Paul Warfield and Ray Nitschke have both commented on Jim Brown's intelligence not just as a tactical runner but as a psychologist on the field as well. But to truly get a sense of how great Jim Brown was, find some old game film to watch (if there's an NFL Films special on tv, tape it and keep it). You'll see him run over, spin around, and fly past defenders with almost an ease. Size and speed? Of course. Just add to that uncanny balance, intellect, and near scary determination and you have Jim Brown; the greatest ever.
