Great pitcher. Great person. While you may not agree with his beliefs, Sandy Koufax is an Orthodox Jew. He didn't pitch from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. Still led the NL in wins 3 times and strikeouts 4 times. He came up as a raw pitcher, great arm, no location. He tried to overpower everyone, but couldn't get the ball near the plate. Walter Alston told him that he had a great team behind him - get the ball over the plate and see where they hit it. So Sandy Koufax started throwing that curve for strikes. All I can say is if you never saw Sandy Koufax throw that breaking ball, you missed something. He could start the pitch out behind a lefty's head, and watch it break across his knees on the outside corner! Most difficult pitch to hit in major league history. Remember, when he won his 3 Cy Youngs, they only gave out 1 for the major leagues, not 1 per league. His autobiography written with Dick Schaap is out of print, but it's great reading. If you run across it, make sure to pick it up.
