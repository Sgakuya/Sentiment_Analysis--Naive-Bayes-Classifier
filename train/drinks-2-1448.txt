Giving it a 2, because, in spite of its multiple failings, it does contain alcohol after all and a friend in need, etc.. Now back to the beer. As a beer, just terrible. One of the worse factors is the unfavorable buzz/hangover ratio. The low alcohol means you drink more to get the same buzz as other beers, but presumably the additives or whatever give you (or me anyhow) a skull-splitting headache, even after drinking relatively little of the stuff. On a side note, if you ever wondered why people in Marketing earn high salaries, go to Germany and witness, mouth agape, as certain guileless Germans pay more in a local bar for imported Budweiser than their own excellent domestic, because they feel that they are having something truly American. Now that is a success of good marketing, spinning straw into gold. Who would have thought you could export Bud to Germany and sell it to Germans, but there you have it.
