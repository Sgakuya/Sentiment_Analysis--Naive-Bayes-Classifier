I am currently a 1L and have really enjoyed my experience thus far. The best thing about UConn is the price. EVERYONE gets in-state tuition after their first year, which is very rare. It is the top-ranked public law school in the Northeast, followed by Maryland and Rutgers. So, we get a lot of people who turned down schools like BU and Fordham, due to debt concerns. The campus is breathtaking, placement is superb, and the education is first-rate. The only reservation I have is the lack of non-traditional students. The campus is filled with a bunch of BC and Holy Cross grads. We need wild liberal arts grads representin'!
