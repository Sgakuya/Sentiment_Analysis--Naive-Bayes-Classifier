I enjoyed visiting Hawaii. It's true that Honolulu is like any other city in the US; indeed it reminds me a lot of my home city of Miami. However, go out to Maui, Kawai, and the Big Island and you'll find the best beaches and some great natural attractions as well. Halekala Volcano in Maui is something else, especially at sunrise. Visit the Volcano national park in the Big Island to see an active volcano erupting. The Northeast sides of all the islands have great surfing, the south and west sides have all the resort hotels. You can find tropical jungles on all the islands along with desert like scenery. The weather is usually great throughout the state; really the temperature throughout the year fluctuates between 65-90 degrees. Lots of interesting things to do, great scenery.
