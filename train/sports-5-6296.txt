It's pretty mind-boggling, but this team has been to the NCAA tournament 27 years in a row. Yes, 27 YEARS. Arizona is the next closest team with around 17 years. During that time, they have won two national titles (although critics may say that both were tainted - the pass and the timeout) and have been to many Final Fours. Plus, look at the long line of players who are currently in the NBA who went to Carolina (Carter, Wallace, Stackhouse, Jamieson, Hubert Davis, Rick Fox, Jeff McGinnis, Sam Perkins). I think it is pretty fair to say that they are the best program in the country. And, this year, they are #1 with a very real chance to win another championship.
