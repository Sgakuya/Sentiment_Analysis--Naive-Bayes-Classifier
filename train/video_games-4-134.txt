This was bought as an interim game, I had completed one and needed something to fill some blank spaces during the week. It was in PCZone's top ten FPS chart so I went on that recommendation and yet again I wasn't dissapointed. First thing I want to say is that Cate Archer, the main character is absolutely georgous and beats the pants off of Lara Croft, think Darcey Bussell and you're half way there. Secondly, the game was one of those rare ones that mixes a great sense of humour with an interesting story - chuckling out loud I would progress through different parts of the world as Gucci's answer to a female James Bond. The graphics are colourful, the music spot on, the engine perfect and the entertainment level high. It lost a star because it didn't excite me like other games have but if I met Cate Archer in real life I'd probably have to redefine excitement.
