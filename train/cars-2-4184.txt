Sold my 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 88,000km last year to purchase a new 2002 Subaru Outback - 9 months later I hated it so much that I bought the Jeep back!! (luckily the Jeep had been on loan to a client and the dealer still had it). The Subaru is uncomfortable on long trips, terrible seats give back and leg aches after less than 1 hour, the mirrors get splashed in wet conditions making it almost impossible to see behind, at 12,000 km I had the cam belt tensioners replaced as it sounded like an old diesel, cliamte control air con blows too harsh for comfort and temp fluctuates....etc....etc....etc. It will go everywhere we wanted but you just didnt enjoy the drive. Bring back the Jeep - I will gladly put up with paying twice as much at the pump.
