This is one of the few cities that effectively blends into, as opposed to taking away from, the natural beauty around it. The beaches are beautiful and an athlete's paradise with soccer games, chin up bars, and jogging/bicycle trails scattered throughout, the views are majestic, the hotels opulent... this place is a tourist's dream. Definitely do the tourist circuit (corcovado, pao de azucar). The best beaches are not Ipanema and Copacabana, but Barra, which is a little farther South. Do not stray more than 3 blocks from the beaches of this beautiful city however, because Rio is shockingly poor (and dangerous) pretty much everywhere else.
