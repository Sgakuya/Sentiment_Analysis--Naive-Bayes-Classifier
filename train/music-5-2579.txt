This is my favorite album. I actually didn't really care for it all that much the first time I listened to it, but after a few listens I changed my mind, and after many it slowly beat out the White Album as my top. The medley is amazing and I love that they come back to You Never Give Me Your Money at the very end to tie it all up. Octopus is not my favorite song, but then, there is a song or two on pretty much all the albums I don't particularily care for. Her Majesty has always driven me crazy. I never let the album play through that song because after you come through The End, it's just so out of place and disrupts everything else. Anyways, still my favorite album of the best band of all time.
