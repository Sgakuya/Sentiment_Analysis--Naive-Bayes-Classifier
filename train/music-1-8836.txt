I have to change the channel every time the video comes on the TV. First of all, I can't stand the song. The singer's voice gets on my nerves SO bad...it sounds like his voice is just starting to change, and he sings so high that I am suprised all the dogs in the neighbohood don't go crazy when they hear it. Second, the video is just plain stupid. I mean, who wants to stare at some ugly guy walking down the beach whining into the camera? I wonder how long it took the band to come up with the idea for the video...must have been a whole two seconds. It seems like a band with such a hit song could come up with a more creative video than that. To sum up this video in one word...boring!
