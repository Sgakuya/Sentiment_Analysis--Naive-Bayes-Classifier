I had to rent a trailer recently and had a terrible experience with U-Haul. Trailers were in high demand and so I decided to make my reservation on the internet. Got the confirmation, they charged my credit card etc. then the next day I call the 800 number to get my pickup location and the guy tells me he's going to have the woman who runs that territory call me and tell me. 6 hours pass. I call back a woman says you're all set here's the number of your pick up location. I call it's not them, I call again not them again. I look up the name in the phone book it's diff. from the one give to me by U-Haul they say we stopped using U-haul months ago. So now I have no trailer. I call the 800 number again, she says oops and finds me a location 45 minutes away!!! and of course I have to go get it. Just to add to it I get there and I say I've never done this before what do I need? You're all set she says. Of course it ends up the adapter for the trailer lights isn't correct so I have to delay again and go buy one. U-Haul keeps America moving alright in circles.
