Easily the most overrated state in the country. Its reputation for rain is not an exaggeration. The people are very snobbish (esp. Seattleites). They think theyre better than everyone, that every other place in the world is inferior to Washington. You are almost guaranteed to get caught in a traffic jam regardless of the time of day. High unemployment rate. Highest minimum wage in the country means people can get a living wage at McDonalds with no motivation to get a better job. The sports scene is also bad. Ive got to wonder why the Sonics have not relocated, having played in the NBAs worst arena for ten years. The Mariners have the absolute worst radio announcers- Seattle has the best fans, best ballpark, beat grounds crew, best everything, in their mind. And of course, as we just learned, the voting system is horribly flawed. I moved here from Colorado and quickly came to regret it. As far as the characteristics Washingtonians most like to brag about- many places have lakes and rivers, many places have trees, and many places have mountains. There is nothing unique about Washington that you cant find anywhere else.
