I have to say this was a true experience flying with this airline. It wasn't the worst, yet I wouldn't fly with them again. Getting there was extremely squished at best, and the plane landed so hard on the runway in clear weather, that I had thought we damaged a landing gear or something. We left at least 30 minutes late (except for the return flight, which was 2 hours late)and did some funky loading thing where we used the middle hatch above the wings to load the front to the back...which would cause you to never leave on time because of the pandamonium of brawling in the hallways to find a seat. They managed to serve dinner without any drinks, because they served drinks for the middle, then the front, then the back...so by the time anyone got a drink, they were done. They pick the cheasiest straight to video movies as entertainment, making channel 9 (pilots chatter channel) seem extremely entertaining. When exiting the airline, they show their appreciation of the money they have stolen from you by ignoring you and chatting among themselves. The discount airlines I have flown with like Southwest and Frontier were way better than this airline....
