Was Shoeless Joe guilty in 1919? Probably. Should he be kept out of the HOF because of it? Certainly. As long as Rose can't enter, Jackson shouldn't be allowed in either. Am I sick over this? Yes! This is one of the greatest players ever to grace a baseball diamond. I think 2/3 of the blame for the damn Black Sox scandal should go to the owners for the shoddy way they treated and payed their players. They virtually treated them as slaves right up into the 1980's. I am also sickened by the way Comiskey was able to make all of the confessions of his players disappear and then amazingly reappear at Jackson's lawsuit. Another example of how a few powerful men could get away with anything in that era. In my opinion, what should have been done is that Selig should have had a general amnesty for all banned players as a one time, good will thing at the turn of the millenium. This would have been a perfect excuse for him to allow Rose and Jackson in the HOF. It's too late now, though.
