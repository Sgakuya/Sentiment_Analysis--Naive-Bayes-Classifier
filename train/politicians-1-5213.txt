Many people think it sounds crazy when conservatives like myself say Democrats are socialists. I wonder if they realize the vast majority of people who were citizens of communist or formerly communist countries vote Republican? Everytime you vote to take someone elses money for some social plan to benefit yourself is an act of socialism. For example, Gore wants universal preschool, I don't have children and if I did I would stay home and do my job to raise them. My parents raised their children, we even qualified for free lunches. I never took a free lunch in my life. Why should I or my parents have our hard earned money taken away from us so some idiot can abandon their children for most of the day to try to earn an extra buck? I'm constantly amazed by the stupidity and nerve of so many staunch Democrats/liberals. If you want to live in a socialist country there are plenty of them out there, go for it. Leave America to those who accept personal responsibility and expect others to as well. We are becoming a soft, spoiled, shallow society who puts material wealth ahead of all else. The two knuckleheads running for president right now are proof of this. By the way Al you lost, stop being such a baby and get over it.
