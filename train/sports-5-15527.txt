Larry Fitzgerald very quietly had a stellar season even despite all of the QB troubles in Arizona. Fitzgerald amassed 103 receptions (tied for league lead), 1409 yards (4th in NFL) and 10 TDs (tied for 5th). Despite the fact that there is virtually no chatter about it, Boldin and Fitzgerald easily were the best recieving duo all season with a combined 2811 yards. To give you a full comprehension of the utter domination these two imposed, they even did better than the top 3 recievers on the Bengals vaunted passing offense. Lets compare here: Chad Johnson [1432] + TJ Houshmandzadeh [956] + Chris Henry [422]= 2810 recieving yards Fitzgerald [1409] + Boldin [1402] = 2811 recieving yards See my point?
