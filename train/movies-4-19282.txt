This is one scary, creepy, and creative flick. A psychological thriler disguised as a horror flick, Identity weaves and dodges against a backdrop of constant rain, and a feeling of dread. The bizarre plot is just confusing enough to keep you paying attention, and there will be plenty of times that you'll be hiding your eyes. If the movie missed at all, it was throwing in one two many twists - it was as if a one line punchline was tagged onto a 400 page literary classic. Despite this, Identity is worth seeing. The dreary surroundings and lighting reminded me a lot of Seven, and while Idenity is not quite the movie that Seven was, strong acting and a creative plot makes it worth the price of a rental.
