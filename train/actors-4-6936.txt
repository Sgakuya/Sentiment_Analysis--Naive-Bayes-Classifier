Josh Hartnett is one of the best of today's young stars who are trying to march their way to superstardom. If you ask me, Josh is already there. He was OK in his first two films: Halloween H20 and The Faculty . However, in the roles succeeding those films, Hartnett was phenominal. First, in Pearl Harbor , he gave an awesome performance, and he pulled off that country accent pretty well too. Then comes another military drama, Black Hawk Down , in which he again gave a wonderful performance. So far, in my opinion, he best performance was as the envious, villianous Hugo in O . He was so mysteriously phenominal in that film that without that on his resume, he would probably earn a 3 from me. He communicated Hugo's jealousy and insecurity all too well with the audience. I enjoyed his branch out into romantic comedy in 40 Days and 40 Nights , an average film. He was also good with his supporting role in the romance, Here on Earth . I can't wait to see his new movie with Harrison Ford, Hollywood Homicide . In the final analysis, judging from Hartnett's performances so far, he will continue to go far and eventually earn a 5 from me.
