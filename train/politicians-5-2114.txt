Mr Davis DID NOT create this energy crisis period. It all began with a republican during Democratic president Clitons term. It was another way for republicans to shake the powers of the Democratic party both in California and the United States. You cannot sit there and tell me that the Republicans with all there advisors did not see this comming. I do not buy it for a minute that they would not know the out come of this Energy mess in California. What I do know is this. The republicans thought that this would be another good move for California and when it was not they started pointing thier fingers at the Democrats because there just happens to be one in office. What would the republicans say if there was a Republican Governor in office right now with this energy crisis? Would they still blame the Democratic party? Or would they say Yes we were wrong, we thought it would work but didn't Its funny because not often do you see the polictical leaders excepting responsibility for their failures. I dont know about the rest of you but I am really sick and tired of the finger pointing game.
