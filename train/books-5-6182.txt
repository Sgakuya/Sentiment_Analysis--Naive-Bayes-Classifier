This is one damn good book. Next to The Color Purple it's one of my favourites. It was written with sincerity, love and real devotion from a man who was blessed to meet a lifelong teacher, someone who changed his life forever and for the better. Morrie truly made Mitch Albom look internally at the distant human being he was becoming and at the life choices he was making and the reaons as to why he made them. I don't know anyone, with even the slightest bit of humane emotion thats read this book and hasn't taken a look at their own life and the people around them and questioned the improvements to be made. Outstanding!
