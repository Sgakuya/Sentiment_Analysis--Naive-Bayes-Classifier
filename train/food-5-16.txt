I absolutely love this ice cream! I mean L-O-V-E it!!!!! I lived in Texas until I turned 16. I always got their Homemade Vanilla. When i moved, I tried all sorts of brands of vanilla. I live in St. Louis and Boston by the way. I've had Hood, Breyer's, Dryer's, Edy's, B&Js...and the list goes on! I found Breyer's vanilla disgusting! It was really hard all it tasted like was hard butter! It is by far the WORST Vanilla Ice Cream Every!!! Everytime I go back to Tx, Blue Bell is always the first thing I look for in the grocery store. If yall ever go to Tx, yall better pick up some Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream!
