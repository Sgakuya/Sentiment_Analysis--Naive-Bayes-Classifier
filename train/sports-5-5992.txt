JJ is the one of the many great players to go through Duke. He is a pure shooter who has obviously worked hard on his all around game. His Driving capability and his ability to find the open man have really helped his game this year. He makes the defense honest and opens the inside for Sheldon by just being in the game wether he is scoring a lot or not. Being from his hometown in Roanoke, I have been able to watch him progress from high school to college and it is one that as a college player myself i have great respect for. People can talk all the trash they want, but there is no denying he is one of the best collegiate players right now!
