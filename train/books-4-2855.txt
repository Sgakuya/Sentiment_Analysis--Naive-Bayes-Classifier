I was absorbed in all 976 pgs when this came out. Its great to read a history by someone who understands and LOVES America (from the UK of course). There's some poor fact-checking here (my brother spotted multiple errors on Gettysburg of all things), but then he's far above most historians in appreciating the real causes of the Great Depression; demystifying the over-rated trinity of FDR, Kennedy and Wilson; and appreciating the spectacular increase in human well-being over the past 300 years not as an inevitability but the product of hard work and genius from American entrepreneurs and laborers. Well worth reading.
