definetly one of the best games ever. it's so well made you can think it's been developed by blizzard. the plot is amaizing, though i gave up trying to follow it somewhere in the end of the first quarter of the game it's still amaizing. you could see there was alot of work put into it. the maps are also well made, there are alot of great interactions with NPC's, secret areas, it's baisicly very fun to explore. the game itself is fascinating. from the every second (literrary) changing plot to the in game events and to the maps themselves. but the best thing about it that it maneged to actually be a real role playing game. you'd think that as a first person shooter it will weak the role playing elemetns, but not only that just like in role playing game you get more exp. points by exploring the whole map and doing every possible thing you also got special abilitys that definetly affect you in the game, the diffrence between unexperienced solder to experienced one is huge, start with how fast can you aim, how still will be your arm when you aim with the sniper rifel, how much can you be under water, how fast can you hack into a computer and the list goes on and on. another great thing is that just like in role playing games there is more then one way of doing something, to get through a door for exemple you can either blow it up, find the key, lockpick it or just bypass it through some ventilation opening. the plot is much more open then in other shooters and changes depending on what you do. also there's three diffrent endings. it uses the engine from thief (plus elements from other engines), so you can hide in shadows too (though not as good as in thief). it's damn long, at some point i started joking with my freind about how it invent itself as i play, but belive me, it's worth it.it's great in every possible way you can look at it.
