One of my least favorite cities in the US. Atlanta is very fast growing, but it has its own fair share of problems. During the 1930's, the city had lots of great architecture but thanks to urban re-development during the 1960's and the '70's, the place was torn up and changed. Development within the city continues to be very uneven. There's potential here, but the city is very nondescript, no real character to speak of like NYC or Chicago. The nearby North Georgia mountains however are very scenic, lots of recreational opportunities (hiking, biking, rafting). In short, there's potential for Atlanta, but it's got a long way to go. Way too much sprawl, too much traffic, and huge income disparities.
