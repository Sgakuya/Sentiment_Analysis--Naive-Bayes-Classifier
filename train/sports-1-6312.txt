I don't hate alot of things... but DUKE is pretty high on my list. Can't stand the prissy rich schoolboy thing and so what if you have a rich daddy... you dont need money to play basketball... you need SKILL! so what if J.J. can play his full 40 minutes? CAROLINA has such great depth that at the highest our players play is 25-30 minutes. If you look on the ACC list for player with most minutes played, of course you'll see J.J. Not one single Carolina player is on that list, and i think that's awesome.. the end of Carolina's bench could beat most teams this season... so who's the better team now? as much as i can't stand Duke and J.J. Redick.. i would never yell f*** u J.J. That was just uncalled for. And the fan who made a comment about sleepin w/ J.J.'s sister. Maryland needs to get some class. UPDATE: didnt even get past the SWEET 16!! dukefan4life04, SORRY u wont be seein carolina in the final four now will you?
