Here is a man with absolutely zero competence to run the most powerful nation in the world. Not one of Bush's issues is minutely superior to Gore's. I have genuinely tried to understand why people, assumed to be intelligent and informed, would vote for such a person. It all comes down to they like him . Fine. Go have a beer with the man, but his address should NOT be 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. How scary a thought, I shudder to think. The sad thing is that, I believe, this election will be won based on personality--and that is unfortunate. Should Mr. Bush become elected, it will truly be a sad time for our country and its future. Even more disappointing is the realization that in 2004 my generation and the one to come will elect an administration charged with the responsibility of correcting the plethora of seemingly irreconcilable mistakes and problems that have occurred as a result of this travesty of an ensemble that some of you people call leaders, i.e. George W Bush and Dick Cheney. Don't you worry about though, in four years--the rest of us will deal with the ramifications of YOUR decision.
