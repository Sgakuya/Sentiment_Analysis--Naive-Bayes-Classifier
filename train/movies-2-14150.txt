Boys Don't Cry was a film i eagerly anticipated. I heard it was a power house film with a deep message. This film was powerful. All brawn and no brain however. Giving us all the sh*t that being a cross dressing lesbian woman woman can bring upon you and those you love. What was the point? What did we learn? Back woods hicks are ignorant killers? That you shouldn't be a cross dressing lesbian? Don't get me wrong, the film had some phenominal performances, Hilary Swank especially does an inceredible job as the young woman possing as a young man. It also contained some bitingly real scenes that almost hurt to watch. But what was the lesson? What do we take away from the film except a horrible sese of dread and guilt? I cried for an hour after this movie. And felt i had learned not one damn thing after suffering through this characters ordeal. The only reason i gave it a two star review is for the sheer power and the incredible acting. Beyond that, this film is a torture to witness and sit through.
