Sold my Land Rover Discovery 2002 yesterday, a very happy day!. Nearly rolled over twice. First time my salesman was driving it, entering the freeway from the ramp, went over on two wheels into the ditch, up over and down again into the ditch, finally back on the highway into traffic. Second, I was driving and just changing lanes on a dry highway and found myself on two wheels. Service is bad and expensive. Can only purchase wipers at Land Rover, got caught in a storm with bad wipers so learned my lesson on keeping spares. Unless you are driving over rocks and streams this is not your vehicle. I am a female and looked upon as an alien when entering the Land Rover service dept. Shouldn't need to wait 2 weeks for service when you have oil leaking all over the driveway from the transfer case (replaced twice) new water pump, etc.
