I've always been a big fan of Jerry Sloan. His teams play with discipline and an understanding of the game, which is clearly a reflection of Sloan as a coach. I remember a couple of years ago when Stockton and Malone were still on the top of their games, Sloan started to take steps to reduce their minutes - not because they couldn't handle a lot of minutes, but because Sloan was planning for the future. He knew that he could squeeze out several more productive years from his workhorses if he could shorten their seasons by reducing their minutes. Now it is 2000, and Stockton and Malone are STILL playing productive basketball, and the Jazz are still winning games.
