Thomas Jefferson was a brilliant man. He spoke several languages, was a very prolific writer and inventor. From this we know he was always thinking, always looking at new ideas. I believe he probably fathered children by at least one of his slaves. While I don't approve of slavery from what I've gathered it was much more complicated freeing slaves than we know. I don't know what the relationship was between these two. I do believe he probably treated his slave as well as you can treat someone you own. Though the only black mark I can give Jefferson is that he was a slaveowner. If I could I'd give a 4.5 for that.
