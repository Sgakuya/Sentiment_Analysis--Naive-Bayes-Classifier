My alma mater so I'm biased. I've also been away from the school for over decade so what I know of the school now comes from Alumni magazines, requests for donations, alumni social events and news from fellow alums. Tulane is a great school where you can get an excellent education. The school's name and reputation carry a lot of weight in the working world as well. Tulane is great if you're a Business, Law or Med. school major. Architecture and Engineering schools are top notch as well. Tulane is located in New Orleans , which is just icing on the cake on how great the school is. Going to school and being able to experience four years of Mardi Gras and Jazzfest? Sign me up ! One criticism is that the school postures itself on par with Vandy, Duke, Stanford, etc...it's not quite there ( yet). Still, this is a great school to go to if you want to get away from home, live in a party city, get a quality education and have the time of your life.
