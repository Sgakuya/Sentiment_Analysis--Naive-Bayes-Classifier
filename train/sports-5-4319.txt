Tubby i have to say i love how well you have coached this team to be doing what they are doing. They have hearts bigger than their whole bodies. I love how you dont settle for what you have but how you always demand more. This is what makes a great coach your defense is superb! they work so hard and i love watching them play. I enjoy watching this team just as much as i did when Kentucky had Mercer, Anderson, and Walker. You have takin a team that doesnt have one big scorer or main player and made them a TEAM! They play very well together and have great chemistry. You make me proud to be a true blue fan! thanks for everything Tubby and keep up the good work. David age 18 Crawfordsville, In
