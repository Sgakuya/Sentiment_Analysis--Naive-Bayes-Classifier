Saw this a few months ago. Good movie. Freddie Highmore is good as Charlie. and Johnny Depp is also good as Willy Wonka. this version is darker.the only singing is by the Oompa Loompas {played by only one actor} so it is not really a musical. this one sticks closer to the book. It also goes and shows Willies life as a kid. and how is dad was a strict dentist. and how Willy took an interest in candy and candy making. good acting.this one can be a bit scarier for smaller children. has some funny parts. we saw it on Imax although don't know why it was NOT in 3d and the only difference was everything was just bigger. we could have had just as nice a version on the regular screen.
