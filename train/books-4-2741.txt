Should be required reading for all young women entering the dating pool. Should be required reading for all women, period. If I'd read this book five years ago, I would have had the tools necessary to get rid of more than one creep that wouldn't take no for an answer. Chapter 9, occupational hazards , which discusses violence in the workplace, is relevant and offers very helpful information, especially to managers who do the hiring (come to think of it, this book should be required reading for hiring managers too!) Chapters 10 11 deal with predicting violence in men, getting rid of creeps, and gives good advice on PREVENTION (which is the whole idea, right?!) This book gives great advice and I can't wait to read De Becker's take on terrorism (one of his other books, Fear Less ).
