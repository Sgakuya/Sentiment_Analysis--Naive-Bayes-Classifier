I just finished this book and would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the unique group of statesmen responsible for the birth and early development of the United States. If you're looking for a one-volume summary of the initial development of the U.S. government, this isn't the right book. Founding Brothers isn't a sweeping overview, it's a series of essays that explore themes surrounding key revolutionary figures - Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, Adams, Franklin, and Burr. So it's an interesting introduction or complement to a more complete study of the time, but it's not a comprehensive history. The writing is clear and engaging, and Ellis chooses interesting themes to explore - the clash over slavery, the Burr-Hamilton duel, the life-long collaboration between Adams and Jefferson, etc.
