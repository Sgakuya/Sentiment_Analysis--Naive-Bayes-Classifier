South Carolina is one of the most beautiful states in the United States. Charleston is, without a doubt, a city with no rival. The colonial and antebellum history and the preserved 18th and early 19th century architecture are without equal. Charleston's greatest asset is it's people. Charleston has a civil, courteous, and gracious way of life that still exists, but is rare indeed. Visitors please respect the old world civility and charm of this one of a kind city and the charming people who have called it home for generations. As an added bonus, some of the best beaches, golf courses, and tennis courts in the country are in the greater Charleston area. There are so few cities in the United States that are unique. Charleston can join the ranks of New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, and Savannah is truly being one of a kind.
