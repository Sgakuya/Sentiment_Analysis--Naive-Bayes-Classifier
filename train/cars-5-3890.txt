I have to disagree with the comment that this is an overpriced Explorer. In my area (Maine), Mountaineers can be had fully loaded for approx $2k to $2.5k less than their Explorer counterparts, and I like their color combinations more than what is offered on the Explorer. Granted, the Mountaineer is not offered in the $22k range that the Explorer starts out at, but you can get a fully loaded Mountaineer (elec/lux pkg, moonroof, cd changer, reverse sensing system, side air bags, etc) for $29k while a similarly equipped Explorer will be more expensive. I've had a couple minor warranty issues, but nothing to really complain about. The local dealer (I didn't buy from him) has been very responsive to my service needs. I'm very satisfied with this vehicle and its capabilities (V8 AWD) for the money.
