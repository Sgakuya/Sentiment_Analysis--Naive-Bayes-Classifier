Verizon Wirelss is like the Wal-Mart of cell phone companies. Their customer service is a joke and their actual phones are crap. I used to have Verizon Wireless and they never got my bill right. My sister and I were on a share plan at Verizon and our bill was only supposed to be $80 after taxes. Next thing you know, I am charged bills of $60 to almost $200 more after a few months. Verizon is screwing people left and right. If they have the best coverage in America, then I don't understand why I had so many dropped calls in the Kansas City Metro and Lawrence Kansas area. I switched to Cingular and have had absolutely no problems with them whatsoever after a little over a year. Hey Verizon Wireless, can you hear me now? VERIZON WIRELESS SUCKS!!!!!
