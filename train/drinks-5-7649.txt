I have only had one bottle, but I truly enjoyed it. I won't go into hint of chocolate with a touch of hickory, because my tastebuds are not that refined. Nevertheless, I know what I like and I liked this. It was smooth, which I often equate with Jim Beam, yet it had substance to it. There was strong flavor and character without being harsh, which is how I often think of Jack Black (no, not the actor). I bought the bottle of Knob Creek in a grocery store (still can't get over that) in Omaha. They buyer for the store was praising Knob Creek while dissing Jack Daniels for dropping to 40% (because that is what their customers want. Hello, seems the Republican Party is not the only master of spin in America). Anyways, the Knob Creek was about $20. or so. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when I have seen it in Florida for $28. to $33.
