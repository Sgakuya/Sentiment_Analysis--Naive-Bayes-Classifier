Ann 'Bimbo' Coulter is the epitome of the old saying, 'Beauty is only skin deep', because after the skin, she is ugly to the bone. Any decent Republican should wince when they hear her name associated with their side. If you gave her more than 1 star, maybe you haven't heard some of her quotes. She's so looney, here's a couple of them. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. - My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building. - God says, Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It's yours. - ...liberals and democrats are traitors. There are so many other quotes of hers, equally looney or evil, that space wouldn't permit the countless nutty ideas she comes up with.
