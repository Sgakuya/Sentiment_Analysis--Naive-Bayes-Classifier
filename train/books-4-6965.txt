I read this book about a month ago, and I'm sure it will, as my life goes on, go down as one of my all-time favorite books. I was so hooked with it that I finished it in 28 hours, which is the fastest I've ever read a whole book! A really great book. A sufficiently swift pace, very well-written without being too flowery, interesting plot and intriguing characters. I know this is generally considered a sci-fi book, but while there are elements of science fiction in it, I find more to be a semi-satire, showing how far censorship and political corectness might go if we're not too careful. Anyone who gives Farenheit 451 a rating lower than at least a 3 has very poor literary taste and probably considers Superman comic-books to equal Shakespeare. My only real complaint with the book is that Bradbury kept the plot dragging along over the last twenty pages or so when it felt like it had already run out of gas, but the introduction of Grainger and the hobo camp at the end gave an interesting twist to the story so that it didn't get too tedious. I'm not sure how I can really express my feelings about this book, but..I don't know, it's just great! I reccomend it enthusiastically to anyone who hasn't read it already!
