Too bad that we can't give a zero star rating. This parasite is about as helpful to the United States as AIDS is. He delights in causing trouble, yet he names the name of Christ. He is no more of a minister than Adolf Hitler. Jesse Jackson and his narrow-minded supporters congregate where trouble abounds. And if there is no trouble, let them hang around for a while. It's time that Americans realized that Jesse Jackson is a worthless, dumb, piece of trouble causing idiot. If this is the kind of leaders that some Americans want, let them go to Antartica and start their own country, because most of his supporters wouldn't have the brains to know that humans could not survive there anyway.
