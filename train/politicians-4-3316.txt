I respect Bob Kerrey for his service to the United States during the Vietnam War, and I also respect his courage for facing the terrible mistake he made during that war. I am rating him as a politician, and he really is impressive to me. He served as Governor from 1983 to 1987, and when elected faced a heavy deficit and was forced to balance it out. He mae tough budget cuts and kept the deficit under control, and even managed to balance the budget for the four years that he served as Governor and turned the deficit into a surplus in 1987. As Senator, he has been a hard advocate of welfare reform, education reform and protecting our environment. He is the only member of Congress today who has won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his service in Vietnam.
