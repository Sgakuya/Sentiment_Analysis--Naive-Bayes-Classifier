My family loves going to NYC for vacations. rodeodo and everyone else who says that your family will get mugged and raped and all that crap is just stereotyping. If NYC is such a crapy place and there is so much crime, then why do its 8 million and counting residents walk on the streets all the time without a second thought, not because they are used to the crime, because there isnt that much, not a fraction of as much as people say. now that the statue of liberty is open again, that is a great place to take your family, and of course, ellis island, you can actually find the names of your ancestors! i thought that was really great, some may not but whatever. Pretty much everyone you see on the streets in new york will give you directions if you get lost, that stuff about the people being rude is complete BS. I love visiting NYC, and once i move back to Upstate NY, i will be able to go there much more often, can't wait!
