To all the people who REALLY know a good car when they see (or drive) one, this is the car for you! I'm a 6 month owner of the RSX (base model) and I have to say that this car does not disappoint on any level. Performance-wise you can't get much more bang for your buck than RSX: 0-60 in 7 to 7.5 sec. and 1/4 miles in mid to upper 15's stock. But numbers belie the true sense of this car--you have to sit in one to really appreciate how FUN this car is to drive. A warning is that once you drive it once, you won't be driving anything else so if you have your heart set on a Celica, Tib, or Si, drive those first. Style: 4/5 (this is a hit-or-miss as Honda usually is, I love the look but some may want more curves). Interior is beautiful. Performance: 4.5/5 (some may say just a tad underpowered for the base; handling is excellent for a front-wheeler). Value: 5/5 (lets just say you get your moneys worth). Fun factor: 5/5 (too much fun!) overall 5/5
