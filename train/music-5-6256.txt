Marilyn Manson has changed my life with good and bad influences. I think he is really intelligent and has a great personality. People shouldn't judge him or his music before they properly understand exactly what he is trying to do and how he came about. I think he is very attractive in a dark sense and he is naturally sexy for saying what he thinks, etc. Because of him, he has converted me from a poppy arse into someone who isn't nieve and loves rock music/heavy metal. Marilyn Manson should be credited for his work, he is good at drama, art and english. He is my idol. If you hate him or love him, you are still a fan because you make him the centre of your world.
