One of my favorite games in the whole world! First of all, even if you don't like the game you're going to love the graphics! The controlls are easy and they took away the irritating chore of walking around the world map. Also, the mini-game called Blitzball is really fun, even though I've never won a game yet. They've also gotten rid of most of the man status effects that FFIV had.You get to play as 7 characters, such as my favorite, Wakka and the legendary guardian, Auron. There's also a new way to build up your character to your likings. I'll stop here evn though I've probably gave up most of the game. So in conclusion, his game offers up to 70 hours of gameplay, new development systems, and many more things for you to enjoy.
