I think it is sick to ridicule someone whom you believe may have a life-threatening illness such as anorexia. This is an ILLNESS! Would you be saying the same thing about someone you know? Just because Calista is a celebrity do you think she doesn't have feelings? I hate the way people are judged by their weight. She should be recognised for her incredible acting talent, which is what got her where she is today, as well as her ability to shrug off biggets like you! Also, it is ignorant to assume something about a person that you do not know. So all of those Red Necks out there, stop winging about Calista and take a good look at yourself!!!
