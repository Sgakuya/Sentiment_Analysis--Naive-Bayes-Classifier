Let me tell you about Metallica. Before I begin, let me say this - I don't care if you are a die-hard Metallica fanatic or can't stand them - you absolutely CANNOT argue with what you are about to read. Facts are facts, baby. First off-this is the greatest Metallica album of all time. Hands down. Kill Em All was like nothing ever heard before and was great. Ride The Lightning showed lots of progression, but was a bit choppy. They sounded a little confused - like they knew where they wanted to go, they just had a hard time putting it together. Don't get me wrong - Ride The Lightning is still a great album, with the best song being Trapped Under Ice. Then came Master Of Puppets. After you hear Master Of Puppets, you appreciate Ride The Lightning more because you see the transition. You see that Ride The Lightning was the stepping stone to Master. Master Of Puppets is not only the greatest Metallica album of all time, but one of the greatest metal albums of all time. Next came ...And Justice For All. Another great album, but not better than Master. Then something happened - something called castration. Metallica became a bunch of f*ggots. The black album is one of the biggest disgraces and slaps in the face to true metallica fans and metal in general. And it all went downhill from there - and quickly. Looking back, you take a line like "the show is through, the metal's gone it's time to hit the road. Another town, another gig, again we will explode. Motel rooms and motor ways, life out here is raw. BUT WE'LL NEVER STOP, WE'LL NEVER QUIT, 'CUZ WE'RE METALLICA!" from Whiplash on Kill Em All and you just have to shake your head. They did stop and they did quit. They became f*ggot wh*res for the money and the fame. Poor, poor metallica. But, man...Master Of Puppets, nearly 20 years later, is still phenomenal.
