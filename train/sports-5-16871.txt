Alright, I've been on this board for about 10 minutes, made about 8 posts and I don't even plan on coming back after this because half of you here have IQ's comparable to T.O. (with similar arrogance) This board is full of fanboys; it's pathedic that most here don't even have the brains to post something slightly intelligent. Let me give an example: The Steelers are a great team. They play hard and have many loyal fans. Now I'm not a Steelers fan at all (i am a pats fan, as you might have guessed) but if I saw this posted, I would agree. Do I like the Steelers? Nope. Are they a really good team? Yes. Do they play hard? Yes. Do they have many loyal fans? Yup. Once again, do I like the Steelers? Not at all, but hell can they play ball. Now another example: The Steelers kick ass!! Every other team sucks! Lack of creativity; lack of influence; lack of credibility; lack of intellegence. Plenty of stupidity to cover up. I would continue to post here but I'm afraid I might come across another completely stupid post and have to waste 10 minutes of my life explaining stuff to a bunch of retards who have no idea what they are talking about.
