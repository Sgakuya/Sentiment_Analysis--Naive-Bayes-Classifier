My BUSA is my 7th Motorcycle. I love my BUSA. Everytime I get on it and twist the throttle I get more and more respect for the bike. I can't for the life of me think why anyone would not love a bike like this. It has everything...From a relaxed seating position to unbridled power that is just a little twist away. I have ridden other Super Bikes like the Blackbird and the ZX, but nothing compares to the power and pull that the BUSA has. MY COMPLIMENTS TO SUZUKI FOR FINALLY SETTING HONDA AND KAWASAKI WHERE THEY BELONG...ALWAYS SECOND TO THE HAYABUSA. Those of you who REALLY have one know what I am talking about. medemattia69@yahoo.com
