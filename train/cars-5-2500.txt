Don't be fooled by people who form their automotive opinions primarily through reading magazine articles and daydreaming about numbers printed on those pages. In the flesh, the Twin Turbo version of the 4th generation Supra is an incredible machine. I base my opinion not only on having read more than 250,000 pages of automotive press over the years, but also on having driven many, many, different vehicles -- including the best from Europe and Japan -- and having maintained and modified more than 25 of my own. The TT Supra is incredible from most any individual standpoint, but as an overall package of performance potential, reliability, styling, exclusivity, and affordability, it has no equal. None. However, I am very happy that not TOO many people recognize the awesome nature of this car. If they did, I probably wouldn't be able to afford a nice Supra because they would sell for at least two to three times what they presently do. So I say, LET THEM REMAIN IGNORANT! :-) Steve
