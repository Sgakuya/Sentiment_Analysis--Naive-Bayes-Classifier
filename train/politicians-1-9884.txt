Hoover's main achievement was to create by far the worst economic record of any political leader in the history of western capitalism. Most people think Hoover inherited a worldwide Great Depression but didn't do enough to fight it, due to the lack of economic techniques knowledge at the time. Only the first claim is true. The Fed created the conditions for a stock market bust and recession/banking panic by massively inflating the money supply during the 1920s. Hoover inherited this, but instead of following previous policy and letting the market correct itself, he believed it would be better for the government to step in and help the economy recover. The idea that he was a free market republican is absolute nonsense - from WWI onwards there is a clear record of him advocating large government intervention (in supposed partnership with big business) to fight recessions. So he was always a big government interventionist (like Nixon). In addition, he enacted HUGE interventions from 1930-32, which were almost as extensive as Roosevelt's. These actions were the direct cause of the recession turning into a depression. Far from not doing enough , it was his attempts to do something that were the problem. And as for economic theory not knowing how to respond, this is clearly wrong as well. Ludwig Von Mises had explained many years before that central bank expansion of the money supply would cause booms and subsequent busts, and he also made it unmistakeably clear that heavy government intervention would prove counterproductive. The latter fact was also a widely held belief amongst prior presidents (especially in the 19th century), and many businessmen, which is why previous recessions saw the government do nothing and subsequently watch the recession end within a year (e.g. the panics of 1907, 1920 etc). But no, Hoover thought he knew better and had to introduce policies which experience and economic theory said would be disastrous. Then, when the consequences of his folly became clear, instead of rectifying the error he refused to admit it and instead ordered ever MORE intervention. This finally killed off the economy and led to the worst recession in the 300 year history of western capitalism. For a good explanation of Hoover's interventionist mindset, the specific policies he implemented, and the results, read Murray Rothbard's America's Great Depression . Finally, the idea that the depression was a mysterious worldwide force beyond control was nonsense - countries such as Great Britain (whose central bank also printed lots of money, causing a similar boom) did not suffer anywhere near as badly, and countries like Sweden which followed a relatively hands off approach actually suffered only a normal recession, exacerbated mildly by the subsequent trade wars and competitive devaluations of the 30s. No, it was only America that suffered such a catastrophic economic collapse, and this was unsurprisingly due to specifically American policies enacted by its government. Needless to say, Hoover was a complete disaster as president.
