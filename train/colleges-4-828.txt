I have to say that I do not share the same negative sentiments towards Univ. of Phoenix as a lot of these authors. In all honesty, I have had positive experiences at University of Phoenix- through the overall learning experience as well as team building exercises. Since attending the university, I have been promoted on my job several times; my salary has tripled over the past five years. Of course, this is not solely credited to the University of Phoenix alone, but it does have large part to play in my advancements. I have also notice a an increase in my business knowledge as well as an improvement in my skill set. The truth is that I have shared some bad experiences with the financial counselors, as so clearly noted on this site, but I have also shared same experiences at other institutions (state universities and community colleges alike). Also, as pointed out numerous times throughout this thread, the tuition is too expensive. I agree, but my company is paying a portion. It is not enough to carry the full amount, but every bit helps. By the way, that Mercedes that my wife wants is also way too expensive, but we aren't talking about cars, are we? Anyway, I will be finishing up with my MBA in less than eight months. Afterwards, I am taking a 11-day cruise to Alaska a celebration for accomplishing yet another goal. BTW, I would like to share an acroynm for SUCCESS. I picked this one up from one of my readings in my project management text (Gary and Larson, 2005, p. 99): Select a dream Use your dream to set a goal Create a plan Consider resources Enhance skills and abilities Spend time wisely Start! Get organized and go -Gray, C. and Larson, E. (2005). Project Management: The Managerial Process (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.
