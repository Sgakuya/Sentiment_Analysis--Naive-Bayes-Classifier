Theodore Roosevelt has always been my favorite U.S.President. Not only was he a foreign policy expert, but a skilled diplomate as well. He was awarded the nobel peace prize for his efforts in bringing too an end the Japanese/Russian war in 1903. He also was the first environmental/conservationist president. He set aside millions of acres of government land to preserve for future generations. Yellowstone national park is among these! However, his greatest achievements were probably the Panama Canal, and the building of the U.S. navy into a dominant military force. Without the Panama Canal the trade of certain countries would never have happened and it is my opinion that this economic watershed led to the roaring twenties and established the U.S. as a powerful economic force. Also his vigorous rhetoric speak softly, but carry a big stick . Ensured the safety of the U.S. during his times. Other world leaders saw that he wasn't some one who was not going too back down from a fight. It is admirable when you consider his child hood asthma and the obstacles that he overcame. BULLY FOR YOU TEDDY! Mattyl.p.
