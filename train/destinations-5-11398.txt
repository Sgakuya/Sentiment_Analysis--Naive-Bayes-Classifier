This park is absolutely beautiful. The snow-capped mountains are spectacular and there are lakes and streams all over. When I camped there, I woke up really early on my first morning to hike a trail that circled a big lake (Lake Jenny, I think). It was early enough that I was the only one on the trail, and after about 1/2 hour I turned a corner only to see a bear about 20 or 30 yards in front of me. It was amazing. The bear saw me, scratched a tree for a while, kind of charged towards me a couple times and reared up (but never got close), and finally trotted down towards the lake. A great moment like that kind of made the rest of my stay at Teton a little anti-climactic, but I'll never forget it. Teton has great trails and some of the most scenic mountain views in the entire country.
