Its' no Cedar Point. But it's got decent rides and alot of potential to build up. They are using somthing liek 40% of the land they own.. and teh park is pretty big too. Looking for thrills? Well They have Mind Eraser.. a 90 foot Vekoma SLc.. suspended coaster, pretty intense. Two Face: The Flip side. Vekoma Invertigo.. suspended coaster.. The seats are faced so you look at other riders. The coaster brings you backwards... Up 120 feet i believe. Drops you.. past through the station. Up into a boomerang (Half loop,half corkscrew, half corkscrew half loop) into a loop, Up then this tower brings you up to the same hieght and you do the same thing backwards, very fun. Superman: Ride of Steel. Brings you up 208 feet, drop down 200 feet.. Intamin Hypercoaster, very good ride. Roar, GCI woodie. A very good wooden coaster. only 80 feet i think but packs a great ride. Wild One, this ride used to be in a park in Mass. But got moved. iT's a good ride. Batwing: a Vekoma flying type coaster, so you feel like your flying.. If your not familiar with this. You get into your seat.. Then as the ride starts, your seats fold dwon so now your laying down.. Then durin the ride the track flips over so your looking down. It's fun. Then they have a tower ride. It's pretty good i guess. If you plan on going. Reminded.. it's a Six Flags Park you can bring your season pass.. But your parkingpass won't work, So Parking i think is 7 dollars. If you don't have a seaosn pass, Buy a coke at a nearby store, They have some good coupons on the cans or bottles.
