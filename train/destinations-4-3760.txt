Moved to Buffalo after 7 years in NYC and extended periods in Seattle and the Bay Area. Buffalo's greatest failing is a real lack of progressive political leadership, but it offers great opportunities to those who are willing to roll up their sleaves and work to improve it. Great houses in good neighbors are a dirt cheap and downtown is coming back with new investment and residential conversions. No one who has visited me here for the first time has not been impressed by the architecture, sense of place, cultural offerings, and quality of life. A lot smart educated people have left, but many are coming back and some people (like me) are coming here for the first time and loving it.
