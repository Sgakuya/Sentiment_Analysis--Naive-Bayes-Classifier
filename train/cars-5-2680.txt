I hope all your f-ing supras and civics blow up. I hope I meet one of you at a signal And ill blow you all away in my cobra R or in my turbo Covette. The cobra R and I have beeten every single rice rocket we have gone against at the strip and the track, same with my corvette. Boy it just makes me mad to see evryone turn to rice rockets. Oh look at me and my new supra I have 1400 horse power in it.(from #3 Review)(no car goes 0-60 in 1.6, an f-15 jet has 50000 horse power per jet and dose 0-60 in 1.0 second so an f-ing supra cant. The guy in #3 review is a retard) First of all when you have 1400 horse power in a car that size you better have a strong chassis or else you are going to twist it. second you would have to spend quadruple the amount of a cobra R to make a supra have even over 400 hp because if you have just the stock set up in it your supra it will break. I dont understand how you all think that the supra is the better car it sucks. for any one looking for real info and real reviews please go to a non Rice Rocket inhabited site. OH AND ANOTHER THING SUPRAS F-ING SUCK.
