What can I say...This man is the embodiment of the word entitlement . He managed to enter Yale and Harvard Business school with grades that could only get someone into community college, (C). He wanted to be an oilman like daddy, but failed miserably. He became governor and presided over Texas' slide to 50th in pollution, families in poverty, and children without access to healthcare. Ah, but first in number of people executed by the State. He sounds more like a Third World leader. In terms of leadership , as a comparison of Republican governors who lead , in Texas Mr. Bush's staff is about 200 people. Mr. Pataki in New York has a staff of 14,000 people. Mr. Bush could lead a Walmart, or maybe a large department store. But I wouldn't buy what he's selling.
