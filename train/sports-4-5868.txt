Well, jj redick, in my opinion is a great player he never gives up and he is just great, gorgeous i might add. This is saying alot because ima confused-troubled person...lol... both of my parents are umd-cp alumni's... so you probally know where that ones gonna go, but seriously im not one of those md fans who are gonna waste there time to talk crap about jj , i mean come on hes one of the greatest college basketball players i have ever seen. But jj is definately not worth 5 stars, i also think jj can be very self-centered at times and that is not a good quality for an "all american". but overall, i think he is a good role model and leader, i just hope he gets on an nba team close to my house...
