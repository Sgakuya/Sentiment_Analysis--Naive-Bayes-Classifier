Starbucks Coffee isn't as bad as some want you to believe. Price wise, they are comparable with other chains for like drinks. Starbucks offers organic milk and soy milk. Many other chains or locals do not even offer organic milk. Starbucks also offers fair trade coffee which helps to ensure that the bean pickers are paid a fair wage. Coffee wise, Starbucks tends to over roast their beans in my opinion, giving their coffee and espresso a distintive strong taste. Don't be afraid to try the altenatives. Educating yourself on coffee is a good thing. Some may not like Starbucks. That is okay. Hopefully that means people are paying attention to their coffee and educating themselves to the world of coffee instead of heading off to the convenience store and loading up on a gallon jug of coffee that was made at 4:30 this morning and has sat there all day. Hopefully it means that people are discovering the difference between good coffee and bad. Good coffee is a science and art. Starbucks has taken the step to insure that your cup of coffee will taste the same from one store to the next. Some may consider that the McDonald's theory as a bad thing, but it is a good thing with Starbucks. It helps insure quality control. Brewed coffee is brewed on a timely basis ensuring fresh coffee throughout the day. Starbucks offers on the average 3 different brewed coffees of the day, including a decaf. They usually offer a house blend also, for those who just want a plain cup of coffee. Starbucks treats their employees well, offering every employee inexpensive health insurance, incentives to move up in the chain, a good clean friendly environment to work. For fastfood coffee Starbucks does a lot of things good, not that they couldn't be better, but they are good.
