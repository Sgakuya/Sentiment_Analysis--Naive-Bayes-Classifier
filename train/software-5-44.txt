I hate scumware. There's a company called Gator / Claria that makes this crap, and apparently they did $90M in sales last year, and have now filed for an IPO... revolting. This particular scumware hijacks your browser, and launches new browsers full of contextual ads based on the Web pages that you are looking at. So if you are trying to book a flight to Hawaii on Orbitz, all of a sudden your system will freeze, and a new browser will lurch into view, and you'll see competing offers for plane tickets to Hawaii. It's really irritating. Even worse, this software is added without your knowledge, and there is no 'Remove' feature. Anyway, Ad-aware is a lifesaver. I found it via Google after a couple of months of being harassed by this Claria software. To my surprise, Ad-aware is free, easy to use, and got rid of all traces of the Claria scumware. Definitely try this one before springing for some of the $29.95 software listed here.
