Its truly unbelivable to see so many mindless patriots slamming a suberb actress for simply stating her beliefs. For expressing herself and exercising her free speech. I thought thats what America was all about. I truly am ashamed for any foreigners who may be reading these so called patriots getting ready for their witch-hunt for someone who simply states what they believe in. As for people that say, just stick to acting ... LOOK: if you had PASSION about politics and had the chance to communicate to millions of people...wouldn't YOU do it? Of course you would! You would be a FOOL not to! So lets stop being hypocrites, pretend we're still leaving in a free country, and respect the rights of all people to state when they believe, EVEN actors! (gasp) By the by, has anyone read Patriot Acts I and II? Or are we still too busy checking out which neighbor has the biggest flag on their house, car, lawn, shirt, etc. (Because as we all know, whoever has the biggest flag is the most patriotic) Its too bad some Americans are more passionate in demonizing someone for expressing themselves than for defending our quickly eroding freedoms. I sometimes think that those two towers were not the only thing that went down on 9 11 as we have deceitful politicians using a horrible day as an excuse to take away our rights and increase their wealth and power.
