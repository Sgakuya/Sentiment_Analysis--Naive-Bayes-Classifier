I really like A F, their clothes are really cute, I don't really mind having thier name on it because I don't care what other people will say. I will admit that A F aren't really too smart when it comes to their catalogs, call me crazy but if I had a clothes line, my models wouldn't be naked, they would actually be wearing the clothes, you know modeling the clothes so we know what they look like on a human, but thats just me. I don't shop at the regular A F stores, I shop at the outlet stores. The regular ones cost way too much for me, I'm only a teenager! I used to be opposed to shopping there because it seemed like it was only for crowd-follwing preppy kids who wanted to spend money, but I found out that it isn't. Clothes don't make the person. I'm still the same person I before I started shopping there. It's not like ALL of my clothes in my closet are from A F, only a few things. Infact, I'm wearing an A F shirt right now!!!
