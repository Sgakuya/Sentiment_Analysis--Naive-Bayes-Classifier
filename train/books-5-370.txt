This is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about a great way to look at money. It is about a man whose real dad was a hard working man who never had money. He made a lot of money but for some reason was always struggling to pay the bills. His best friends dad, who he looked at as a second dad didn't make as much as his real dad but always had money to spare. It is a book that tells of this man's experience in watching his real dad (poor dad) and his friends dad (rich dad) and how they used, and viewed money. It teaches to not say you don't have money. It teaches of buying things, stocks, property, and treating yourself before anything else. These lessons all teach of letting you be in control of your money instead of the other way. It is fascinating to read this book and learn from the author who is now rich himself from watching his two dads and learn from them. I learned a lot from the book and highly recommend it to everyone.
