Spielberg is more or less responsible for creating a culture of emptiness and shallowness. His movies plunged America (and the world) into a society of moronic drones. Speilberg was on the path of greatness with the extraordinary thriller Jaws. But hasnt done anything since his tender age of 27, perhaps his first large paycheck numbed his sense of greatness. The decline of a great American culture started with ET winning the Oscars back in 1985 (or wheneve it was) Doubly responsible for his support of the unfathomable syrupy acting of Tom Hanks. Spielberg has done more damage to America than I care to think.
