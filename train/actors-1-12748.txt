There are many reasons why I dislike Gwyneth Why me Paltrow 1. Gwyneth becomes famous because of Brad Pitt. Yet, this ungrateful snob keeps insulting him in her interviews. 2. Gwyneth stole her best friend's script 3. Nothing makes this toothpick happy. Not even winning an Oscar. Gwyneth-Winning an Oscar was very stressful 4. Her remarks about overweight people 5. Using the race issue to portray herself as a PC actress. 6. Her overrated acting abilities etc. 7. Her fake British accent. 8. Last but not least, I am sick of hearing about her love life. Many magazines have a need to talk about her boyfriends. Who cares if she is dating Ben? ZZZZZz
