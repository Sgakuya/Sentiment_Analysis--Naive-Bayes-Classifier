I can barely remember most of the characters (except for the few main ones) or many of the plot points, but I do remember being surprised that political intrigue and academics could be so enthralling. If you try to describe these novels to somebody, they will come out sounding pretty pointless and boring. However, none of us are Isaac Asimov, so our descriptions will fall short. As far as science fiction goes, or as Asimov's other novels go, the Foundation Trilogy are middling when it comes to ideas .and sci-fi is the genre of ideas taken to their logical conclusions), but it is so well written that you will find yourself enraptured by the most mundane political discourse. I have probably done a really bad job of describing and recommending the books, but you're going to have to trust me that they are totally fascinating, even if I can't seem to describe them to non-readers/
