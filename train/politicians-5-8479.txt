The greatest president of my lifetime!! A lot of people have written about his economic policies and how horrible they were. Many very well thought out comments that only lack any fact based evidence to support them. Check out http://www.cato.org/cgi-bin/scripts/printtech.cgi/pubs/pas/pa-261.html for the truth. I saw one person that blamed Reagan for AIDS. I think I could agree with that except that he is not in office and AIDS is still growing. Even after such a compassionate person like President Clinton was in office. Its a prevenatable disease but I guess like smoking people need to decide for themselves if they want to take the chance or not.
