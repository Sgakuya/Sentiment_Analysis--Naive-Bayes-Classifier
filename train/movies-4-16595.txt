 Training Day isn't a great movie, but it's very good. Denzel Washington's performance alone makes it worth a trip to the theater. Washington plays a police narcotics officer who spends a day evaluating Ethan Hawke's character, an idealistic but ambitious rookie cop who is a candidate for a spot in Wahsington's narcotics group. It turns out there's more to Washington's character than the rookie expected, and a simple training day quickly degenerates into a test of will for both of them. The plot is well-constructed, and as it unfolded I found myself running through earlier scenes in an effort to piece everything together - which made this movie more challenging and rewarding than most. The ending gets a little ridiculous, but not so ridiculous that it ruins the movie. Training Day isn't the best film of the year, but it's worth seeing.
