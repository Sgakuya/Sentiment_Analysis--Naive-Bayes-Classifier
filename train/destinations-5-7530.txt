Stone Mountain...I was there for a swim meet this summer. The place is amazing. If a person squints in the sun to look at the mountain, their eyes will soon be wide open. You look up at Stone Mountain, and you automatically know that this is what REAL beauty is like. Whoever carved out that picture on the side of the mountain, the one of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Jefferson Davis, can honestly call themselve an artist. Back to that swim meet I mentioned earlier...I had to swim a long-distance freestyle race. By the sixth lap, I was exhausted (the race was 800 yds). But when I lifted my head out of the water for a breath, I inhaled the wonderful scent of Stone Mountain Park. Just that smell gave me the energy I needed to finish, and I won my race. Thanks, Stone Mountain! Take care, everyone!
