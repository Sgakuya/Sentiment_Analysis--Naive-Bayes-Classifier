Well to comment on the idiotic rant by Samjung (who doesn't even sound American anyway), it seems that YOU in fact have been brain-washed into believing what extremists who hate this country want everyone to believe. First of all, Americans are extremely educated, and anyone that pulls up a "fact" that many don't know how to read or are ignorant to other cultures is insane! Go to any junior high or high school in this country, and everyone knows how to read ( big surprise) and they are learning in some point in time about other countries' cultures. It is a shock when we find out someone doesn't know how to read ( ie. The recent American Idol winner). The other "fact" that there are very few interracial couples is also absurd. I see inter-racial couples everywhere I go. In fact, my borther is engaged to an Pakistani girl and I have several Chinese and blacks in my family, ALONE! I am sure that that isn't very different for the average American. You say this country is overpopulated? If there even IS a problem with overpopulation, your reason is absolutely nonsensical. It would be because of immigrants (especially illegal). The reason we protect Israel is because it is the last Jewish country in the world and they are our ally. We believe that they rightfully own that land. I shouldn't even have to go on anymore. This is an amazing country. Its just said that people like you have taken the great right of free speech and use it as your excuse to slander and completely put down this country. People died for you to have that right and you use it for all the wrong reasons. I am absolutely disgusted. And anyone that rates this country based on the emotions that they feel toward our president are absolute fools. This country has always been, and always will be the best damn thing that'll ever happen to you and if you can't accept that fact then get the hell out and stop making it a living hell for those of us who appreciate it.
