My comments apply to the XR-250R and XR-250L The L is a decent dual-sport, but it has (as do all dual-sports) serious weaknesses in the dirt. The lights are great, but the turn signals are vulnerable. The battery (which makes the lights work so well) is a pain in the neck to maintain. The suspension is too mushy even for a um... mature rider. The power band is great for slow riding, but poops out too early. On the other hand- The R is a much better dirt bike. The suspension is competent at less than full-bore riding. The power band is adequate, the stock tires work well in hardpack and clay. I'd recommend this bike to any adult looking for an easy to ride, non-adrenaline-rush-producing dirt bike.
