Went on holiday with my ex to Paris for 5 days last week (weird i know) and we decided to go to EuroDisney. We did Disney Studios first - I swear the best ride was the Aerosmith rollercoaster as it was in the dark and you had great music in the background. There was a stunts show as well which was really cool - it had loads of cars, motorbikes and fires in it. The parade was crap to be honest and the music really got on my nerves after a while - but the kids seemed to love it. There wasn't really much to do to be honest. We also visited the main one after 5pm (it was dark and raining by then but hey) and we went on Space Mountain and I loved that as well. We had dinner at the EuroDisney Village which was really cool then we had a couple of pints at the bar. We went back the next day and did all the rides we hadn't done the day before - it could be better - but it was a hellva lot of fun. There's loads of places to eat and the place is done up really nicely. The kids will love it - we certainly did!
