If your idea of your collegiate experience is to take classes with socially retarded dorks,cutt-throat pre-med and suit-wearing business people, and segregated cliquish international students on a campus with absolutely no social life and some of the most hideous dumpy horse-faced girls I've ever seen all in one of the blandest, most american cities, chicago is the place for you! Seriously, one of the worst decisions I've ever made. The core completely restricts your ability to take courses that actually interest you and, if you haven't picked your major by 1st year, you're screwed. The people here seem to be proud about how completely lame they are. Sure, my education was top-notch, but at the expense of a college experience: pressure not to go abroad, no social life, etc... I came out of there with good grades, etc.. but I still have no idea what i want to do because of the stifling academic atmosphere.
