I wish he were a true conservative. He's not. He raised tariffs and caters too much to the liberal. For his responce to 9-11 I respect him and hope he wins reelection. His place is guaranteed in American History as one of the better presidents of our time. It's funny that Clinton wanted a legacy that Bush will have without even trying. Bush is a good man, just not a good conservative. But I'll take what I can get. Ralph the wonder llama? So many words and so little meaning. YOu think that the NewYork times is conservative? Can you even read? If you can read you can see which way the old grey lady leans. I'll give you a conservative Fox News if you admit that CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC and CBS are all liberal leaning. I didn't say liberal all the way, but leaning. For Fox's 2 million viewers you have about 15 million viewers for those other left leaning outlets. You have a polemic tone, but no substance in your comments. Go ahead and revise it and I'll get back to you. By the way...Music-Fan sucks...
