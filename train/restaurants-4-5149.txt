Perphaps the most tolerable of the slow food franchises, Applebee's has is good parts and bad parts. Their food is excellent, especially their chicken fingers. Their fountain drinks are also of top quality. Also, their service is top-notch, as the waiter will come by almost every minute (!) to check on you, refill your drink, etc. However, I do not like the fact that the have a bar, complete with mindless alcholic beverages. And, the internal design isn't that bad with windows present and a fair level of lighting. In the end, while the food was surprisingly delicious and the service top-notch, Applebee's is missing the little things that make fast food so great: boxes and sacks with logos, creative mascots and advertisements, reusable cups, drive-throughs and bright, colorful interiors.
