This company may be the all time worst at service delivery. Here's the drill - two months in advance of our move we called them to book them. Then two days before the move (on a Wednesday)we confirmed that they would be there on the Friday at 9:00 am. At 10:00 am on Friday they still hadn't showed up so we called them, only to have them claim the move was Saturday. After much discussion we agreed it would be Saturday. So Saturday comes and again at 10:00 am they haven't shown up. So we call again - several times. By noon we discover that the driver of the truck was about 150 miles away doing another delivery and his truck had broken down outside of cell phone service. Apparently the drivers for this company are too dumb to use a land line. But we are told that he will return that day and move us at 7:00 pm. Of course, Saturday night comes and goes without them showing up. As does Sunday and Monday. And when we called them for an explanation they said it wasn't their fault that the truck broke down - I suppose it must have been mine. At this point we booked another mover who moved us with relative ease two days later. Apparently, this company has neither heart nor men - and if I could score them a zero I would!
