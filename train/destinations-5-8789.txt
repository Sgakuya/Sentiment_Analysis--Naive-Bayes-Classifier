Been dippin copenhagen since about 1989 when I was in 8th grade.. back then I could get a can if snuff for about 1.10 a can.. now I cant find a can of chew for under 5.50 here in hippy faggot drivin california. I guess the law can make the tazes so high on it no one will buy it.. just like cigs. Copenhagen is the best chew on the market hands down doesnt compair.. Skole give me hartburn like a muther and of the wintergreen junk burns my lip.. Cope is teh real deal butit is just too much now. I have switched to Grizzly Fine Cut I have found that for 2.13 a can I can still have a chew and not no be broke at the end of the week. At 5.50 a day just for chew, Im droping 165.00 bucks a month on chew.. I would lik nothing more then to keep on with the Cope but I just cant afford it anymore. 165.00 a month is too much when I can get a kinda close second with that Grizzly stuff.. Does anyone know of somehint geven closer to Cope then Grizzly? Let me know if you do.. http://www.kingjes.com
