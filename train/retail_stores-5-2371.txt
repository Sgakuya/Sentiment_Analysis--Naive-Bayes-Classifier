If people would get off their high horse and take a look at it from the shoppers stand point and the employees, maybe they would come to relize it's not the checkers fault that they have to wait in line! The first thing that anyone should know is that if you shopp you wait! The wait at any other grocery store is at least two to three times longer than at WINCO. tHE CHECKERS ARE THERE TO HELP YOU AND NOT TO BE YELLED AT OR TEATED BADLY BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER CAN NOT MANAGE THEIR TIME RIGHT. Yes, the fact that the express lanes are gone make it seem like you have to wait longer, but you have to think about it from the other stand point. All customers need to be treated the same wether or not the have a cart full or a couple of items. Each customer expects the same kind of sevice wether or not the see it at the time is a whole discussion in it's self. When the one or two item person sees it that way is their problem and they should find a P.I.C.(person in charge) for those who do not know this, and then fill out a comment card and send it to the general office. Please leave the checkers alone and learn to get along. Winco is a great company and it trys to take care of it's employee's, A prime example would be Albertsons they basicaly crapped on their empleyye's thuse making the customers pay for it. All the nasty mean people need to find more time to be happy and to take their businees to albertsons because then they would shop with their one kind!!!!!!!!!!!
