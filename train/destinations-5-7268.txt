Stockholm is definitely one of the nicest European capitals, up there with Rome and Paris. The first thing you'll notice when getting into the city is that there's water everywhere. The natural setting of this city truly can't be beat. It was built at the end of a long lake; 13 islands make up the city itself. The new town is very sleek and modern, the height of Swedish efficiency. But the incredible part of this city is the old town, Gamla Stan, has been very well maintained. It's medieval Europe like how you imagine it. They've done a great job in preserving the beautiful architechure all over the city. It's also a really fun town, lots of stuff to do, great nightlife.
