Honest Abe is arguably our greatest president. Lincoln embodied everything American. Born into a poor family he was predominantly self-educated. He worked as a riverboat operator and was elected to a postmaster position. Later he served as a state legislature and member of the House of Representatives. As president the impact he had on the nation we see today is unparalleled. Beyond preserving the union- his first priority- he grew into the belief that our nation could not survive while preserving slavery as an institution in any state. By the commencement of his second term he was a fully evolved abolitionist who sought to free southern blacks from the atrocities of human bondage. His eloquence is unmatched by any president prior or since- the Gettysburg Address and his Second Inaugural Address are two of the greatest speeches ever given. Only through skilled statecraft and leadership was he able to attain victory in the most brutal war in our history while being roundly criticized and lampooned by the media and elitists of the time. The passage of the Homestead and Morril Acts gave every American the ability to purchase a portion of the American dream- no laws have ever assisted more individuals in gaining mobility up the economic ladder. Sadly only a few days after the end of the Civil War he was struck down by an assasin's bullet. I suggest David Herbert Donald's biography for anyone interested in learning more about Lincoln. Beyond all the historical info I was absolutely surprised by Lincoln's sense of humor and affable demeanor.
