Easily one of the MooCow's favorite Snugglebunnies, Alyson Hannigan is the ultimate Girl-Next-Door. She is simply awash in sweetness, charm, and quirky prettiness that is a huge breath of fresh air in the busty blond-bombshell world of Hollybore. She has moore than amply demonstrated her comedic and dramatic skills on tv (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), as well as several memorable minor roles on the big screen(American Pie, My Stepmother is an Alien, Boys and Girls). Alyson is EXACTLY the sort of sweetie that this big ol' cow falls for in a hard, hard way, so it is no surprise that the MooCow's big ol fuzzy heart goes THUMP THUMP THUMP whenever he sees Ms. Hannigan. Heck, the MooCow even remembers her fresh-faced Burger King cowmercials back in the day. Her popularity gives the MooCow some hope that there are people out there who are mooore acceptible to a different kind of beauty, rather than the same old Hollybore standard. If you ask this Cow, Alyson Hannigan blows away moost of the popular actress in the Biz today, and he would dearly luv to do a little Willow snuggling!!! :=8D
