This was a PRETTY good film!!!The first time I saw it,I hated it 'cause I didn't understand.But whenever I came to completely understand it,I really liked it from then on.The reason Drew wanted to portray this autibiography about Beverly Donofrio,is because she could TOTALLY related to this woman,'cause her mom Jaid basically went through the SAME thing trying to raise her by herself in Hollywood,with NO help from Drew's NO good dad John Barrymore Jr.The SAME thing with MY mom!!!Anyway,Drew REALLY expands her acting talent in THIS film;as well as "Poison Ivy"!!!I kinda wish she would do films like this MORE often!!!Who knows?!!!Maybe she WILL!!!
