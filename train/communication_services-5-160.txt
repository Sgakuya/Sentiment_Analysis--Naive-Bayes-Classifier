Just to let you know about the previous article stating that Verizon generates revenue for selling phone... Whoever wrote that must be a dumb customer! lol!! Verizon Wireless actually looses money by selling you a phone when you sign up for service! They call that cost "handset subsidy" but they make it up with service revenue as you might not even realized but you are spending at LEAST: $50 a month (times 4 = $200!) and here's where the $$$ comes from! They own the network, they don't care how much you use your phone (10 mins or 3,000 mins a month) but they have plans that restrict you on usage and once you go over "Jackpot": 45 cents a minute! --- That's revenue as well :)
