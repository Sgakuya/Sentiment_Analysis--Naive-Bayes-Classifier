Don't know what this birch guy is talking about. Kenyon College is a top notch school! They offer such diversity in their educational endeavors that you can go from graphic design to Defense Development with ease. Who cares about athletics...Kenyon never has, it's program integrating literature, science, philosophy and the arts is the best in the country. Kenyon takes liberal arts to the extreme and allows students to build their own majors based-upon existing programs as well as shape the new ones! Students are very involved in course management and have the ability to network through the vast alumni network. Your professors are a mere mile from your dorm--making it easy to learn from 6am until 1am. Yes, an isolated campus--but a mecca for the most important things in life, learning and drinkin' beer.
