I wasn't a fan of a number of his policies, and he certainly had a number of fumbles during his presidency (iran contra and AIDS being front and center), but Reagan was certainly a very charismatic leader, and a very effective President. I believe that optimism is a pre-requisite for a leadership role, and Reagan's optimism was infectious. He made people proud to be American, and was a riveting and compelling public speaker. Like Bush, he cut taxes and increased spending, but unlike our current president, he was skilled at foreign policy, and was from the Big Tent, more inclusive school of Republicanism - ie that Republicans can come in many different flavors, and don't necessarily have to be pro-life and deeply religious. While no one would accuse him of being brilliant, he had good instincts and was convincing and unwavering in his convictions. I recently read a report that listed Reagan among the three most effective U.S. Presidents of the last century - along with FDR and Truman. I would agree with that.
