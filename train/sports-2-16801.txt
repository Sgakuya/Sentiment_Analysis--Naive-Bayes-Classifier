How the hell can a team with a 4-4 record be rated number one out of all the teams in this website. All the damn WisCANson cheddar heads are brainwashed morons who think that their team will last forever. Besides if they're so good, how many Super Bowls do they have since 1968? One? They were lucky to face a scrub Patriots team with overrated Drew Bledsoe that year. Next year (98) they face old-ass Elway and get smacked around. Yeah, Favre is a great q.b., but the receiving corps this year look much better than what they are because of him. Ahman Green is solid, but I'm just waiting for him to get hurt and see where that leaves them. The defense isn't very good. Once again, Favre keeps the offense on the field longer, keeping opposing offenses from exploiting their second-tier high school secondary. Mike McKenzie? Looks like a Ricky Williams clone, minus the talent. Remember what Michael Vick did them in unstoppable Lambeau Field last January? Lambeau Field is a crappy stadium in an even worse town. They should change the 'Lambeau leap' into the 'Lambeau leak' where the opposing players pee on the fans after scoring a touchdown against the fudge Packers. Not only that, but that stupid 'go Pack go' cheap Paul Diamond-sounding thing they play falls in the same category as Vanilla Ice and Backstreet Boys when it comes to gayness level.
