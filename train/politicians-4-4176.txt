Ralph Nader's political party has their heart in the right place. To those who say he took votes from Gore: if Gore did loose the election, it will allow the democratic party to do some house cleaning on their issues. Nader isn't just about teh environment, though. His ideas on economics are incredible and his education plans are the smartest things I've ever heard. Were he elected though, the still growing Green Party's spirit would be crushed by the oppressive Congress in place. These next four years will give the Green Party time to develope into a larger and more well-known organization and perhaps try to get representitives elected into the legislative branch of Congress.
