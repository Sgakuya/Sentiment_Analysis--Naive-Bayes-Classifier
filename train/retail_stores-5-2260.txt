What a pleasant surprise. My friend who recently moved back from California brought half a car full of Trader Joes items back with her and now I see why. During a recent trip to Santa Barbara with my husband, I discovered a Trader Joes not far from our hotel. Since the place we were staying at had silly prices for just about everything, I started going to Trader Joes daily. The wine section was fantastic and staff were very helpful with picking out the right stuff. More impressive for me were their fresh salads and sandwiches. We did not find one item that failed to impress and the prices were great. I'm from Iowa (where food is cheap) and had heard stories of how expensive southern California is so I was shocked to find food even chaeaper than the natural foods store in my own town. In fact, Trader Joes was better both quality-wise and price-wise than what we have here. Next time I'm in Chicago, where the closest Trader Joes is, I'm bringing two huge coolers and stocking up. It was that good.
