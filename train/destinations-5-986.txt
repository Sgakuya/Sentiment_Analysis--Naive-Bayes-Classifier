England still maintains a lot of charm outside of London. Sure, it has its ugly cities, but overall, it's idyllic. Most of the Brits I've met are friendly and courteous to a fault, are engaging conversationalists, and have their own brand of humor. The most negative thing I can say about the brits is that they seem to have no sense of direction, i.e., no one in the countryside knows where anywhere else is in England. So, if you are traveling by car, once you get over having to drive on the wrong side of the road, make sure you have a good map and have plotted your course carefully to the next town you're going to. The food is OK, and I guess if you like ale, you're in for a treat. Hotels I've stayed at are always an adventure; some were positively Dickensian. Service is always superb, though. It's definitely a repeat travel destination.
