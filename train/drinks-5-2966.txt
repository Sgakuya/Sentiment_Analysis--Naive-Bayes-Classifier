I believe in Integrity and Honesty in the display of a new product, So here is the most honest point of view i can offer. I'm one of those weird people that enjoys staying out late at night, I'm also one of those people that has to be at work at 6am on monday, And instead of falling asleep at my desk, I can drink an XS, and be wide awake! Not only that i give is a 5! because my overall work performance is Awesome! This thing even has a catchy slogan i found, No Sugar, No Carbs, No Bull! This is by far, the Greatest and Healthest energy drink there is! I also found that the Adaptogenic blend as noted, contains echinacea, which i have found to boost the immune system to fight off sickness's. And as far as taste I prefer this over others i have used such as, Amp, Redbull, And Sobes energy drink. overall this drink is very, very, Impressive! I can't wait to get my hands on the new flavor!
