This is a classic example of how an actress or a singer should stay in his or her own genre unless they're Gene Kelly. Jennifer is a very attractive woman and very confident of herself, but I hate hearing how she bounces around to different men, taking them all on the rebound. And I hate the stories of how *everything* in her dressing room must be white, she must have flowers, a certain kind of wine, blah, blah, blah. I mean, come on, she's totally exploiting her own celebrity. The only thing I like about her is the fact that she chooses men to play opposite her who might not have gotten the chance to play that part. For example, she chose Jim Caviezel (wonderful, powerful actor) for Angel Eyes and she chose Billy Campbell to play her husband in Enough .
