I first noticed Natalie Portman in her role in the film Beautiful Girls. Right off the bat, she impressed me with her ability to stay in stride with much older actors. She has this very strong screen presence that makes her stand out in any film she's been in even mediocre ones. I like to compare her to a young Audrey Hepburn. Obviously very beautiful, there's undeniable grace and maturity to her. Not another pretty Hollywood doll, Natalie attends Harvard and has managed to remain well-grounded and a terrific role model. Her work in all her films is good with clear delivery and a feel for the material. Yes, the Star Wars movies aren't good examples of this but I think the script is more to blame than her. I hope to see Natalie in many more roles and think she will prove to be an actress with a long, successful career.
