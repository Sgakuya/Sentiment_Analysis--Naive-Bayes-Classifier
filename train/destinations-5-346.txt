The reason why Nefoundland is the best place in the world to visit is because you don't have to worry about crime, natural disasters, or people being inconcederate, rude, obnoxious, violent, disrespectful, and cruel. You won't find none of those things in Newfoundland, just pleasant and kind people willing to help you out in anyway they can. that's why the U.S sucks because its the opposite of Newfoundland...or the rest of Canada really. As for DickDirk I see you have a stereotype for people. I bet anybody from Newfoundland is smarter and better looking than you'll ever be...unless you spent a whack of money on plastic surgery.
