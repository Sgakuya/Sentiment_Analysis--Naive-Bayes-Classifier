I have just completed my MBA with the Open University Business School. I chose this school because I could fit in my studies with my family and my job. The courses however, provided much more. The quality of the material provided for each module was excellent and the support from tutors outstanding. What has been the most benefit was what I learned from other students. During my studies I have networked with students from all over the world, with hugely varied backgrounds and experience. The modular structure of the MBA has enabled me to study courses that fitted with the work to maintain a high degree of relevance and make studying easier because I could put the course concepts quickly in to context. An aspect I hadn't appreciated fully was that students from normal universities often relate to the university itself, its location, buildings etc. This is not the case with the OUBS since you don't have this physical anchor as you don't actually attend the school. For OUBS students and graduates this anchor is provided by the people, other students and tutors. It is therefore a huge, global family and you can epect to get a warm welcome from other members of the family wherever and whenever you meet them (and you will meet them). Overall a hugely rewarding and enriching experience. The only down is that I have finished the course. David Jarvis MBA(Open) MAPM
