Jason (Steve Burton) is a really good actor and really hot as well (What girl in there right mind would not want him).. I love GH the only thing I don't like is that Jason and Courtney are not together right now.. I think they make a perfect couple and I also love Sonny (Maurice Benard) , Carly (Tamara Braun) are a really cute couple as well i think these two couples should remain together. Also i think that Courtney should start living up to what she promised in her vows when they got married for better or for worse and i think that she is a liar and taking the easy way out of a hard situation. But love as everyone knows is not easy. So i think she should buck up and try to compromise instead of running away.
