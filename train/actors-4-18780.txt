Van Sant has a gritty style that, in his best work ( Finding Forrester Drugstore Cowboy Goodwill Hunting or My Own Private Idaho ), can be pretty mesmerizing -- so that you're looking at his films like visual art not just storytelling. But of course, these same films needed interesting plots and characters to be watchable to audiences outside weirdo film students. On that score, he's been more inconsistent. I've missed some of his biggest flops ( Even Cowgirls Get the Blues ) and stranger gestures (a shot-by-shot recreation of Hitchcock's Psycho ) over the years, but I'd still rank him as someone whose movies I'd seek out.
