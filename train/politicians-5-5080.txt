I think Al Gore is wonderful, he truly cares about people especially those people who are not as well off as some. He wanted to fight for a woman's right to choose and make tax cuts that would really benefit the working class people and not the people who have so much money already they don't know what to do with it. Al Gore won the 2000 election by over 1/2 a million votes nationwide. He would have won Florida if the counting of the votes was allowed to continue but the Republicans got scared that all of there lying and sneaking would catch up with them if it was allowed to continue, so instead of us the people electing our president the Supreme Court was allowed to do that for us, and it's a true shame that 5 people were able to decide for the whole country who our next president should be. Shame on President George W. Bush, he knows this election was bought and paid for by DADDY, he can't even run his own presidency he's got all of daddy's old guys running it for him, ESPECIALLY Cheney.
