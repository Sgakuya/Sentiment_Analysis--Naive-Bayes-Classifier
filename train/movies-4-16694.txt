A nice heartwarming kind of movie. If you do not like those type of movies, you probably will not like Radio. I liked the movie myself. Based on a real like man who went by the nickname Radio. He is mentally handcapped man who is befriended by a high school coach. He encourages RAdio to participate in the football team by helping.out. Of course you have your jerk students and parents who do not want RAdio around and we see the obstacles the coach and Radio go through for acceptance. Radio is made an honarary jr. at the school where he remains today 40 years later.Well acted by Cuba Gooding jr. and Ed Harris.
