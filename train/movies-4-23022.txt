I never was much of a fan of Spider-Man (I thought that the character is pretty wussy, but to be fair, that's because I watched the cartoons only), so I went in not expecting too much. But, I think the story was told pretty well. Willem DeFoe is an incredible actor, and I don't think any other actor could have pulled that character off like he did. The CG was used in such a way that it didn't overshadow the whole thing (which was good, because I expected it to be just another spectacle of the wonderful world of computers). Yeah, it was predictable, and the wet t-shirt show in the rain was gratuitous, but overall I think it's worth seeing.
