The majority of you have no Idea what so ever radio shack has a focus on or where the world is going with technology most analog components will be replaced by digital within the next 10 years or so and if you know so much about these components walk over to the drawer system and pick them out . as for not employees not knowing anything , every non franchised radio shack employee goes through about 55 hours of individual training not to mention monthly training on new items and technology so if an employee cant answer your questions they probally wont be working for the shack to long . And as for you former RS employee if you averaged 5.25 an hour you have to be one of the biggest morons Ive ever heard of I can make $8.00 an hour without trying although I average $13.00 because Im not afraid to offer a cell phone or satalite dish or cable modem . So as a current radio shack employee I urge you to to shop here before the world becomes 1 big wallmart and none of have can have any choice where we shop.
