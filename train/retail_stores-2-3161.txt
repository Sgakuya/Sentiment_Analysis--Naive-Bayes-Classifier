unethical marketing practice. I joined Netfix because I received a promotion saying that they would send me a playstation if I became a paying member for a couple months. Based on the trust of this big name company, I signed up. But after serveral month, the promissed gift never came. Netflix customer service people kept asking me to wait weeks after weeks. then at last they simply asked me to contact their affiliate. Only at that time, I found out what they have been doing all along: in their website, they have a affiliate program, which basically greenlights just about anybody to do the promotion for netflex service. those affiliates will get at least $9 referral fee for each new customer they can get. the idea is that those affiliates may do whatever they want to get customers on board and netflix is not responsible for any of those rogue affiliats' false advertisements. By the time to pay the bills, netflix will redirect the blames to the affiliates and the affiliates may simply disappear and only reincarnate to new affiliates so the games will start all over again. Never realized Netflix was in such a desperate situation to get customers.
