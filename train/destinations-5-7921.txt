What can you say, it's a family restaurant/bar with a baseball game going on in it. The roof is off so you're among the elements. Parking is pretty accessible and exits are swift if you know the area. Public transportation is preferred as it drops you off a block or two away. Riding the train back is fun because you never know what to expect. I've taken my kids on the train several times and they love it. When I was single it was just another place to meet the opposite gender. Prices for game, food etc. are more reasonable here then the indoor sports teams in the city. Whether you're into the game or the people watching, every seat gives you a good view of both. If you can use the word intimate, it's one of the best parks to interact with the players. Take advantage of it before it gets torn down and replaced by one of those mega parks.
