Extremely poor reception and customer service. Actually had a customer service supervisor tell me that he didn't care if I had 30 phones on my account(s), if I didn't like the service to take my business elsewhere, ...I did! Tried to advise corporate about this conversation including offering the employee's name. The woman at the corporate office told me..and I quote....I'm sure you are mistaken. Our employees wouldn't speak to our customers in such a way. If you are unhappy with our service, I agree that you should find a new carrrier that will make you happy. This woman could care less about my complaint and was just as uncaring as the cust serv person. Goodbye Nextel..thank God we don't have to deal with your bad attitudes any longer!
