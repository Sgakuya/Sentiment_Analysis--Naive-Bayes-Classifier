Architecturally fascinating, from the beautiful European-style double story homes with their gorgeous iron balconies, to the creepy nearby cemeteries with the famous above ground crypts. Bourbon Street and the surrounding area in the French Quarter is great fun day and night, and the Garden District makes for a nice walk, easily accessible by the St. Charles Avenue historic streetcar. The biggest problem, as nearly all the comments here have pointed out, is that outside the touristy areas like the French Quarter - and even just outside it - is a great deal of poverty and associated crime. The city looks, even in many places that you'd think would be upscale, like it's falling apart - and in far too many areas, downright dangerous. Worse, most of those dangerous areas are scattered, not concentrated, so you can easily wander into one while walking towards a more tourist-oriented area. This seems odd, as so many tourists pour into this city, that little of the revenue seems to be going into upkeep of the current city or even the long-gone ones - the cemeteries are falling apart too. In the tourist areas, like the French Quarter, this is a beautiful and intriguing city, well worth seeing. Unfortunately, at the moment, you have to keep your wits about you when visiting.
