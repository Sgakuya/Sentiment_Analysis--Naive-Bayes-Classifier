 One of thr greatest Presidents we have ever had and certainly one of the most brilliant. 8 years of prosperity, vigorous attempts at peacekeeping and he worked brilliantly with one of the opposition, Alan Greenspan. Clinton was smart enough to listen to Greenspan and followed his advice. He has a lovely daughter as brilliant as he is and how well he withstood the non-stop vicious attacks from the media. Also, proof of how good he was is the unbelievable hatred of the Conservatives - God how they hate him. Also, he achieved everything on his own merits and didn't have a rich daddy to buy his diplomas for him. Now, we all know he had a problem with women but so did Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson,and Rudy Giuliani (i dont know how to spell his name correctly) and that did not stop them from being great. Of course, I wouldn't want to be married to Bill, but I sure loved having him as our pres. His naughty behavior with women was Hillary's problem,not mine. When I think of how those Conservatives hated him. I'll bet they thought BILL WAS THE ANTI-CHRIST.
