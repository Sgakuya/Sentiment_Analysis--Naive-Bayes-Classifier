I'm currently a freshman and really enjoy the diversity and freedom here at Wesleyan. There's no required courses, which means, take whatever you want! The general education (GenEd) expectation is really easy to complete, since most courses count toward GenEd. Most professors are really good teachers, and are enthusiastic about teaching. Housing is really nice, I have a single, and most people have their own room in two-room doubles (two rooms with one door connecting them and share one door out to the hallway). The one-room doubles are fairly spacious too. Program housing and apartments are available after first year. The best thing is probably the senior woodframe housing. You get to share a house with your friends!! Food is ok. It's cafeteria food, what do you expect? However, the points system is pretty nice, and you don't have to eat in school facilities after the first year. The town (Middletown) is just one street. There's no nightlife in the town, but trust me, there's plenty to do on campus. The only reason to go downtown is for banking (we do have ATM on campus though.) Overall, I'm totally enjoying myself here, and don't judge Wesleyan base on other peoples opinion. Why should you believe me? Just come for a visit, and maybe you'll like it here as much as I do. Good luck in your college search/app/visits!!
