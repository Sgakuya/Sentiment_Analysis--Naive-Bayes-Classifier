Martha put a gun to my head and made me go with her to see this Tom Cruise flick. I have been burned so many times by Tom Thumb that I wanted to invest the cost of admission in beer. I offered to drop Martha off, ease into Murphy's Strip Bar and Armenian Grill for a few, and they go get her afterwards. She put her foot done, (stomping on my sore toe, by the way) and we went together. Well I have to admit that it was much better than I expected and not nearly as bad as I feared! I was a great fan of the George Pal 1950's edition, but this flick is respectible even when stacked up against the classic. The politically correct little girl deal is a little tiresome, but I gotta get used to that, I suppose.
