This game is awesome. The graphics are beautiful and in-depth. The story is well written and has the D&D world down to a science. If you are a true D&D fan, and I mean TRUE, you can't help but love this. The gameplay is fast and exciting. The only complaint I have with this game is the length and the fact that you only get to play as three predetermined characters instead of getting to create your own, which every fan has to agree makes D&D more personal. I can't wait for the second part. I only hope that they allow you to have more freedom to choose your characters alliances and personal traits. Definitely a keeper for all fans of D&D!
