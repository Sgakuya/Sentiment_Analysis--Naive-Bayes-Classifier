If I do have anything to say about Sonic, it's that I'm not a big fan of fast food. But when I do need something quick, and I'm in the mood for a burger, rings, or a coney, Sonic is one of my top choices. It's ten times better than Mc Donald's, Burger King, Wendy's, ect. I will say, that I have experienced more slow service experiences at Sonic, than not, but I'm a pretty patient person, so as long as my food is satisfying, I really don't care. And most of the time, my food is satisfying. I've never had a horrible tasting food at Sonic, and in the fast food industry, that's difficult to achieve. I've had horrible experiences at all of the competitors listed above more than once. But I will say that Sonic's got nothing on Culver's. It's just way more accessable.
