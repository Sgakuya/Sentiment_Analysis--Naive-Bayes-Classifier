Jimmy Carter had good intentions, but he was a terrible President. Unfortunately, Jimmy Carter was almost as bad a President as Bill Clinton except he was honest, moral, and has a deep religious faith. He was very naive, though. He gave our canal to Panama and they have contracted out the operations to the Communist Chinese! During the Carter administration we had double digit inflation and high unemployment. He created the Department of Education. There is absolutely no need for such an organization at the Federal level. The thing that really did him in was the Iranian hostage crisis. What? There really are bad people in the world? Oh no. I guess we need a foreign policy, don't we? Thank you Ronald Reagan for coming to the rescue.
