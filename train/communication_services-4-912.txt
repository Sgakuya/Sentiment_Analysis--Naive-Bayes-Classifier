I got my first cellphone in december '03. It was on the att digital one rate plan... meaning i could travel anywhere in the US and use my phone without roaming charges... it was good, i had service almost everywhere, but it was expensive ($60/mo for 450min, no nights/weekends) I decided to get the GSM america national a few weeks ago... I figured it was about the same plan, but with less coverage, lots cheaper ($40/month, unlimited N/W, 450min) I had to call customer service to get them to help me, cuz the att webpage kept telling me i was in an area not covered (i wasn't) the customer service picked up everytime i called within 2minutes, and they were nice, but couldn't get me set up. I had to buy a new plan, with a different phone # and another contract, but it's worked out alright... overall, they have a few issues with gsm migration as they called it, but other than that i always got pretty good service, really good deals, and i don't know of any billing errors. my friends with verizon do get better coverage, i think... on cape cod, MA, at least.
