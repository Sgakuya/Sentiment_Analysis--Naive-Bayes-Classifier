Contrary to what most Stanfordians might think, UC-Berkeley is the west Coasts equivalent of Harvard...There is no university in this country that can match the intellectual vibe of Berkeley, they have more bookstores per capita than any other city in the U.S. except for Cambridge, Ma. The type of hand-holding that is pervasive at most elite private universities simply does not exist in Berkeley. students must fend for themselves when it comes to academics. They have access to the whole world within the city of Berkeley, they can run into everyone from a noble laureate to a drunken transient. A little note to all the private school cronies who put down berkeley: if it had even half the endowmnet of most elite private universities, it would without a doubt surpass all of them in the various rankings except maybe for harvard, as a matter of fact its rated and revered much higher than all of the ivies except for harvard when it comes to the overall university including grad school.
