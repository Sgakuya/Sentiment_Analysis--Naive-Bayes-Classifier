I am giving this movie this rating not because of what it was, but, because of what it could have been. Val Kilmer and the robot A.M.E.E. were wonderful. You may all think me mad, but, I saw a real sexual chemistry between the two. Also, you have got to give them credit for the wonderful job they did advertising this movie. There weren't many commercials, and one I saw was at 3 am. on the SciFi channel, but, the commercials they had were wonderful! They created a great sense of intrest and made the film look like it could have been great. I will admit that it fell short of being good, and you should all know I still think that The Saint was a good movie. If they had gotten a better director this movie could have soared (I think I read somewhere, that this guy had only directed commercials before; possibly why the commercials were so good). In my oppinion that is Val's biggest problem, the directors he gets teamed up with. Alot of his movies could have been made great if they had been given competent directors. And Val, God bless his soul, promotes a film like no other actor I have ever seen. Unfortunetly, people tend to blame the actor when a movie goes down hill. Anyway, I'm going to stop ranting now let me know what you think if you want to. 'Bye :)
