First of all, I have to say that I feel deeply sorry for the people not the political bullies who have kept them virtual prisoners in their own country but the real people of Afghanistan. When you see anything on the news it is always so pathetically sad. A dusty, rocky country, pitiful living conditions and people forced by a group of cowardly fanatics to live in the dark ages. I have never blamed these people for anything that happened on 9/11. They just happen to unfortunately serve as the skirts Osama and his crew have been hiding behind. I hope one day they are back to normal living in this century and enjoying the prosperity that should be possible for all citizens of this earth. Until this is all over which I pray will be soon I don t think Afghanistan will be drawing much tourism though.
