Quite creative and effective in scaring the bejabbers out of me. Most horror movies usually show their cards and reveal the thing that goes Booga-Booga. The tension builds up, but 9 out of 10 cases, the scary thing is a letdown (most notable exception - Alien). Blair Witch never tips its hand. The ending was scary and kind of left me puzzled. Someone at work explained it and I thought to myself, Brilliant. The only thing that amazed me was the stupidity of the 2 dudes and chick. I was howling when they walked an entire day and did a full circle. If you ever get stuck in a haunted forest in Burkittsville,MD, just remember to follow the stream -- it will eventually lead you to a town.
