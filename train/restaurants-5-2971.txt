A certain reviewer here by the name of DeathRattle will give me a hard time for this review (primarily because the product being rated is so unhealthy), but nonetheless, I will proceed. I am not a big fan of sweets, but I really like Haagen-Dazs ice cream, It is simply the best out there. The texture is very creamy and it comes down really good. I don't care whether or not it's unhealthy, it's worth it when I want a good treat. The sorbets are also great, I usually have these since they are healthy unlike the regular ice cream. They come in many fruit flavors that include strawberry, mango and lemon. It's pretty refreshing, not as good as the ice cream though.
