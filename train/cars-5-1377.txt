My friend just bought a 00 Jetta and it is sweet. Besides the typical VW Golf / Jetta quality, durability, and reliability (see my comment on the Golf), the new Jettas add a user-friendly aspect which I have not seen on many cars. Everything in this little car makes sense - from the way your key is a remote control that can set your alarm, open your trunk, unlock your doors - to the layout of the dashboard, the CD tray in the trunk... everything. And driving this car is a dream, the shift is so smooth you don't even realize that you're changing gears at all, and the souped up V4 engine has a surprising amount of zip. Highly recommended.
