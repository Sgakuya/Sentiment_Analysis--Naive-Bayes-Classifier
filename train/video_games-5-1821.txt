Honestly maybe 007 Goldeneye was Game of the Year for 1998-99, but it wasn't all it was cracked up to be, the missions were fun but only if you wanted to play the story, some levels were better off just screwing around (silo, facility, Interrogation) the cheats were hard to unlock but not impossible, also there was enter codes in a button sequence to turning the cheats on and off was easier than unlocking them. Personnally I thought the multiplayer levels were fun and mildly amusing, not enough cool characters (face it nobody wants to be civilian 1) the guns were cool but the fact that you can find the golden gun in multiplayer was ridiculous, everybody get killed by the guy with the 1-hit-kill gun, yay. The game was fun but I prefferred the later released perfect Dark, that game was all like bond without the movie tied in, both are great and I highly recommend them.
