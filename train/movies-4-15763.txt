Set during the 19th century a few years after the Civil War, The Last Samurai tells the story of Captain Algren (Tom Cruise), a jaded, alcoholic Civil War veteran. He is sent to Japan in order to help train the new, modernized Japanese Army. But they are sent to battle prematurely against a group of revolters who cling to the old way of the Japanese soldier, the fully decked-out samurai. These revolters still commit seppuku, and they still follow the way of bushido, the samurai code. The samurai roll over the Emperor's Army, and Algren is captured during the battle, despite putting up a fierce resistance. Katsumoto, played wonderfully by Ken Watanabe, the leader of the samurai revolters, treats Algren with benevolence, and eventually, respect. When an improved Japanese Army comes a'callin, Algren must make a decision: whether to fight to certain death with the samurai, or finish what he originally came to Japan to do. The Last Samurai is beautifully shot and superbly acted all around. Tom Cruise hasn't been this good since Magnolia, and the Japanese actors are all excellent, as they usually are. The movie felt like five stars all the way until the ending, which is a superflous copout. It's still a fine movie however, a very enjoyable popcorn flick that remains lingering in your psyche the morning after.
