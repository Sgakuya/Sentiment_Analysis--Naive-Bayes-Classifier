As a european raised military brat (and proud of it!) it was quite the culture shock attending this small southern private baptist college. You have to be open-minded and willing to overlook the fact that they don't have much else besides the school there. Ever heard of Buies Creek? Close enough to Raleigh if you crave the nightlife. Beautiful campus, very friendly professors, mellow atmosphere, and in the process of expanding the school and athletics programs. The new president is trying hard to compete with the like of Wake Forest and Methodist. Fantastic PGM program, Law school, and Pharmacy program. Academics are good in undergrad programs, better in graduate. As with all schools, it is important to match your personality. Campbell is certainly not for everyone. I enjoy the discussions where it's mostly me against the rest, and most of the time it doesn't get personal (although I suspect I've had quite a few girls there pray for my soul...). Visit, talk to people, and if you decide to show up, don't let anyone rain on your parade!
