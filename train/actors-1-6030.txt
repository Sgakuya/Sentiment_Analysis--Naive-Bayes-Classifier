Tom Cruise is an egotistical, brainless, talentless buffoon. And I hold it very much against him that his participation in A Few Good Men kept me from being able to watch it. He's the only celebrity I can think of right off hand that I would punch in the nose if he passed me on a sidewalk. That is if I could swing that low. He also ruined Interview With The Vampire. I've hated him since I was a kid and being dragged to awful pieces of crap like All The Right Moves. I'd call him a one-dimensional actor, but I still haven't seen him get one dimension down yet. Mark my words...the moment Tom Cruise is no longer sexy to women, his career is absolutely over. He just can't act. I don't understand how someone with so little talent can go so far. Is the general movie-going public so superficial?
