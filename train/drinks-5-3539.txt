The White Russian is a perfect way to end a night of drinking. Sure, some may think it is a little too girly, creamy, sweet or whatever. I do not necessarily disagree with these sentiments. But at the very same time, it is refreshing, a nice way to cap off a night of drinking other various libations and it is strategically a good move to coat your stomach with milk for the long night of 'digesting' alcohol that will lie ahead. The ladies dig it when a guy drinks these also. It shows that he is comfortable enough with his masculinity to be drinking a potable choclate milk. So next time you are out at 2 am and wondering what to order next from your friendly barkeep, think about getting one of these fine mixed of vodka, milk and Kalhua.
