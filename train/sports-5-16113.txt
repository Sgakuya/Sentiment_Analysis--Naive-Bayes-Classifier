Mike vick can put the ball in the air or on the ground,everyone saw how he played in the miami game from the pocket and had an outstanding day.But when he runs he wins so he can do anything.He has stayed in the pocket alot and they have lost even with him being accurate.So all the criticizime he has been given i don't think he should pass more maybe Peyton Manning and Brette Farve should run more, but they don't have the talent.Even if Vick's passing rate isn't high, HE CAN WIN GAMES.He needs better wide recievers and he would be set.As far as his decision making goes he has gotten alot better and the fact that the wide outs SUCK could be a factor in his decisions(duh).Half of the mistakes aren't his falt.He is either throwing into the wind or the wide outs do not fight for the ball.He throws the ball where it needs to be thrown regardless of what you think.(you know who you are)The fact is they can get to it, instead of expecting to magically to go around the DB and fall into their hands. Watch the Miami game and he can pass from the pocket.The weather is always a huge factor since their a dome team,the cold doesn't suit them.Even if other dome teams do good in snow all human needs sre different.The fact is he MAKES PLAYS straight up and can bring the NFC to a win by dodging defenders.Talk about worse players like FARVE or Alex smith, Mcnabb maybe.
