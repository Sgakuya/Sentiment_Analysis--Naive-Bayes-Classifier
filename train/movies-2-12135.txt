Head Of State tells the story of a guy from the hood who was a nobody who is gonna be a somebody. Haven't we heard this before? YES! If you thought Pootie Tang was robbed of oscar nominations this year, then you had better get out there and see this film right now! Otherwise, you had better stay clear. Chris Rock plays a nobody (Oh...I've already told you!). Anyways, he and his buddy begin campaigning for president. He of course has some white competition, and some love interest on the way. Chris Rock is tediously bad in the film. He is energetic, but the material is so out of whack that is is almost scary. What ever happened to the guy who wrote the hilarious HBO specials that we once loved? His film Down To Earth in 2001 was a bomb among critics, but I loved his performance. He doesn't try here. However, we do get a spectacular supporting performance by Bernie Mac who steals every single scene in the entire film. Unfortunely, he is supporting, and isn't in every scene. Plus, the material just gets thinner and thinner. It's quite a predictible finale in the end, you won't be all that pleased with the film whatever way it goes. Head Of State could've been a better film had only Chris Rock taken better steps. Bernie Mac is a joy to watch, but is simply still a supporting performance. Head Of State delivers minimal laughs.
