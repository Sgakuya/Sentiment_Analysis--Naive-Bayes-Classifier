Unknown and alien president. Right up there with George Washington. Definitely in the top five. Polk was the best of the first termers. Why like him? Well, for one he is the only US president (and maybe only international president of a democracy) to keep ALL HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES--yes, ladies and gentlemen, ALL HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES! Quite a miracle... He wanted to 1) lower the tariff, 2) acquire Oregon, 3) acquire California, and 4) set up a loose national treasury system. In just four years (1844-1849) he did indeed lower the tariff, acquire Oregon through treaty with the British, acquire California plus ALL Mexican territory north of the Rio Grande in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), and revoted into power the Independent Treasury which was set up by Van Buren in 1837 but voted down in the early 1840's by the Whigs. Such served as a semi-stable and needed basis for national monetary needs before Wilson's Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created our modern banking system. Without Polk's Independent Treasury our government might well have suffered grievous economic problems that would have crippled the country. Added to his, Polk gave us a great campaign slogan--Fifty-four Fort or Fight! He virtually died for our country by being the hardest working president (12 hours PLUS a day). He died not long after leaving office in 1849 in his early fifties of overexhaustion. Also, a dedicated first-termer from day one--a brave fellow! Sad to see how so many on this page polk fun at him. Really a terrific man and a terrific influence on American history. Be grateful, America.
