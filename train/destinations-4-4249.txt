Ok, I lived in Dallas for seven years and complained about it for most of the time I was there. But, having lived in Atlanta, Houston and New Orleans (among others), I have to say that Dallas does have some very important things going for it. The shopping is really terrific, really, only behind NY or LA in the US. The people are amazingly attractive. They just seem to know how to make the best of what they have here. The people are VERY friendly-I've got lifelong friends here. Hardly saw a cowboy hat and no big white caddies with horns the whole time I lived here. And whoever said there are no young and hip people must have been under a rock because that is what Dallas is. Very hip and lots of parties, bars, clubs, restaurants. If you like dressing to the nines and seeing and being seen, this is your place. Downtown is developing its night life scene and uptown is packed with cool restaurants and clubs. It may be tree-less and hill-less (except for Lakewood, which is quite lovely), but it works what it has to the max. You don't even notice there are hardly any trees and no hills after a couple of weeks. And the arts have really taken off here. The museums are becoming better every year (Dallas Museum of Art, Fort Worth Museum of Modern Art, the Kimball) and the new Nasher Sculpture Center is amazing. I was constantly defending Dallas to all of my non-Dallas friends for years while secretly wondering if things were really better in their towns (Houston, NYC, LA) and now that I am no longer there, I actually miss it.
