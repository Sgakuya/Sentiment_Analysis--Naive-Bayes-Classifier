I went to college in Nashville - its a great college town!! There are a half a dozen or so universities here, specializing in everything from top-notch academic (Vanderbilt) to the artsy muscial prodigies (Belmont University). Its a great place for that age for dating (huge dating scene) and having fun. The weather is awesome - beautiful sunny skies and four distinct seasons and the rolling green hills are beautiful. However, I'm not sure I would move back there now that I am in the next stage of life. It seems like a great place to raise a family - Williamson County is a very safe, affluent area. But, if you're in that stage in between college and family, I'm not sure Nashville would be the best place to live.
