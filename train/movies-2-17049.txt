Gets two stars for the overwhelmingly gorgeous scenery, especially the Virginie Ledoyen part of the scenery. The movie itself sucked, I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters who were mostly despicable. The only good person in the whole movie who I cared about was the the hot french chick's boyfriend. He was a really cool guy, and she ditched him to shack up with Leo Dicaprio. Leo is good looking, and usually a pretty decent actor, but his character here was an arrogant jerk when he wasn't being a whiny little bitch. Stupid movie filled with the best looking and most hygienic hippies I've ever seen.
