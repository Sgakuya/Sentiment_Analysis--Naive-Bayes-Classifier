Okay, to all the people who say the lakers bought a championship are wrong. karl malone and gary payton are the ones who wanted to come to the lakers. and somehow kobe committed rape but the other 3 guys the girl slept with that week didnt? especially since shes known to be a slut? i used to live in colorado and believe me, it's pretty racist there. and don't forget about the 3 and 5 second in the key rules for the nba. shaq steps out of the key and that resets it. and also i think if your in a foot within a player its not a 3 seconds in the key foul. anyway look at the facts. this team is unstoppable right now defensively and especially offensively with kobe who should be one of the leading MVP candidates right now with his play of late. look for the fourth ring this year.
