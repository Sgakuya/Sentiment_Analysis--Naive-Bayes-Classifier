I'm so sick of reading some of these comments. I have worked at a Wendy's in New Jersey since April, and although I don't like it, I don't hate it either. Everything is always clean, and we try to get the food out as fast as possible, but it can be hard sometimes when stupid customers change their orders, or have no freakin' clue what they want. It isn't always our fault, so get over that aspect. As for the burgers being greasy, think about the time that you go. If it's busy, we only have so much time to squeeze out the grease before we have to get more meat for about 13 other sandwiches within a one minute time period. And remember, one bad experience at one Wendy's in all of America shouldn't cause you to stereotype every Wendy's in the rest of the United States. It's thinking like this that annoys me... people have to stop being so narrow-minded.
