Oregon is so beautiful. It has the most dramatic and scenic coastline I've ever seen. The area around Florence has jaw dropping scenery around every bend with high rocky cliffs, lighthouses, thick evergreen forsest and pounding Pacific Surf. It's the perfect place to sit on the beach for hours or til sunset and just think about nothing. Anyone who is tired of stress or become too jaded should visit here. Oregon also has Mt Hood which has that perfect cone shaped mountain peak within site of Portland. Portland is a great little city with a walkable and inviting downtown, nice archetecture and awesome parks. I give it 4 stars, would rate 5 but the economy is in the toilet and too many rednecks in certain areas. Otherwise it's totally cut out for living.
