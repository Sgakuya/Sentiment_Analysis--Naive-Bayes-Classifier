I have been a Sear's customer since 1951.I have never ever did Sear's wrong in anyway, and TRUSTED them. Today I get a my bill and I last owed $174.00 and found that I had been slapped with a $39.00 late charge. Went thru this entire house and can not find any billing for the month of August and the last payement I made was July. Who is to blame.Post Office or Sear's?My mails is home delivered, and I know I did not get a bill. So I have decided to return my Credit Card to Sear's and they can keep their stores, and their products as $39.00 is plain robbery without a gun.Especially when I paid my bill without fail before this incident.. Since K-Mart got their hands on Sear's, its been going down hill, and I have now decided I do need to ever buy from them again.Just fed up with their stuff, especially when I found some $1300 plus dollars of purchaes on my bill that I did not make , and I did get that squared away but they made me feel like a criminal to do so.. I have vented here as I can't find the damm Corporate address, as I would vent to the CEO ,and do so with passion
