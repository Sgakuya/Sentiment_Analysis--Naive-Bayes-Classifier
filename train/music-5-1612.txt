What can I say? I know what I like. And not only did I like this CD, I loved it. Amazing vocals from Amy Lee, incredible rhythmic beats and instrumentals. I found myself thinking if I had a band I'd do anything to sound like this. Purely out of curiousity did I listen to this CD which actually belongs to my sister. But after listening to it I might as well buy one for myself or she might never get it back. I liked every single song except for one. That's not bad at all considering it has eleven songs. That one tiny flaw aside, this is an excellent CD that I would recommend to anyone who likes originality and wants to get away from the 'pop' music.
