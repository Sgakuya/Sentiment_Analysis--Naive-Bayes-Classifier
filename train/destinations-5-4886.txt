I just returned from a month in Ecuador, and this was one of my favorite cities. It reminded me of Aspen or Vail or some other little Colorado mountain town, minus the snow. Overlooking the town is the massive Tungurahua volcano, which erupted as recently as 1999, forcing the evacuation of the town. But the volcanic activity seems to have settled down these days, although of course the famous thermal baths that give the city its name are still going strong. Banos is pretty touristy, with lots of gringos wandering around, but there's a reason: it's a great place, where you can hike, ride horses, mountain bike, and much more.
