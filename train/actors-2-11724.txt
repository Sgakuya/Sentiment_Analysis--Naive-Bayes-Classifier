I laugh at all the posts about what a "kind and generous person she is..." as if these people have met her. As for her sex appeal, that's funny too because all I see is a woman trying way to hard to be sexy, with her bizarre, cocky posturing in every film. She is essentially the same character in every film...the "oh, look at me, I am an arrogant bitch trying to pout for the camera, all the while pretending to be oblivious to how calculating I am." Blah, blah, blah. Again, never met the woman, this is just how she comes across to me. There is something incredibly skanky about her despite the image she tries to project.
