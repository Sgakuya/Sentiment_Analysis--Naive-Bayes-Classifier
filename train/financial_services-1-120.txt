I did not have a good experience with Wells Fargo. I went to apply, but it is only allowed online. Something was wrong with their internet at the time because it would erase it every time I went to submit my application and resume. I called the bank and I left a message for their manager to call me back to see how else I could apply. It took him a few days just to call me back. He said to come on down and fill out a paper and then he would fax it and then I would get a call to give a regional manager information and then they would submit my resume. The regional manager didn't even call me. I called the bank about a week later and said that I wasn't qualified enough. It made me feel bad because I wasn't even done with the application and they wouldn't even let me finish it because they decided beforehand that they didn't want me.
