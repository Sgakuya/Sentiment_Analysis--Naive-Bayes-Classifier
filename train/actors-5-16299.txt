Maurice Benard makes the writing believable- that's what a GOOD actor does. We see Sonny as a brilliant businessman, a loyal friend, a loving father, a supportive husband, an imperfect son, a proctive brother, a formidable enemy, and a hot lover--all of whom have a career as a mob boss. Could a man who cooks for his wife and tenderly reassures her of his love order a hit moments later? Could a man with a mind like a super-computer have a killer (no pun intended) smile ? Could a man who can never let his guard down give his heart to a child of a man he despises ? Could we actually LIKE and root for an underworld figure ? Maurice Benard makes Sonny human. We are all a combination of good and bad, anger and laughter, and a miriad of traits we are forever trying to balance in our own lives. We relate to Sonny and love him because of the brilliantly underplayed performances by Mr. Benard. He and Tamara Braun click. You actually believe they are talking to each other, not the camera. I have only watched General Hospital for about eight months, but I became hooked just from seeing a preview of an upcoming episode. Maurice Benard has a presence on the screen that is mesmerizing-- and he gives that to Sonny. Thank you Maurice, for the pleasure you bring to millions of viewers. You are absolutely the BEST.
