I'm going to Valdosta U in GA. Your courses get called off too many times. I don't know how those 52 admirals and generals yu all brag about ever got a UMUC degree since your courses get called off so often. Oh yeah, I wasn't too crazy about the quality of your professors. UMUC was much better 3 or 4 year ago, but those people have moved on to better lives, better jobs, or whatever. My last UMUC course did not meet the course description and goals, and it was a second choice bcause the first choice got called off. I don't want to take your DE courses, and don't like being pushed in that direction. See you in Valdosta! My friends say it's pretty good there. Steve, Germany.
