Now here was someone who could really act,a theatrical knight with a hugely impressive range of screen credits.Not always the most magnetic presence,perhaps,but his integrity was enormous:reflective and authoritative,content to slip quietly into the skin of less dramatic parts when required.Yet at times he could be mesmerising,a master of disguise and versatility- in Kind Hearts and Coronets(the finest,most elegant British comedy,in which he played 8 central roles!),as Fagin in Oliver Twist,(only 2 years after his break as Pip's cheery,slight young friend in Great Expectations,a colossal leap),as obsessively upright Colonel Nicholson in Bridge on the River Kwai,a mild-mannered bank-clerk turned scheming robber in The Lavender Hill Mob,a dignified Arab King in Lawrence of Arabia.He added gravitas,depth and (as Lorie's reminded me)soul to Star Wars,coming to the attention of a new generation unfamiliar with the brilliance of his earlier career.Unequivocally one of the all-time greats.
