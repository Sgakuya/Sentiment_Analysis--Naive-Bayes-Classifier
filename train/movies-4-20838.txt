This film was a visual splendour..excellent set-design, make-up and costumes. The dancing and the choreography were really well done. Most of the acting was very good, but I did have problems with Richard Gere. He played his part without any problem but during the musical numbers, I just didn't buy him. His gestures seemed forced and out of place and it distracted me. I thought Catherine Zeta Jones was fabulous as Velma, she had that perfect vampy, bithcy thing going. The two standout numbers in the film for me were the Cell Block Tango, and Mama's good to you (or something like that. Queen Latifah was so perfect in that number, she just blew me away. She owned that stage and really surprised me with her acting ability and the power of her voice. One problem that I had with the film was the at times the musical numbers seemed disjointed from the plot. They were always in different settings, and I think they could have been interwoven more effectively
