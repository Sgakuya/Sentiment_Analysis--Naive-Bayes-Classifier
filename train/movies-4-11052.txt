I rented this not too long ago--it was just another silly teen-movie loaded with sexual humor, but it was pretty funny still. A recent graduate has a crappy start to his summer: he gets dumped by his girlfriend in the worst way, and then his online pen pal starts hitting on him, and he gets weirded out and tells him to never talk to him again. Then, to top it off, he realizes that, about his penpal, he is actually a really attractive she, and he just completely blew it. Solution: Go to Germany and proclaim his love (?) for her. With the help of a few friends, he crosses all over Europe in the hopes that he'll get the girl in the end. There's a lot of stupid childish humor here, but hey, it's supposed to, and it's at least kinda funny.
