As Secretary of State in the Clinton administration, Madeline Albright was a proponent of using American power to engage in wars for soft humanitarian purposes rather than using realpolitik. Reality is that the Republican and Democratic approaches to foreign policy making varies very little. Democrats give lip service to the naive strategy of collective security and Republicans give creedence to foolhardy policies of unilateralism. Albright believed that getting involved in wars in such far-flung places like Kosovo would ultimately aid in American interests. The severe overextension of American troops abroad began under her and Clintons watch. While they do have good intentions, that is not good enough. You have to be right every once in a while. Her acolytes claim that she promoted an active US foreign policy, but I would consider it half-handed and intellectually flimsy. Like most of our leaders, she failed to grasp the meaning of American power and our mandate at the end of the Cold War.
