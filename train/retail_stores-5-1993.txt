I have always been a fan of Best Buy. Great prices, friendly employees, and a great selection have always been part of my Best Buy experience. I recently got a job at Store #40 in Eau Claire, and I feel that the misconceptions about the employees are rather insane. We don't work on commission, we make a respectable wage, and every one of my coworkers that I know, as well as myself, love our job. I can tell you that Best Buy is going through a lot of changes, including getting more knowledgeable employees. I apolgise to all those who have had a bad experience at Best Buy, as it was not our intention. For those of you who still shop there, even though I'm only a Media Product Specialist, we do appreciate your business. And no, the company is not making me do this, I do this on my own accord. I'm just a satisfied customer turned employee.
