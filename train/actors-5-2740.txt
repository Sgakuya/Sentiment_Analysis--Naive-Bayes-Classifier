Definitely one of my top five picks for best actor over the last ten years. I've always admired his work and respected him as a performer, but I never took a close look at his ablilites until I saw him in Pay It Forward. I was on the edge of my seat. I was especially enthralled with the scene where he was explaining his burns to Helen Hunt's character. I think I could watch that performance a thousand times and never lose interest. I would've never believed he was capable of so much by his limited role in The Ref. I'm very glad he got his big break and has been recognized by all for his talents. I love everything he has done and wish him a lifetime of success. I love him. He's one of a kind.
