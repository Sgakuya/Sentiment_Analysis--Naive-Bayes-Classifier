This game would have had another star but Quake 3 is better I think. However, I played Q2 for a long time. Some coworkers and I would play it during lunch at work, and sometimes after work. It rocked. It's so much better if you play multiplayer over a network or the internet. Single player is too easy. We even added the WOD (weapons of destruction) pack, which gave us a flamethrower (a riot watching someone's head on fire and hearing them yell ow.. ow... uhh, ow.. LOL), a guided rocket, and (my personal fav) the cataclysm grenade. We also downloaded different maps to play in (the giant kitchen was my fav). Quake 2 is an awesome game.
