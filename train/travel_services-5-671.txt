I usually always rent from AVIS, especially when I go down to Florida to visit family. Avis is a little more expensive most of the time, but the time you save not waiting in line at the counter and walking straight to your car at the airport seems worth the extra money. Also, the times that I have returned the car, it is so organized, especially in Tampa and Orlando.... you follow the signs into the Avis area in the airport garage, the attendants check your car in as you are getting out. It honestly takes about 5 minutes... Once I even left some keys in the car and they fed-exed them back to me in New York the next day. I haven't had any problems with extra charges... JUST FYI, you normally don't need any extra insurance... if you have car insurance on a personal car, it sometimes covers a rental car, ALSO your credit card company automatically (most of the time) covers rental car insurance...
