The last time they let this guy have a major league team(1994), Alou had them killing the Braves in their division. Given the poor state of affairs involving the Expos, the strike of '94 may have robbed Alou of his only real chance at a ring. I respect the hell out of his loyalty. He could have left, but he has stood by the team that gave him a shot when no one else would. He certainly gets more out of the AAA teams they set him up with then any other manager could, with the possible exception of Dusty Baker. I can't ever recall thinking what a stupid decision when watching Alou manage a game. I can't say that of any other manager.
