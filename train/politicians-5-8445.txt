The best President in America's history. Our economy was in a recession and he turned it into a roaring one in the mid eighties. He had a foreign policy that made us a country to be reckoned with around the world, unlike the pacifistic idiots Jimmy Carter made us. With his trickle down theory, he turned our economy around for the better, and it worked. Big business is the success behind any capitalistic economy. Poor people do not work for other poor people. Big business makes small business possible and provides the American people with jobs. Reagan recognized this, and made it work for the American economy. Democrats just put him down, b/c they're ignorant and can't fork out anyone that can come anywhere close to his intelligence and leadership skills. He came through for us with the Iranian Hostage Crisis, and put an end to the Soviet Union. Review your facts, and change your ignorant views. Ronald Wilson Reagan was an amazing President,kept America as the most powerful nation in the world, and will be looked at favorably for generations to come.
