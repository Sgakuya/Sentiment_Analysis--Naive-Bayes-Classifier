I lived in Denver for about six mos. in '89. I hate cold weather, and it is the only cold weather location I've considered moving to. The people were friendly (sometimes very wierd -- due to the elavation I guess), the bars closed early, but strangers always invited us into their homes for parties (coming from the South this was very odd and hard to get used to at first cause I'm a black guy and there are few blacks in Denver or Colorado for that matter). It is such a beautiful state. The train ride west from Denver (esp. in the winter) is one of the most beautiful things you can experience. Denver, Colorado will always hold a very special place in my heart. If you like cold weather and are in good health (you've got to be in good health to take the altitude), this may be your spot. I'd give it a five if I didn't dislike the cold so much. I saw more cold, snow and ice before Thanksgiving than I've seen in my life.
