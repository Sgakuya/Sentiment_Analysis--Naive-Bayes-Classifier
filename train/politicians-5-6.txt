GoneAway really nailed it in her review of Princess Diana. She had a hard and sad life, and I felt very sorry for her. I think part of the reason she was resented by the Royal Family is because they could see she outclassed them in so many ways. Yes, she did cheat on Prince Charles, but he was running around with that ole hag Camilla. So it's hard to blame her for seeking love and affection wherever she could. She came from a very aristocratic background, but she seemed to empathize with those who were infirm or otherwise unfortunate. I really cried when she died, not only because I felt so sorry for her sons losing their beloved mother,but because I really ached for Princess Diana. She was such a lovely person and she deserved better than she got.
