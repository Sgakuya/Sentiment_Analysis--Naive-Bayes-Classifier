This is one of the best SUVs I've ever driven! It's got loads of interior room, great instrument layout, economical to drive, good power, doesn't drive like a truck and best of all...its a Toyota, which means the best reliability in the industry. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for an SUV that is as comfortable to drive on extended trips as a luxery sedan, but still has the capabilty to get you thru any type of winter driving. As far as the idiot that gave it a 1 star...there's a good reason why his dealer didn't have one (its called they can't keep 'em on the lot ) to show him. But why would you rate something down when you didn't even have a chance to drive one???
