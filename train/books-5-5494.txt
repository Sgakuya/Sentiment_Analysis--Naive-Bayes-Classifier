Now this is a story with heart. Wowie what a story. I work for walmart and reading a story that has my workplace all over what really drawned me into reading the book. The book is a whole lot better than the movie and the only wish was that the movie had a charecter who played SAM WALTON. To me SISTER was the greatest charecter. SHe has humility and always asking forgiveness which you will have to find out if you decide to read this book. Trust me, you will not want to miss this reading. HA! I am even cracking up thinking about what she has done while I type this out. This story will warmth your heart and fill you with lots of love to come. PLEASE READ THE BOOK!
