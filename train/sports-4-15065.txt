To the person who does not think O.J. killed anyone, I guess al the evidence implicating him and no one else does not matter. As far as him finding the person or persons responsible for the tragic deaths of two young people, I beleive he need not look any farther than himself, and IF he in fact did not commit these murders, I do not beleive he will find anyone responsible on any golf course, and I have seen no action on his part that he is even looking. Maybe he is, and if so then I am wrong. Also. this is just my opinion, but I feel if the jury had not been stacked with black people, and had been held in a different location, I beleive he would have been, and should have been found guilty in the 1st trial.Remember this is just one persons opinion. By the way, I was a big fan of O.J. ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD. He was awesome and he ruined it all.
