I love our local Kmart! It's always been a good store but with a new manager, it's even better. They've removed clutter from the aisles, keep everything spotlessly clean and have made displays more attractive. The Martha Stewart and Jaclyn Smith brands are great quality for the money; the shoe department is excellent! Wal-Mart goods may be cheaper but they're definitely cheap in quality. Wal-Mart clothes and bedding/towels are HORRIBLE -- they unravel, shrink, and become otherwise useless after just a few washings. The clothing and domestics I buy at Kmart last a LONG time. I would be very sad if Kmart went out-of-business.
