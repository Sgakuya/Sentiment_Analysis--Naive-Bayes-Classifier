Busch Gardens had advertised itself as being rated the most beautiful amusement park in the world . . . and rightfully so. The natural beauty surrounding the park is breathtaking--very little of the natural surroundings were disturbed in installing the five roller coasters and other attractions they feature. As far as the roller coasters go, they are few in number, but they are incredible--the Loch Ness Monster takes you through the forest, over the lake, into a cave, upside-down and all over the place; Apollo's Chariot's first drop is a HUGE rush! Those over the age of 21 can sign up for a Beer class , where they teach you how they make beer and have samples for those who want it. There is a wonderful children's area, with friendly-looking dragons and all sorts of things to play with that make me wish I were young again! The food is great, the staff is friendly, the admission prices are fair. This park truly has something for everyone!
