This is a fun game. Watch the wheel spin round and round, the dealers must get a headache. It can be fun to throw a few chips down on the table, cover 2 or 4 numbers with one chip, and you've got a decent shot at hitting some small amount. My buddy and I thought we cracked the system, and would bet on red or black, keeping our winnings separate and doubling our bet every time we lost, until finally we won and would break even. Now, this is great if the opposite color doesn't hit more than, say, 5 or 6 times in a row, and you have enough money to cover your loss. We walked out with a few hundred $'s several times out in Atlantic City, until one time when red hit about 15 times in a row and we lost a few grand.
