Customer service has to be by far the worst of the cell phone companies in town. I thought it might just be our location that was bad, but we've visited two other sprint stores that were both over 200 miles away from where I live and it was the same crappy service. Their website account manager is a joke, and you often get charged for things that you never asked for and can never get those features removed from your account. We have had many many many terrible experiences with SprintPCS on each of our 6 accounts with them. Yes I know that is a lot of accounts for a person that is unhappy with them, but the one thing that I'll say for Sprint is that their plans can't be beat IF you call a lot of other people that have SprintPCS. That's they only way I could rationalize giving them a 2nd star.
