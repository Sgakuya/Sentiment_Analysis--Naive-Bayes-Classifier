I was very disappointed in Meet The Parents (released in 2000 and directed by Jay Roach). Ben Stiller plays male nurse Greg Focker who is off to visit his girlfriend Pam's parents for the first time. Every guy's worst nightmare comes to fruition as Pam's dad Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) obviously does not like Focker, a situation only exacerbated by one disaster after another (eg a lost cat, flooded toilet, and a fire). Stiller comes in with his usual flare and De Niro is exceptional, but something does not really click, whether it is chemistry or the script. Moreover, some of the gags and disasters are played out far too long (eg the cat). One often-overlooked highlight is Owen Wilson as Pam's perfect ex-boyfriend. The bottom line is that Meet The Parents should have been better and must suffer in the rating when compared to the better films on this list.
