Mr.Torre, I have been a Yankee fan since 1960, after the Yankees lost the World Series to the Pirates. I am 51 years old, have played baseball in high school! I even pitched a no-hitter once! My real love has been the yankees like most yankees fan Mickey Mantle. You must have a million opinions on chucks 2B problems of course I have mine! I felt that chucks problem would be taken care of with a couple of weeks at third base; the reasons are the ball gets to you quicker Chuck would have the time to locate the first baseman he would have to use more arm. Thank you for your time; I think your strength is your integrity; knowing your players. Having spent 20 years in the military I know how important that is. ( one for the thumb in 2000 one) Sinerely Glenn
