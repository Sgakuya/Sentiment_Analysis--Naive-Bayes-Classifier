I do not own this car. However when Buick introduced the Lacrosse I was working for them, so I got to drive probably 100 of them. My quick overall opinion.... do not buy this car unless you can get the CXS. I am a man of performance and luxury. I like a car that might have a hint of performance but mainly looks like a luxury sedan, until you sit behind the wheel and get her going. Like the Cadillac Deville or Park Avenue Ultra ( which I own ). Buick offers three models for the Lacrosse: CX- The lowest end model, I hated driving them. But if you cannot afford the CXL which offers the same un-powerful engine... but more luxury. Then go with the CX. CXL- This one I feel is the CXS without the sport performance and engine. CXS- The 240 Horse Masterpiece. This car has quick 0-60 power, however it lacks in torque and you can feel it when its time to hit a hill. Unlike the Park Avenue Ultra which has 280LB of torque. However it offers all the nice luxury features. The road handling is amazing, it feels like a small sports sedan but you can comfortably sit in this car. I am 6'1" and I fit just fine. The sound system will blow you away. The Lacross replaced the Regal and the Century. Both of which were outdated and needed replacing. The Lacrosse was the PERFECT replacement. I recommend it to anyone who cannot afford the new Lucerne.
