We are lucky in America to have a President, in these morally troubled times, who knows the meaning of the phrase, Doing the Right Thing for the Right Reasons. It is to our country's benefit that we have a President who is: 1) willing to appoint extraordinary people to offer an intelligent blend of expertise and experience to each decision he will be making as the leader of our country, and 2) willing to allow each to receive credit for their help in making this country great. Most often, men of power do not have the fortitude or ego to allow others to be so recognized. AND....with parents like his, who could go wrong? :-)
