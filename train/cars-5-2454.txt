It is kind of hard to compare the supra to some of the other cars on the list but it definantly can hold its own. The 2JZ engine is a VERY solid engine and is capable of great things. Its easier to get upwards of 450hp out of this engine than it is for some V-8's. The stock internals of this engine are more than capable of handling extreme power and this car truly is a sports car in its own right because of the fact that for A LOT less money than a conventional sports car you can have your own V-8 killer that can get some serious looks. I'd take a twin turbo Mk IV over a Corvette or Camaro any day of the week!
