We have a chemistry problem - and that chemistry problem is, when you put us on the basketball court together, we explode. Any Heel heads out there hear that Mike Jarvis idiot? Jesus, what the hell does the guy that coached St. Johns know about chemistry? He wouldn't know chemistry if RON ARTEST slapped him in the face. I think analyst underestimate Roy. I emphasize 'maybe', we MAYBE had a chemistry problem last year. I think it is impossible coach Williams doesn't pull this squad together, after a full season of learning the system. Chemistry? They talk about us like we're UNLV or Cincy or somebody! We obey coach - we dominate- PERIOD! HELLOOOOO!- It's not a matter of chemistry, it's a matter of DEFENSE! We had a sizeable lead at one point in every game we lost last season. CHRIST, WE COULD HAVE BEEN UNDEFEATED LAST YEAR! If you idiots out there think that won't be different this year with Marvin Williams, Quentin Thomas, and a fresh understanding of what Roy wants, you simply don't comprehend the game! Roy is truly bing underestimated at this point. Heel fans, has the realization truly hit you yet that we have ROY WILLIAMS? This ain't Bob Huggins. This ain't Pete Gillen. We'll be okay,trust me. RELAX! - 4 studs signed letters of intent on Wednesday alone! ROY WILL MAKE CHEMISTRY! RELAX.
