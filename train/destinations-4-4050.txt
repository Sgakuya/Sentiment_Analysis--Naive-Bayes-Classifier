Tucson is a pleasant city that has some very nice things going for it. It's perched in a valley surrounded by high mountains, and as a result doesn't get the ridiculous heat extremes of Phoenix nor the sudden cold snaps of Flagstaff - it's just pleasant, almost every day. It's also a much more genuine looking city than Phoenix, as the people there recognize that they are not in Wisconsin; the houses are adobe and the lawns have desert flowers and cacti. The biggest knocks against Tucson are that, outside the U of A, there isn't a lot going on culturally. Also, it's pretty isolated geographically - even the Grand Canyon, in the same state, is a five hour drive from Tucson.
