What makes a football player one for the ages? When they change the way the game is played because of him, then you've gotten there. Lawrence Taylor redefined the way defense is played in pro football. Teams were forced to completely restructure their offenses to deal with him. Do you run away from him? No, he's too fast and pursued better than any linebacker in the history of the game. Throw the ball - better make it quick - he's as fast to the quarterback as anyone who has been on that side of the ball. Go right at him. Watch him rip the blockers away and make the tackle. All that said, however, the man was and is a jerk. But, it'll be a long time before they make another defender like him.
