I've never experienced worse customer service !!! I hired 2SM to p/u a piano in Sudbury, Ont and deliver it to Kitchener, Ont. (about a 5.5 hr drive) Firstly, I had a terrible time getting a return phone call after having left at least 4 voice messages over several days(can you never get a live person ??)(and this was to GIVE them my business !!!) Finally I tried to get them to respond via an email linked from their website....no response. I decided to call and pretend to be a whole new customer....that seemed to have worked for the initial stage. Next, the estimator didn't call after my leaving a few messages for him. I started over and was finally hooked up with a Sales person (about 2.5 weeks after my first attempt to contact their company to give them my business). He gave me the price...originally I was given a figure that was much less than what the Salesperson was quoting, but still not a bad price.... I had a time constraint which they said they could accomodate, and was asked to chose a week in which I would like the piano picked up. I was told that the drivers would call the p/u location when they were getting close to Sudbury.. I was getting a little concerned because they hadn't p/u up yet and the week was almost through. I was assured they would p/u within the week I had specified. They never did show up in that week, and they never did call the pickup location to let them know they were going to be late. They didn't call (as promised) to tell the pick up location that they were nearing the pick up city. I had to call and enquire about the piano and was told I was rude and unreasonable when I expressed my disappointment with 2SM moving company for being late after I was told they could accomodate my timeframe and even after I checked when the week was almost over. On top of that, when the guys were moving the piano out of the house in Sudbury, they split some wood off of one of the legs (this piano is going to be 100 yrs old soon ! - so you can imagine how that would concern me). The two guys didn't seem concerned about the damage at all ! I was left on hold, ignored, belittled, didn't have my calls answered for up to two days, after leaving messages for both the Dispatcher and Sales person in the Toronto office. Finally I was told that the piano would be delivered on Sunday btwn 6 and 8 pm....you guessed it...the piano never showed. Again I tried for 2 days to get someone to speak to me about the situation. The piano was promised to be at my home finally on the Wednesday. The crew did show up and just a little after the promised time...one of them used my washroom (he must've been in there a good 5 minutes - started to make me nervous), another of them walked around the perimeter of my home for no apparent reason (I didn't like that either). The third guy kept me busy reading and signing. They brought the piano in and placed it in the location I requested. They all left at once and I thought the main guy was going to come back in with some information or a claim form etc...no...they got in the truck and left. No Thank You, No Good Bye, No Have a Nice Day...just a slam of my front door. PLEASE !! TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW, NOT TO USE 2 SMALL MEN WITH BIG HEARTS FOR THEIR MOVING NEEDS !!
