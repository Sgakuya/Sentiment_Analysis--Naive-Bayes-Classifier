Funny - there has been a lot of criticism of Americana culture on this Destinations section, but the bottom-line is simple - for vacations/holidays the US offers it all - deserts, beaches, mountains, rivers, cities, farms, infrastructure, cheap hotels, luxourious hotels, cheap cars, good maps, etc. I live in an exciting 3rd World country, but I love to take vacations in the US because THE US HAS EVERYTHING - from Disney to NY to Georgian plains to Rocky Mountains; Vegas and the Canyon; you could spend years just dicovering this country (and all those snotty Euro-pseudo-intellectuals should hop on a plane and discover how nice life can be for those who don't lose 55% of their salaries on taxes!!).
