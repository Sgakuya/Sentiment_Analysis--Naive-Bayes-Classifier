Chambers during his best years '86-'91 was unstoppable offensively. A 6'10 forward who had afterburners on the fast break, could score with either hand, shoot from outside, take it to the basket for an acrobatic power dunk, and convert 80% of his free throws. He was the prototype for today's high-flying big men. His main weaknesses were his rebounding and shot-blocking, always seeming to be focused on his offensive positioning and readiness. Often overshadowed in his era by Bird, Worthy, and Karl Malone and by playing in small media markets (Seattle & Phoenix). Definitely an underrated superstar of the 80's and early 90's.
