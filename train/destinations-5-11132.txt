I am surprised at these low ratings. Have these people been to Ocean City, Maryland? Granted, I enjoy Rehoboth Beach for it's quiet charm and peacefullness. However, surprisingly, Ocean City has a similar charm. Sure there are a ton of souvenir shops, games etc..that suck the money out of your wallet. Hey, that's what vacation is all about. If you are simply going to the beach, it is a great area..clean, watchful lifeguards, etc...If you are with your kids and decide to venture to the Boardwalk..keep your budget in mind. Between lunch, rides, games and trinkets you can drop at least $100 in a couple of hours. However, it is fun, surprisingly clean and an overall FUN time. Don't miss the Thrasher's fries (with plenty of vinegar), a trip through the Haunted House or a stop in the picture booth..there is nothing like one of those sets of black and white photos of as many people as possible stuffed in that little booth to remember your day at the beach.
