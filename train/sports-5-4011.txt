If it wasn't for Dean- well, nevermind......just read 'The Carolina Way', and you will see why he is the best. Hey , Spain's coach , another thing Dean would never do is not shake hands after a game. NEVER! No matter what the beef ( and plenty of coaches disliked him ), he would literally follow a coach until that coach shook hands. Furthermore , he ALWAYS called timeouts towards the end of decided games , but not to disgrace the other team.......to get reserves in , use mop-up time as practice , etc. What nerve to mention The Dean , when he wouldn't even shake Brown's hand ! If you played a game against Carolina , Dean would shake hands afterward if you had the ebola virus. )))))))))))))))))))))))))UPDATE. Ludicrous notion that his assistants got recruited all the players. Being NORTH CAROLINA recruited all the players. 80% of the guys we get dreamed of being a Tarheel their whole lives. READ UP. And being the school where Jordan went didn't hurt. Although, I will say that it's a documented fact that Smith flew to Philly to meet with 'Sheed 3hrs after the '93 championship buzzer sounded. So, he did some recruiting. Furthermore, what great coach hasn't had great players. And no matter what anybody thinks of him, he gets a 5 from me for breaking the basketball color barrier in the state of North Carolina. They told Scott to exit the restaurant, Smith said, then I go too. to make a long story short. 5 just for that. Another 5 for following Rick Barnes (current Texas coach) around for 2 weeks after Barnes wouldn't shake his hand after a Clemson beatdown. He eventually got his handshake in the office of the head of the ACC.
