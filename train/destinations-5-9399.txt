I wouldn't normally think of a bridge as a great tourist attraction, but the Charles Bridge is special. I took a walking tour of Prague led by a Czech guide, who said the bridge was built in 1357. 1357? Can you imagine that? This bridge was standing there over a hundred years before the New World was even discovered! Anyway, the bridge itself is architecturally cool, and there are interesting statues lining the guard rails on both sides. On one side of the bridge is the old town square, and Prague Castle is on the other side. At all times the bridge is packed with tourists and vendors selling art, jewelry, etc. If you visit Prague, I'm sure you'll end up walking across this bridge anyway, but if for some reason you don't have plans to be in the area, it's definitely worth a side trip.
