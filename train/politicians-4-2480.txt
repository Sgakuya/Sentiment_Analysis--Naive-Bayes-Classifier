Sure, his affair was a mess-up. He looks very weathered now because of that and all that's been going on. But we all know how much Rudy has swept up NYC and I think he's done a better job of being the friendly people-person politician than Dubya Bush. I took a tour of NBC studios a few years back and he was guest starring on SNL at the time- I saw him in person through a window. I didn't realize how cool that was until more and more I started to see him in the papers and I started to respect him. He's prevailed through some tough times- the whole encephalitis ordeal, the crazy election (although it may not have affected NY very directly, it affected us all), and of course the World Trade Center terrorism. I'm not much on politics, but I know enough to respect you, Rudy.
