When in Bangkok, you have to check out Khao San Road. At night, it turns into a pedestrian only, people watching heaven. It's very mixed - thais and backpackers from all over stroll down the street, checking each other out. Hippy kids sell art on the sides of the street, and street vendors sell all kinds of snacks. There are bars and cafes along the way with music blaring. What I recommend is to pick up a 40 at one of the little groceries that line the road, and just stroll the length of the road and back taking it all in. Very cool - reminded me very much of Bourbon Street, but with less ugly drunkeness, and much more diversity.
