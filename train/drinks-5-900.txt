Different moods and different settings call for different beers. Heineken used to be a beer to drink at a wedding reception or out with the parents for dinner. Lately, it has become the 6 pack that is in my fridge or the beer that I am looking for when I step up to the bar to place an order.It is light, gets really cold and has a nice taste to it. I suppose it can be comsidered to have a hint of a 'skunky' taste to it, but that is pretty commomn for a lot of imported beers. One thing that I regret about a past trip to Europe is that while in Amsterdam, I failed to go on the Heinken brerwery tour. I have heard rumors, and this may just be people talking - so do not hop the next plane to Holland based on this, that the brewery provides tourists with an unlimited suppply of beer at the end of the tour.
