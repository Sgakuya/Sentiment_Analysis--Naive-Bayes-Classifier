AVOID ESURANCE / ESURANCE COMPLAINTS / ESURANCE SUCKS I am a former claims employee of Esurance. Horrible claims service. horribe / bad insurance = Esurance - rips off customers with shady practices. The Esurance claims adjusters are given 3-5x more claims than other companies. NO time to investigate liability / contact witnesses. Little effort to attempt to collect owed deductibles (no time) no agent to help with claims issues or to help policy holder choose which coverages to buy. esurance under investigation for bad faith in several states for bait and switch as they raise premiums after first month when they run customers credit report. Also bad faith on rental coverage they do not pay what they owe. DO NOT GET RIPPED OFF BY ESURANCE. I HEARD THE COMPLAINTS ALL DAY LONG ON MY PHONE - BAIT AND SWITCH, POOR SERVICE, POOR QUALITY. THEY ALSO TREAT EMPLOYEES HORRIBLY - ESURANCE HAS WORST TURNOVER IN INSURANCE INDUSTRY - DO NOT BUY IT AND DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT WORKING THERE!!!
