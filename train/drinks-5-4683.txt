I'm surprised the Coca Cola has the edge over Pepsi. I prefer Coca Cola because it tastes less sweet than Pepsi (I drink the diet variety) and it seems to have more fizz. So here's the million dollar question: why is it that I am not offered a choice in restaurants? Why is it that I must pick between Coca Cola and Pepsi? Answer, the devious games that the distributors play. Pepsi is winning the distributor war - in case you Coke enthusiasts have not noticed. That means that over 50% of Coke's potential customer's are going unsatisfied because purchasing one isn't an option at certain restaurants. ADVICE TO COKE: instead of trying to copy Pepsi's taste to win a larger market share - get back your market by positioning yourself as the fair manufacturer of sodas. We're so confident in our product...hey Pepsi, let the customer decide. Push for restaurants to carry both. Obviously (by this survey) they are not interchangeable.
