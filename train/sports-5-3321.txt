The fun of rating baseball figures is that you can play so many games with the statistics. The same number can be bandied to and fro in both a pro and con argument about a player or period of time. Example: Ruth's 60 home run explosion (in '23, I think) signalled both the beginning of a new, exciting time -- the live ball era -- in baseball (good) and the end of the istrategy and defense-dominated period that preceeded it (bad). So with that in mind, I'll pitch the following figure to all the rhetorical cleanup hitters out there: In 1987, at the age of 40, Ryan led the National League with a 2.76 ERA and 270 strikeouts. Having undergone elbow surgery the preceeding offseason, Ryan put up these numbers while being held to a 110 pitch count or seven innings per outing. Had he played for a media darling or a playoff team that year, we might still be talking about this feat. But instead Ryan played for the Houston, which featured Billy Hatcher (20 HR) and Dickie Thon as its power tandem, and Frank DiPino (who?) as a closer. Never has a pitcher more often left a game with a lead only to watch his bullpen blow it. Ryan's record that year: 8-16. This happened throughout his career; had he played up the coast, for the A's, instead of in Anaheim for the Angels in the 70's, he might have approached 400 wins. Instead, he finished with a mere 324, and armchair pundits point to his 292 losses and feel just in calling him 'average.' I'm not ready to elevate him to Walter Johnson or Christy Mathewson status, but this is a pitcher for the Pantheon.
