Aaron Mckie is my favorite NBA player. He is one of the best defenders in the league and is invariably matched up against some of the league's most prolific scorers (Carter, Kobe, etc.). He is big and strong, with quick feet and an excellent handle, allowing him to play the 1, 2, or 3 spots competently. He rarely turns the ball over, and never complains about getting enough touches. And finally, when the game is on the line, Mckie is the only other Sixer besides Iverson who wants the ball - and more often than not, he delivers. I can do without the Rasheed Wallaces, the JR Riders, the Latrell Sprewell's - give me Aaron Mckie any day.
