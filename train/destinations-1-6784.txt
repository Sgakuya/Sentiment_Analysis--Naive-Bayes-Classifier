Massachusetts has voted republican several times in the last 60 years- 1952, 1956, and 1984- Also comparing Nebraska and the Bay state is like comparing a corn husker with a silk purse. As far as 'liberal garbage' the garbage comes from the republican party hijacking our civil rights through indimidation and illegal fund raising. Check out Armstrong Williams and the payoff he recieved- and the use of the Social Security administration to propagandize Bush's shabby lies to 'salvage the program. Was it not the GOP that opposed Soc. Security, Medicare and just about every major piece of legislation to help the common American? Please spare me from the right wing Nebraskan stupidity trip. Nebraska is rated LOW for a reason.
