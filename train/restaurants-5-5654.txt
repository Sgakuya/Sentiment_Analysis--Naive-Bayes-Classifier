i live just on the other side of trolley square across the street where a tiny little cafe used to be and is nothing more than an empty lot now. i had gone to bill and nadas since i was a kid. it was my stepfathers favorite place for breakfast which was the famous brains and eggs.though they seemed to be a favorite of many i never ventured there. a few things made this place special . you were made to feel at home like you were family. the other thing was bill. i will never forget when fred meyer bought out the block across the street from the cafe so they could build the 2 story super store that stands there today except for one thing one of those houses belonged to bill and no amount of money was worth selling his home with all his memories and he said you couldnt put a price on what he felt getting up in the morning looking across the street to his little cafe seeing pancakes being flipped on the griddle and good friends and customers at his place starting their day. so he stood his ground and fred meyers never for a moment doubted that they would get their way so they proceeded to buy up the rest of the property and they were wrong. they were left with no choice but to build the store around bills house and there it stood until he died. the house is gone the cafe is gone but the memories are not.
