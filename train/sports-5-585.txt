He is a very good athlete with good morals and a strong value system. From the fact that i live next door to him, I know he is a great person and deserves everything he recieves in terms of awards. He's quite down to earth and popular--he and NY go very well together. Even if you aren't a baseball fan, you have to know know who Derek Jeter is and I think that says a lot about his character. Most of his teammates and i say that he is hard to not like because of his personality. Even if you aren't a Yankees fan, you have to admit that derek is among the best athletes in sports today if not the best. He is the best shortstop of this eneration and will be a hard person to beat in Hall of Fame votes when his time comes. He is an all around type of player. He has his agility, coordination, his playing ability, style, poise, and looks to back him up in New York as well as in the sports industry. You have to admit that he is very good at what he does and that he is definitely one of the Yankee Greats .
