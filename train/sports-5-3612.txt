Pete Rose lives and breaths baseball. Nobody has ever played the game as hard as Charlie Hustle. I still cringe when I see the footage of him running over the catcher in that All-Star game. I will admit that he had limited physical skills. He was not as gifted as some players that never accomplished nearly as much as he did in his career. He did it with heart, hard work, and determination and that is something that is missing in a lot of the millionaire players that are playing today. Now about the Hall of Fame. The last time I went to the Football Hall of Fame I saw the bust of OJ Simpson. What Pete Rose did doesn't seem nearly that bad.
