My 78 year old mother-in-law recently purchased an expensive side by side Sears refridgerator/freezer. While still under warrenty it stopped working. IT TOOK SEARS SIX WEEKS TO REPAIR IT! Then they had the nerve to try to sell her an extended warrenty! Sears and KMart mergeing are like two drowning men trying to save each other. We stopped shopping at Sears a number of years ago. We live in a medium size town (150,000) and the merchandise shown in Sears advertising is often not available locally. It is very frustrating to be told that although Sears had an ad supplement in the local paper, it was regional advertising and that we would have to go to a city 60 miles away to find all the items. No wonder Sears' stock and market share has fallen so much over the years.
