If you had asked me before I had worked ar Taco Bell, I would probably given that place a four. The only thing I eat there these days is The Cheesy Gordita Crunch. Beyond that I stay away. I do commend them on their originality. They come out with some new marketing ploy every month or so. Let it be a new Taco or Burrito, they always have some new imitation mexican food bio hazard to try out. Lord knows I try every new thing they come out with at least once. The Cheesy Gordita Crunch and Chulupa will be very difficult to top. Their price is a little steap, but, what fast food place isn't these days? I guess that palce is o.k. if you like to play Russian roulette with your digestive track.
