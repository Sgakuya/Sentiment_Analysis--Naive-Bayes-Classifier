We have this Xterra se. It is a good suv for the price tag. It gets pretty good gas mileage. I am 4'11 and it fits me perfectly. On the other hand my husband is 6'2 and he feels a little cramped. The engine is a v-6 but doesnt have much power, I wouldn't buy this with the idea of pulling anything. The stadium seating is a nice feature for the kids. I can't really imagine using this off road but it is a reliable family suv. I had to lower my ranking, for our xterra has died at 65,000 miles. It doesn't start at all something to do with the starter and other things. Anyway we have waited almost two months for the parts as they are on National back order. In my opinoun something on National back order should be a recall and honored by Nissan, but it has yet to be! Trading it in when it's fixed! Oh yes forgot to mention now we have electrical shorts engine light and gas empty lights get stuck on.Thinking maybe the Honda Element!
