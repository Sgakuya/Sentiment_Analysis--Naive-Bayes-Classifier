Cater is a good man, to good to be president unfortunatly. He came in at a bad time when the economy was already shaky, didn't win the support of congress and so left with an even worse mess. The hostages in Iran didn't help matters, he had supported the bad government of the shah and then when our embassy was invaded wasn't quick enough or strong enough to know what to do. Overall though I think he had good forgein policies and tried to get home programs going. I think that if he had compromised with Congress-played their game more he would be viewed better by the American people than what he is. A decent man, compassionate, caring. I'm not Christian but he's an example of what a true Christian should be.
