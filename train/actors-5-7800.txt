First, Alec is a great actor. Second, it was REPORTED that he made those comments about leaving the country, the tabloid media has been known to make mistakes every now and then (and especially given all the hysterical reactions here) im willing to give Alec the benefit of the doubt. And Finally, and this REALLY gets to me, whats all this BS about Alec has no qualifactions to speak about public policy? WHAT QUALIFICATIONS DO YOU NEED TO HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF YOUR COUNTRY???? I guess the only guys who are allowed to talk abut politics in your world are the talking airheads on your television. Bill Gates was a college dropout. Einstein liked to play hookie. Leave the long knives at home, boys! Long live free speech. And by the way, Why worry so much about having intelligent actors when we dont even have intelligent Presidents?
