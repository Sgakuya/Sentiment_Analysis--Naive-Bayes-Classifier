I would say Miami is the closest thing to a bordertown Florida has. You have a plethora of Cubans, Haitians, and other Carribean peoples in this city. However, what makes Miami really bad is how everything is compacted. The traffic sucks, the people can't drive, and there's an uneasy atmosphere everywhere. I also saw an employee punch a customer working at a clothing store for whatever reason. Also, south beach is WAY overrated, and don't bother going to any of the restuarants on the strip, for they will be EXTREMELY overpriced. The two big reasons to go to Miami, however, are its awesome skyline, and Miami Beach, a wonderful beach to swim in all times of the year.
