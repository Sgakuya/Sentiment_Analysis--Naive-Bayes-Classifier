Venice is not the place to go without your lover...a truly romantic experience (and I was without my significant other on my visit, and yet the romance was still consuming). The locals are freindly and worth getting to know. You can also save some major $$$ by bargaining with the gandolersmen (?) or by not taking a gandola during the peak times (like after dinner) which can be very pricy. Also, I paid a fortune to take a water-taxi from the train station to my hotel...have a map ahead of time and enjoy the greatness surrounding you BUT if you have tons of luggage beware, there are TONS of stairs and bridges to cross. I can't wait to get back again.
