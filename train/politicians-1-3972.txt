I wish there was a zero rating. Read his history...the ONLY thing he has going for him is his family name....and that name means nothing more than MONEY...gotten ANY WAY it can be gotten. His Daddy makes war on Iraq...to defend some of the richest hoods on the planet, the Kuwaitis...and Harken Oil and Geo Jr. make out like bandits. How much has the Bush family cost every taxpayer for the Savings and Loan failures? I think it was the Florida son who made a killing on that. We don't need Geo. Jr....we can't afford any more Bushes!!! Can't help but think of the title of Jim Hightowers new book: If The Gods Had Meant Us to Vote, They'd Have Given Us Candidates . But don't get me wrong...I'll vote...if only to register opposition to Bush and his ilk.
