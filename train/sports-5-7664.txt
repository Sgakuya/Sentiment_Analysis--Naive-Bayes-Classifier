Some of these takes ripping Shaq are the dumbest I've ever heard. He just dominates because people are afraid of him? Anyone that size should score more? He's not an athlete, he's just big? Are you KIDDING? I HATE the Lakers, but it doesn't take too much thought to realize that to be able to run the floor, rebound, defend, and yes, score the way Shaq does, at 7'1 and over 350 lbs, you've got to be one hell of an athlete. Listen to anyone who knows the game talk about Shaq, and you'll hear a testament to a combination of size and agility that's never been seen before in the league. If you're telling me that Robert Parish, Patrick Ewing, or any other big man that rates higher than Shaq on this list is a better basketball player, you sir are an Idiot.
