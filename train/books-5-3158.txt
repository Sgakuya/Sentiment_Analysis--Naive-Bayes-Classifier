The most terrifying book I have ever read..oh jeez, my ankles get weak thinking about it..The movie was the scariest film I have EVER seen, and the book is even more horrifying. I guess because it is very possible, in fact I believe that the story is a compilation of factual events..good God, did you read it? if so, do you remember the part where Regan/demon is coming down the stairs ..scuttling down while in a backbend and licking at the ankles of (was it the mother or the assistant chick?)..whatever, I have never been so terrified in my entire life..and was so glad that that image was not put in the movie, because for whatever reason, that horrified me more than anything..well, imagine the terror when we watched the new version of the movie..that part is in it..God Help me...I cringe just thinking about it. Anyway, a great psychological, horror book..but read it in a well lit area and try not to be alone in the house.
