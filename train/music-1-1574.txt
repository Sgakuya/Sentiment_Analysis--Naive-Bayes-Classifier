1) This is NOT goth rock. 2) This is emo. Worse.. it is FAKE emo! Maybe I would like Amy Lee's voice, if it was actually her voice. Look at the label she is signed to. No artist goes in there, sings and records, and comes out with an album with no editing. SO much computer goes into the voices now that I wouldn't even call them voices. Have you ever heard that girl... Julia Robert's neice or whatever. Compeltely not her voice. Well it's the same with Amy Lee and her sad excuses for songs. If you want to listen to Mope Rock listen to something real, something raw where you can hear the pick on the guitar and you can hear the little imperfections in the singers voice. That is not Evanescence. They are another product of America's capitalist market.
