I was worried about the mileage (88,000) on my 1998 Grand Cherokee so traded it on a new 2002 Subaru Outback - 9 months later I hated the Outback so much I bought the jeep back (luckily it had been on loan to a client of the dealers and they still had it). That must be the ultimate expression of confidence in a vehicle - to buy it back. GREAT TRUCK (as long as you rember it is a truck). Probably overkill for the driving we do, gravel roads, long distance towing of a dog trailer, riverbeds and beaches etc which is why we chose the Outback (mistake!) - The only one fault is the abismal mileage it gets, otherwise it would rate 5 stars from me.
