Hey Samjung!!!Ur gay and because of ur comments ur also saying t-mac sucks!Sure the rockets made the playoffs but did they win the first round??no!!Even with t-mac averagin over 30 ppg in that series!!He is the biggest ball hog!!In the 2003-2004 season,T-mac scored a career high of like 60 points and had a ppg of 28 that year!!If ur saying that Allen Iverson and Steve Francis are ball hogs, then how come both players average 7-8 assits while t-mac averages 5-6!!!HUH????Whose the big crappy ball hog now!!!Now look at the Magic!!!With T-mac, they went 21-61 compared to 36-46 with Francis!!!U cant expect a team to contend in the playoffs right away after they were the worst team the year before. And Steve Francis only averaged 21ppg compared to T-mac 28.The magic should definately keep Steve because Francis has that pure love for the game that T-mac will never have. Keep u and ur gay comments to ur self cause u dont no smack about the NBA!!!ENOUGH SAID!!!
