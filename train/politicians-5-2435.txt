Wonderful mayor of NYC and I hope public service is in his future. Started cleaning up NYC by eliminating graffiti and fining intimidating and disruptive squeegee men. Turned Times Square from a decaying, pornographic cesspool to a thriving area once again. Crime experienced a sharp decline thanks to his policy iniatives, most notably the Compstat program that has become the focus of his private business. A conservative on fiscal matters, he cut the oppressive NYC hotel tax, among other taxes, and voila, more vactioners sought NYC as a tourist attraction, and more businesses came to NYC for conventions and what not. Finally, his leadership during the 911 was unparalleled, from attending to the wreckage to calming the city at a time when is desperately needed it. Attended the funerals of many of the policemen and firefighters who died on that day and visited them in hospitals. Truly one of the great politicians of our time.
