I loved this movie but in a way it made me mad that poor guy tried so hard to make things right and his girlfriend never really took up for him knowing the stuff that was happening to him until the end of the movie! Like when he accidentally spiked the volleyball into her sister's face after they kept calling him names and telling him to and then they all gave him dirty looks and walked away from him even his girlfriend. It was funny but made me cringe in those parts because anyone who has met someone's parents knows how awkward it is and would have not put up with that crap for that long without going off on everyone in that house including his girlfriend!! But then again haha if that happened then there would would not have been a movie!!
