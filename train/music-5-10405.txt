Josh Groban is the idol of every male vocalist in the world. His range is almost untouchable, his quality is amazing and he is absolutely the most talented singer I've ever heard. I've been on many tours for State choirs and outside functions, and I have yet to hear a better male vocalist. He is the equivalent of Charlotte Church in the female section. Not only his solo sections, but also his harmonic accompaniment throughout numerous duets with some of the industries most prominant powerhouse singers (Celine Dion, Charlotte Church etc..) has made him one of the most diverse singers I've ever come in contact with. He is my idol in the music profession, and I'm only 16! Wonderful, bravo. If I could clap online, I certainly would. Amazing talent.
