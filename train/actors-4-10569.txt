Drew Barrymore is an above average actress, but she is not one of the best. She's special in her own unique way- she is so adorable and has an amazing amount of charm. I think that X-D was a bit too hard on her (was there any mention of her acting ability in that post?). Drew Barrymore has given some impressive performances since her performance in E.T. in her youth. I enjoyed her performances in Never Been Kissed , The Wedding Singer and Charlie's Angels . However, her best performance is probably her least known. I thought that she was wonderful as the bad girl Ivy in Poison Ivy . When I get tired of seeing Drew Barrymore's typical good girl roles, I just watch that movie and am amazed at how she pulled that performance off. She's a good actress, and as her career progresses, hopefully she can broaden her acting horizons.
