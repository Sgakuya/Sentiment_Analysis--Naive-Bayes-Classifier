If you are residential, have a single line and have ultra-reliable broadband, its doable. But don't even think about using it in a business environment. For starters, the fax line is unreliable. They offer NO DIRECTORY SERVICE! If somebody calls information and askes for a listing for your business, they WON'T get it. I have spoken with industry professionals and according to them, Vonage COULD share your information with various directory services, free of charge (i.e. Yellow Book) if they chose to...they simply don't choose to. Next, cancelling service is a living nightmare. These people will keep your account alive as long as humanly possible. They put you on hold, tell you that you have to speak with an account specialist but one isn't available, then they offer to call back, so you accept. When they call back, you're not available but they WON'T talk to ANYBODY except the person whos name is on the account, so they hang up and you have to try to call THEM back, and start the entire miserable cycle all over again. Meanwhile, you get another Vonage charge on your credit card. These people know exactly what they are doing. This whole cancellation process is by design so they can milk you for as much money as possible.
