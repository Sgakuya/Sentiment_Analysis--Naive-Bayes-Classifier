I am impressed with the graduates from this school. The name is very elite and commands high paying salaries and etc.. This is truly a very prestigious school with a reputation more above its closest competitors. Heriot-Watt graduates are very knowledgeable and very professional. I like their style in dealing their day-to-day approach. If I am an owner of a multi-corporation, I would definitely hire most of my staff for higher managerial positions from this school. I would be very confident that it would be the right decision that I did at the end of the day. I have really such high regards to graduates from this school. Heriot-Watt MBA - among the world's best. No doubt!!!
