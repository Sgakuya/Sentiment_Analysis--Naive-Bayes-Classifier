You know at first I rated her a three, and I was ready to go on some of the critics' assertions about her in here. But I went back and watched Silence of the Lambs again (hadn't seen it in years), and I realized that there are very very few actresses (I can't think of any) that could've pulled off the role as she did. Clarice Starling is one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen on the big screen. She was very complex: tough and ambitious yet at the same time unsure and delicate, embodying all the strengths and weaknesses of a bright and eager young student, and she could've been botched very easily. When I try to think of other girls attempting that role, I can just picture them trying to beef up (and flatten) the character, whereby ruining the whole movie. I haven't seen a whole lot of Foster's other work, but the ones I remember (Contact and Anna and the King) both lacked direction to make their extravagant visions (and budgets) very compelling, and I could see her (along with her coactors) putting forth a focused effort.
