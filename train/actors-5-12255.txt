Halle is a beautiful African-American woman (look back at your history people - in the U.S if you had any black in you than you were considered black - and was treated as such). How can a person CLAIM to be black? She IS black. Most white people that look at her view her as a black woman, and I guarantee if she were not a celebrity she would not be as accepted as she is due to her complexion. Her own mother is the one that advised her to view herself that way (African-American) because she knew that others would. Rather she is light skinned or deep chocolate brown - I applaud her and will continue to support her as I do all of my sisters.
