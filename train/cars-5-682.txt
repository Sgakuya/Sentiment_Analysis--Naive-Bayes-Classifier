I got my alien green response just over 3 years ago and its been very dependable. I live in Toronto and it has proved to be a great city bike. Also its a very capable off roader. Down a hill I hit 84km/h and the bike was very stable, and when I reached the bottom of the hill, it stopped like a pro. I have taken my bike to many cities abroad, Paris, London, Prague, Munich, NYC, Montreal, even a long ride from Paris to Cannes. I now have clocked 4200km and still wearing the original Kenda tires! (but I really need to start looking for new tires) brake pads just got replaced. Its a quality bike without the big price. I have ridden bikes costing 4 times as much and I would say they are not that much better.
