They are understaffed. I have gone to a particular department looking for someone to help me and there was no one in sight. I do not appreciate having to look around all over the place for assistance. The lines are too long and the prices too high. They do not have enough of a variety of clothing styles. I have better luck ordering from catalogs. Once I went in to find a pair of pants. I couldn't find my size and was looking for someone to offer to help me. No one did; they were all standing around chatting and more or less told me that if I couldn't find it on the rack, it wasn't there. They're just not helpful enough.
