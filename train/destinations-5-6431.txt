I like my home state because it has a mild climate and is close to the ocean. I was really happy to live near the ocean again after so many years of living in an inland state. There is a lot of history here and a lot to do. Opinion just said that we are not part of America;alas, opinion, we tried seceding but ended up in a little conflict called the Civil War. We were trounced, so I don't think we'll step up to the plate again. Since you seem to hate the South so much, I'm glad you are moving back to the North. Judging from your comments and those of your compadres, the Northerneastern United States is a veritable paradise where the sun always shines and folks are shiny and happy. Au revoir!
