I work at Chuck E. Cheese and every employee works extremely hard to give the customers great service. We clean up everyone's mess, play and talk with the kids, sing and dance to entertain the kids, and serve everyone. Hard work goes into every part of Chuck E. Cheese. The pizza is made out of fresh dough, for those of you who think it is frozen. We make minimum wage, and in my opinion we deserve more for putting up with some people that we have to deal with. I am a birthday party hostess and all of the hostess's go through a lot of stress each day to try to give your child the best party ever. And a lot of the time, we aren't tipped. I just don't get it....here we are, taking your order, refilling your cups, cutting the pizza and serving each child individually, dancing for them, singing for them, cutting the cake, serving the cake, and attending to all needs by all guests. I don't understand how some people don't have the decency to tip for this huge service.
