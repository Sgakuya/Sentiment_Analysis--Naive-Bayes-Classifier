I have used several video editing packages. VideoWave seems was designed to be the most powerful one. That is its strong aspect. On the other hand, its DVD authorizing part is extremely weak. Apparently, the video editing part and DVD writing part was not well meraged. The later take each movie file as a title instead of a charpter and you DVD player will not play as one movie but several movies with the main menu show up after play of each title. In order to avoid this problem, one have to make all the videos into a single movie file before ge into DVD Authrizing part. After all, you will find your movie file size is not optimized for a DVD disc.
