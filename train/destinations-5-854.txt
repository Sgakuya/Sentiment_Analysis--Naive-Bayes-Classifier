This is a travel section,so i'm not sure if one week at Toronto and Niagara qualifies me for commenting on such a vast country.But i must express my thanks to the Canadian people for their unfailing kindness during our stay-the hospitality has left a glowing impression even 3 years on.Toronto is an excellent,progressive city and Niagara Falls were breathtaking(we'll never forget the first sighting, nor the wonderful hotel view overlooking the falls lit up at night.)I'd so love to see more of this huge,open country-just looking down on the forests,lakes and wilderness from the plane was memorable enough.A trans-Canadian train journey,through the Rockies and on to beautiful Vancouver,is one of my dream holidays:i'd be interested to hear from those who've done it.
