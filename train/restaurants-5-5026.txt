I absolutely love Olive Garden as a matter of fact I just visited the restaurant last night. Their Salad is wonderful, breadsticks are outstanding, and their pastas and entrees are the best I have tasted. If it is micro waved please point me to the frozen section. The only time their Fettuccine Alfredo has not been the best is when they have the Never-ending Pasta Bowl . I think they may thin it down some, but be sure to have lots of Parmesan/Romano cheese added to your plate and you cannot go wrong. I do agree with most statements that it is not authentic Italian Food, but I am not going complain! I have been to several quoted Authentic Italian Restaurants and the do not hold a candle to Olive Garden.
