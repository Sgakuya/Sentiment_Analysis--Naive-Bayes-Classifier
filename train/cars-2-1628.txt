the old alero where should i start,with the good i guess. drives nice good handeling nice interior looks sporty good sound system lots of horse power now the bad..... wheel bearings(front) break system(eats pads) intake manifolds go bad window&trunk seals(suck) anti-theft system goes out trackion control goes out lights come on for no reason(computer sucks) thats all i can think of right now,i had the car since '00 and it has 68,miles on it and its been a head ach since ive on it,i had it the shop the frist week i bought it,and 4xs after and it still aint right,so if you are planning to buy one make sure you get the extra extended warrenty and have a 2nd car i hand.
