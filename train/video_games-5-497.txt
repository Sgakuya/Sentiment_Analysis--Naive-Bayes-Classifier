Monopoly is a great claasic board game. It's fun to move the unique tokens around the board and try to collect sets of the properties before anyone else. The play money is also fun to use, but my pet peeve is the single dollar bills because it makes it a bit of a pain to have to use them and keep cashing in bigger bills in order to get $14 for rent or something instead of an even $15 or whatever. But on the other hand, this gives kids good practice in making change and improving math skills etc. The biggest thrill in this game has to be landing on free parking- especially if their is a big jackpot put in the middle.
