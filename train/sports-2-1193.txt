With great reluctance I have to give one of the most selfish, unappealling players ever to play the game 2 stars because he was once a good player and his personality thoughout the thrilling home run contest in 98 was engaging and good for baseball. However in the last few years, Sosa has suffered a staggering decline in fortunes (both on and off the field) virtually unparalleled in the sporting world for which he has no one to blame but himself. The corked bat debacle, the bogus charity work in his homeland, the strong evidence that he was one of baseball's many steroid abusers, his alarming slump in productivity and last but certainly not least, the selfish and dismissive attitude towards his fans, club and fellow players (which he managed to conceal so effectively for much of his career) have together combined to make a once respected ball player a figure of justifiable public derision. The damage to Sosa's reputation is irreversible but if he was to quietly exit from the game today he would prevent further injury to it. Unfortunately for him I suspect he is too arrogant and simple to take this step.
