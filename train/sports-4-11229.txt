As a Michigan fan, I'm biased, but not so biased that I think Lloyd Carr is God's gift to college football. He's a fundamentally solid coach who has proven his ability to do a very difficult job: meet the expectations of Michigan football fans, who are so spoiled we can only forgive a 3-loss season if it's followed up by a national championship. Carr may not be a genius in any one area, but he can recruit, he can motivate, and he knows how to use his assistant coaches. I'd love to see someone with a more dynamic personality heading up the program, but Carr has proven that his low-key approach is effective. What he lacks in charisma he makes up for in reliability. Sure Carr's teams sometimes lose games they should easily win, but when has a Michigan team NOT done that?
