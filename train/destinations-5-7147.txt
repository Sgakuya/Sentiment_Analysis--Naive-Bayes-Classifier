Zakatak11 - I imagine you were visiting from some small town in the US where people walk around with their wallets hanging out of their back pockets. Madrid has petty crime like every world capital, but if you use common sense you'll have no problems. Carry your wallet in your front pocket and leave your passport at the hotel (you don't need it to sightsee). browniesmith - The people aren't rude, they're just not fake. If you're looking for big smiles and hugs stick to Disney. Also, Plaza Mayor has the worst restaurants in a town crowded with good restaurants. Expand your horizons and check out something other than the tourist traps. CharmingPrince - "Too crowded. Too over-populated. Got vertigo because of everything being so high up." Are you a Smurf? This is the capital of Spain, and we're not breaking any records with our skyscrapers. c1snoopy - "Crime on tourists is a major problem." Especially crime on tourists named Snoopy. I've lived here for six years and have never had a problem. Once again, use common sense.
