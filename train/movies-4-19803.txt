This is not a horror movie in the traditional sense--it's one in the real sense. Many people cannot stomach this film, with good reason--it is shocking stuff. The story (loosely based on an Ingmar Bergman film!) involves two teenaged girls who visit New York City and try to score some pot before a rock concert. They are abducted by the dealers, taken into the woods, and.......(see it for yourself, but consider yourself warned). The movie is every parent's nightmare, and no punches are pulled. The story sags a little with a subplot involving an inept sheriff, but perhaps the director added this as comic relief. This is strong stuff and several friends I have detest the film. It is well made and the acting is real, and terrifying. Wes Craven was the force behind this movie, but don't expect Freddy Krueger or Scream. It's the real deal--up there with other real horror films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Henry, and (more recently) Frailty.
