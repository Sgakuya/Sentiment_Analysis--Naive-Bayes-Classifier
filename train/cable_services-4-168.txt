Sounds like someone called the cable company instead of Dish. I have had nothing but positive experiences with Dish, ranging from getting clarity on a billing issue (they did double-bill me for a PPV, and did reverse the charges without much discussion), to changing programming packages (done this a half-dozen times, and the call went fast and easy, and the changes showed before I hung up the pohone, for the most part). The receiver does get a little bit quirky if the power supplied to it isn't totally clean, or if you've left it unplugged long enough to miss a firmware update. Otherwise a great service with very competitive pricing to cable and DirecTV. Only reason I'd take DirecTV over Dish is NFL Sunday Ticket (and I'm not that much of a football fanatic).
