I attended Darden in the early '90s and found their focus on developing decision-makers and leaders vs. technicians and content experts the best part of the program. The Darden concept (much like other case study schools) of pushing students to resolve 2-3 tough business cases a day and be able to articulate an defend a solution was/is a great way of developing managerial judgment and decision making. After all, in whatever industry, function or line of work we are in, the successful excel at these skills. It was not an easy program by any means, but I certainly feel I got my money's worth and wasn't paying to attend a country club that was largely geared toward making "connections".
