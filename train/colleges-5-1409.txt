Newberry College was est. in 1856, in the historic town of Newberry, SC. Although Newberry is a small town, it's convenient to Columbia & Spartanburg. If you want to be a person and not a number, Newberry College is YOUR SCHOOL! The student-body is a close-knit community. Professors are ALWAYS available. NC gives you EXCELLENT ACADEMICS, & GOOD SCHOLARSHIP PACKAGES. There's ALWAYS something to do ... clubs, greek life, athletics, internships, studies abroad, etc. Most important, NC encourages you to do your BEST ... to EXCELL ... they challenge your mind ... and make you think. NC wants you to come up with ideas, and implement them. They want college to be fun, and educational. That makes a really unique experience! A lot of people read the College Review for rankings ... well, NC has a GOOD ranking. But rankings aren't comprised by students who are actually experiencing a college. Personally, I left one of the top liberal arts colleges in the U.S. for Newberry College! It may not be the biggest, or most prestigious, but IT IS THE BEST! The Tribe rules!
