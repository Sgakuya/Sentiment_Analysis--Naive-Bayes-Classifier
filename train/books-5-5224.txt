This book reads like an autobiography, and since the main character is a writer looking back on his life, I had to remind myself several times that this was a work of fiction. Hosseini's writing style is very clever. He does a great job of slipping the reader some knowledge about the story, and waiting until later to unravel how that scene came about. He is able to describe some gruesome and tragic thoughts and events, while also being able to beautifully capture instances of love and caring. The story is excellent not only because it is great fiction, but also because it gives a personal perspective on the plight of Afghanistan over the last 30 years. This novel is helpful in understanding the experiences of expatriate Afghanis, and what 20 years of war has done to a society in modern day Afghanistan.
