What it boils down to for me is that Bush's critics can cite mountains of facts about past and current hypocritical policies and behaviors, while all his supporters use are rhetorical arguments about what a great man he is. If Bush really wants to make the world (or even just the U.S.) safe(r) from terrorism, he should dedicate his presidency to freeing the U.S. from its dependence on the foreign oil that provides the funds that people like bin Laden use to organize terror networks. Ousting Saddam and replacing him with a puppet government that will be no more democratic than the one it has now - and alienating our traditional allies in the process - will only make things worse in the long run.
