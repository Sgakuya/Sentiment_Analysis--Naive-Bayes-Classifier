As a big fan of Toucan Sam, I'm giving Froot Loops a 2 instead of a 1. However, I think the cereal itself is horrid. The smell of it is enough to make me feel nauseous, and the flavor is harsh and artificial. It reminds me of air freshener or Lysol- not a good thing in a cereal! As I kid, I was drawn to the brightly colored loops and the appealing packaging, but nothing could make up for the fact that the cereal tastes terrible. I am also extremely annoyed by the intentional misspelling of the word fruit, which sets a terrible example for the young children who can stomach this cereal. This is a kid cereal I'm never tempted to buy.
