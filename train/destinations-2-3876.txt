A pretty decent city to visit, but a terrible (and I mean Terrible) city to live in. Much more expensive than it deserves to be, and the people are mostly complete a$$holes. If you see someone being genuinely friendly in this city, they are almost definitely from somewhere else. This is probably the most elitist city in the country (after Toronto) and the hostility to those they consider beneath them is thick enough to be collected with a butterfly net. They pride themselves on having the most educated population, but any visitor will be put off by the jaw-dropping ignorance of most of its citizens. Combine this ignorance with the most opinionated people in the country and it is unbearable for any longer than a day or two. Only stop if you need to gas up before hitting the mountains. They have a pretty good transit system but neither the trains nor the buses run past midnight, which is mind-boggling for a city of one million people. They get two stars instead of one only because there are a few genuinely nice people there (transplants from other cities) and there is decent scenery.
