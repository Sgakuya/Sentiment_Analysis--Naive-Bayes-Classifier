I am a season ticket holder and love following this team. Though the A's have come up short the past five years, I am proud they grow the majority of their talent, unlike the free-agent laden Yankees and Red Sox. Hey Boston, that kook, Trot Nixon, is the only starter from your farm system. I know the blow hard Yankee and Sox fans will say we use Oakland as our farm club. And you clowns are proud of that? Win or lose I have a sense of civic pride as an A's fan because the players are born and bread in the A's family. Red sox and Yankee fans, if everything is so much better in your towns, tell your pals Vinnie, Richie, Tony, Marky, and Brian to stop moving here to live their California dream on our dime. Lastly, Boston, the slang term wicked-cool is the dumbest, thing that you half-sissy's say.
