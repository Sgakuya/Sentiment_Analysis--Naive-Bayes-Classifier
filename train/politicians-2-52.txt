Horse face Liz is just a lucky old woman whose ancestors killed others in order to grab possessions and power. Nothing special about that - she is not a god. She wears gloves when she has to touch "her public" as if she might catch something contageous from them. Has this woman got a serious Howard Hughes complex or what? All the fortune she has amassed, and it is considerable, is not the result of honest labour. The fact is she is just a priviledged sponger who has never done a real day's work in her life. As for tourism, is France or Italy, or USA even, short of tourists? If the few cretinous people who visit Britain just to catch sight of a royal are lost forever, would anyone care? What an insult to Britain and to all those intelligent people who visit not to wave at the queen but to actually see the country. I suspect the days of the royals lording it over their "subjects" will soon be over. Not many people under the age of 60 have any time for them now.
