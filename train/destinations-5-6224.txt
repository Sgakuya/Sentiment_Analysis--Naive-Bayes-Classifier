Let me clear up a few misconceptions you folks seem to have: a) We aren't ignorant. SAT scores are skewed due to the fact that nearly all students here take the test as opposed to other states where fewer than 10% may take it. b) Yes there are some undesirable people here. Please show me a state where there are none. Most Georgians, though, are friendly and hospitable. By some of your definitions, undesirable means religous. Yes, we are Christian and if you don't like that, then you probably won't like it here. c) Please tell me you have more sense than to judge a state from the interstate. Interstate highways in Georgia (as in many states), for the most part, bypass cities and activity. That would be why you see a lot of trees. And we're the ignorant ones?? d) Living conditions, including but not limited to weather, are ideal here. If you don't believe me, ask the thousands of folks from your home states that move here every year to get away from the blizzards, rude folks, factory/traffic smoke, and such. e) Atlanta IS NOT all of Georgia. Georgia is a state; Atlanta is just one of the many cities inside it. Don't make ignorant comments about how you hate Georgia because of Atlanta traffic or because you had to wait in the airport too long. And finally, f) There is absolutely NO STATE in the country with better food than Georgia. ---- Georgia is a great state that gladly welcomes many folks from your states every day. As happy as we are to have you, though, we don't want to hear how bad you hate it. We like it and it's our state. Georgia's not for everyone; if it's not for you, Delta's ready when you are.
