I am 21 years old and love Destiny's Child more than Micheal Jackson was loved in the 80's. There clothes are the truth their hair is off the hook, and the lyrics to every song you cant tell me I could not have wrote the songs for them. But the only thing that I HATE IS THAT, THAT DAMN BEYONCE IS ALWAYS IN THE FRONT!!! When the truth of the matter is KELLY HAS THE BOMB VOICE SHE CAN BLOW BEYONCE OUT ANYTIME AND SHE KNOWS THAT THAT IS WHY THEY DONT LET KELLY SING MORE THAN SHE DOES. Just listen to her on the D.L and you will hear what Iam saying Kelly is so baning...her voice,her sytle, her petite size, her hair she is the truth ! but deep inside Beyonce knows that show that is why her and her parents keep Kelly in the back....BUT TO KELLY KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO, AND HOW YOU DO IT BEACUSE YOU ARE OFF THE HOOK!!! AND I KNOW MANY OTHERS THAT SAY THE SAME THING!!!!!! princess Carla
