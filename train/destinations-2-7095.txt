Dublin Positives: the winters! they are mild, and contrary to what every thinks quite dry. There is a very beautiful area in the south part of the city, which is supposed to be the best example of a Georgian city in Europe. There is an excellent theatre festival in October, mostly a repete of the Edinburgh theatre festival, but with less crowds. In general the fine arts are excellent in Dublin, loads of theatre, classical concerts, and often for free. Dubliners are reasonably friendly to tourists. Dublin Negatives: I think the worst thing about Dublin is the tourists, the city is swarming with them, almost any time of the year. On a normal day in the city centre more than half the people are tourists. The second worst thing is the nackers (heroine addicted, tracksuit wearers). They are the largest group of the local population and are aggressive and stupid. Be careful while getting money from ATM machines since nackers are into syringe mugging! Dublin has been growing very fast in the last 5 years but the growth is not well managed and so traffic is awful and most of the city is very dirty. In general you have to pay a lot to get any quality at all, in terms of hotels, apartment rent or anything else. In terms of living in Dublin, I think Dubliners can be quite closed to outsiders, and many of the foreign people I know there have absolutely no close Irish friends.
