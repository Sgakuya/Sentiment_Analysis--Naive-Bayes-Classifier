I own a 99 Bmw m3, i have a stage 3 Madmax turbo by Active Autowerke, with 17.5 psi of boost, a cold air intake, carbon fibre hood and wing, 19 wheels, JE pistons, Venom computerized Nitrous Oxide, and air ride. My car has over 520 bhp to the rear wheels. Therefore, the M series is a sports car. Stock 99 M3 has 240 bhp, whereas the 5.0 liter V8 Mustang Gt, has 215 bhp. These cars are awesome, and no doubt that they can be tuned to be one of the fastest cars imaginable...all from a staight 6.....so to all you wannabes our there, this car is for real. And to cage....my car has wiped out over 15 Vipers, and I'm gonna continue to destroy them and their 500 bhp.....stupid domestic cars.
