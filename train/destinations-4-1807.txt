Sometimes our idealism makes us forget that we are all human, capable of some of the most wonderful things in the world, but able to tear them down in a fraction of the time it took to build them up. Government is not an independent being of perfection, but formed and glued together on the ideas of imperfect individuals. So, why demand for perfection as though perfection can derive from imperfection? We have all made mistakes and we have all been blinded in our lives, but to charge another as though you are not guilty of the same makes one the lesser of the two. Look back on your history and the history of your country, and if there are no doubts of perfection, then feel free to condemn. But if thoughts loom of past mistakes, then please keep with the topic of this forum and comment only on the tourist appeal of America. As for me, I must say I was struck by the vast diversity within one nation. If you look, you can find the entire world in this one country, or more amazingly, in one city: New York, a true world class destination.
