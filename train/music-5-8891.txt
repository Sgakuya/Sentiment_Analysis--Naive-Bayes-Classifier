What a fun video. I wish Iwas in this video or around when they shot it. Everyone seems to be having such a great time (with the exception of the girl blowing chunks next to a dumpster) This video also show cases a new talent. Sum 41. They are a little reminecent of Blink 182 only Sum 41 is actually good. The video consists of thousands of clips from an out door show that Sum 41 put on. Watching all these little decked out punk kids run amok is a hell of alot of fun when your sitting on the couch wishing something like this was going down in your boring ass town. This video will sell you on Sum 41 and make you get out of your recliner and thrash around. Very energetic, fun and immature video. Great for anyone who likes happy fast punkish music. High up there on my current video list.
