This is as beautiful as it gets in the Pacific Northwest. You can hike a trail with dense forest covered in draping moss hanging from the tree branches. This is the Hoh rainforest and is one of the worlds few temperate rainforests. Then there are the scenic and beautiful Olympic Mountains which are snowcapped for much of the year and are a site to behold. The best part of the park are the ocean beaches. This is as pristine and undisturbed as coastal scenery gets in the United States. You can hike on a beach for hours and not see another person. The scenery is grand too with huge monolith rocks as big as 5 story houses the rise from of the ocean, natural arch rock formations and jagged cliffs which are fun to climb and watch the big Pacific surf crash on the rocks below. If your lucky enough and the skies are clear the sunsets are spectacular and unforgettable. I can't think of another National Park that can combine this much scenery in one place. I would reccommend renting a cabin on the coastal town of La Push. If you appreciate nature and like the ocean then you'd love it here. I sure did.
