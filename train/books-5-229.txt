So genuinely describes the thoughts, life,etc of an addict and the recovery process. (I know). But he doesn't preach or issue warnings - he simply tells the story. It is very sad, funny, and entertaining in general. I thought the parts where he was in rehab were brilliant. Nothing fancy, just plain, simple, honest, ingenius writing. I liked this even more than 'Running With Scissors'. He might be the best out there right now. I should change something though- he doesn't just simply tell the story as I said. Like it's some average memoir that basically says 'then this happened'. He creates a picture, lets you know the characters. He tells minute details in a way that makes them hugely significant. Well, they actually are significant, but most writers could not make these things so entertaining and vivid. Like just walking down the sidewalk or cleaning his apartment.
