I wish I could give this mesmerizing book five stars. But the ending was so unsatisfying and unworthy of the rest of the book that I'm forced to label it good instead of great. I don't want to go into detail that would spoil the book for those who haven't read it, so let me just say that the ending's key event bordered on nonsensical, leaving me feeling hollow and frustrated. At the same time, I wouldn't have been so upset if the vast majority of the book wasn't so engaging, lyrical, and artfully constructed. As someone fascinated by World War 2, I especially appreciated the setting and the seamless mix of fiction with historical events. This story and its desperately sincere characters will spin in your head for a long time after you put it down, and maybe that's a sure sign of truly effective literature.
