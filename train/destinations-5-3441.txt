Lived in Boston for 7 years (1994-2001), I have been to hundreds of America's cities and will tell you right off the bat that Boston is definitely one of the best cities in America. Boston has so much to offer (sights, attractions, shops, etc.) and it is well renown for its restaurants, colleges, sports, history and pretty much everything! You have to see it all in Boston (Newbury Street, Public Gardens, Boston Common, Downtown Crossing, Faneuil Hall, North End, Cambridge, South End, etc.) The list will go on and on... but I can testify that I love Boston and would live there again in a heartbeat. Yes there are some downsides but you can find them in any major city. Traffic is indeed terrible but there is always the T which is relatively very cheap comparing to NY or other cities. You can't simply pass up Boston when visiting New England due to its proximity to major areas (Cape Cod, NH, Maine, VT, RI, etc.) So many memories has been formed in this city and I wouldn't hesistant to rank it number 1 in the nation. Feel free to send me email if you want insider's tips on Boston on what to do, I am a former tour guide. One good tip, find hotels in surrounding areas and commute to Boston via the T if you are on a budget. Plenty of good choices! Many great restaurants in the city that can fit any budget. Avoid tourist traps knowing you can pretty much find a good deal a few blocks away. Walk and walk and walk, don't be stupid driving around... Boston is very walkable and you will enjoy it much more if you walked plenty :) Best to go in Spring or early Fall. Enjoy Bawssstoonn
