Being a fan of the AH Presents series I was really enthusiastic about seing his movies for the first time. But what a letdown were they: Vertigo , Rear Window , The Man who Knew too much , The trouble with Harry , Rope , Charade , Notorius (yes, I really saw them all). Very boring stuff. Let's elaborate: anybody actually understands Vertigo the first time though??....not to say James Stewart's perfomances in several of his movies (I can't say if it's either overacted or fake)..the director appearing in the middle of the story (his signature )... the fake set choices (Vertigo, Harry, The man who)...the genres (all of his movies were just about suspense). I didn't even saw any reviews then for a more unbias point of view but hey! what I'm talking about!!! ..objectivity??? ...it's all about emmotion that matters.....Psycho, that was a good movie, but one out of too many.....
