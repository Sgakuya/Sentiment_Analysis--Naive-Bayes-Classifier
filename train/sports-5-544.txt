Look, Derek is a NICE guy. He'll sign autographs, all day, visit sick kids in the hospital and be a POSITIVE role model. Oh, DID I mention he's a Hall of Fame caliber baseball player, too? You know, we GOTTA' find a nice girl for Derek to settle down with! Mariah Carey was TOO much of a hootchie for him, as well as the MTV VJ gal pal. Hhmmm, Julia Roberts is TOO old for him (as well as being married, already & preggers, to boot!). Lindsay Lohan? Hilary Duff? Paris Hilton (STRIKE that!!!)? I GOT IT!!! Jennie Finch! Yeah, I KNOW she's engaged to that Diamondbacks player, but it HASN'T been consummated yet. Can you imagine the babies THESE TWO would make, together?!
