Ronald reagan was the greatest president we have ever had. He had the courage to stand up to the communists, did a great job improving the economy of the 1980's (and in a way is responsible for the economy of the 1990's) and had a sense of moral character that most politicians lack today. He commanded respect so even Democrats ended up voting for him. He was able to convince people that the United States needed to remain strong and his only fault , SDI, was a blessing because it was the only way to force the Soviets to overspend and destroy themselves. If it weren't for Ronald Reagan, we woudl still be having nuclear drills and under constant threat of the Soviet Union. Reagan was a genius: he knew what was best for the country and brought it to great lengths, only to see his dream deteriorate with Bill Clinton's immoral presidency. If George Bush can get the country back on its feet I bless him wholeheartedly like our best President, Ronald Reagan. The only thing I blame him for is not developing the nuclear missile shield which would have served us greatly in the years to come. But considering the circumstances he did better than any president has ever done in our history. God Bless Ronald Reagan!
