The Zcar has left it's mark, and will continue to be a great car,s for a very long time. The last model, 300ZX was one of the greatest cars of all time. 6 years running it got Best Car of the Year, and please note this was for every year it was being sold. The late 300ZX set the standard for the Japanese Sports cars coming to america. We saw other companies build cars with more hp, better handling, etc, etc, but it started with the Z32. Secondly, Nissan set the standard with the 240Z... it established a name for itself, and broke records(then of course). The Z lineage started great, ended great, and will hopefully return... the latest rumor a 3.5 Liter Z.. 240-300hp... I CAN'T WAIT.
