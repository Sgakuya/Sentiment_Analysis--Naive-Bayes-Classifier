First thing's first: this album sounds dated. But who cares when modern music's too far gone to rescue. that's why we're not on the modern page right? i do however think that the beauty of some of this music has become lost in the legend and that only happens with classic rock. Hendrix was a sloppy guitarist...sure he could play but too bad he was off his face on drugs most of the time because it really takes away from the music. The great psychedelic melodies and guitar lines which waver on the border between music and soundscape are incredible to me and probably down to his drug-taking but the playing is of a lot higher standard on all his studio albums than the band ever achieved at live shows. There are some brilliant soul moments like in Remember and weird quasi jazz like in 3rd Rock From The Sun. The instrumentation is all of a high standard but Jimi wasn't an alien; oh no: he was as limited as the rest of us, all he did was focus.
