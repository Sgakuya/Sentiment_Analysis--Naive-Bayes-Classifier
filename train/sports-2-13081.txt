Texas A&M is historically BARELY a top 20 program. In 1994 Texas A&M had a TIE. Don't lecture me on doing my homework. I said unbeaten and untied. I suggest you read more carefully next time Chris G. Texas A&M succeeded only about HALF the time since 1985 with regard to just competing for conference titles. That is not the same as being in the hunt almost every year. 1994, when Texas A&M went 10-0-1 was the same year Penn State finished 12-0, Nebraska finished 13-0, and Florida State finished 10-1-1. To claim Texas A&M was in the hunt for the title in 1994 when they tied SMU the week AFTER beating Rice only 7-0 seems uninformed if not ignorant. Texas A&M is currently suffering from shot themself in the foot syndrome by getting rid of a classy man like Slocum for a less ethical Franchione. It seems unlikely Franchione will even compete for his division let alone winning the Big 12 or national titles.
