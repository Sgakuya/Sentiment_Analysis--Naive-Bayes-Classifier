We could really use someone like Teddy Roosevelt as president right now! This guy kicked ass! What else can you say about someone who grew up a sickly, weak nerd in New York City but by adulthood, was roughing it out West as a territory sheriff and cowboy! As president, he made some of the greatest and important changes in history, signing into law vital food and drug safety laws, thus saving the lives of millions, and establishing the National Park Service and helping start Yellowstone Park and other conservation efforts that saved the wilds of this country. He served his country in war and helped make important progress in America's position as an international power by developing diplomacy with Latin America and expanding our Navy! And talk about guts when in 1912 he was shot on his way to a campaign speech, and despite what must have been horrible pain, made his speech anyway then went to the hospital. He was a true representation of a good ol' red-blooded American!
