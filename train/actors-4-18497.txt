What I love about Woody Allen is that hes not one of those predictable directors, he is in fact the opposite and very ambiguous. Hes also one of the few directors that writes their own material instead of ripping off other peoples work and getting credit for it. When you watch a Woody Allen film theres no high expectations, you don't know what to expect as his movies are never quite the same. The only consisting theme is a jazz or 1920's/1930's soundtrack and the same font in the credits. I loved Sweet and Lowdown, Celebrity and Hannah and her Sisters. I didn't like Annie Hall or Manhattan, but Everyone Says I Love You was in-between. For me personally I would rather see a movie with no expectations than go to see one where I was sorely disappointed due to high expectations.
