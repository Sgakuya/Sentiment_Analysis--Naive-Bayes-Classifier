Wile Janet Reno's unspeakable handling of the Elian Gonzales case has earned her, on top of her other shortcomings, the spite and hatred of the whole Cuban American community and of many decent other Americans, we must never forget how grateful we can be to her for being the One person who managed to have G.W Bush elected President. That the election boiled down to two counties of Florida, with a million Cuban votes and only 547 decisive votes (or 2 per 1000 of that electorate) can be regarded as an Act of God or Immediate Retribution. That will not bring the little boy back, but it does give a meaning to his plight. Thank you Janet !!!
