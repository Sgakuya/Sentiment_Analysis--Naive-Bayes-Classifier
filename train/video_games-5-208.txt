FINELLY!!!!! a game that can actually challenge me!! every shooter i've ever played was usually medium to easy, but this game finelly gave me what i need! it got an amaizing atmosphere, there were occasions in which i was afraid to continue because i didn't wanted to get killed. it allows you to play as alien, predator or marine, which all are extriemly diffrent from each other, which force you to play with diffrent strategy. as alien you got to be quick, as the marine you must be accurate with your shooting, as the predator you must stay hidden and use the surprise element, but the good thing is that all the good things you have as one of the characters turns against you with it's full fury when you play against it. the alience are so quick and lethal it took me alot of time to learn to stay cool and not panic shoot my whole ammo each time i see an alien, as alien you got to be evry very fast, not let even a single bullet hit you, because it all that it takes sometimes to kill you, and as a predator it takes some time to learn how to moderate your energy in some very demanding levels. the graphic is great, and the movies are amaizing, as good as blizzard's. bottom line: the best FPS ever!
