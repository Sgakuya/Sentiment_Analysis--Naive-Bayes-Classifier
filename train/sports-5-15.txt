Alomar is perhaps the most underrated superstar in baseball today. For starters, he is the best defensive second baseman in MLB history. He is incredibly quick leading to tremendous range and has a great arm. In addition, he can flat out hit. His career average is well over .300 and he had an off-year this year hitting around .290 with about 20 homers and 90 RBI. Alomar is also a threat on the basepaths. It seems like he has been in the majors forever, but is only around 32. Unfortunately, Alomar hasn't been respected as a player since the incident when he spit in the umpire's face. Since then, however, he has gotten on friendly terms with the umpire and quietly donated thousands of dollars to fight the disease afflicting that umpire's son. Alomar is a certain, first ballot hall of famer who we are going to miss when his playing days are over.
