'Take A Bow' is one of my favorite songs of all-time. And the music video itself was memorable. Who can forget the storyline of the brash matador taking on the bull (which serves somehow as the metaphor for his star-crossed relationship with Madonna)? Splashed with nostalgia, the music video somehow pays homage to great matadors such as Manolete and Joselito (both tragic figures), combined with the 1930s pre-Francisco Franco Spain mixed with the 1990s and television media. The music video was simply a masterpiece with the dark visuals (representing the relationship and the bullfighting spectacle) complimenting the slow, sad overture of the musical score. If A-Ha's 'Take On Me' was the quintessential music video of the 1980s, then Madonna's 'Take A Bow' deserves some recognition as perhaps one of the better videos of the 1990s.
