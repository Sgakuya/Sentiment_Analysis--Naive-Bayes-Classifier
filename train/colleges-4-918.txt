I have attended CTU online for two years and I am graduating in one week. Online education is not for everyone, if you do not have self discipline or the ability to write well, this is not the forum for you. If you want to be a doctor, lawyer or computer programmer this is probably not the college for you either. As for the curriculum, it is for working professionals not kids that know enough to fill a thimble. Most of the people that have a problem with CTU are too lazy to focus on the work and want more down time. The curriculum is aggressive on time but manageable and achievable. Pick CTU if you want a fast paced track to your degree and the degree isn’t too technical. As for the cost, what technology is cheap today? As for the books, I have sold 16 of 22 books on Amazon with no problem. My only complaint would be the group work; it is never very comfortable or productive but gets the point across. Personally I am blessed, I make a ridiculous salary for a 30 year old with a HS diploma, I needed my degree to validate my rare experience. My degree being in business is perfect for this forum and I can see where computer programming would be a challenge. Overall CTU is a good fit for most of their programs, keep in mind with the price you are paying for technology, support, and convenience of not driving your car to a place where kids are hanging out and planning Saturday’s drinking binge.
