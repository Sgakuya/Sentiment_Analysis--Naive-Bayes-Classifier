A message for Vice President Gore. Please be yourself! You are so convincing when you say what you believe. You have a tremendous record of public service and your opponent does not. You have the right experience to be president and your opponent has next to none. I am frightened to think what will happen to women's rights, the environment and education if you are not elected. Please speak out more forcefully on these issues as I know you are passionate about them. I am not looking at your tie, your hair or whether you look relaxed or are funny. This is not an audition for a B movie. This is for the most powerful position in the world. You have to be president or we will slide back into the dark ages!
