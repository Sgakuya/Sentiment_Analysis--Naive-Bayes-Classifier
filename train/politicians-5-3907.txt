I believe it's about time that someone wasn't afraid to make a conservative stand. As a conservative Christian, GWB's stand on banning partial-birth abortions is great!!! I think that if a woman doesn't want a baby the time to decide is before conseption not after. Please do away with the marrage penalty tax. As a working wife and mother of four, life is hard. I don't have any retirement anyway and no insurance, so every prescription and doctor's apointment is paid for in cash, the insurance programs don't work for the working middle class. We make to much for state help but not enough to purchase insurance. I think with a grass roots coalation of conservative leadership America can get back to a more moralistic and Christian life. These priciples are what founded our country, and they will still work today. I would like to see something done with NAFTA, which is ruining the agriculture in America, and use our surplus grains to make ethanol for fuel. Go for it Mr. Bush but don't forget about the grassroots people that are helping to push you forward.
