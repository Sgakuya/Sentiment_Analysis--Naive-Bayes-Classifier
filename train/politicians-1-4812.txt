Here's another one totally unequiped to serve even as Congressman, yet has the temerity to run for the highest office in the land. Just another self-impressed member of the country club set who was made by his greedhead of a father. If you took this guy's $$$$ away from him, he'd only be suited to be a bartender at some joint that caters to snooty, rich, old farts. His championing of a flat tax tells you exactly where he's at, namely, shifting the tax burden onto the shoulders of what remains of the middle class, and the poor, and taking the fatcats, who all certainly can afford to pay much higher taxes, off the hook. He's the type who often jokes, Only peasants pay taxes. What was paticularly unnerving about this guy was that leering idiotic grin and the fact that he never blinked his eyes: this would lead one to think that he has a tumor lurking somewhere in that mushy tissue he refers to as his brain.
