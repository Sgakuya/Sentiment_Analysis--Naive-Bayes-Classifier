And so the buck keeps being passed around. No, it's not the illegal immigrants at fault for breaking our laws to come here...it's the redneck bigots fault. No, it's not the fault of the twenty something year old for sleeping around with every person he or she meets and then the girl get's pregnant...it's those damn members of the radical right. No, it's not the fault of the man on welfare who has six kids, doesn't pay child support, but drives a Mercedez...it's the fault of those evil, greedy rich people who actually work for their money. So yeah, let's keep on blaming problems on those we disagree with instead of holding people accountable for their actions. I guess that why President Bush is an embarassment and personifies everything wrong in this county- he dares to question the naive and complacent attitude that is costing Americans thier jobs, homes and livelyhood.
