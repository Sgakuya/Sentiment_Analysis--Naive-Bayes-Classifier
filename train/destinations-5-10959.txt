Paramount's Kings Dominion in Virginia boasts the most roller coasters on the east coast--and they DO have a lot! They have incredible roller coasters, like The Outer Limits: Flight of Fear, a full-indoor coaster in the dark which starts off at an insane speed and doesn't let up until the end; the Grizzly, a great old wooden roller coaster nestled in the woods which will jar every bone in your body; the Shockwave, one of few stand-up roller coasters; the Drop Zone, which is simply a straight-downward drop . . . but, from 305 feet up! It's a HUGE rush! They also feature the Extreme Skyflyer, which is pretty much a ten-story free fall on a cord (this feature requires an extra fee of $15 to $20). They have a Nickelodeon kids area and waterpark area. Almost every year, they've got a new coaster. Food isn't too good, but you won't be thinking too much about food anyway when you're there. Admission is fair, for all the rides you get. Not as beautiful as the nearby Busch Gardens, but it's hard to see the scenery at 80 mph, anyway.
