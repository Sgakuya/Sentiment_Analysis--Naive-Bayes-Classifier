DeVry University is a great University if you are there to really learn. Like any college, there are slackers, students that will complain about the system no matter what, and students who care about learning and getting their work done. I go to the DeVry campus in Long Beach, CA and I have learned a ton! Devry is a great University to go to if you are a full time employee and want to get your undergraduate degree. I work 32 hours a week and I've found that it is much more difficult to try and attain a BS/BA at any other University. The professors are very knowledgeable, Devry's online undergrad courses are awesome, and Devry offers a full normal summer semester, which most other Universities do not offer.
