Let me just start by saying AT&T is nothing but a bunch of greedy A-HOLES! I had phone service with sprint, local and long distance, and not only did ATT charge me for long distance, but they ILLEGALLY switched me to their long distance! I have been trying to get a matter of $616 resolved with them for over a year now, i even got the public utilities commission involved, and they actually lied to them too. i am 18 yrs old and barely starting to establish my credit, and because of ATT i have a debt on their already. i hate ATT with a passion...i think they should be sued and sued and sued till they have no more money left to run their greedy, money hungry corporation.
