You can tell when a company has spent a lot of time and energy on their product, even if you don't like it. It shows... it just gives you that feeling that this piece of software is REALLY well done. Tomb Raider 3 is not one of these games. The Tomb Raider series has been going down hill since one. They've been using the same engine, even with the last one, which was released earlier this year. The graphics are not terrible. The gameplay, however, is. Lara's jumping, shooting, dodging, and key-pounding puzzles are not only infinitely tedious, but they are insanely difficult! At best, you will have to try three or four times for the hardest ones before you get them right! Lara is hard to maneuver at times. She does have lots of cool moves though... but it doesn't save the game. The music is practically non-existent, and the sound effects leave some to be desired. I think the original Tomb Raider had it right, because it was so innovative! But the rest have just been copy-cats, and the style is getting old. I would have liked to see more action and fighting, with a more streamlined combat system. The adventuring portion of this action/adventure has great potential, too. I hope that in future games, they will have better puzzles and combat, not to mention a new engine!
