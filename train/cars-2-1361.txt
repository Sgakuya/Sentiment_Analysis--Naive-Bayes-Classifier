I have a 2002 Jeta Wagon 1.8T, it's a great car as long as the clutch doesn't go on you after 14,000 miles. I've been driving stick for 20 years, and my last Jeta (115HP) I had for 4 years with only one problem that required service. I bought my 1.8 and a buddy of mine liked it so much we he bought one as also. Well, we've bother replaced the clutch on our cars, he paid $1400, I paid $1800. Not only that, but taking a car that is 1 1/2 years old back to the dealer, the charge $500 to drop the trans to check if it;s the clutch or transmission. If its the trans, they replace for free since its under warranty, if it's the clutch, you pay $1800. If you don't want it replaced, you need to pay the $500 for dropping that trans. Sad to say, it the last VW I'll ever buy. Not that VW cares, but this whole episode left a very, very bad taste.
