I think Mr.Hanks is the best actor and human being of all time.Thousands of great actors have come before him and will be remembered in film and television history.I believe that Mr.Hanks will be remembered with all the greats,and deserveingly so. Tom Hanks I feel always shows not only the reality of his character,but with his fine acting reflects the reality of his character's situation in a way that I have never seen before. In closing, what can I say the guy moves me. When he is funny,his characters make me laugh.When his characters are serious,I feel as though I am not watching a movie but that I am living in that situation along with them. My favorite movie is Saving Private Ryan .I have seen it many times and when his character Capt.John Miller dies at the end I can't get through it without crying,every single time. Keep up the great work Tom,and thank you for making movies enjoyable,and the great craft that they are.
