I'm generally a generous reviewer, but there's just no excuse for Robert Jordan's atrocious Wheel of Time novels! Using a fantasy setting, Robert Jordan tells some decent but ridiculously and pointlessly, fancily worded tales, thinking he can impress you with his use of Thee and Thou. It didn't work for me. For some reason, they're ridiculously popular. I guess it makes people feel like they're intelligent. You would be much better off reading a Tolkien book and getting some actual decent literature than this. Comparing Robert Conan the Barbarian Jordan to Tolkien is like comparing a pebble to Mt. Olympus! I would almost suggest that you build your house with them, but bricks are cheaper and much more stable.
