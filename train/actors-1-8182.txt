Beautiful face, good family connections in the business, shame about the acting. To get an idea just how overrated Ms. Fonda was as an actress, watch country singer Dolly Parton and comedian Lily Tomlin blow her off the screen in 9 to 5, with performances far more natural and interesting than Fonda's. Her character looked like like Dustin Hoffman's in Tootsie ... except Hoffman was more convincing. Her political judgment was even worse--her actions gave a black eye to all loyal, principled Americans who opposed the Vietnam war...and there were a million times more of us than there were Ho Chi Minh groupies like Ms. Fonda, despite what today's right-wing war lovers would like everyone to believe.
