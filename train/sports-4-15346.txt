It's amazing how well this kid is doing. He came on pretty strong late last year, and alot of people began talking him up because of it. I didn't hop on the bandwagon then, but it's kind of hard not to now. I feel that he has been the most reliable and productive quarterback all season. He has outperformed even Peyton Manning. Say what you want to about Peyton winning the duel in between the two because the simple truth is both teams really just proved how grossly weak their overrated defenses were. If Carson can either take the Bengals deep into the playoffs or performs this highly again next year, I'll rate him a 5. UPDATE: Ouch! It sounds like his knee injury is pretty serious. Normal time for a torn ACL could be anywhere from 6 to 9 months. It surely will affect his ability to play next season, the only question is how much... If he turns out to be okay and leads his team as he did this season, then I'll rate him a 5.
