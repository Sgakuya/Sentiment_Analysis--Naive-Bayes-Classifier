He freed his country from the Batista regime...and that included our big business and the mob. They may not have our glitzy, useless products, but they do have superior education and medicine. Our embargo is a national shame, supported by only one other small country (can't remember it's name right now). It seems like a national temper tantrum. The Miami Cubans are those who lost their corrupt power and millions...they don't represent the Cuban people. These are our neighbors! We should treat them as such. None of this would have happened if we had responded to Castro when he appealed to us for help right after the successful revolution. It wasn't a Communist revolution, but he had no choice but to go to the USSR for help when we refused. We forget that we had our own revolution. and there is often no other way for the people to gain their rights. It's time we repaid our debt. Our mob and big business ripped off that small country for generations. Let's admit the facts and go about doing the right thing at long last!
