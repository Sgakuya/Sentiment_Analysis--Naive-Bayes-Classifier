Who would be that dumb/ignorant to give this less than a perfect rating? KIND OF BLUE cannot possibly be lower than first, second, or third on anybody's list of greatest jazz albums of all time. Don't you remember the first time you heard the opening notes of this album? Hey, I love rock. . .but Jazz goes places that rock cannot reach. KIND OF BLUE is a great place for people to start building their CD collection of Jazz music. (Fellas- this is a great CD to have in the player when that special someone comes over when you are cooking dinner- the 'sensitive but masculine and intelligent' bs that you want to project.)
