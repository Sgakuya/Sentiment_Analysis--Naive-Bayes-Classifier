This is the best album in the world!!! It deserves every star it can get! 5 is not enough!! The title song is a great way to open the album, and put us on our feet and in the mood to rock! Cover Me is equally rockin, and adds a bit of sex appeal (which the boss had plenty of to begin with!). Then come Darlington County and Working on the Highway, 2 songs that not only rock, but tell stories about middle class Americans. Then, Downbound Train, the album tearjerker about a man who loses his love and can only get a menial job, and the very atmospheric I'm on Fire add a touch of softness, a chance to mellow out. Then, side two brings us No Surrender, which welcomes us right back into true rock! Then, we hear Bobby Jean, an equally rockin song with a bittersweet storyline about losing a best friend. Then comes my favorite track, I'm Goin' Down. This song, despite its lyrics is perfect to blast on the car radio in the summer! I could talk all day about how great that song is, but I won't. Instead, I'll say that the next track, Glory Days is equally good summertime party material. It will no doubt make anyone think if maybe their glory days have passed! Then comes my other favorite track, Dancing in the Dark. What else is there to say? Dancing in the Dark is just amazing! And of course, the album ends on a hometown American note, with the soft and memory filled My Hometown. Anyone who wants a break from the regualar radio garbage should seriously consider buying this! You won't regret it! In fact, you'll regret it if you don't!
