I know that there has been all sorts of controversy surrounding this story, but I think the book as well as the movie are interesting. I think what makes this story so scary is not so much the green ooze dripping out of the walls or the appearance of hundreds of flies...but that this is based on some true events and what the Lutz Family has based on events that happened to them. This idea these evil spirits that inhabit this Long Island home has never been proven or more importantly, disproved...so I guess that is why when I watch this movie it does disturb me a little. The movie itself is a true haunted house classic that can be taken seriously or as a joke by whomever is watching it depending on your point of view concerning the events surrounding its creation. To this day when I pass by a gambrel style house with windows staring out from it's top attic, the first thing that comes to mind is that house in Amityville!
