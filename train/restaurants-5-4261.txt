Though one of our company suits said the place was terrible, my family has gone there three times and have been pleased every time. I have had the Penne Rustica (a flavorful bowl of true comfort food), Grilled Pork Chops (Delisiozo), and Tuscan Steak (big tasty hunka meatsa). The panne bread dipped in olive oil, by itself is great. Deserts are also exceptional; in fact, their cheesecake was almost as good as Cheesecake Factory's flavorful offerings. My one gripe: They use this very heavy, stiff paper for tableclothes. My wife and I average about 3 nasty paper cuts per sitting. One waitress (obviously not very knowledgeable on inherited diseases) said to me while blood was oozing out of my finger from a paper cut, I hope you don't have sickle cell. (HUH!!!??? Think she meant hemophilia).
