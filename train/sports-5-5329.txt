I am sick and tired of people who don't know what it takes to make it critisizing players, If he weren't anygood or if he was not talented enough he would not have gotten drafted 7th overall. Mostly everone that has something bad to say have never played a game in thier life thier records are 0-0. Kirk Hinrich may not be the flashy athlete that you want to sit at home and watch but he can play ball and is going to make a living doing it, i do not need to get into what he does well and why he is so good, if you critics knew anything about basketball you already know why he is good. go see Nick Collison's ratings there is a lot i said about Nick Collison and Kirk Hinrich mainly directed to the undefeated critics
