UPDATE: Having just listened to the 23-CD audio version of the book, and studying it a bit deeper, I can see the importance of the book. It allows HArry to grow up, like most 15 year olds do. It is a good transitional book, and a very important book in the series. --------Maybe it is just me, but this fifth book in the series is just a bit disjointed. Rowling seems to take delight in tormenting Harry. It is unrealistic that one person could exert so much control over a school, even if she is from the ministry. Still, Harry wins out and saves the day. The longest book of the series so far. Like I said, it seems disjointed and needlessly cruell and complicated. Some of the younger readers may find it difficult.
