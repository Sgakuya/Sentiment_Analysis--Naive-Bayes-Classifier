I think its so sad that WVU fans make the entire school look so bad with their poor sportsmanship. VT fans travel everywhere except WVU and there are soo many reasons. We treat fans nice. We dont throw objects at them that could potentially cause concussions. The entire environment at WVU is outrageous. Its so rude and makes the stereotypes of West Virginia people seem true. When fans spit on opponents fans, throw batteries at them, cuss out small children, pee on their cars, destroy their cars, etc. then its reached a point when I think WVU fans need to get a reality check. IF you are helping the stereotypes of West Virginia by participating in these events, then you have absolutely NO RIGHTS what so ever to get angry if someone says oh you married your sister, or you have no teeth, or you are ignorant... BECAUSE YOU ARE ACTING LIKE THE SORT OF PEOPLE WHO DO THIS!!!!
