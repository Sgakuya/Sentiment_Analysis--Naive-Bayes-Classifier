At first glance, Saint John will appear to be a foggy, industrial port city but to really appreciate it, there are several things you must do: 1) go to the City Market (7 days/week), 2) walk the historic streets of uptown/downtown to absorb a genuine 19th century architecture/streetscape & visit Kings Square & Loyalist Burial Ground, 3) go to Falls View Park to view the Reversing Falls (don't go at slack tide!), 4) hike a nature trail in Rockwood Park, 5) definitely hike a coastal trail in the Irving Nature Park, 6) go to the New Brunswick Museum at Market Square - well worth a visit! Saint John is the oldest incorporated city in Canada, not to be confused with St. John's (Newfoundland) which is the oldest city in Canada. Saint John has a character which grows with each visit I make. In the 1870's it had a larger population than Toronto and Princess Street was the Wall Street of Canada. Decline in shipping/manufacturing and some urban blight has left Saint John with some undesirable areas, but overall it's well worth a day or two of exploring.
