Just to set the record straight, Big Baby, it is NOT the same truck as the LandCruiser. The LX470 has a height-adjustable air suspension with 4 different degrees of firmness from Sport to Comfort which is not present on the Toyota. The ride and handling is completely different. Take them out back to back--you'll see what I mean. Additionally, the amount of sound insulation is greater in the Lexus and the interiors are differently appointed. The Lexus has considerably more wood and leather, as well as a world-class stereo from Mark Levinson. It's okay to not like this truck, but don't inaccurately slander it or hate it because you can't afford it.
