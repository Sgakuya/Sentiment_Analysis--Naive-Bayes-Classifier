It's a real pity there aren't more ryes on the market. Jim's Rye has got to be one of the best buys in American liquors: it's got a lovely, smooth bourbon-like flavor but the unique "dustiness" of rye. Before Prohibition, rye was the pre-eminent American whiskey; afterwards, because corn was more plentiful for distillation than rye, bourbon became the American whiskey. Pick up a fifth, it's only around eight to ten bucks. Most people have never tried rye; ask for it in a bar and you may get a quizzical stare. Jim Beam Rye, a/k/a "Yellow Label" is an elegant whiskey but it leaves you wondering what the really great ryes of yore must have tasted like. Some "antiques" if you can find them are Pikesville Rye and Sazerac Rye. Good luck. I've only tasted Pikesville and would give it five stars, but three ryes in the world (Canada's "Old Overholt" is another) is not much basis for comparison, is it? I bormally drink Jim Beam Rye on the rocks or neat, but the classic rye cocktail, is called a Sazerac. The recipe is a combination of an Old Fashioned and a Martini: Soak a cube of sugar in Peychaud's (not Angostura) Bitters. Muddle it in a glass with a one-count of Pernod, Ricard or, if you're lucky enough to have it, an absinthe. Add rocks and a five-count of rye. Strain into a cocktail glass. Cheers. Let's hope for a revival of fine ryes soon.
