Fine second album from late '67. While IMO this band never quite put out a true, 5 star, all songs are great album, they never put out a poor one either, (though "The Soft Parade" indeed is about half lousy- a few real clunkers on it- and was probably their worst except for the 2 they put out without Morrison, I haven't heard those in their entirety, and I think the surviving members refuse to release those, but from what I have heard..well, the results ain't pretty).They certainly had quite a few splendid songs on this one, such as the title track."Horse Latitudes" is really weird, certainly one of the strangest psychedelic tunes from a major act of the period." When the Music's Over" is one of their long epics like "The End" or the title track to "The Soft Parade." "People Are Strange" and "Love Me Two Times" were the hits, and the best known songs on this, both have been covered by several bands since. Somewhat similar to the debut overall, but a bit more trippy in keeping with the spirit of the times.
