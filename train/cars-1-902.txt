I have a GTX-RFI. I rate it terrible because of build quality and durability. I've had nothing but problems with the ski and it's something different every time. For one, it eats batteries (5 to date), It's had charger problems, oil delivery problems, oil tank welds leak, resonator has blown, Rectifier has blown, and the console buttons push into the steering wheel rather than held in place by whatever SeaDoo uses to attach them. I've had to be towed in twice. It also almost sunk because of a bad seal at the drive shaft. I contacted Seadoo for some goodwill jestures from them and of course they would hear no part of it. This is in spite of some documentation above showing at the dealer as prior warranty problems. SeaDoo makes a nice riding ski, a good looking ski, but I will NEVER buy another. I just bought a new Yamaha FX cruiser and will be replacing the Seadoo with another brand, possilbly Polaris once I've researched it. My suggestion is to stay away from Seadoo products and stick with durable manufacturers. There's no excuse for any one ski to be as troublesome as mine has been.
