We've owned this for 8 months and LOVE it. There's not been a single problem with it. The gas milage is 16 around town and 22 on the highway and that's ok considering it's a solid, heavy duty vehicle. The acceleration is very good. The interior on the sport is fine. The seats are very comfortable and the car is very quiet. There's a very solid tight feel that gives the impression it will last for ever. We take this on frequent excursions of 7 to 8 hours and find it very good for long trips. After the hard winter we had in NY I can tell you that in the snow this is a tank. It seems unstoppable. I drive a big 3/4 ton Dodge 4WD pickup on my job and this little SUV will go places the dodge won't go. It seems that the people who rated this vehicle low don't even own one but have some kind of grudge against Jeep or something. The people who really own one rate it high. I recommend this vehicle highly.
