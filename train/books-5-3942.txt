A masterpiece of alienation and emotional estrangement. Camus was truly prescient when he penned this book decades ago in that the main character, a remorseless and unfeeling human monster, is presented as being a very rare case. Now in the millenial new world order, it appears half the people you meet in the street are as disconnected and deranged as the main character of this yarn. Seems that psychological tendencies that were once considered deviations from the norm have become commonplace. In this, Camus sensed the disquieting trends of reduced affect in post WWII man and used it as the theme of his first novel. Intriguing premise brilliantly executed.
