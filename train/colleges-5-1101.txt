First off, I don't even know what this site's legitimacy and reputation are. It is possible that my comments may not be read by anyone who is truly interested in getting solid, frank insight into schools. But I accidentally happened upon this site and felt it necessary to express myself. As a 1996 Cornell alum, I can look back at my four years on the hill and smile. The academics were very intense, but I don't remember the late nights studying in my fraternity or library, taking tests, or writing papers. The friendships I formed and memories of hanging out and having a good time will always be a part of me. There is so much I can say about Cornell, but if I had to summarize it in one phrase it would be unparalled opportunities . It outstanding academic and social atmosphere make it a place where you can reach your full potential, become the person you want to be, and reach your dreams. The rigorous curriculum made me a workhorse capable of defining and takling virtually any problem and sticking with it when others have given up. I encourage anyone who desires to gain the knowledge and mindset to become a hard and perservering worker while having a good time to go here.
