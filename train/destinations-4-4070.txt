An intriguing place... The entire population of the area is about two million, yet people do not seem to think of it as a major metropolitan area. Even more intriguing though, the region that is home to Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell seems to be in continuous conflict betwwen the young and the old. Though the seven cities contain high black, Filipino, and Asian populations, old, conservative, white men certainly make their presence felt, especially in government. Aside from that, I really like this place. Downtown Norfolk is improving rapidly. Chesapeake is where a lot of people prefer to make their homes, and Virginia Beach in the summer can resemble South Florida, Daytona Beach, or anyother place like that. Newport News and Hampton can be a little rough, but they've got grit - and I like that. The Tidewater region is also big on hip-hop music. Many rappers are from here and the many rappers that are not from here still come here to record and make a second home. While playing with the radio dial, you can find about five hip-hop stations - that is more than Chicago or L.A. Overall, this place is not perfect, but it is a nice vacation spot with good universities and entertainment. It is probably the best city (or cities, really) in Virginia (Northern VA is nice, but without D.C., it would not be anything special).
