an interesting comedy. Peter Sellers is very good as Chance, the gardner, He has a simple mind and spent his whole life living in this house his mother worked in. He lived there until the old Man died. the realtors put him out in the street. he has an obsession with watching tv and when wandering alone in streets he is watching a department store tv. when a Limo backs into him. A very rich nice lady brings him in the car and takes him back to her huge mansion to be cared for.{he had a leg imjury} since they do not know him they mistake his simple comments as a kind of genius. they also think his name is Chauncey Gardner instead of Chance the Gardner. It shows how people can mistake a person for someone else. Has some good funny scenes. Shirley MacClaine is good too.
