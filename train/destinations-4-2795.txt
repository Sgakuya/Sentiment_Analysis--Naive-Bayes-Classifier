Montreal has been good to me. I probably went 20 times from '97-'00 for the underage drinking and gambling. The casino is beautiful and the bottom floor is glass with water underneath; really cool. If you're American your dollar goes far in Canada. And I've found the girls to be friendly to Americans and I always did well at the dance clubs. Of course it was always the rich girls who were up from Boston that I had luck with but hey that's alright. It does have 2 knocks though - 1) it's kinda sleezy with strip clubs, peep shows, and panhandlers on every single block and 2) don't go from Nov thru Feb it's way too cold.
