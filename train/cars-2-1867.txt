I owned a Stratus for 8 months and just a week ago it was totaled! I didn't like that vehicle 2 months after I had it. The vehicle looks fairly new but sounds and runs horrible. I bought it with 15 miles on it brand new and had to take it back to the dealer the next day the horn didn't work. Then the spark plugs had a problem. It was a 4 cly sucked gas like an 8 cyl. I am glad I don't have that fuss anymore. Also when I bought the vehicle the stratus wasn't even blue booked so I waited and as soon as it was booked it depreciated almost 10 grand it is a pile of s*t. I would never by a dodge car again. I am now buying a 2004 Buick rendevous. My opinion is to buy used cars they have already depreciated and the kinks have been worked out. If you own a gm vehicle I have a service to run reports such as carfax but the difference is that I have all the info even if it wasn't reported unlike carfax. If you need a build sheet or dealer information, recall check, shop manuals, owners manuals, and much more e mail me at gmautohistory@yahoo.com. You can also find me at allexperts.com under gm/gmc.
