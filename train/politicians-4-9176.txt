William McKinley took office at a time when the United States was on the road to becoming a world empire. His Presidency marked the true transition into the twentieth century and set the political stage for the next couple of decades. [1. Leadership: **** out of ***** Stars] William McKinley was a great wartime President whose vigorous foreign agenda set the nation on the road to empire. However, in other areas he failed to exhibit certain amounts of leadership. He did little to address the growing disfranchisement and exclusion of black Americans fromm political power. He also issued no formal protests to the lynchings that were occuring in the South. McKinley also failed to propose laws to fight monopolies, which was the major issue of the day. During the preceding months leading up to the Spanish-American War, McKinley proved to be decisive and willing to negotiate. The Cubans had rebelled from Spain in 1895, and Americans began to fight on the side of the rebels. McKinley proposed a peaceful resolution to Spain, but to no avail- Spain declared that it would not give up Cuba without a fight. When the Battleship Maine exploded in 1898, McKinley was quick to respond to the rumors that Spain was behind the explosion, getting Congress to declare war on April 25, 1898. After 3 months of warfare, which was mainly fought at sea, Spain began to talk peace and a cease-fire was declared on August 12. In the subsequent treaty, the U.S. gained several territories. In short, McKinley proved to be an efficient wartime leader, but failed to deal with the disfranchisement of black Americans in the South. [2. Foreign Affairs: **** out of ***** Stars] As I stated before, McKinley definately proved to be an effective wartime leader. It is unquestionable that McKinley's heart lied in foreign affairs and setting the nation on the path to empire. As a result of McKinley's bold leadership, the Spansh American War was won in a little less than 4 months and the United States did gain several territories as a result. After the Spanish American War, the U.S. gained, among other territories, the Phillipines. A rebellion broke out in 1899 which forced McKinley to send in thousands of troops to the islands, and a small war lasted until 1902. This arguably justified the future interventions in Korea and Vietnam. Whether this was a necessary intervention is to be debated. His Open Door policy with China recognized china as an independent nation and called for free trade in China. This Open Door Policy laid the groundwork for American trade in the 20th Century. He put down a rebellion which sought to install a dictator in China with military force. [3. Economic Management: *** out of ***** Stars] William McKinley was not expected to be a strong economic leader given his McKinley Tariff which was passed when he was in the Congress in 1890 and contributed to the worst economic depression in 1893 up until that time. However, he did finally establish the balance between gold and silver in American currency. In 1900 he signed the Gold Standard Act which formally placed U.S. money on the Gold Standard. All currency from that point on was fully backed by gold. However, the Dingley Tariff which passed with McKinley's signature again rasied rates nearly 50%. McKinley's extreme economic tariff policies had a terrible effect on American merchants. [4. Vision For The Country/Accomplishments: *** out of ***** Stars] McKinley in foreign affairs came into office with a clear agenda for the United States, and he did achieve his empire goals somewhat with the acquisition of several territories in the Pacific and Carribean after the Spanish-American War. However, in domestic affairs, he did not exhibit much leadership, proposing no new laws to battle big business monopolies or Civil Service reforms. [Final Score: 3.5- **** out of ***** Stars]. In the final analysis, McKinley definately proved to be an important transitional figure and set the scene for the 20th century. He was definately a true imperialist. Whether the foreign agenda that he pursued was postive or negative is for you to decide. His bold establishment of free China and the Open Door Policy established the United States as a true world superpower.
