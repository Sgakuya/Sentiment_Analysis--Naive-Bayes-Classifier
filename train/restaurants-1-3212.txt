On Jan. 7,2006,I went to Papa John's to order a pizza in Oxford, Ms. So when I arrived one of the guys was on the phone while the other was making pizza as usually. Well, the guy making asked to take my oder and so I asked for the special as usual. Well he insisted that I pay after the order is fixed so I sat in the store and waited for the pizza to get done. So some other customers came in the store also to wait as well. So there order were fixed so they purchased their food and left. Well the guy brings my pizza up and says your order is ready. So, I handed him my debit card as a mature adult so he could slide the card. So i held my hand out to get it, he threw the card at me. I didn't say anything because I just got off work from working a 12 hour shift. I was tired and hungry and didn't want to cause any problems. Then he goes to the back to get the copy that i needed to sign. Well of course he throws the copies down as well as the pen. He told me which copy to sign. SO I signed the store copy and laid the pen back down. He says have a good night ma'am. I responded you too. I didnt get a attitude with him. I expected to be treated with respect as he was treated with respect. If he came to my place of business, I would never toss anything at him. I would made him feel important and appreciated him for his business. I took my pizza to my car and cried because I felt as if I was treated like trash. No one should ever have to go through that.
