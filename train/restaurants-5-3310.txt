I went to college in a town that- no lie- had about 26 pizza places to choose from. My friends and I almost always ordered from Papa John's. I like that they always give you a yummy (but fattening) buttery garlic sauce to dip your crusts in and pepperocinis on the side. I am not a big crust person- usually because small pizza places burn it and then it is hard as a rock. But when I have something nice to dip it in I'll eat it. I like the fact that while they put a good amount of cheese on the pizza, if you hold it upside down you wont get a puddle of orange grease on your plate. They also offer cheesesticks (sauceless ham and cheese breadstick thing) which I enjoy.
