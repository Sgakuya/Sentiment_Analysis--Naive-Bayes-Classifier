I've seen all his movies from Killer's Kiss to Eyes Wide Shut, and there's not a bad one in the bunch! He is undoubtedly one of the greatest ever! Just ask Speilberg, Scorcese, or Woody Allen, and they'll agree! Paths of Glory should be on the AFI top 100 along with Strangelove, 2001, and A Clockwork Orange. The only one of his movies I can't sit through repeatedly is Barry Lyndon. I can find new things to admire in his films every time I see them. His films are not for those who have short attention spans or like lots of car chases, bathroom humor, or need their plots spelled out to them. He took Stephen King's overly long, tedious The Shining and but out all the BS to make a creepy classic! I still get tears in my eyes at the end of Paths of Glory.
