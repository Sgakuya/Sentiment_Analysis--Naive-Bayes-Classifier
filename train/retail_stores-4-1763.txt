I feel really guilty about shopping here. There is so much in the news about how they mistreat their employees;they are not the kind of company I would normally support. However, I can really save by grocery shopping there, and with times being so bad, I have to watch every penny. UPDATE: I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, but I actually love Wal-Mart. They have such good deals and a wide selection. Who would have thought I could find Morrissey's latest great CD at Wal-Mart of all places? I know Wal-Mart has garnered a lot of bad publicity for their human resources practices, but the employees at my local Wal-Mart are friendly and helpful. UPDATE: Well, no, opinion, I wouldn't say Wal-Mart is the Macy's of the South. Although we don't have Macy's we have Dillards, Parisian, Belk, and Dallas has this little mom and pop shop called Neiman-Marcus. I can't believe you didn't notice these places when you lived here, unless you were running with a really rough crowd.
