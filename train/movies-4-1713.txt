Watching this film I was really struck by the sense of futility. The cinematography, the direction, the camerawork-all gave it this dark, depressing feel. Honestly i think this was done very well but it just doesn't measure up to other war movies i.e. Saving Private Ryan. My guess for this is because you really aren't afforded the time to get attached to any of characters and this made me slightly indifferent at times. That being said, I was moved by the fact that the horror of the film actually happened. I can't imagine how horrible it was for the men who served in Somalia. All in all, I think it's an impressive war flick with talented acting that showcases Josh Hartnett and Ewan McGregor especially.
