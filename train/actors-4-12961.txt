Okay, I often complain about the lack of convincing young actresses in Hollywood today. Someone told me that most young actors and actresses don't really know what they're doing, and I guess I'd have to agree. Having said that, I still like Leelee Sobieski. I really appreciate her weirdness. I didn't care for HereOnEarth as a movie in general. But in that cheesey movie NeverBeenKissed, she was my favorite character. Hollywood never cares that there a quite a few geeks out there in real life that are interesting people, and she set out to portray that. I think she did a good job. I also think she did a good job with Joan of Arc. At times she seemed to be struggling with the dramatic scenes but I didn't think she overdid it (like some other Joan of Arcs I've seen). I'll give her credit for that since she was only 16 years old (and apparently the only age-appropriate actress to ever play Joan of Arc in a movie).
