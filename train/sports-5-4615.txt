As someone who went to the University of Michigan, it pains me to give Tom Izzo five stars. But I have to do it. The man is a great coach, and he's done an amazing job with the Michigan State program. Three straight Final Four appearances? You have to start considering the Spartans as one of the elite programs these days, right up there alongside Duke, Kansas, Arizona, UNC, Kentucky... As a Wolverine fan, an article I read the other day about Izzo really gave me a sinking feeling in my gut. The article quoted a bunch of Michigan high school coaches as saying that one reason Izzo now has an edge when it comes to in-state recruiting is that his coaches will call them to check up and say hello on a regular basis, regardless of the talent the high school has at the time, while the Michigan coaches only call if there's a blue chip recruit around. Little things like that make you appreciate the foundation Izzo has built in East Lansing. Michigan's new coach, whoever it ends up being, better get on the ball.
