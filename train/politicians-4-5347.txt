The Republicans think they have perfected the character assassination ploy. Just put it out there that Al Gore is a liar and the cattle will follow. A lot have, I've read their ratings here. I'm amazed at how quickly the Republican party members latch onto a smear campaign. Al Gore exaggerated on the cost of his mother's prescription to make a point. He exaggerated on the number of days a girl was without a desk in a Florida classroom. Am I missing something here? Bush conceals his DUI conviction and is praised for being forthcoming!!! He evades most questions put to him or flat out refuses to answer (a la Papa Bush). Al Gore is thoughtful, respectable, presidential and LIKABLE! He goes overboard sometimes when answering questions but he answers them. I do not question his honesty merely because he was Clinton's VP. Now, Bush on the other hand...
