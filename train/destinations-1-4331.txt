eeeeew gross, i wish i could give it less stars. its nasty, polluted and mean. i could care less if the sun shines a lot there, you can't even see it through the brown air. there are people living under blankets and boxes in the streets, you would think you were in a third world country when you are walking through helLA. I think they should sell southern california back to mexico, it was a very bad buy in the first place, although i doubt mexico would even want it. oh and that thing that enkidu said, about there being many core centers of the city DUH! AND GUESS WHAT, THE CORE CENTERS OF CITIES ARE THE DIRTY NASTY AREAS, SINCE LA HAS SO MANY OF THEM MAYBE THAT EXPLAINS WHY IT SUCKS. and new york is the most diverse melting pot in the world, not LA, everyone knows that!
