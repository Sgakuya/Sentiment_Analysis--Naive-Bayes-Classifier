Response to below rating, Mr. Mendoza. Customer proceeded to yell at Moving Staffers Movers when they showed up at 10am (Within there 9-11am window). Then customer got extremely irate after movers explained they were there within the customer window. Customer stated she did not have payment method with her for her move and due to the 2 issues (Irate Customer, Non Payment) Movers informed the customer they could not service her. Customer called myself Mr. Mendoza and proceeded to curse at me. Customers mother called me to apologize for the inconvinience, and actions of her daughter. Moving Staffers has 98% Customer Satisfaction. Very excellent Satisfaction Ratings.
