I recently stayed at the hotel flamingo in cozumel and was presently surprised. It had been over 8 years since I had stayed there last and I was amazed with all of the changes to the property. A new owner has taken over and improved all the rooms and it now has a bar and a full restaurant. The food was excellent with the mango shrimp being my favorite. The service was top notch and the staff was very friendly. They also had internet service available and laundry service which was nice. It is downtown on a quiet street near the waterfront. I understand from the management that they are in the process of upgrading the rooms more to a 3 or 4 star rating and that a pool will be going in later in the year. I was very happy overall with the stay.
