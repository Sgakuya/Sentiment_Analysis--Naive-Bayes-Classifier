Since this is the actresses section I'm going to give a review about Cher strictly based on that. I do not care for her private life or her love for botox injections thats her business as this doesn't detract from her performance as an actress. Cher is a damn good actress and shes done better projects than some actresses on this list. The worst film I've seen Cher in is The Witches of Eastwick and even that wasn't too bad. The Mask, Moonstruck, Mermaids, Silkwood these are all good films and rather than over-act Cher was completely natural and if I remember correctly she was nominated for a supporting actress for her role in Silkwood and actually won an academy award in Moonstruck. Not bad at all.
