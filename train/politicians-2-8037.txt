Most people believe FDR's greatest contribution was ending the great depression. If that's the case, he should be rated accordingly: not only did he fail to do so (unemployment INCREASED under FDR until the onset of WWII), but his Keynesian economics made it much worse (previous depressions ran their course in 1/3 the time). In addition, he exceeded the authority of his office multiple times and when the US Supreme Court shut him down, he attempted to pack its membership by expanding its size! By the way for the liberals fawning over FDR's ghost, can you say, Japanese internment camps ? So why a two? The man showed some courage and could have done worse. He just couldn't have done much worse.
