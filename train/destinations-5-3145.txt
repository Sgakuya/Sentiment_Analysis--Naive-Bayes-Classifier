I was born and raised in Toronto, but have lived in New York, Atlanta and San Francisco and travelled all over. I will tell you quite honestly that Toronto is by far one of the most under-rated cities in North America. While I do not object to the current rankings (aside from Philadelphia's high position), I will say that Toronto is definantly on it's way to being along the ranks of Chicago & San Francisco in terms of prestige. If you know the right people (which can be difficult), Toronto is an extremely 'happening' cosmopolitan place and never ever boring. Contrary to popular thought, Toronto is extremely multicultural, diverse and sophisticated. However, It is true though that Toronto has what might be percieved as a 'snobbery' problem. But, while I love NYC and San Fransico, because of the friendly openness of folks and energetic vibe (of mainly NY), the problems that plague typical American cities are always there: obese women, high crime rates, ignorance, racial tension and dirtiness. I agree that NY dirt does add some character to NY, but let's face it: dirt sucks. It can be really plain disgusting sometimes the way it makes you feel like showering every 15 minutes. If everyone really loved the dirt, then, everyone in NY would be begging to live in the Bronx and Bed-Sty, instead of the Upper West Side. I will take Toronto clean anyday. And whoever claims that NYC has more sophistication in two blocks, must be living in a different city or confined to some place in the village. NY has plenty of pseudo-sophisticated types and unrefined (sub)urbanites - they're called middle-Americans.
