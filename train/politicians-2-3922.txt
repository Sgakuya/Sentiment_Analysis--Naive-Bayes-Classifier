I have been a strong Republican all of my voting life (25 plus years). I believed in Bush from what I saw at the Convention and his political past. Unfortunately, he is BLOWING IT! The recent errors in judgement (name calling under his breath of a reporter and the word RATS in his television add) are causing me to question his integrity. He is demonstrating to me at least, that he is no better than any other politician. He is scripted and willing to pull out all of the stops to win. If he doesn't begin to shine soon, not only will he not win over those crucial undecided voters, he may lose those conservative Republicans as well. GET IT TOGETHER, GEORGE W.!!!
