Just a wonderful city. I haven't been back since '96 but when I visited I was amazed at how much activity there was throughout the city and at all hours of the day. The strip clubs had amazingly attractive women as did the dance clubs and the people were very friendly and non-confrontational. I don't speak French and ran into some confusion at two different coffee/donut shops and the employees were very patient. The views just outside the city on the hills were breathtaking and spacious. It was cool checking out Olympic Stadium from above. I'm not too sure what its purpose is now that the team fled for D.C. Pack sweaters and a jacket if you go all during the year. When I was there in August it was 60's during the day and near 40 degrees overnight. Don't listen to the negative posts here on RIA as most who have scored the city low have never even stepped foot in Canada. And I'm not someone who hates America either and I don't have any type of political agenda but if you write this place off just because most residents speak French you are missing out.
