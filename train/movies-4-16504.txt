I enjoyed the whole movie , I though I cannot relate, I understand what it feels like to be alone , nobody paying attention to you and all. If the her so called mom paid attention to her poem at the beginning of the movie , she would not be on the floor restraining her totally reconstructed ,360 degree angle turn from doing anything else painful. BTW I have to problems with this movie; Why the f**k were all the boyfriends sheslept with were african american and I what was the ending of the movie all about! Mom and Daughter sleeping together throughout the night? the she go to therapy? the she continue on her downward spiral to armageddon! WTF happened?!?!
