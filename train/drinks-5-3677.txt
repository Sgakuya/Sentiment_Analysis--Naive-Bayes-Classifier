Ahhh, the Whiskey Sour. Funny, for a long time I was stuck in the typical girly rut of ordering nothing but fruity blended drinks and for a bit even sunk down into wine cooler territory. As I grew older those sugary sweet drinks lost their appeal to me and I started looking for a little variety, something to sip. I drank vodka/collins for a while, not that the vodka/collins combo doesn't have a lovely taste but I wanted a little more kick! to my beverage. A friend of mine suggested a Whiskey Sour. At first I was afraid, felt like a whiskey sour would be branching out into an uncharted grown up man variety of beverage, but then I tried one. Whooo wheee! The crisp sourness and the slapping bite of the whiskey made whiskey sour my drink of choice. I loved the way the sour seemed to grab right at the back and sides of my tongue as it slipped by. Delicious. I would rate this easily my #1 favorite mixed drink. Good stuff...
