As a mexican living in Madrid I have found this city rather nice. Ive read comments and the things that people on this site praise or dislike about it, and they seem a little bit shallow. There is very little tourist crime (compare it with Rome, Athens or Prague). The people seem unpleasent but thats just the way they are, you gotta understand them. Its not that crowded and there is no place on earth with such a rich nightlife. But it does have some shortcomings: its not as beautiful as Paris, nor as filled with culture like London. The weather can get quite weird (changing all the time). The education levels are poor and the universities suck. So, to sum up: great place to visit if youre backpacking (dont go to the joy or the kapital, go visit Pacha or the Moma, awesome nightclubs) or looking for Goyas or Velazquezs paintings. But i wouldnt live here, not as a student nor as a grown up guy with a family. And while youre here, go take a look at Toledo and Segovia. And eat at the sidrer√≠a sagaretxe (great meat).
