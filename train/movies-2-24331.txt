Unlike most film critics out there I know that this was a complete work of fiction and was not required to be historically accurate. With that being said I must say that my main problem with the film was that it seemed like they had trouble focusing and would jump from character to character. One thing I noticed was that the vampiress was out in the sunlight twice. If the whole vampires and sunlight thing was a myth then I would've appreciated it if they had said so. The story of Dorian Gray was interesting except that the guy was dumb enough to tell someone his one and only weakness. Also, what kept him from looking away from the painting or simply closing his eyes? Also, how come no one got the benz when the sub resurfaced so quickly? And the heat from all of that molten metal could have detonated that dynamite prematurely. I would have given this a single star but I must admit that I did enjoy how Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde were brought to life.
