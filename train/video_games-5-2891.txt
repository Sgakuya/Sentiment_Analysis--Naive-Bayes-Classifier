A thoroughly smashing piece of entertainment software with a early nineties gangland motif, featuring a soundtrack which includes such gangsta luminaries as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and the immortal 2-Pac Shakur. GTA's worrying attempt to outdo reality continues as parachuting, driving school, eating, exercising and even courting are added to the already sizable array of things to do inherited from the last game. One can now even recruit idle homies to hit up enemy hoods in attempts to gain prominence. To top it all off, it stars Samuel L Jackson as a corrupt law enforcer! Highly recommended gaming (basic knowledge of ebonics required).
