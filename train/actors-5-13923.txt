This girl is a movie star! What's that? Someone so interesting that the audience either falls in love with her, or can't keep their eyes off her. Roberts' feelings are all exposed in her face and eyes. Her face was made for a camera lens to love. Also, Americans seem to love her because they don't see much artifice in her lifestyle or behaviors. She seems to do whatever she wants, and as she has said, she's lucky, happy, rich, and working at a great job, so she has what a lot of us want. But in BROCKOVICH, Julia Roberts demonstrated that she isn't JUST the $100 million gross girl, way ahead of all the other earner/actresses; she can really act. Her friendship with Eric Brockovich was also interesting to the public (she was not allowed to meet Eric for quite a while by the director); Roberts invited Brockovish to the Oscars as her guest but Eric had to stay home to take care of a sick child. Julia Roberts is an interesting pop culture icon; she's certainly not conservative, rightwing or religious, but she represents the American girl type of woman which women also like to watch, and men like to dream about having. Five stars!
