I work for Cellular One (Dobson) and I love it. I have their services too. The thing is, when you have a problem call the customer services department and see if they can help you. I always go out of my way to help people, and I know lots of us working REALLY do care what you think of our company. Also, I don't know if you know this but there's different 'branches' of CellularONE, they're not ALL owned by the same parent company. For example, the CellularONE I work with covers MI, MN, WI, AK, MD, OH, NY, and OK. Those are the only states WE are responsible for. Please, if you have problems or questions call us! :)
