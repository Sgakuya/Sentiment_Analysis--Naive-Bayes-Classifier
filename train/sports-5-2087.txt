Currently my fav. baseball team after dumping the San Diego Padres (who WERE my fav. baseball team up until this year). The Dodgers had always been my 2nd fav. team and I wish they had always been my fav. Any team affiliated with San Diego are losers. There's something very amateur and stupid about San Diego and it's taken me, unfortunately, my whole life to realize it. Their teams are losers; they suck. The community is full of stupid, culture-less people. L.A. has a pretty good lineup once again, but once again they are underachieving -as they most the time do. They really should be putting up a lot better numbers offensively with the talent they have. Their pitching has been very solid this year, though.
