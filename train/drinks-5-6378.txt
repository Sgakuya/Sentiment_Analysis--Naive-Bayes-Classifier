I have been addicted to Vanilla Coke for some time, and I knew this was bad for me, so I was quite glad when I found out they were coming out with a diet version! And even gladder when I tasted it! This is the best diet soda on the market! It doesn't taste exactly like the original, but it's very close and it's simply head and shoulders above other diet sodas. It has a very smooth taste, it doesn't have that usual diet aftertaste. Coca-Cola did a very good job with this one, and it is a product that I recommend to Vanilla Coke and Diet Coke drinkers alike. It's WAY better than that awful Diet Coke with Pledge - sorry, I mean Lemon - and I wish that they would have this in the vending machines here rather than that nasty stuff. This is practically all I drink anymore!
