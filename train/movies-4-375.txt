I was sitting in the theatre waiting for the movie to start when I suddenly realized, Gladiators are bloody!! I don't care much for bloody films. But I held fast, often covering my eyes. But the dramatic interpersonal story was great and I really felt like I had been there at that time in history, like Ghandi. I was surprised to see Oliver Reed in Gladiator. I thought he had drank himself to death- Ha! If you liked Gladiator, rent Titus. with Jessica Lang and Anthony Hopkins. It is a very very good treatment of what is considered Shakespear's first, worst (yet still very good)and bloodiest play, Titus Andronicus. An art film.
