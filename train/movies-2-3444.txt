Gotta agree with edt4 and CanadaSucks on this one. Forgetting about the politics for a moment, it was not a good film. I mean, it's entertaining I guess, and when you're 13 or something, before most people develop deep critical skills, it seems like a good film, but when you get older, you realize it's trash. As much as Rambo, this movie mirrored the general attitudes of the Reagan era. The plot was absolutely ludicrous, and the actors of this grouping- The Brat Packers and Outsiders alumni, were a bunch that I've never liked. I think it was Harry Dean Stanton who played the over the top dad on this one, I like him as an actor, but this was far and away his worst role. This was one of those films for Michigan Militia types. It was funny to see the communists parachute in and attack the school though. I was in junior high at the time, and, like most kids, there were many times I wish class could've been disrupted or cancelled, if not quite in so brazen a fashion. Not an absolutely awful film, at least, if nothing else it's watchable. Somebody please tell Sean Hannity that this is NOT a non-fiction film.
