Christian Bale is simply amazing. Not only is he wonderful on screen, but he's just as brilliant off screen. He's talented, charitable, and beautifully down to earth when it comes to his massive fan club. I noticed some people complaining that he doesn't belong in the class of Robert DeNiro and Tom Hanks, but i think that's complete nonsense. He is just as good, if not better than both of those men. And for people who think Baleheads have no life, you are mistaken! Baleheads do have lives, we just like to take a little time out to adore quite possibly the greatest actor of the millinneum. And there's nothing wrong with looking up to a brilliant man such as Christian Bale.
