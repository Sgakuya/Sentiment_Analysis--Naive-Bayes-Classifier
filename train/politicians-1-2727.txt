I agree with anonymous (1/21), and that's why I give him a one. He's not an outsider---he has a long political history---a record that's there for all to see. They all do...check them out. We shouldn't support someone because they 'look like a nice guy'. Any actor can do that...and politicians ARE actors. I think Bradley and McCain are getting Perot's people...folks who judge by appearances, by charisma (or in the case of Bradley, anti-charisma). I don't want to vote FOR any of them, but I will vote AGAINST the republican party. Neither party represents the people, but I think the GOP is further from us. Their support of corporations will do us no good at all...will harm us. These corporations have given us nothing but pollution, untested foods and medicines, a military budget that eclipses all domestic services, low wages and long hours, privatized prisons that will get inmates any way they can, and a record of worker abuse all over the planet...just to mention a few. Enter 'genetic engineering' into any search engine and see how much the world means to corporations!
