Fleetwood Mac's shining hour, a record more ambitious than Rumours, and I think superior. Rumours is a landmark and timeless in its own right, however Tusk really pushes the envelope with pop experimentation, thanks to Lindsey Buckingham. Several tracks became hits, the biggest being Stevie's haunting Sara, but all three songwriters (Buckingham, Nicks and Christine McVie) contribute one wonderful track after another--the best being Buckingham's I Know I'm Not Wrong, Walk a Thin Line and the title trcak; Nicks' Sisters of the Moon and Storms; McVie's Over and Over (beautiful!), Think About Me, and Brown Eyes. Great digital transfer as well.
