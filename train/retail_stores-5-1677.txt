I guess I shop at a different K-Mart then most of the other posters here because I love my local K-Mart. I go there all the time and I have never had a problem. I find the store is always clean and usually in good order. I've never had an employee be rude to me. In fact, a lot of the old-timers at the store I shop at know me by name bacuse I'm in there so much. They have a lot of nice seasonal stuff. Their prices are fair. True, some of their clothes are crap and look awful and worn out after a few washings, but I've also found some really nice outfits there that have lasted me quite a while. I'll pick my local K-Mart over Wal-Mart any day of the week.
