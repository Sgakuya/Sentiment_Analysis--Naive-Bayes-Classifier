I absolutely love my Venture. I bought a used one, but it runs great and has low miles. I LIKE the interior, my dash is NOT the shinny Fischer Price model. My van has a smooth ride, practically glides down the street.I have been driving it for 5 months now, took it on some long trips, it gets great gas mileage. On one trip, I even stretched out across the seats and slept quite peacefully. Seats are easy to remove and replace. My van has a sunroof and a CD player, so those are pretty nice extras. My kids absolutly love the spaciousness of it, as it is a little bit longer than the average minivan so I have noticed. I would be lost w/out it, would definately buy it again.
