This video caught my eye when I was just a baby myself, in fact only fourteen. Some how I liked from the first second, there was something about her, the way she moved and the way she sang. And the fact that there was nothing else like her out there. The song has a good swing, the video has no plot or reason, and what was at that time new and strange is now a standard for girl pop music videos. My friend, thought that this was a tirthy year old woman trying desperatly to be a teenager when she first saw this video. I had to fill her in, and since then she hates Britney Spears. This video also brings back some good old memories to me, from the time when Britney wasn't a slave for anyone, just a pretty girl who sang nice songs and wore nice, not slutty, outfits. I miss those days, but I still like her style today. She always comes back to this song and video, and you can't deny it. ...Baby One More Time is the essences of Britney Spears.
