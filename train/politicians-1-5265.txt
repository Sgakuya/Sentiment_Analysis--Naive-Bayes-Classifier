OK... I am so disappointed in Al Gore. Granted I am a Bush Fan, but get real! I just heard on the news that he wants to sue the Democratic party of Broward county and Dade county because they don't want to count the votes by hand .All the other counties have done it and he gained only 6 votes. Mr.Bush is acting like the better man now and I feel like we should be getting our Vice President a pacifier and check his diaper. Al Gore you lost! My Cousin is a die hard democrat but due to the childish behavior Mr. Gore is displaying he has refused to vote democratic again. I also heard on the radio the Gore's campaign was going to homeless shelters with absentee ballots and offering homeless people a pack of cigarettes for their vote for Gore. That is a hypocritical move from the anti-tobacco and save the earth Vice President. Gore is the reason most people will refuse to vote. I can honestly say he is the WORLDS WORST SPORT. Thanks for your time. Tina Boggs
