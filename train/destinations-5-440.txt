I loved St Kitts & Nevis. There is a bit more to do on St Kitts. I stayed at the Rawlins Plantation. I loved Rawlins Plantation! Definitely rent a car to drive around the island (carefully! the roads are mostly crap!) Go up to the fort (Brimstone Hill) on top of the mountain and imagine yourself a young conscript from 18th century london. Now you understand why the british wanted to colonise the world! In Nevis I stayed at the Ouallie Beach Hotel. Nothing special but it is right on a beach. There is a restaurant on top of the mtn (Golden Rock Plantation) on Nevis that has wonderful food. Also try the fried Flying Fish. It's a staple on most menus and it is soooo good.
