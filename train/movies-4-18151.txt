I remember my dad renting this movie when I was about ten years old, and I laid in my bed while he was in the other room watching it. The music was so scary that I couldn't even go to sleep. I just now watched the movie last week, and I thought it was really good. Not only does it make you think, but it also teaches you a lesson. The lesson is think about who you trust. The reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars is because of the ending. It really didn't tell you what happened. I don't think she became a devil follower, I guess she just cared for her baby. I didn't like the Hail Satan stuff either, because I'm a Christian. But other than that, it was good!
