THis is a really bad team. I would have rated Colorado one star but they have a home field advantage that seems to have suited them well the last few years. On the road is a different story. It is not uncommon for this team to reel off 10 straight losses while playing away from home and it should happen this season. I was just checking out their roster and there are many people I've never heard of. Their pitching staff looks as bad as Tampa's. I see they added Joe Kennedy to the staff. Everytime he pitched with Tampa last year he got trounced. Also Turk Wendell is nothing special and he's getting up there in age. The infield looks really weak with Vinny Castilla at third and Royce Clayton as the shortstop. Miles and Hocking rotating at second don't impress me either. The Rockies are a vulnerable team in the outfield as well with Wilson in center and Larry Walker in rightfield. Bottom line is this team still has some potent hitters with Jeremy Burnitz, Todd Helton, and Larry Walker but it won't be enough to offset a horrible pitching staff and a suspect defense
