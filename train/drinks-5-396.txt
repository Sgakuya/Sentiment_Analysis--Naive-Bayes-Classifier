I got turned on to drinking this beer by a german restaurant in my local mall! Now I'm picking it up at a semi-local special distrib (dang PA laws). This is by far my favorite brew with Yuengling Lager a close second. I only end up drinking more Lager cuz it's cheaper. Some people can't get past the fruity or banana taste. I always suggest a lemon if that's their reaction. Somehow, the lemon just seems to smooth and mellow it out. I drink and like it both ways. It's also one of the few beers I enjoy just as much a little less than cold. . Get your hand around one of these and you won't put it down. .plus the monk on the bottle is just cool :)
