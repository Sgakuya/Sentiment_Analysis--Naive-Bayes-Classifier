I bought a 32 Toshiba Clear Flat in March of 2003. Brilliant, and crisp picture. It had a wider viewing angle compared to conventional tubes: 160 degrees, as opposed to conventional tubes, which are usually around 130 degrees. When bright sunlight would enter my living room, it hardly reflected off the screen, due to the flatness of the screen. Conventional tubes are rounded which causes light to convex which can interfere with viewing when direct light is shining on it. I used high end components video cords for DVD and an S - cable for satellite. I found that with component cables, you have to adjust the color downward, as the definition is too great for a tube television to handle. Save those for the high - def recievers. S - cables are a good comprimise. This T.V was stolen from me when burglars broke into my home just 2 months after I purchased it. That's O.K. I've sinced replaced it with a Sony Wega and the crack that they bought from selling my T.V. is long gone....
