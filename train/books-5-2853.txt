In his book, History of the American People, Paul Johnson retains his status as the greatest historian still active in modern times.This is a man who truly loves his work, as well as his subject, the American People. It is truly refreshing to read a history of our country which isn't weighted down with the usual revisionism most of our academic historians employ.Instead the reader is treated to clear and concise treatment of our historical events with Johnson's incisive commentary. This is a Brit who really knows how to write, and who treats our country with respect when we've earned it! Oh, and about the few fact mistakes related by another reviewer, he gets a pass from me on that charge by giving you his home address so he can revise future editions if he was in error -- talk about academic integrity! When was the last time you saw that type of humility from a major author.By the way, if you haven't read his earlier book, Modern Times, don't miss it: it's a keeper!
