Washington is a nice city to visit, it has a good variety of restaurants, museums and points of interest. If you plan on moving to DC, get ready to look hard for an affordable place to live. Housing is sparse here. There are a few bad neighborhoods to watch out for. The cost of living is fairly high here, it's not the most expensive city though. Still, I like the feel of the city. The Elyseisan design makes the city look wide and open; it looks more European than most American cities. If you want to eat something different and tasty, try any of the Ethiopian restaurants in DC, excellent food. It's a must see city.
