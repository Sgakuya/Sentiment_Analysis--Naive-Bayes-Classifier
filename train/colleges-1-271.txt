I have been a facilitator with the University of Phoenix. I was a rarity at Phoenix, in that I hold a doctorate. I found the school to be a bottom rung institution. What is rarely noted by students posting here is that UOP has very little seat time compared with a traditional institution. A three credit hour class only requires six four hour sessions. This is woefully inadequate compared with a traditional setting which would require at least ten four hour sessions. The classes are split into work teams to supposedly work the additional time outside of class. What I found were homework cheaters, students who did not read the assignments, and a general lack of understanding of the material or interest to learn. If you are looking for an extremely easy degree and your employer is footing the bill, UOP is for you. If you have a desire to learn and want a degree worth having, go elsewhere.
