I have no interest in sports therefore I rarely, if ever, comment on what s going on in that world. But in this case I will make an exception. This team and its owner are currently in a power struggle with Indianapolis will they stay, will they leave, will they get their way and get a brand new stadium:::whaaaaaa::::. I couldn t care less if they get a new place to throw their ball around and knock each other down. I don t even care that they make mega bucks while their beating each other to a pulp. But what does concern me is that they want my hard earned tax money to build this palatial billion $ showplace. If they want it so badly they should sponsor it themselves instead of expecting the entire population of the city to do it for them. Just WHO stands to gain the most from this anyway? Imagine if private schools asked for this kind of backing or any other private business for that matter. People would be storming the capitol building! So, as far as I m concerned pack your bags you blue and white dumb clucks and head for the coast and when you get to the beach KEEP WALKING!
