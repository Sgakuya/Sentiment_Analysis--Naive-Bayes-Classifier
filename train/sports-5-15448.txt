When he first broke into the league, he was the best receiver in the NFL. He would get more TD receptions in a game than Keyshawn in a season. He is still in the top echelon, but I would drop him down to Top-5, picking T.O., Marvin Harrison, and Tory Holt over him. As for his personality, his goofiness should be no surprise to anybody. He was kicked out of the U. of Miami for detrimental behavior (I did not think that was even possible) and he went way down in the draft because of this risk. Moss kept his nose clean early on; but over the past few years, he has been a lightning rod of controversy. There was the driving incident where he nearly ran over a female police officer, the dousing the ref with a squirt bottle incident, his near-mental meltdown in an interview last year, walking to the locker room against the Deadskins incident, and now the moon-shot/butt-wipe affair in Green Bay. You may not know this, but Moss might have did this in reaction to Packers' fans long-standing tradition of mooning the visiting team as the bus pulls out of Lambeau Field. His interviews are always bizarro. Obviously, from a cost-benefit standpoint, the Vikings have decided that Moss is too talented to dump. As for the last two incidents, I don't think either was that heinous. When you get the Spin-master Heads of ESPN involved, they are going to spin it a million different ways to get their coveted Tempests in Teapots. Al that said, I predict that one day you will see an end-zone celebration in which one of more of the following occurs: 1) A bowel movement; 2) A Toltec-like human sacrifice; 3) a Player will grab a woman out of the stands and jump bones on National TV; 4) Something involving dynamite, wild animals, or decapitation.
