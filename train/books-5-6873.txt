As a storyteller, Martin is unparallelled. His A Song of Ice & Fire is the best fantasy series I've ever read. Martin takes tired old fantasy cliches and turns them around and backwards and to and fro. Martin takes up the point-of-view of several different characters in each book--some of the characters are good, some bad, some defy such generalizations. But lest you think that characters who get their own point-of-view are safe from Martin's axe, think again. Of the eight point-of-views presented to the reader in the first book, one is axed--quite literally. One of the other eight doesn't make it to the end of book three. And so it goes. Good guys and bad guys get the axe in the series. As Martin has said, War does not discriminate. The political intrigue--the backstabbings (literally and figuratively), the double-dealing, the political alliances--are well realized. His characters are fascinating and his pacing is perfect. This is not standard epic fantasy.
