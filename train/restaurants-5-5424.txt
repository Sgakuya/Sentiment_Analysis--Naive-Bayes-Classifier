My rating addresses the Ryans at Tyler, Texas. Since this is a buffet style restaurant, the issue of service is virtually moot, exccept to say that those who oversee the timely refilling of available selections on the buffet are both vigilant and efficient. The atmosphere is fairly typical of any similar restaurant, but the serving tables are logically and aesthetically arranged. When one considers what it would cost him to prepare for himself a full meal of the types found in Ryans, in terms of time, groceries, utilites, and so forth, the price of the meal is a bargain in spades. The food itself is tasteful and hot and fresh, and while it might not come to the table wearing the attire prepared for it by a cordon bleu chef, I submit that one should be pleased with his food not entertained by it. All in all, should one be travelling through Tyler, Texas and happen to find themselves on Broadway, do yourself and your family a favor and try Ryan's.
