Princeton is special among the Ivy League schools in its focus on the undergraduate student body. There is no medical school, law school, or B-school so the majority of graduate studies are in the arts and sciences and do not detract from undergraduate education. Money used to recruit faculty directly benefits the undergraduates. Full professors teach all courses and most often lead the small group preceptor sessions...they are among the most accessible faculty I have come accross. The campus is probably the most beaufitul I have ever seen. The social life remains a bit segmented with a lot of time spent at the eating clubs, but this is one of those things that makes Princeton unique. The athletics are top notch in many areas (including lacrosse, basketball, swimming, squash..) despite the fact that Princeton does not offer full-ride scholarships. I cannot think of a better undergraduate experience than the one I had at Princeton and feel fortunate to now be a part of the larger Princeton community.
