I really enjoyed this book, but I'm not completely convinced it's worthy of the Pulitzer Prize it won. Essentially Guns, Germs, and Steel makes the argument that civilizations advanced at different rates in different places primarily because of environmental factors, not because of differences in intelligence or work ethic. Diamond argues, for example, that complex societies arose first in the Fertile Crescent and in China because both of those areas possessed an abundance of wild plants and large mammals that happened to be highly suitable for domestication. But in Australia, on the other hand, aborigines never developed complex societies because they lacked the easily-domesticatable plants and animals that would have led them from a hunting/gathering lifestyle to sedentary farming. Societies that moved from hunting/gathering to farming could support denser populations as well as specialists (scribes, bureaucrats, soldiers), which were key ingredients for creating advanced societies. Eventually, the more complex civilizations developed the technology (guns, steel, ships, etc.), writing, centralized government, and germs (along with germ resistance) that allowed them to conquer the less-advanced civilizations. Overall, the book s power to explain huge patterns in human history is amazing. It s authoritative and scientific without being overly technical, and it s easy to read. My only complaints are that it seemed overly repetitive at times (the main theme of environment not intelligence is hammered home again and again) and it glosses over a point that to me seems extremely important: if the Fertile Crescent and China had such a head start over other civilizations, why was it Europe that became the dominant force of modern times? A few pages at the end of the book outline a possible answer to this question, but I would have liked to have seen a more thoughtful explanation.
