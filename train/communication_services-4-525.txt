I think there's a bit of truth in most of the comments posted here. I recently left Nextel because I was tired of paying $70 a month for 500 minutes a month and was lured by compact, attractive, feature laden phones with cheaper contracts. I switched to Cingular and got the 1000 anytime minute plan for $39.99 a month and added the data transfer plan for $7/mo for a grand total of $54 a month with taxes. Although this rate plan is great, I'm having serious problems with the coverage and realize now that I hate my phone. I bought the T637 Sony Ericsson and the Cingular rep I bought the phone from ended up costing me the $70 rebate through what I believe was inefficiency and sleaziness. What I realize now about Nextel was that I had crystal clear reception (nationwide) and that is worth more than anything to me. Nextel called me to woo me back and offered to take $200 off the price of the phone and gave me a great deal on the new service. Unfortunately I'm going to end up eating the $150 to early terminate with Cingular. I guess it was just an expensive lesson learned.
