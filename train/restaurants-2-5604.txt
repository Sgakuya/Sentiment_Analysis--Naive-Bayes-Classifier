Quite frankly, even though it's okay, the food is really nothing to rave about, and, more often than not, the place is infiltrated with cigarette smoke that gags me. It's just not worth it. Also, it is a total blow to my mind about the apparent rotten treatment of some of the African-American customers who pay their hard-earned money to get a convenient, satisfying meal and service with a smile. Heck, I don't think I want to grace such an establishment with my patronage, and I'm white. This hasn't been known to happen yet where I live, but it happens in too many other places to mention. I don't like to see anybody treated unfairly, especially for stupid reasons such as race, handicap, religion, political affiliation, etc. That's predjudice, and this world, which is already cruel and topsy-turvy enough as it is, doesn't need it. In the eyes of God, everyone is equal, and should be treated as such. Unfortunately, that's not the way it is.
