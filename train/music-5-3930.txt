Certainly among the cream of the crop of Classic Hard Rock Albums,Morrison Hotel showcases the Doors at the Height of their musical prowess.It kicks off with "Roadhouse Blues"-possibly one of the best down & dirty,gritty rock'n roll songs ever.Following is "Waiting for the Sun"-eerie and beautiful,unique even amidst other Doors material."Peace Frog" is another dose of great rock riffs alchemically enhanced through poetry and "The Spy" is a sly and romantic tune that conjures images of bygone times.Then there is the inexplicably ignored by radio masterpiece "Maggie M'Gill",another serving of rough n' ready blues/rock.Even the mellower songs are haunting.There is no filler on this Album.That just doesn't happen very often,even with the best bands.If you actually own the LP-you are treated to a photo inside of the band drinking at some dive with the daily denizens,not some staged "photo op" that many bands might have used.
