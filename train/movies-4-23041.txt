Our whole family saw this today.{ a big deal for all four of us to agree on a movie LOL} I thought it was pretty good. Tobey McGwire was perfect as Peter Parker the quiet nerdish high school boy who gets bit by a special spider He soon finds out he has these spider like powers.After his uncle is killed by a thief he decides to help out others who are in danger. Of course as in any comic book hero movie there is the Villan who has his own powers. the pretty girl next door he has a crush on.I did not read the spiderman comics but from what i have heard, the movie stays close to the comics. I thought it was a pretty well done movie.
