I found this book ourside a bookshop near work and it was for a pound. I recognised the author as my sister reads and collects the Sandman books - so I decided to buy it and wow! The book revolves around the main character Shadow, and wht happens to him when he gets released from Jail. He becomes involved in the world of gods past and present, and helps bring the war between them to a head. This book is really easy to get into and the characters really fill out the story. It doesn't have any soppy romance and it is quite dark, but is humourous in some places. I adore this book and i can easily read it over and over again.
