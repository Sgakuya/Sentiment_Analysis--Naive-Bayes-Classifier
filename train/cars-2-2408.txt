I'm sorry, although Honda is known for incredible HP per Litre, their cars are just too slow to be considered a sports car. A True sports car should have acceleration, top end, handling, and still leave room for comfort. If you'd like to know more about nice sports car please visit my post in the Supra forum. You might find it helpful as to why the KMIV should be a little higher in the list. Not to sound mean or anything, but you might learn some things about the Supra you never knew, or that might amaze you. And for those of you who think I'm a F F fan, I'm not in the least bit a fan of that movie. The movie sucked for being based on real events and being so fake. I don't really think the RSX is that bad of a car but it's rated way too high for a sports car.
