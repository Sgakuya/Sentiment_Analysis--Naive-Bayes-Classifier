Largely ignorant of the problems facing England, William III was content in leaving the problems of England for his wife, Queen Mary II, to solve. Under William and Mary's rule, England underwent a profound political transformation in which Parliament clearly defined the King's powers and limitations and declared Parliamentary supremacy over English affairs, establishing a system of checks and balances between Parliament and the Monarch, much like that of the American form of government today. Overall, William and Mary were ineffective and seemed content to let the Parliament make most of the decisions critical to English prosperity and governance.
