 ..... All I can say is wow. Congratulations Cadillac for showing me the way. I know a good running back when I see one. The first time I watched this guy run a ball, I was stunned with how mature he looked. Let's face it people of the jury. Cadillac Williams is a force to be reckoned with, and you know it. Don't even try to give me this lucky rookie b.s. Maybe you havn't seen this guy run, but I have, all three games now. I'm a Jacksonville Jaguar fan, but frankly, the Bucs are the team to beat this year. Amazing isn't it fellas, how such a (and I quote)"Gay Looking" team can start off the season with a bang. I don't care who they played, all I know is they came, they played, they conquered.
