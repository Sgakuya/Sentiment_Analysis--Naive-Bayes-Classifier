I have found that their customer phone center takes about 30 minutes to answer. Worse though is that I have repeatedly tried to e-mail their customer service and am not able to. It seems that they do not have a valid e-mail address listed. Perhaps someone knows of a valid e-mail address that works. Have been told by a customer I spoke with in a store that sti phone cards (used on landlines) are his favorite. I recently activated service and find that the reception in my area is fine. Overall I would say that the service is fine but the phone contact center wait times are very poor and the e-mail option is totally bogus.
