Halle Berry is quite simply one of the most beautiful and talented women of color in Hollywood today. Count 'em up folks there's, unfortunately, not very many women that fit into this category. Some people want to criticize her for her looks, she's had plastic surgery! she's had implants! she's had blah blah! Who cares?!? It always amazes me how quick some people are to cut down someone else, it's sad. I don't think there's very many people who don't alter their looks in some way to look better, there's nothing wrong with that. However, alot of people (mostly female) will attack a Halle Berry for having cosmetic surgery but why? Did Halle ever say 'this is all 100% original from the womb baby!' ...no I don't think so. So why gripe on the lady for her good looks? I'm guessing it's an envy thing because no one probably looks at them and tells them how hot THEY are so they need to tear down those individuals who are viewed as most attractive. It'll probably only get worse for Halle 'the Hot' Berry though as a newspaper reports Berry to receive 2.5 million for her role in the upcoming 'Swordfish' movie. Half a million of that going for her to be topless in the film...don't look now I smell envy arising out there.
