It may not have mountains or vast quantities of people, but Manitoba is a very beautiful and wonderful province. Grand Beach is the best beach in all of Canada by far, and one of the best in North America. Winnipeg has some very attractive scenery and some great parks. Even though it's in Western Canada, Manitoba isn't redneck and ignorant like Alberta and Saskatchewan, and isn't all Ken-and-Barbie smugness like B.C. Some of the best and most down-to-earth people in Canada can be found there. It has some of the best fishing and hunting too, for the many Americans who visit in order to kill the local wildlife. A very open-minded and friendly place.
