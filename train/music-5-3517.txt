Released in 1970, Moondance is a great place to start when contemplating that first Van Morrison purchase (save for one of the better compilations). While Moondance doesn't contain any of Morrison's more party tracks (eg Brown Eyed Girl), it does contain some of his best work which has not been overplayed including the well known Caravan (featured in an episode of WKRP In Cincinnati), the title track, and some lesser known singles such as Into The Mystic (my personal favorite), And It Stoned Me, Crazy Love, Come Running, and These Dreams Of You. The bottom line is that Moondance is both a critical and popular favorite for good reason.
