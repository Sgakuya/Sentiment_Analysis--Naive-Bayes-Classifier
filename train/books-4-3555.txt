I really enjoyed many of Bill Bryson's essays in I'm a Stranger Here Myself. It was the first time I'd read any of his work, and I found him funny in a quirky sort of way, similar to Bailey White. Bill Bryson is a master at finding things everyone has experienced and showing the funny side. His essays on cupholders, rules, and tax returns are absolutely hilarious. My mom was reading the one about filling out your tax return while she was waiting for my dad to have minor surgery. She was laughing so hard that she had to stop reading because she felt she was unable to control herself in the hospital waiting area. While I did pick and choose from the selection of essays, there are definitely enough really good ones to make this book worth reading.
