Let's start at the Beginning. I was one of the first customers with Direct TV way back when. We paid full price had cable & primestar prior to Direct TV. We hated both equally. No complaint on service with Dss except for a few storm's on what seems to always be very bad timing. Like the end of movies or the last two minutes of a sporting event. But what really irk's me is the HD situation. We bought a Pioneer 65 IN' HD TV. Direct TV THEN SOLD ME A SAMSUNG HD TUNER $399.00. then they give me a only a few HD channel's. nice of them Huh!? I have the premium package, I have the total sport package. We called about why the football games were not in HD. sorry sir that's another $100.00 for that. why can't i get them in HD only now that i purchased the HD tuner? sorry sir that's the way we do it. so then tivo comes out......why not get one right? Hold on sir you gotta pay. it's free to new coustomers. heck they get 4 room's-complete hook up new boxes & tivo. sorry sir you're not a new coustomer. mind you loyalty will get you no place fast. and with direct tv.....I'm driving a ferrari. sincerley,,,,,pissed in illinois
