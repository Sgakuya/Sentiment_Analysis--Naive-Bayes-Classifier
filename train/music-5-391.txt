I was blown away by this CD. I'd never paid any attention to Radiohead before, but I kept seeing OK Computer show up on lists of the best CD of the year. So I finally cracked under the pressure and listened to a few songs at a record store, which was enough to convince me to buy it. The first couple of times I listened to it, I thought it was OK, but by the 5th or 6th time I was completely hooked. And I can't even tell you which songs I like, because they all kind of blend together. The CD works as a whole, which is really rare these days and definitely hurt its commercial sales (no hit single = no hit CD). Even if you're biased against concept CDs like this, you should give OK Computer a shot... It's that good.
