Just adding a few details to irishgit and Enkidu's posts. Harold was a man who not only spent his short reign desperately fighting for his own sake but for the whole English way of life. First he had to defeat the King of Norway, who was aided by his own traitorous brother, Tostig. Then when he had returned to London after hearing of Williams arrival, he received the news that William was ravaging the countryside. Infuriated, Harold set off to defeat William. His advisors begged him to wait and gather more forces before meeting him but Harold said he would rather die then be known to fear William the Bastard. Tired and downtrodden, the Saxon Warriors and Housekarls (armed with small shields, axes and short swords, without mounts) faced a force of Normans who had a fully equipped and well rested force of knights, infantry and archers. The only advantage the Saxons had was a steep hill (and it IS a steep hill folks, I've been there) and their cunning tactic of holding a shield wall at the top. At first the Saxons seemed to be winning but the cunning William turned the battle around by staging a fake retreat, many Saxons got overconfident and charged down the hill (breaking the shield wall along the top). The foolhardy Saxons were cut down by the Norman Knights (now on even ground). The remaining Saxons on the top of the hill had become scattered and William capitalized on this by demanding his archers fire high into the air onto the English troops. Harold himself was hit in the eye with an arrow and killed. With Harold, died Saxon England.
