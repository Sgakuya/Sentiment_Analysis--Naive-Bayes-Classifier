Sometimes the earnest gamer gets tired of blasting his way through legions of slavering undead and requires a more reflective experience, and Ico is it. The game centres around a young boy named Ico who has been inexplicably incarcerated in a massive castle and his subsequent attempts to escape. In his endeavors he is quickly joined by a girl called Yorda with a complexion of shimmering white who, given that she speaks an alien language (subtitled with incomprehensible hieroglyphics), can only communicate with Ico through gestures and the tone of her voice. The teamwork between the two required to achieve goals is both quite endearing and satisfyingly strategic. The graphics are the most appealing I've ever seen in a computer game (and I've played quite a few) on both a technical and design level. With each new location you just have to pause to admire each roaring waterfall, each steep and jagged clifface, each imposing tower which often seem to stretch for miles. The sound is gentle and naturalistic, usually forgetting music for the chirping of birds, the howling of the wind or the pattering of raindrops. Crucially, the player's view is never encumbered by onscreen statistics and the game never feels anything but a perfectly honest experience. Sure, Ico is a little short and doesn't have a vast scope for re-playability but it's the sheer beauty of the game that makes Ico a classic.
