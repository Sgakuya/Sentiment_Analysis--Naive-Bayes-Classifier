Well its not hard to figure out why the dodge viper is awesome for most of us. We all know it has great looks and sound. But for some of us who dont know a thing about speed, Celica Trd, I will give this moron a wake up call. Celica says a supra that he could mod would smoke a viper at high speeds. Translation: a V6 turbo with maybe up to 350 hp would smoke a V10 aluminum big block, 833 horses (venom) 8.8 twin turbo. 0-60 in 2.43, 0-100 in 5.5. Heres the part that is going to make you want to scream at Celica. This is funny. He says the viper venom 800tt will get passed at high speeds even though it accelerates quickly to a MAX OF 235mph!!! Somebody back me up here. Celica , you would be better off racing honda civics!! I think I prooved my point, idiot.
