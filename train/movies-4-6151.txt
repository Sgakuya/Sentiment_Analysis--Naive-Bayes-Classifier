Movies tend to replace the actual history they attempt to portray, and Patton is a prime example. It is a wonderful and impressive film, and it does a better job with the history than most, but it should not be confused with reality. To point out a couple of examples-- George C. Scott's gruff, gravelly voice seems perfect for the character, but the real Patton actually had a high, squeaky voice. Patton did not slap one soldier, but two, in separate incidents in Sicily, so it wasn't just a momentary excess. In the movie, Scott complains about his quarters in England looking like a goddam bordello. In fact, that would have been appropriate; while in London, the real Patton carried on a steamy affair with his wife's niece. And the business about Patton believing he could be in Berlin in a week is true-- Patton believed it-- but as a matter of reality, it was nonsense-- as everyone but Patton realized at the time. There would simply have been no way to supply his army even if he did get it across the Rhine. Patton was a great general, but he never paid much attention to logistics-- and World War II was all about logistics. Still, despite such forgivable lapses, this is a legitimately great film.
