I live in St. Louis, so it is my home and I have to respect that. Also, it's home to AB, which has one of the best looking industrial complexes in the world. But aside from that, this place sucks. We only have enough attractions to entertain a typical family for a weekend, but no more. We have the highest crime rate in the country. Our downtown is non-existent. East St. Louis is the poorest city in America. Our nightlife is week, with Laclede's Landing, Soulard, Clayton, the Loop, and that's it. The arch ceases to amuse when you live right next to it. All are industry left, leaving no jobs and a population that has dropped about half a million in the past half century. We have so many abandoned buildings that they filmed Escape From New York here, since the movie needed the post apocalyptic feel. In a wave of building new, state of the art, attractive sports stadiums around the country, we build the Jones Dome, which is the ugliest building in downtown. We have the smallest and most pathetic Amtrak station for a major city. It consists of a doublewide, which replaced the jewel union station, which now is a mall that few go to (yet more people go there than the St. Louis Centre). The worse is the urban sprawl. People are abandoning the city and moving into track mansions out in the farmland, and because are puny mass transit (which nobody rides anyway) doesn't reach to the sprawlers, they have to commute downtown, clogging the highway with endless traffic. If these jerks realized they could live in better looking houses closer to their jobs at the expense of having a big yard and ugly house, than St. Louis could be saved. But now, it's all going downhill.
