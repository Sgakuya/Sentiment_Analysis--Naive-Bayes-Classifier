We just did an in-town move in Livermore, CA with the regional Sacramento-based Starving Students movers. Our basic complaint is that they keep some of your items on the truck, and say pay us or the stuff stays on the truck. Also, we were overcharged for time. At noon, when the move was very nearly complete, they charged us for stopping at 12:45 PM. We estimate that we were overcharged for 30 minutes. We were charged for time not used in our move. That is stealing. That is illegal. I will be contacting the BBB and CA attorney general. The movers themselves were decent but by far the least professional. Don't move anything you really care about with these guys.
