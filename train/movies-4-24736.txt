Saw it on an airplane flight. I know this movie was nuked by critics. Even Jennifer Garner was uttering something to the effect of They made me do it, as her excuse. Maybe she should have said, Hey, I'm dating Ben Affleck. Everything he touches turns to dung and now it's rubbing off on me. All that being said, I thought it was a pretty good movie. It had a decent plot (though a bit perplexing, it's no less convoluted than a typical episode of Alias) and the martial arts scenes were pretty good. But then again, I'm the kind of guy who would say, I thought Kickboxer IV was not only as good as The English Patient -- but better because it had more kicking. Poor purty Jennifer Garner has not had a seamless transition from small to big screen, but she is one fine specimen and she could kick Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston's sweet little derrieres at the same time.
