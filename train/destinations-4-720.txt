Just a short drive from Pacific Beach, California, Tijuana is a different world. Crossing the border by foot, you will be greeted my the armed Mexican Militia, accosted by money-hungry Mexicans as your American look smells green of dollar bills. Travel light as you are no more than a $10 cab ride from the American border... Be prepared to wait in longer lines crossing back into the USA than you will find at the clubs... Leave you watch (cell phones, too) behind... This underbelly has Vegas' influence as rules are loose and time is of little consequence. As you continue to imbibe the Mexican Drinks of choice, (ours was Sol with a few violent shots of Jose Cuervo) be thankful of the little luxuries provided in the bathroom. You will find an attendant who owns all the supplies including soap, towels and all the chicklets you can buy. Food and drink are at happy hour prices... so if you are on a budget and looking to hit it large then give this place a go! Be weary though... Hopefully, one way or another you will be able to brink back some indelible stories (my buddies found the wives of their dream, me... I lost my cell phone during the Mexican Tequila shakedown) Live it large my friends!
