Governor Romney has done a fantastic job considering all the forces working against him. Most obviously that he is a Republican in an almost completely Liberal Democrat state. Massachusetts like most of the country is facing very difficult economic period and the Democrats in the state both in the House of Representatives and the Senate shut down every attempt by Mr. Romney to make changes and attempt to root out waste in the state. Even still Governor Romney has been able to accomplish quite a few things that are going to help the citizens of Massachusetts. Not to mention it is still very early in his administration.
