Has it ever occurred to anyone that perhaps Steve Buscemi plays in Adam Sandler movies because he enjoys working with the guy? That, maybe, it's not about money??? And for that I commend him because he doesn't care what anyone thinks about his choice in roles. He plays every part without effort or arrogance. Just look at his Donnie in The Big Lebowski ! He took a character who had minimal lines and made it feel like more than a prop for Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. I can't imagine anyone better playing the part of Mr. Pink in Resevoir Dogs . His talent isn't 'being wasted' in Sandler's movies. The way I see it is the more we get of Steve Buscemi, the better!
