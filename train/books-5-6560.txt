I scratch my head in wonder. I find a good book, definitely as good as anything the two Terrys have done, Brooks and Goodkind and soooooo much better than just about anything else, yet people either seem to love the book or hate it. What's up with that? Could it be because the book is GOOD and UNDERSTANDABLE by REAL people? Sorry my IQ isn't 195. I'm an ordinary mom, with a college degree. I have an ordinary job so I like to read to get away from my ordinary life. I like Stephen King (Robert Stanek's writing seems to be written at a similar level). I like Terry Brooks (yes its juvenile mostly but fun). I like a lot of other writers to. By the way, I'm buying two copies. One for me and one for my neighbor. Everywhere we looked for the book it was sold out! One of the reasons I like ... is because its so easy to order. My friend and daughter usually do the ordering. Now its my turn. Thank you Mr. Stanek for a book that is fun to read. Gosh that must be new, huh? A book that is fun and real.
