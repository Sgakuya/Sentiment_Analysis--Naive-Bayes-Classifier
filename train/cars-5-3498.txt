This is a great car for a great price. I am essentially getting a Lexus Rx300 for a great price. I love the smoothness and quiet ride. The powerful V6 engine is strong yet gets better gas mileage than those other SUV's. The JBL system sounds awesome and you might consider the 6 in dash changer so there is no clucky changer box underneath the seat or in the back. The leg room for the passengers in the rear is fantastic especially when you can recline the seats back. It actually has more cargo space than the 4runner. I love the full size spare in the back like a car. No special tools, chains, or locks to toy with to get to the wheel. And you don't have a spare wheel attached to the exterior to take away from the apperance of the car.
