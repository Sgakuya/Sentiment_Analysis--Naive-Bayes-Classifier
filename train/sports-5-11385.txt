June Jones is, no doubt, one of the better if not the best coach in college football! How many coaches come to a school that was winless(0-12) the year before and revive the program to a championship calaber team(9-4) just one year later in which they were WAC champions, and Oahu Bowl Champions. June Jones was in a horrible car accident earlier this year which almost cost him his life but he definitely had the lord watching over him because he is back on the field coaching Hawaii through fall practice! Some doctors said that most people that are in car accidents like Jones' don't live to tell how it happened! June Jones is not just a special coach but a special person! Hawaii will be a special team lead by Coach Jones this year! Watch out!
