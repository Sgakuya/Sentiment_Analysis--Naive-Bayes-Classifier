Phoenix is just sort of...there. It's a big sprawling mass of a city improbably located in the middle of a desert. There are some decent areas - Scottsdale isn't bad, and there's a lot of nice areas west of ASU in Tempe - but overall there's just not much to really recommend the place. This is particularly odd considering the city is essentially brand new - much of it was built after 1950 - and it's the fifth largest metropolitan area (thanks for pointing that out, Igantius) in the country now, which should enable it to be as cultural as a Chicago, New York, or Philadelphia, yet better planned. Instead it has little or no culture, is a sprawling mess, has terrible traffic, intolerably hot summers, and no cohesiveness to the neighborhoods, such as they are. Some of the surrounding scenery is impressive - Phoenix certainly makes a good jumping off point for the rest of the state- but the city itself isn't very interesting. If you want to go see how a city in the desert should look, drive down to Tucson - culturally, Tucson has less going on than even Phoenix, but it's prettier.
