People who drink Starbucks' coffee are more interested in carrying around the cup, advertising that they are hip and drinking Starbucks coffee. It is definitely a status symbol, and an absurd one at that. The coffee is NOT good, in fact, in my experience it has been HORRIBLE! Any true coffee drinker would prefer a better cup of coffee and ANY other coffee house, at a reasonable price. Overrated..isn't the whole idea behind coffee houses, to be unique and interesting little joints that offer a different selection of coffees..and shouldn't the atmosphere be..I don't know..a little off beat? Starbucks tried to mass produce this sense of idyllic charm..instead, Starbucks is the Mickey D's of Coffee Houses..no individuality, no unique atmosphere..Just really BAD, bitter, overpriced coffee in a room filled with idiots willing to pay 5 bucks for a crappy cup of joe!
