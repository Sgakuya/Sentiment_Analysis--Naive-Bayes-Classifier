My Jeep story: I have 2003 Renegade with the top lights, running boards, charcoal wheels, etc and color black. It's worked out really good. I haul my german shepherd around in it, go to the carolina mountains. It has a lot more head room then the 2002 Cherokee, no comparison. The new Laredo has less headroom so I didn't trade it in. It now has 78,500 miles and I have run the hell out of it. I just changed the plugs on it for the first time as preventive maintenance going into winter. I have now replaced all 4 tires within the last 5k miles. I still have original brakes on all wheels and they still have a lot of pad left. I also had a few floating incidents in the rain but I sort of did it on purpose. Put it in part time 4 wheel drive if you are worried about hydroplaning.
