A very charming and endearing actress whop displayed depth and versatility. Great looking, too. However, she was miscast in a number of her roles (Gypsy, The Searchers, West Side Story) and the roles dried up for her by the time she was 30. Too bad. At about that time, movies in general started their long descent toward the level of unmitigated crap that they're in today, and a talent as rare and precious as Wood's had no place in the gathering tripe of post-code Hollywood. She was wonderful in Splendor in the Grass, Rebel Without a Cause, Love With The Proper Stranger. A shame she died at an age when more mature roles might have been available to her.
