The game is fully as good as the other Civ games, but that's part of why it only gets 4 stars. I was hoping for something more groundbreaking, and this game does not deliver. The only real way to win the game is still by conquest, diplomacy still doesn't seem to do much good, and the way this game handles resources (such as steel and rubber) mean if you get a bad start early on, there is no hope for you. The culture thing seemed cool at first, until you realize it can stop the expansion of your civ cold, if you fall behind, and even start costing you cities. Also, the game still has that aggravating habit of letting medieval warriors triumph over tanks and such. That infuriated me in the first one, the second one, and they STILL haven't gotten rid of it!! Seriously, do you think an archer could take out an M1A1 Abrahms? Play Civ III, and they just might. Every bit as fun as the first two, but nothing special here, really. I'd wait for it to hit the discount bin.
