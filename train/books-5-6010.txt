Miami Blues is a terrific read. This book is the first in a quartet of novels that follow Detective Seargant Hoke Moseley as he ferrets out a host of gruesome villains across the Floridian Panhandle. Moseley is a wonderfully etched character, he is at once down trodden, yet, fiecely street smart and savvy. Moseley is the ultimate anti-hero. He lives in the decrepit El Dorado Hotel in South Beach (circa 1982) a place peopled with some senile senior citizens. One particularly eccentric hotel tenant is Old Man Zuckerman, a fellow who has a pension for presenting passers by with neatly folded paper napkins.In exchange for keeping the hotel secure, Moseley receives free bed and board in the seedy Hotel. Moseley's world is interrupted by Freddie Junior Frenger, a blithe sociopath who pummels the cop, tosses his dentures out the window, and leaves Moseley for dead. Frenger is on the lam in Miami after his accidental murder of a Hare Krishna at the Miami Airport. However, a selection of stolen credit cards buy Frenger some time as he eludes the authorities. Willeford mixes wry, sardonic humor with sudden bursts of violence that catch the reader off guard. Willeford's character depictions are vivid, colorful and always memorable. Frenger studies an assortment of stolen wallets, One wallet was eelskin, another was imitation ostrich and the third was a plain cowhide billfold filled with color snapshots of very plain children. Why would any man want to carry around photographs of ugly children in his wallet? Frenger hooks up with a dim-witted hooker and a precious game of cat and mouse is on. Miami Blues is a cornerstone to the crime fiction genre and will have readers feverishly reading into the night.
