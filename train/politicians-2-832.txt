He decimated Canada's once proud military, turned Canada's international voice from influentianl to worthless and was involved in blatant corrupt practices. Our soldiers lost thier lives in outdated dangeroud equipement, while his party members get brand new private jets. He was arrogant and bull-headed, calling his run as PM his legacy , while in realit the only reason he got elected again was at the time, the other choices were even worse. Now, his crony Paul Martin is PM, the former Finance Minister who claims he didn't know where all this money was being wasted - but that's another story. 2/5 because he didn't let Canada descend into Anarchy.
