UPDATE: We won 16 of 18 but they were against losing teams. We haven't had a breakthrough this year. We haven't beaten a winning team since, I don't know when. Since Bush took office in 2001, my team hasn't done anything special. But I still love them. OLD MESSAGE #1: I still believe. With the additions of Carl Pavano, Jaret Wright and Randy Johnson, I believe we're still in the hunt. We're the underdogs now. The Red Sox are now the target and we're looking forward to kicking their butts. Let's see how Boston responds to the pressure in 2005. It's gonna be fun and interesting. Go Yanks! ... OLD MESSAGE #2: We're still the greatest organization in the world. We'll win it all again, believe me. And it won't take 86 years either! HEH!
