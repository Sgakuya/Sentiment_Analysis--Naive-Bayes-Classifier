I can't believe I spent four and a half years there. It's called Towson University , (they dropped the State part of it years ago), located in Towson, MD. Just to sum up how I feel, here's some stats from 2002: Former University President Perkin's length of term: 282 days. Amount Spent on Perkins' pre-inaugural lobster dinner: $3,100. Cost of Guildord Mansion for president to entertain guests: $850,000, plus about $600,000 on renovations. Amount spent on rugs for the president's Guilford mansion: $30,000. Number of residents of mansion: 0. Cost of Inauguration ceremony for Perkins, 3 weeks before his dismissal: $56,500. Cost of Gold Medallion he wore for the inauguration: $25,000. Amount spent on catering for the inauguration, 4 hours time total: $13,000. Cost of 39 jackets for Towson University Police Department: $7,500. Number of female students held at gunpoint behind their dorm rooms at about that time: 3. All of this, while students work with outdated materials, and students walk to and from their dorms on poorly-lit walkways, lending themselves to attacks. Paying well over a hundred dollars for a parking pass in my last years there, many times I couldn't find parking because large sections of the main garage were blocked off for campus events (Luckily, a new parking garage opened earlier this year, so hopefully new students don't have to worry about it). And that's just one year's worth of stuff. The priorities of the school, at least when I was there, were horribly misplaced in my opinion. Hopefully, the years will get better for Towson, but from my experience, the Alumni Association shouldn't expect any donations from me anytime soon.
