Spielberg is one of my least favourite directors. Everything he produces seems scientifically calculated to have the widest possible demographic appeal, and his foreshadowing and moralizing are about as subtle as a brick to the face. He also seems to hate German people. I'm not German, but I'm getting a little sick of seeing them portrayed as the sum of all evil. Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List would be the most obvious. I know that Germany was the enemy at the time but those movies depicted ordinary Germans as sadistic and without any redeeming qualities. Not every citizen was a hardcore anti-semitic nazi murderer, you know. The Germans were also villains in the Indiana Jones movies, and even in Jurassic Park II: The Lost World, the most evil character in the movie was named Dieter. WWII is over, Steven, can you possibly think of another large subsection of humanity to completely villify? With that off my chest, his films otherwise bore me, so that is another strike against him. Is it too much to ask for a film that allows the viewer to do some thinking on their own? Or does every message have to be pounded into us? His films are insulting on so many levels. I wish he'd retire, he's already worth zillions of dollars.
