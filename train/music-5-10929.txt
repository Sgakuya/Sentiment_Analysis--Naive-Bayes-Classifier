A great CD after a long four year wait. Some of Al's best stuff is on here. I'll do a track-by-track review for your enjoyment. 1. Couch Potato-(parody of Eminem's Lose Yourself)-A great song, this is classic Al. It not only shows his knowledge of words, but TV shows as well. 5/5 2. Hardware Store-(Al's original)-Not only is this a great song, it shows just how fast Al can talk. 5/5 3. Trash Day-(parody of Nelly's Hot in Herre)-I didn't really like the original, but Al made it great! 4/5 4. Party at the Leper Colony-(original Al)-Great beat, with some rather funny lyrics. 4/5 5. Angry White Boy Polka-(Al's original polka, with some help from other artists)-Al's signature polka on every album only gets better. This one features hard rock artists, hence Angry White Boys. You have to hear it. 5/5 6. Wanna B UR Lover-(original Al)-This is Al's version of Beck trying to sound like Prince. Consisting of all cheesy pickup lines, it's a hilarious song. 5/5 7. A Complicated Song-(parody of Avril Lavigne's Complicated)-I can't explain it, you have to hear it for yourself. 5/5 8. Why Does This Always Happen to Me?-(original Al)-Funny song about a guy's bad day. And the murder of his boss. 5/5 9. Ode to a Superhero-(parody of Billy Joel's Piano Man)-What Al did for Star Wars and American Pie he does for Spiderman and Piano Man. Might be album's best song. 5/5 10. Bob-(original Al, but a tribute to Bob Dylan)- A dead on impression to Bob Dylan. The lyrics are the amazing part. They're all palindromes. Read them backwards, then you'll get it. 5/5 11. Ebay-(parody of BSB's I Want It That Way)-Hilarious song, and dead on to the original lyrics. About a crazed Ebay addict. Listen to this one for a good laugh. 5/5 12. Genius in France-(original Al, but a tribute to Frank Zappa)-Two words: classic Al. 5/5
