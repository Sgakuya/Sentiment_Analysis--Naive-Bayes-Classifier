It was over 300 years ago, or 1702 to be exact that deep in the southeast region of North America, long before the state of Alabama or even the United States were formed, a French settlement named for a local tribe was created near the river sharing the same name. About nine years later, the settlement of Mobile was moved to its present location close to Mobile Bay. Being the seat of Louisiana until 1719 long before the territorys purchase early in the 1800s was only the beginning of what would soon become known as The Port City and a good example for the state soon to follow. Just one year after its founding, the French-based carnival known as Mardi Gras would take place for the first time in Mobile in its earliest form. For those accustomed to New Orleans' version of Mardi Gras, here's an interesting fact: Both Mobile and New Orleans were founded by Jean Baptiste Le Moyne, Siuer de Bienville (also governor of France's Louisiana) of what is now Canada, making the cities not-so-distant brothers (or sisters). With French influence and all, Beinvilles spawn came into Britains possession, then the Spanish followed, and finally in 1814 the United States incorporated it as a town before making city status in 1819. After seeing everything from a war between states and the growth of the rest of the nation, including Alabama, Mobile remains a port city (or should I say The Port City) and a seat of some sorts, only its Mobile County rather than a giant territory. Mardi Gras continues to be celebrated in the streets of downtown and parts close by, keeping a more wholesome (or family as some would) image far from New Orleans just a couple of automobile hours away. Nowadays Mobile is looking forward to the future as a cruise ship port and the location to the RSA Tower (tallest in Alabama, as originally projected) and continues to keep its Southern heritage & charm alive and well for visitors, Mobile natives, and new residents. Take care, yall!
