Released in 1939, The Wizard Of Oz is an institution of American cinema. The movie went through a series of directors; however, Victor Fleming sat in the chair for most of production. Obviously, this movie was a landmark film in its use of color, switching from black and white as Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) leaves her drab reality in Kansas for the vivid Land of Oz over the rainbow where magic and fantasy are the rule rather than the exception. In Oz, Dorothy has magic slippers to protect her in this alien world as well as her humanity represented by the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), the Tin Man (Jack Haley), and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) (ie wisdom, love and courage). Nevertheless, Dorothy discovers that fantasy is not as fulfilling as her home in reality, so she searches to find the great Wizard (Frank Morgan) while her nemesis the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) attempts to waylay her at every turn. Ultimately, Dorothy triumphs over flying monkeys (which scared me as a child), the forces of evil and temptation, and failed, misdirected hopes to find that her power is within not without. The casting for the film was perfect despite the fact that Dorothy was to be played by Shirley Temple, Buddy Ebsen as the Scarecrow, Gale Sondergaard as the Wicked Witch, and W.C. Fields as the Wizard. Another interesting note is that the signature song Over The Rainbow was going to be cut to speed the pace of the film. The bottom line is that The Wizard Of Oz is now a part of the common American experience and remains enjoyable even today.
