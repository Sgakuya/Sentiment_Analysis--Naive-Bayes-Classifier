The only source of scariness in the film is the music and sound: not the plot, not the direction, nor the acting (especially not the dialogue). Naturally when you hear sudden loud drum-like noises interrupt a dead silent moment, you're going to react, which is basically the only scare tactic that this film employed. The plot was inconsistent in a subtle way (which is good for those who want to watch it for the thrills and not the meaning). The dialogue could have definitely been improved (the dialogue always gave away whatever thrill was coming up, so if anything it was destructive). The content and themes were half baked (something along the lines of following your instincts over logic, I gather), and there was absolutely no psychological depth in the film whatsoever (only psychological terms), which reflects very poorly on the film seeing that it is a psychological thriller (supposedly, anyway). The acting would have been superb if the film was a drama, but it wasn't appropriate for a horror film. I must say that I'm surprised Halle Berry didn't lose her voice after all that screaming rubbish she pulled off, but besides that she played a convincing role. The film is basically a piece of trash with pretty wrapping paper and a ribbon attached to it.
