Halo 1 (for its time) was the best game!!! It had all the kick-ass stuff, and the weapons were awesome!!! The assault rifle, the pistol.....ETC., they were all AWESOME!!! I loved the different environments that there were in Halo 1, and I likes the way it was all put together. The little glitch at the end of the game with Halo exloding made me laugh too (hey, it was 2001 computer graphics, not 2004 computer graphics...a lot can change in 3 years graphic-wise). It was a really fun game, and it still is, even compared with HALO 2!!! Now, Halo 2 (in my opinion) is the only game that beats Halo 1 because they are both AWESOME!!! Halo 2 is cool (just like its father, HALO 1)
