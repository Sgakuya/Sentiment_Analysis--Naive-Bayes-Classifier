We drove to Hoover Dam on our way to the Grand Canyon. We have to admit we were a little disappointed at the Hoover Dam, in our minds we pictured it a lot bigger(thanks to movies I guess). Post 9/11 the security checks take some time and the tours have been severely restricted. They are also building a bypass around the Dam so you will have to endure backed up traffic until it is done and you will have to go off the beaten path to get there once it is done. One neat thing is the change in time zones from one end of the Dam to the other between Pacific and Mountain time which is highlighted by large clocks on two of the intake towers of Hoover Dam. It is an amzaing structure that man built and if you are in Las Vegas it is probably worth a stop. We are giving it a 4 because of the genious it took to build it and once you see the landscape that surrounds the Dam you'll understand why.
