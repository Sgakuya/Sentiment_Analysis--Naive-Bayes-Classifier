WOW! What more can you say about Jorge Posada, to me, he is the greatest baseball player that will ever be around. He is my favorite, what cant you like about him? He's the best catcher in the AL, hes always in the All-Stars, hes said to be one of the best catchers, especially batting from both sides of the plate. He is an awesome defensive player, he knows the game, and is extremly helpful to his teammates. He is a good Dad and Husband (i wish he was my husband but..) he is very much involved with his son, and exposing him to the baseball world. Jorge DOES deserve to be in the Hall of Fame, he is destined.. I love Jorge, he is my idol, and if i could have anything in the world, it would be to meet him :) i cant wait to see #20 in the Hall. Jorge will be forever remembered!! GO YANKEES!!! p.s. i agree..Jorge is very sexy!!!
