Nolan Ryan is one of the greatest pitchers of all time. Nolan was not best known for his wins, or his ERA, but he was known for his strikeouts in a season. He played 27 years and had a record of 324 wins, 292 losses, 3.19 ERA, and 5,714 strikeouts. Nolan Ryan started in the majors in 1966 then was put back in the minors for the 1967 season and became and offical rookie in the 1968 season. 1968 was the only year he won a world series. He played on four teams during a 27 year career. (Mets:1966, 1968 - 1972, Angels: 1972 - 1979, Astros: 1980 - 1988, Rangers: 1989 - 1993). He had the most strikeouts on the Angels but the most wins on the Astros. At the age of 44 in 1991 playing with Texas he had 301 strikeouts the only pitcher ever to do that age. He had seven no-hitters the most ever by a pitcher. He only played in 5 all-star games and he never won the Cy Young award but he was still great. He played on weak teams with bad defense thats partly to do with his bad winning percentage. In 1973 and 1974 Nolan posted a record of 21-16 and 22-16 and in 1973 was the record year when he had 383 strikeouts. He has 5,714 strikeouts a record that will nevr be touched. Look at Steve Carlton or Roger Clemens, Nolan has over 1,584 strikeouts more than any of them Steve - 4130 and Roger - 4099. In 1999 Nolan Ryan was elected to The Hall of Fame with a percent vote of 98.8.
