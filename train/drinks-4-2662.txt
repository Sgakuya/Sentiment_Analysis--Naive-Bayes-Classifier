Until yesterday I have had no problems with the service. I like the coffee and manage my shipments by way of their website. It's a little pricey, but I get the coffee I like delivered to my door. However, yesterday I received a shipment I had no recollection ordering. Turns out it was an automatic shipment that came because I did not send back a postcard sent to me in September. Perhaps my own fault -- I generally toss all solicitations and often do not even see postcards in the all the general delivery mail I receive. I contacted customer service last night to complain expecting to have to arrange a return shipment on my dime (and cancellation of my account). Gevalia first made me a half price offer on the shipment, which I rejected, and then told me to keep it as a gift for my trouble. I'm drinking the coffee now, very good, but not really 'my cup of tea.' I would never reorder it. A sample packet would have been enough. If this happens again I will cancel the service, but otherwise, I am quite pleased. P.S. I purchased from Target a reuseable filter for my automatic (timer) Gevalia coffeemaker which I quite like.
