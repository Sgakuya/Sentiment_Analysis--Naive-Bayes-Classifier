I see Jesse has been spewing something else besides his usual poison. He is a black militant who has enriched himself by promoting racial division and hatred in this country. Maybe he can redeem himself with a good prison ministry. I am sure he deserves to go there because of his income tax evasion, misuse of public money, extortion and violations of the RICCO act. He should have asked his buddy Bill for a blanket pardon before ol' Slick Willie left office. I hope this Biggotted RACIST enjoys exercising his new immoral authority .You can Run, Jesse, Run but you can not Hide, Jesse, Hide. You should have spent a little more money on voter education in FL instead of putting it in your pocket.
