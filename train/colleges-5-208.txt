I believe that there is no other business school in the US with as much diversity as Brandeis IBS. At any given time, if you listen, you will hear about 8 different languages being spoken around you. As the world becomes increasingly more globalized, I believe my two years spent here at Brandeis IBS will also become more valuable. I believe this is an excellent school for those who want to develop a stong career on the international business, economics, and finance areas. I for one will be going abroad to Germany, where I have never been before (originally from NY), to work for a major investment bank. starting in July.
