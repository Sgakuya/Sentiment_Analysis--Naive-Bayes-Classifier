Britney has a child now and she needs to grow up and stop acting like a little kid, she is still wearing skimpy clothes and it is an embarresment when I see her on tv. She didn't need to have a child in the first place because she is still a child herself and her mother should be embarresed of her because she is disgusting. She even had a c section just so she wouldn't have any pain during child birth and knowing that it is not good for the baby but what does she care, all she cares about is herself and if she didn't want to experiance pain she shouldn't had the baby in the first place. Her boyfriend is messed up and she is too and her mother should be embaressed to have her as a daughter because of the path she is in and leading too, I feel sorry for the poor innocent baby. She is a bad, better yet a horrible example for kids everywhere with her sex provoked music and skimpy attire. Hopefully that was her last album because I can't stand anymore trash from her and Im sure many people feel the same way.
