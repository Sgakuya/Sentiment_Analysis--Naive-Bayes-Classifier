I appreciate what Tom Ridge and his Orwellian Department of Homeland Security is trying to do, but it's just a waste of money and time. The Department of Homeland Security is merely a myth that has been created to make Americans feel like the government is on top of things as far as terrorism goes. I am quite annoyed by the color-coded threat level system. As far as Tom Ridge himself goes, I have respect for him for his service to the State of Pennsylvania. Other than the bad road construction system, Pennsylvania seems to be a fun state to visit. He invested large amounts of funds in Pennsylvania's public education system and environmental security. He cut taxes every year that he was in office while Pennsylvania prospered. He seems like a good man in a silly spot.
