I am a loyal customer here! They are constantly increasing their selection of DVDs, which are of course a tad more costly than VHS, but of much higher quality, in my opinion. You do not have to pay a fee to rent DVD's here like you do at Hasting's. (BTW, I boycott Hasting's, but I'll tell about that when it is added to the list!:))They do have a huge selection of VHS rentals, and game rentals for playstation, gamecube, X-Box, etc. Hollywood Video has a satisfaction guarantee that is absolutely unparalleled: if you are not satisfied with your rental -FOR ANY REASON AT ALL- they will exchange it for you free of charge! In other words, I can rent 40 days 40 nights, take it home, watch it and decide it was a crappy show, then just take it back and tell one of their employees that I found the movie unsatifactory. They will let you go pick something else out and watch it free of charge!! Isn't that fantastic?! Hollywood also has the in stock guarantee , which is awesome! They have several new releases that are labeled guaranteed in stock , and if you find that one of such movies is all out, you simply go tell one of the employees, and he/ she will print you a raincheck for that movie rental FREE of charge on your next visit!!! What's more is that the employees are very friendly and helpful. I have nothing but positive things to say about Hollywood!
