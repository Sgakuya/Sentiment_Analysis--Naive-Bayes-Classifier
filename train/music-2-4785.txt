I feel sorry for her. She's being used by music executives, and always has been (it started with the Mickey Mouse club - and you thought Disney was so innocent!). Any real talent she has is being overshadowed by marketing executives that want to squeeze as much money out of her 15 minutes of fame as possible ( Come in here dear boy, have a cigar, you're gonna go far....). They are stereotyping her image and thus preventing her from growing as an artist and receiving respect from critics, serious music fans, and established musicians. I fear that I will end up seeing her on VH1's where are they now and suffering the same fate as so many other artists that were stereotyped, and used, and then woke up to this fact and ended up suicidal and/or drug addicted. She's got a great voice, good body, good moves... she has potential. But she is limited by bad song writing, predictable moves, and oversaturation in the media. She's getting boring really fast. She should take a break from the public eye and come back with something totally different. That's how Madonna kept ahead of becoming boring, maybe it will work for her.
