Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire are very similar New England States. They are scarcely populated except for a few small cities. They do however fill up in their respective tourist seasons. People go to New England to get away from it all; these states are all peaceful. The locals are generally friendly in all 3 states, crime is low, the population is predominately white, and the taxes are on the low side. Since they don't have any large cities, these states really don't serve much importance to the rest of the country besides a weekend getaway. Nice weather in the summer, great for camping and the beach, and the snowy winter season provides for some great skiing and snowboarding. Again, great to visit but if you are a city person you'll be bored to death if you live in these states year round.
