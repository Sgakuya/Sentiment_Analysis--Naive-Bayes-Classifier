In my opinion, Bush Sr. assembled the most competent cabinet and administration in modern history, though this was mostly due to the eight preceding Reagan years in which the chaff was largely removed. While Bush Sr. only had four years to finish much of the unfinished business from the previous Regan Administration, he was largely successful in doing so (eg implementing the peace dividend by starting the long-term process of standing down the Cold War military position). Unfortunately, Bush Sr. also thought he was above politics which resulted in his ignoring campaigning which ultimately cost him a second term. If Bush Sr. had stayed in office from 1992-96, then there would have been some legitimate chance that real debt and tax reduction would have been completed when it was the least economically painful to do so which Clinton failed to do. (One must comprehend government accounting to fully understand this.) Moreover, we may have been able to begin creating actual social security reserves that will be needed if the program has any hope to be saved. Instead we got an increased social state (that is impossible for us to afford in the long-term) and more generational tax inequities from continuing to shift the burden of current general expenditures to future generations. Some critics suggest that the U.S. should have finished off Saddam during the Gulf War, but these critics seem to be the same people who complain about a lack of international coalition today (ie the Iraq War and occupation). One should remember that the coalition was built on a limited engagement (ie ousting Saddam from Kuwait) and substantially going beyond these constraints would have most likely resulted in serious damage to American relations in the Middle East (though one could argue, perhaps, that Bush Sr. should have negotiated fewer limitations).
