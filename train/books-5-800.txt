The Chamber of Secrets is the second book in the enormously popular Harry Potter series. I have read all four of the books, and I find that this one is my favorite. It has the best plot, most character developement, and most colorful characters. The plot goes something like this: Harry Potter is encouraged not to come back to school for his second year at Hogwarts magic school by a little house-elf named Dobby. Harry ignores him, however, as he wants to escape the oppression of his cruel aunt and uncle. Harry comes back, and then his fellow students start turning into stone. Everyone blames Harry, though they can't prove it. Harry and his friends Hermione (pronounced HERM-I-O-NE, please get it right, I'm sick of hearing people say HERMY-OWN ) and Ron must find out who is causing this treachery. I will not spoil the rest of the plot. You should buy it. It is now in paperback, therfore more affordable. Pick it up, read it, and find out what the hype is about. This is probably my favorite book ever.
