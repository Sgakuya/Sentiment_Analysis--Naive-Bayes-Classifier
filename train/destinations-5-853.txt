Canada is my country, and I'm proud to be Canadian. I've travelled almost coast to coast over the years and have been awed and amazed by works of nature ranging from spectacular Rocky Mountains to miles and miles of prairie grainfields (the biggest sky in the world) to dense, dark evergreen forests along rushing rivers tumbling over and through ancient rock. We have and have had problems but, despite what Rusty may think, we have considerably more than problems. Magellan, you really should come to Canada in the summer, visit in July or August when the sky is blue and clear, the temperature is +30 degrees Celsius (about +90 Fahrenheit), and daylight lasts forever. I'm NOT a fan of winter but the expectation of summer makes even our cold winters tolerable. I liked what CastleBee said -- you're right, you know. Many (maybe even most?) Canadians do not have fear or revulsion toward Americans. I've travelled in the U.S. a number of times and have been greeted with friendliness and hospitality. Let's face it, we're not all that different! Given the relative size and international importance of our two countries, it should not be surprising that many Americans know little about Canada and Canadians. It would take more than that to make me feel inferior -- Canada is my country, and I'm proud to be Canadian!
