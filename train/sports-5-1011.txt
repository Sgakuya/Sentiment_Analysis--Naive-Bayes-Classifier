Bonds was a great player from day one, but he was not a pure power hitter. He was a good fielder, could hit for high average, had a little pop in his bat, and was an absolute terror on the base paths. A certain Hall of Famer, for sure. That being said, he doesn't deserve the home run record. He went from 185 lbs to 225 lbs in essentiially 4 months. That is physically impossible without the use of steroids. I used to be an amateur body builder and the best gain I could get in a year was about 20 lbs of muscle, and that was by watching everything I ate, taking loads of protein, lifting several hours a day, and sleeping 10 hours a night. Until I did a cycle of Andro and put on 10 lbs of muscle in 6 weeks. It is physically impossible to gain what Bonds gained in the time-frame he gained it without Roids! After his gain, he went from 30 - 35 homeruns a year to 60- 70 homers a year. Coincidence? No, it's cheating. Without the steroids, Bonds would be sitting right around 600 HR, not 700 HR. Still a fantastic accomplishment, and HOF credentials for sure. But MLB needs to do something about maintaining the integrity of Aarons record. They ought to take away the tainted home runs from his totals...but they won't, because having someone approach 755 puts people in the seats and makes $$$.
