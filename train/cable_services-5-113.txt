bought Sirius this year. I was skeptical at first having to pay for radio but boy was it worth it. I was tired of having only one channel in my area with music that I liked and tired of waiting for the commericals to end. I now love Sirius and haven't listend to FM since. No commercials on any of the music channels, NFL, NHL, NBA, and NASCAR in 2007. Dang...I sound like a commercial. The only downside to Sirius is deciding what to listen to. For $12 bucks a month, well worth it. I bought Sirius for the coming of Howard Stern at the end of this year. I still would subscribe anyway even if he wasn't coming. Terrestrial Radio, in my opinion, will be obsolete in a couple of years.
