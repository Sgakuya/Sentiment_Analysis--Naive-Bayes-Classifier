I thinik eddie jordan is a hell of a coah. I mean he doesn't make the best descisions as far as picking the right roster, but he does what he can under the circumnstances he was/is in. Sacramento was horrible. Poor eddie tried to make a name for himself and make the kings a cometitive ball club, but look at his roster. What was he suppose to do with that? The nets is a better example of his work. He had a great ball club and he took them as far as they allowed him to. Byron scott was just collecting the pay checks. Now he's in washington, where he's back at square one by the looks of the trades and draft picks. I think eddie needs a challenge. He's afraid of going to a team and messing up what may be a good thing. Like the situation in Philadelpia, he shyed away from that because he didn't want all the pressure. He welcomed the pressure in New Jersey because byron was there for the cover. If he wants to be truly successful, he needs to let things happen, go with the flow.I love you eddie!
