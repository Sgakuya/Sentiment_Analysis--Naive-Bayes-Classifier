A pecular story surrounds the Virago's development. Yamaha felt for some reason that this bike would take the flat track races by storm. I believe they were drunk with their success with the 650 twin and felt that a backwards-running v-twin would be the next step. Well, in this roll it really didn't measure up. But Yamaha had to do something with their motor and put out the Virago. part of the racing dreams went into the early Virago, most notably the mono air shock. What Yamaha didn't grasp, was that they had an excellent street bike and awesome rat bike platform. Sadly, Yamaha decided to re-vamp the Virago as a Harley knock-off, eliminating the outstanding suspension in favor of chromey-twin shocks and needles chrome accessories. I had an 81 Virago 750 that I ratted out and had some good times till I got hit by a car, mangling my leg. I first parted out my 750 and a 920 and hogged them togeather. Most parts were interchangable. Dropping a 920 motor into the 750 thus eliminating all the uglyness of the 920 styling. I had some pipes from J.C. Whitney-the only thing they put out that was any good. Replaced the 750's stock 16 wheel with an 18 wheel from an 81 Seca-they interchange perfectly. If you put the smaller wheel on the Seca, you'd get a freaky hot drag bike. I added 6 extended forks from Forks by Frank. Sometimes I miss my old bike.
