I really liked Vientiane. It was a pleasant break from Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Very quiet and laid-back. The people are wonderful--visit some wats and cheery Lao monks will most likely take you under their wings and befriend you. Also, some of the best French cuisine outside of France is available in Laos. A former colony, Vientiane has several French restaurants where one can get a fantastic meal, with wine, for $5 or so. Although I got a little bored before the end of my stay (I didn't bring enough reading material and there wasn't much available there) the people and food made my visit very enjoyable and memorable.
