Don't like him, personally, but you can't rank the current home run king lower than a 5. He did have a long career, he did play in a small, home run favorable stadium (as did Ruth) and had good hitters behind him for most of his career. That being said, he took care of himself, played his defensive position well and was virtually injury-free while he was playing. Those things count for something, too. There were many ballplayers with more significant skills and competitive instincts, who made more of an impression by their play and their conduct on and off the field. But Hank hit the home runs, helped his team and stayed in the game, in spite of some ugly racism around the time he eclipsed the Babe's record (nothing quite like Maris' struggle, because it happened in April) but he kept on and fought the good fight. Compared to Ruth (who should be rated somewhere around 8 or 9) Aaron was in a pack of very good ball players, but he did hit the most home runs of anybody, for now.
