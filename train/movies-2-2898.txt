It set itself up to be a truly good movie! Gibson had a girl and looked like he'd finally find hapiness, Michael (a.k.a. Bugsy ) finally found a girl, the one guy's girlfriend (beautiful!) finally found them a good place to live, and I was prepared for some good drama because the big fisherman guy's son was an excellent actor, and his parents were going to be divorcing, etc. And I'd heard lousy things about it, and was doubting them, until the film just started to get stupid after far too many colossal waves. I was tired when I saw it, so maybe the fact that I had no patience for a pointless waste of time contributed, but wow this was really sucking. And nothing happened in the end! I'm not asking for a happily ever after, but I would have appreciated it if something more happened!
