I have recently enrolled in UOP online/flexnet. The experience is a joke. I am pursuing an accounting degree and have attended community college for two years. THe first class is a breeze just to get you used to the format of the class. I checked on my next 3 classes and there was absolutely nothing relevant to accounting besides the importance and history. The textbooks I read through reminded me of a history or english class. Anybody who takes the time to do the work will get an A. Grades should be determined by attendance, effort, and skills learned. Not attendance and effort. Learning to write essays on the importance of accounting is ridiculous, and I believe that a person who hopes to gain knowledge of accounting and be able to have a career in the accounting field should steer clear of UOP. UOP disgraces academics by collecting tuition from students and giving useless information for working adults which will only teach the adults how to write reports.
