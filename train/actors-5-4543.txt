You know I once worked with a guy whose next-door neighbor s brother s dentist was married to Kevin Bacon s best friend s landscaper. NOT! Seriously though Kev is quite the actor overall though oddly I haven t really enjoyed too many of his films. Footloose easily springs to mind as one of the more weak titles even if it did have a catchy hit song (LOL) - what a STOOPID premise. Tremors is another lame-o although it did have a few campy/funny moments. My least favorite would have to be She s Having a Baby which I felt was a failed yet embarrassing attempt by Hollywood to return to romantic comedy. As much as I disliked those silly little flicks I would still be willing to believe that my opinion was due to the cheesiness of the material and not the actor. After all, he made one really excellent love-to-hate-him villain in The River Wild and he blew me away as convict Henri Young in Murder in the First . So, though his film selections IMO have occasionally been questionable I can still see that he has very good range and the definite potential to entertain.
