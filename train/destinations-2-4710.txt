I'm from the midwest so if anything I'm predisposed to give this town the benefit of the doubt. And I have. If I were just thinking about the city then it would have to be about minus one. What happened to the city of Detroit is beyond sad, it's catastrophic. Think of all the worst things that have happened to the great northern cities in the Post WWII era, multiply it and then you have Detroit. After the riots of 1967 the town was dead in the water within a decade. Because there are a number of clean, prosperous suburbs surrounding the central core, and the fact that I think metro I give Detroit 2 stars. Sorry to do it because most Detroiters are straight at you mid westerners and I've had a number of good times attending sporting events in Detroit even while rooting against the locals.
