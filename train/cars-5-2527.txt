Swarzkoph...you must have your information mixed up. The fastest production car ever was the 1988 Sledgehammer Corvette that topped out at 244 MPH. The reason the supra should have a 5.0 rating, and supercars a 4.0 rating is the affordability factor. What good is a sports car if most people can't ride in one, let alone own one. the true joy of a car is driving it. The Supra is the only true affordable supercar. Tell me of ANY car ever made that costs under $45,000 USD that goes 0-60 in 5 seconds and a top speed of 155 governed or 183 ungoverned(that cuts out the corvette). the only car close to that is the Nissan 300ZX wich has a 0-60 time of 5.3 seconds (I'm a little hazy on its top speed). If you can contest what I have just said, I'd appreciate you telling me.
