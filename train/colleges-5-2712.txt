This is a small, private urban college located in a historic area on the north side of Indianapolis. It is within walking distance of the Indianapolis Museum of Art, about 10 minutes from the heart of Indianapolis and about 5 minutes from the Broadripple area with its trendy shopping, restaurants and clubs. Butler is a liberal arts and science based university, which offers a variety of both undergraduate and graduate degrees that range from fine arts to pharmacy. With its many mature trees and older well-built and maintained stone and brick buildings, the campus has an intimate feeling and serene park-like beauty. This campus and its approximately 20 buildings have no doubt gone through many changes including campus restructuring and additions since it was established in its second location on the city's north side. Yet it is obvious that, over the years, the administration wisely and successfully endeavored to maintain the integrity of the valuable historic architecture - stressing restoration opposed to renovation. For this reason, there is a very good chance that this lovely old campus will only continue to improve as time goes by. I did not graduate from Butler but I did take a few classes here and very much preferred it in every way to the huge state university where I received my degree. Aside from the gorgeous surroundings, I really saw the value in the low student/faculty ratio (13-1). While the opportunity to establish an actual working relationship with an instructor can exist in larger colleges, the small class size at Butler guarantees this with every course. Also, the faculty at Butler is largely made up of full-time, full professors - opposed to the hundreds of transient associate faculty who populate the larger state university I attended. Given their opportunity to build a better working relationship with the students and their full time dedication to teaching the result is a well-rounded quality educational experience.
