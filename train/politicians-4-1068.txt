Sorry for the off-taste people but facts are facts. I do not for the life of me see how you people speak so highly of Mr.Ariel Sharon, who has a but really dark past or history as you might want to be mentioned. While the most of you might be lauding that he is a better candidate than Ehud Barak..think again after reading this. 1. Sharon was responsible for the massacre of approz 69 unarmed women and children in the bombing of 45 houses in the village of Qibya,west Bank on October 1953 when he was a military officer commandering unit 101 of the Israeli Commandos. 2. As the former Defense Minister of Israel, Sharon had a hand in the massacre of approx 700 Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla by providing support and protection for the Lebanese militiamen who carried out the murders. So how can we support such a cruel human being such as Ariel Sharon, whom if fact should have been hauled up to The Hague and be tried for war crimes and inhumanity against mankind. I personally think that he should change his name to Azriel, which I think is more befitting for a beast like him. For the uninitiated, Azriel is the icon of Death.
