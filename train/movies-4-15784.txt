The movie of a coke-dealer didn't sound appealing to me at first, but since i am a HUGE depp fan, i decided to rent it. it had bits of comedy, but it was depressing. i mean, i nearly cried at the end, and walked away from it feeling less-than-satisfied. I didn't like Tuna's actor very much, seeing as he was on boy meets world and wasn't even very good there, but depp did pull off another amazing performance... i mean you could almost see the pain in his eyes when his daughter got taken away. i really liked this movie, despite the depressive-ness (not a wooord...), and think that it had a good-natured undertone and a tiny moral packed in there somewhere... i give it a 4 :)
