 Clark I think we're lost , Helen we're not lost, will you please let me do the driving I honestly don't think we're gonna find the Grand Canyon on this road! Jesus it's only the biggest goddamn hole in the world! And is it ever. You really need to see the Grand Canyon at some point in your life. What can I say it's unbelievable, it's just so immense it's like some huge creature left this massive, twisted footprint in the earths surface. Just pressed it straight down so that the edges drop off in a near sheer wall to the canyon floor. We hiked down the North Rim trail to the bottom and spent the night along the river. There's actually a guy who has a house down at the bottom who lives there year round, (or at least he did 11 years ago). The story I heard was that he had something to do with the hydro power in the area and was able to finagel a plot of land from the parks service. So as you approach the bottom, covered in red clay dust, sweating like a pig, and roasting like one too you come across an igloo water cooler filled with ice cold lemonade waiting for the infrequent hiker. Good Lord let me tell you that was some of the best, most memorable lemonade I have ever had. He does ask for donations of some amount to pay for the supplies so bring some change with you if you go. If you think the hike down in 110 degree weather was bad, wait till you turn around the next day and head back up. That was our one mistake. If I could do it again I would've spent another day at the bottom, both to explore more and to rest up before starting the ascent. Especially because one of the guys in our group was a bit of a Nancy Boy and my buddy and I had to haul up most of his stuff about 6 1/2 of the 7 miles.
