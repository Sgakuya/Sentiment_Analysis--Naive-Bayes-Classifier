It's easy to see why Lady Chatterly's Lover was so controversial when it was written in 1928. D.H. Lawrence's use of explicit sexual language caused it to be labeled an obscene and filthy work by U.S. Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield, who made it illegal to send this book through the mail. Once you get past the sexual content (which really isn't that shocking for today's readers), you will find a very well-written book that explores not only a woman rebeling against the place that society has set for her, but also a powerful condemnation on society's increasing focus on wealth (and consequent loss of spirituality). Definitely worth reading - a lot of the themes are relevant to today, and it's interesting to see that graphic sexual content is not a new thing.
