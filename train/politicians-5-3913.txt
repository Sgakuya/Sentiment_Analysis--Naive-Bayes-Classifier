George Bush is a candidate for the people. As a military member, a mother and a military wife, I feel that Gov. Bush will aide in the welfare of the military family. We are on call 24 hrs a day, for the American Public. Gov. Bush will see that we are appreciated and cared for. Often I hear the phrase, well you enlisted, you are not forced to sign up. I answer, but if we didn't protect and serve this GREAT COUNTRY, how many people, would rush across the boarders each time a conflict broke out. It is one thing to say and another to do, If George Bush is elected, he will do for the military and maybe for once in my career, we can be considered the middle class.
