I picked this up the other day at a dvd shop and revelled in the past. What a great campy flick! Magellan gave a great review below so I shall not repeat. I remember when this was first playing, in the late 1950's, at one of our local theaters that was kind of a dump. It was right against a busy street where a highway ran past, and the boards with all that great red jello leered out at the traffic, daring them to come in and confront the Blob. As I remember, the kids got trapped in one of those 1940's diners and then escaped into the basement! Did a diner ever have a basement? Yes it did, ladies and gentlemen, IN THE BLOB!
