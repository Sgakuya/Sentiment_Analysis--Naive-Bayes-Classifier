I've lived in London for nearly a year now and I still love the place - despite the numerous amounts of people in the centre which can make it impossible to get around. London is full of amazing buildings and has such unique places to visit. I work near Piccadilly Circus and am greeted with the sight of Eros and the horses statues every time I go to work, Leicester and Trafalgar Squares are close by as is Buckingham Palace. Thats the thing about London, things are close by, but sometimes you just don't realise it. I do advise people who are planning to come over to make sure of one thing, if you are planning to see a lot and will be using the tube, ensure there isn't a strike taking place. You can check at www.bbc.co.uk/londonlive. Its very difficult trying to get around if theres a strike going on. We've got a couple more happening. Thankfully I know where to catch a bus where there won't be a massive queue so I can get home! And yes, do read up on the history of London, its absolutely fascinating and you'll fall in love with the place even more.
