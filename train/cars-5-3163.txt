Had my '97 Limited with all the options for the last 140K miles without a problem. I made it to 115K before I had to replace the front brake pads. Change the oil every 4K and get all of the scheduled services. Great in the snow and on ice. Can be uncomfortable on long trips and the oil filter is a pain to get at (much better placement on the new models). Not most powerful towing rig (V6), but more then adequate to tow a 3,000 lb boat and trailer to the lake in the spring and back again in the fall. I owned Subarus, Mercedes, Volvo, Chevy, and Nissan before. Never had a car make it this long without a major repair. It may be a fluke or just good design but I like it.
