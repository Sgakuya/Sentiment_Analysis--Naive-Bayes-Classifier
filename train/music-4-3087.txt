NEIL YOUNG HAS PERFORMED WITH MANY GROUPS TO PERFECT HIS IDEAS INCLUDING, BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD, CROSBY/STILLS/NASH/YOUNG,STRAY GATORS,CRAZY HORSE,AND PROBABLY MANY MORE. HARVEST(1972) AND LIVE RUST(1978) ARE MY TWO FAVORITE ALBUMS EVER BY NEIL YOUNG. NOT COUNTING BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD-AGAIN(1966) WHICH WAS MAINLY NEIL YOUNG AND STEVEN STILLS WHICH FEATURED THE SONG FOR WHAT ITS WORTH . IN NEIL YOUNG'S LIVE RUST TOUR WITH CRAZY HORSE NEIL WROTE EVERY SONG HIMSELF EXCEPT FOR MY MY, HEY HEY (OUT OF THE BLUE). LIVE RUST ALSO FEATURED CLASSICS LIKE SUGAR MOUNTAIN, COMES A TIME, I AM A CHILD. THEN EASES INTO ROCK HARD SONGS LIKE HEY HEY, MY MY(INTO THE BLACK) HEY HEY MY MY ROCK AND ROLL CAN NEVER DIE... MY MY HEY HEY ROCK AND ROLL IS HERE TO STAY... TRIBUTE TO SEX PISTOL JOHNNY ROTTEN. LYNYRD SKYNYRD DID NOT AGREE WITH A SONG IN HARVEST SO SKYNYRD BADMOUTHED NEIL IN THEIR SONG SWEET HOME ALABAMA WELL LYNYRD SKYNYRD AND ALABAMA CAN SHOVE IT! SKYNYRD NEVER KNEW HOW TO REALLY ROCK! I KNEW THAT AT FIRST WHEN I READ LYNYRD SKYNYRD GOT THEIR NAME FROM A HIGH SCHOOL COACH THAT SUSPENDED THEM FOR HAVING LONG HAIR! NEIL YOUNG IS A LEGEND AND ALWAYS WILL BE!
