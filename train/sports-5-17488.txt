lifelong Vike fan and therefore must first cop to the fact that yes, they are the losers of four Superbowl appearances and yes, unfortunately, those losses were suffered under the direction of a coach who sits amid the coaching pantheon - Bud Grant. With their colrs, their history and hell, even their mascot (Ragnar, not that Vikedontrix thing), they stand apart as a team of class, commitment and determination. Not the same since we moved indoors, but a lot of us older-than-younguns remember the days when the Vikes went sleeveless and the lambs came into town from LA and conceded before kickoff. Bottom line -- the Hail Mary never should've happened (Krause DID NOT push the guy out of bounds the play before so midfield position would NOT have been established; ALSO that was offensive interference on the actual play) AND the Atlanta win in '98 was total bulls*it due, in part, to Denny takin' a knee with more than a minute left in the first half and three timeouts left. Are we not Vikes?! Hopefully, Mr. Tice and Mr. O'Leary can keep Moss under some kind of control .... and good riddance to Carter -- go to the Hall of Fame and leave your f'n mouth in Canton. One of my favorite and most frustrating teams to root for -- but you just have to love 'em. If you're looking for a team, there's room aborad our ship. COWBOYS SUCK.
