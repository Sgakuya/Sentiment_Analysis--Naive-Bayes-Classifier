Not so good was Mr. Truman. Aside form having an affair, his policies were unsound and cowardly. He constantly was faltering back on civil rights issues due to the threat of So. white democrats to mobilize against him in the election. Furthermore, He justifies killing thousand of innocents by saying we saved U.S. troops lives. Rubbish, we were more effective with air raids (that did not kill children). He kicked off the cold war then constantly was using belicose cold war rhet in order to stir up some domestic support. This of course riled some people up so much that a Joe MCCarthy starts 'witch hunting'. Oh yeah, and the Truman doctrine-we are at war today becasue of this one. this is the most losely intepreted piece of legislation in U.S. history. And that reminds me, he sorta misinterpreted everything at Yalta. Self-rightious, and perhaps deaf and daft! At least he relieved MacArthur, and did not let STROM get into office.
