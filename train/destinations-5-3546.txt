Portland is the most amazing city. It is a city yet has a homey feeling to it. It isn't so big that it overwhelms you. It is big enough though to have a variety of people. Everyone is so down to earth. There is so much to do from great restaurants filled with personality to movie theaters that serve beer and food to breweries to great little streets to browse or St. John's landing to stroll along the water. Portland has a great strip of sidewalk that you can ride your bike or run on. It is just this great city that has everything you would want. The cost of living is so reasonable, especially for all that is there.
