When you disregard the fact that the author was a monster, Mein Kampf (My Struggle) is actually a fascinating piece of literature. Do me a favor, and before you people rate Mein Kampf , read the book first. You'll agree. As a person who usually likes to see both sides of an argument, I was thoroughly interested in seeing WWII from Hitler's point of view. And reading about his days as a veteran in WWI was exciting, to say the least. My favorite part of the book was where Hitler talked about his days as a prisoner of war. The man had a stone-cold heart, but was actually a decent writer. Do I recommend this book to everyone? No. But if you are strong and open-minded, you can get a lot out of Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Take care, everyone!
