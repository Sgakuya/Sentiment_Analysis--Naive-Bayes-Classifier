i'm a masochist, i love the red sox. i wrote that before we were world champions. right now i'm still in a fog, but it will sink in more tomorrow. i have only been following the redsox since 1975 and they have broken my heart numerous times. tonight they delivered what ted williams, bobby doerr, jimmy foxx, yaz, luis tiant, jim rice, fred lynn, dewey evans, nomar, and that turncoat vulture roger clemens were unable to deliver. in no way do i compare my suffering to those in new england who live and breathe red sox baseball, but i feel as if a tremondous weight has been lifted from my shoulders. i am so proud.
