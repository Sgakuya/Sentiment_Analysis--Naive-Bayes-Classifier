The bike is not fast. It has smooth torque and power delivery giving it very good street manners.Max HP@7200 rpm.It is very well balanced and stable, but will corner as fast as almost any sport bike, and the torque shoots you out of corners.The riding position is relaxed enough for day trips. The brakes are fantastic! Good suspension with monolink rear and inverted front forks.I know several ladies that ride them comfortably. Not as dependable as a Japanese 600, or close to being as fast, but it is very sexy and you really feel as if you are part of the bike. It very fun to ride and comes with prestige and uniqueness.
