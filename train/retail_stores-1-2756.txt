This place is just AWFUL.Last time I went there (and it will BE the LAST time!) after spending well over $100. I got NO HELP getting huge lumber on my cart,NO HELP getting it shrink wrapped so it wouldn't fall off the top of my truck,and after waiting almost half an hour outside-the only employee who helped me put the items on my truck was a retarded guy who was pushing carts back out of the parking lot.I went inside several times to ASK for help,and the only result was some dipshit with a clipboard came out and dissapeared inside again without being any assistance at all.This was the last of MANY bad experiences at Home Depot.Now I foud out that they use Rainforest wood- helping destroy the precious environment to save themselves a few bucks.No wonder the employees don't give a damn.They are working for selfish idiots.
