Funny, how astute the American beer drinker claims to be, yet keeps on buying inferior beer. People use beer in different ways. There is the Happy Hour way-- 3-5 beers and head home. The Party way-- 6-12 beers and head home. The Partying way-- 12-24 beers and sleep over. Heineken is a terrific Party beer. If Im having just a few Ill enjoy some micros or a Samuel Smith or Fullers, but if Im going to be drinking for more than a couple hours I enjoy something lighter on the belly and not as heavy on the palate. Good ole Heineken. (Same stuff as they brew in Holland because its the same stuff they brew in Holland. Read the label, Holier-Than-Thou Quaffers. The only leg youll have to stand on is the freshness.)
