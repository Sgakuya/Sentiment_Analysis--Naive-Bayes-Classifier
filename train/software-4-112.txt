I've recommended Turbo Tax for years because it's so much easier and quicker than doing taxes by paper, and cheaper than going to a preparer. That said, I was disappointed with the version I tried early in 2003 because every step of the way it was trying to sell you extra services, which really annoyed me after a while. After getting many complaints about the registration feature last year, the version for this year allows for loading the software on more than one computer. From what I've heard, many other big name tax preparation software packages have caught up to TurboTax in quality and ease of use. I've heard they also have a decent free version online of Turbo Tax, with a fee to e-file. In short, any major brand of tax prep software can make taxes much less of a chore, and is worth trying.
