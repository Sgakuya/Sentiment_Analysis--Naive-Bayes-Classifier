A very fine actor with gifts for the dramatic and comedic, and as such, strayed from the same role all the time limitations of many actors in his generation. Although Lemmon usually played the same types, i.e., in his youth he portrayed the decent, well-scrubbed, somewhat daring yet wobbly naif and in later life was the quintessential player of anguished, frustrated middle aged WWII generation schmo, he brought differing color, texture, quirks and temper to the personae he assumed. Outstanding comic roles in Mr. Roberts, The Apartment Some Like It Hot, The Fortune Cookie, and The Odd Couple. Likewise on the dramatic side in The Days of Wine and Roses, Save The Tiger, Missing, and Glengarry Glen Ross. Was also good in Cowboy, Under the Yum Yum Tree, It Could Happen to You, and The Out of Towners. A fine pianist, as well, and the vocal records he released in the early 1950s were surprisingly good. He had a long and fruitful career, with no major setbacks, which is why he left such a large body of work. One of the best performers in Hollywood history, who chose scripts well and achieved effective and convincing chemistry with virtually every other actor/actress he ever worked with. A real pro.
