Hi, how's it going? Just wanted to stop in and tell you how lousy this movie was. Lousy with a capital L . Some halfway decent special effects and some easy on the eyes actresses but even that wasn't enough to stop this bomb from exploding. Weak story line, weak acting, ridiculous play of events, it stunk. Save your $3.29 and don't bother renting this and be forewarned that the upcoming sequel has GOT TO BE just as bad. Okay I suppose I would watch it again...like if I was that guy from Misery and I'd just been hobbled and had to stay in some cabin up in the Colorado mountains with some extra creepy lady who was obsessed with me and she just happened to have cable. Then and maybe just then I'd been be happy to watch it as a minor means of escape, maybe.
