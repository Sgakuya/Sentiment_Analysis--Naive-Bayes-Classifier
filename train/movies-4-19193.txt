Hellraiser used to scare me so much when I was younger that I refused to watch the whole thing. As I've gotten older, it has become harder to scare me, so now I watch it all the time. In fact, I've watched them all except the last one in the series, which I'm going to do as soon as school is out. Hellraiser isn't really scary to me anymore, it's just really gross. It's especially gross during the parts where the guy gets suspended by all the hooks tearing into his flesh. Another gross part is when the leader Igreess the Devil, mutates people to be used as one of his followers. I think the original Hellraiser is the best because it explains the story behind it, which is very intruiging on its own.
