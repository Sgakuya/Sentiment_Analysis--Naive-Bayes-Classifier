I must be the only person who wasn't bothered by how long this movie was!! I was too caught up in the story-line and action to notice! Okay, so it was written from the American point-of-view and made the Brits look like cold-heated non-humans!! If this movie had been written from the Brit point of view , the American's would have been portrayed as the epitomy of evil. So it wasn't always historically accurate, and yes, there was a love story or two added in for mush-factor , but the battle scenes had me gripping my seat, holding my breathe, and several times cheering out loud! This movie is not for the faint of heart--Benjamin Martin with a hatchet is absolutley savage!! It is predictable at times--but we know going in that it's a movie about war--and war is not pretty. I was disappointed that Braveheart kept coming to mind--same type of bludgeoning and bloodshed--just different costumes! Mel and Heath were a good choice for the leads--good on-screen chemistry!! Joely Richardson was a bit over-done in her drapes for a dress and bosom pushed up for distraction. (More of a sense of modesty would have been more believable!!) Just one word for the scene with the tattered flag reviving the spirits of the militia--- WOW !!!!
