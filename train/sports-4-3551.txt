This guy was just a pure hitter. I have to admit I'm somewhat biased in my assessment of him as he was my favorite player growing up but the numbers speak for themselves. 3000 hits, career average of 340. He probably could have hit .400 in 94 hadn't the season been cut short by the strike as he was getting hot down the stretch. Early in his career he was a phenomenal fielder winning a couple gold gloves and was a stolen base threat. His weight kind of slowed him down in his later years but he could always handle the stick. Rarely struck out and always came up big in the clutch. An all around consumate pro! I really miss watching him play.
