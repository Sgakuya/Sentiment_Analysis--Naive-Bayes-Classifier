Tim Burton is a good director who has developed his own unique style over the years. He's directed some classic movies: The Nightmare Before Christmas , Edward Scissorhands , Bettlejuice and Batman . More recently, his films have been more of a letdown, but as Wiggum stated, it was more because of the script itself than his directing. I thought that Planet of the Apes and Sleepy Hollow were fantastic directing jobs on his part. I hear that he's doing a remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory . It should be interesting to see what he does with that one- he's always got a surprise in store for the viewer.
