Talks out of both sides of his mouth. Inconsistent in his positions. Too much emphasis on religion in his life, which is suspect in a public figure in a secular country. Condemned Bubba Clinton for fooling around with The Portly Pepperpot, but voted to grant full pension benefits to that Admiral Kelso a-wipe who was in charge at the Tailhook Convention where all those women were sexually abused by those drunken pinhead flyboys. Extremely constipated rhetorical delivery. The Democratic Party should work out some deal with this guy to get him out of the picture during the 2004 Campaign, because he's far from the best candidate they have to offer and his mere presence in the mix is going to dilute and confuse matters.
