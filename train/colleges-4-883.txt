I have been an online student for two trimesters now and the professors were very good. At first they seemed a little pompus, but as the trimester continued they were much more helpfull. I took two classes and I spent more time on reading assignments and homework than I ever did at traditional colleges. However, I do feel that I learned the material better. The insight coaches were also great. The only problem I had was the fact that financial aid called every week of the trimester and still screwed my bill up. It was easily corrected by my advisor, but it upset me greatly. The school has a good name and from the instructors I had they deserve it...
