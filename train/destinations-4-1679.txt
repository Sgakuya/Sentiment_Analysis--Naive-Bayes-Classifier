Great country. People are kinder and friendlier than anywhere else I've been to. Prices are unbelievable, we stayed at a 5 star Hilton beach resort for under 100$ a night. Perfect vacation destination; Bangkok-cheap and big. One of my favorite cities in the whole world. There are tons of small beautiful postcard beaches to the south, Phuket is the most popular. If you have seen the Beach with Leo DeCaprio, that takes place and was filmed in the south of Thailand. To the North are the rural and mountanious regions. Small towns and villages dot the region. Don't miss Thailand it is an amazing experience and once you've been once you won't ever want to go home. My only complaint was that Bangkok was a bit dirty and smelly at times and there are quite a bit of homeless and destitute, a bit overwhelming at points. Also hold on to your wallet, pickpockets are crawling in crowded areas and while I wasn't a victim I have heard many cases of it happening. But don't worry too much, it is a great place to visit.
