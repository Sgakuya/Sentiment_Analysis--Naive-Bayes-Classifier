Another one where a solid cast was gathered, bushels of green were funnelled into production, it hit theaters.....and vanished. Such a fate should've never befallen this classic "good bad" movie, which featured former Beatle Ringo Starr as Stone Age ne'er-do-well Atouk, plagued by his caring nature, a brutish jerk of a tribal leader (the perfectly-cast John Matuszak), and his adoration for the leader's honey, Lana (Starr's one-time companion Barbara Bach). Through a series of bungling maneuvers, Atouk gets booted from the safety of his tribe and, with fellow outcasts Dennis Quaid, Jack Gilford, and understated muffin Shelley Long, forms another enclave of misfits who agree to help him get rid of Matuszak and back into Lana's good graces. Eventually, Starr gets what he's after, but finds his affections have taken a turn for the better elsewhere. Watch for the silly dinosaurs, the Asian guy who speaks modern English fluently, the blind Gilford's way of telling when Matuszak's around, the lonesome Yeti in the ice cavern, and the musical number in the wilderness. Innocuous fun from 1981.
