I am actually a native Georgian who was born in Marietta. I guess I finally realized how bad it was here when I visited a few non-southeastern cities. The outdoor recreation opportunities here are pitiful, and almost all of the lakes here are manmade. Driving anywhere is a nightmare because you will either get stuck in front of somebody who wants to go 15-20 miles over the speed limit, or, in the same day, somebody going under the speed limit in the left lane. I have had a hard time making friends here because most people have two-second attention spans, and nobody seems to have the time to listen to you anyways. Our summers are 5 months long and viciously hot, and our winters are not true winters, since it gets into the upper 60s in late December and January and it rarely snows. If you have an open mind, close it to the possibility of moving to Atlanta unless you can deal with wasting half of your tank of gas sitting at our numerous three-minute-long traffic lights. The Hope scholarship is the reason that I am still here, and as soon as I graduate, I would like to find a cleaner, friendlier, and more intelligently-run place to live. Oh, by the way, if you think the city of Atlanta itself is bad, then try its suburbs, which are being overdeveloped and have even worse traffic than Atlanta.
