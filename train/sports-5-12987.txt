Erickson has done what no other coach in 30 years could do - turn OSU's losing football record around. He runs the spread offense, which actually is incredibly balanced with run/pass (Junior RB Ken Simonton is currently rated in the top 5 Nationally). They are achieving this through a tenacious defense and a balanced offensive attack. As typical with the best teams, they can beat you with any of their weapons - Defense, Running, passing. This years recruiting class is shaping up to be perhaps the best ever - and potentially in the top 5-10 in the country if current progress continues. Bottom line: this is a fun team to watch play football (FINALLY!).
