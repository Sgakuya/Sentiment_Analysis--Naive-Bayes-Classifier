Like his disciple Peter Sellers, Guinness apparently lacked a sharply defined, concrete personality, but turned this behaviorial shortcoming around to benefit himself in being one of the truly great character actors by being able to easily adopt the traits, mannerisms and ethos he lacked. His early work for Ealing and other British studios is particularly brilliant, but overlooked because it's so rarely seen these days. The Ladykillers and The Man in the White Suit are the films of this vintage that show up on TV from time to time, and they're both good examples of his work at his height in the 1950s. I never saw any of his Star Wars performances, and for good reason: I wouldn't waste my time and money on such juvenile, escapist crap, leaving the ridiculous mythologies of a non-existant alternate universe to the pimply-faced adolescent louts who go in for such absurd, trivial nonsense.
