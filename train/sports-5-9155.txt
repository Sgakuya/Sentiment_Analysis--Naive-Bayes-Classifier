Jason Williams is the best PG in the NBA hands down! Big deal if he toked up while in college...who doesn't?! He DOES NOT have a drug problem, pot is not even a drug...it's an illegal cigarette. If he had more playing time he would be an All-Star every year. Rick Adelman takes him for granted! If he played as much as he should and his teammates could catch his PERFECT passes, he'd average 15 assists a game. He's the most under rated player in the NBA! When he's on the bench...the Kings slow down considerably. He is the best dribbler and passer the league has ever seen! Do you know anyone else who can throw a perfect 80 foot oop?! Didn't think so. He is the best PG in the NBA! Stick that in your pipe and smoke it!
