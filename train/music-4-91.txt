As glum as it is at moments, it's full of good material. When I bought it, the guy in the store explained that some bands got too serious about their job and forgot about having fun, and stopped putting out good material. But he said that this had enough good songs and it was well-produced so that R.E.M. veered away from losing it with this record. I think the only songs I don't care for are Star Me Kitten and the New Orleans Instrumental No. 1 (for those of us cursed with good musical ears, I noticed the guitar is JUST out of tune. I like little ditties, but this one is far too painful). Everybody Hurts is a nice song, but Stipe shouldn't try to sing that high. I love his vocals on Monty - it's a classic R.E.M. tune with accordion and storytelling lyrics. Try Not to Breathe is another favorite of mine. Ignoreland is a good political song with anthemic, pounding chords and good lyrics. I could talk about each song, but it'd be a waste of time. Anyway, good work REM!
