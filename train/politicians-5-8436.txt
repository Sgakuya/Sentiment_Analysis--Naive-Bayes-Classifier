Reagan gets a 5 in my book, for no other reason than reinvigorating an American Public low on morale after periods of inflation, gas lines, hostages in Iran, and the Soviets invading Afghanistan. Reagan spurred economic growth by passing a round of tax cuts for all income earners, including the top tax bracket. Giving businesses more of their money back allowed them to buy more equipment, hire more workers, and invest in technology that precipitated the economic boom of the 90s. Reagan's most noteworthy achievements though were in the foreign policy arena. Reagan doesn't deserve *all* the credit for Communism falling, but he does deserve *plenty* of credit. Reagan upped military spending during his two terms in office, and forced the Soviets to keep up. The Soviets couldn't and they went bankrupt. The defining moment of his administration was telling Gorbachev to Tear Down this Wall, to a thunderous applause.
