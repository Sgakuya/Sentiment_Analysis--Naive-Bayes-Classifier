This book is a sheer delight. Honest, funny, sad at times. You will get to know Bridget like a best friend - she is there to relate to you when you feel that you can't go on after your latest most embarrassing moment, she makes you feel good about yourself because even you are not such a failure with men (surely?) and she will teach you that depending on self help books as a source of fact is probably the worst choice you could ever make. Funny, witty, and with a fine line between realistic drama and exaggerated comedy - a line that a man simply wouldn't be able to distinguish (they would never believe that we count our calories!)
