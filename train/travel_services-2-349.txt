It's funny how we hardly ever speak of and certainly don't remember and regurgitate stories about how good a particular flight was but everyone has a story about how awful one was. Well mine was on TWA and let me first say I've since flown them and had a much more pleasant experience, but I had a really lousy flight on TWA from LA to NYC about 5 years ago. The actual flight wasn't so terrible but it was a redeye flight and the plane was filthy, the stewards/stewardesses were confrontational, the food was served (I kid you not) in a plastic shopping bag that was hand to me without any sort of tray, and I just kept thinking if times are so tough I'm not feeling to confident about what the maintenance on say oh the engines might be like. Well I obviously landed safely but it took a long time, and a price war before I paid for a seat on TWA again.
