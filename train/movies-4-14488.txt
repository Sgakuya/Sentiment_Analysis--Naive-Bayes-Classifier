I took the bait and went to check out 'Almost Famous' and came out of it thinking that it is a really solid movie. I would recommend it to a wide range of people - frineds, parents and so on. It definitely appeals to the masses and I think that says a lot about a movie that can be classified as a movie about rock 'n' roll in the early 70s. Great music throught the movie. I am not sure what this can be classified as - a coming of age movie (for each and every character in the movie)? A music movie? A romantic comedy? Drama? Hhmmm.. maybe it is a little bit of all of these I cannot inagine what would have been more fun than being in a rock band back in those days. Check out the movie, you'll like it a lot.
