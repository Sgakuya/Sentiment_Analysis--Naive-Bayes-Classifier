Released in 1980 and directed by John Landis, National Lampoon's Animal House has become the standard college film against which all sophomorish comedies are measured. There is no real plot, as the film simply takes us through the madcap adventures of the Delta Fraternity House at Faber College in 1962. The Delta's are essentially a group of slack professional students, drunks, and general underachievers, namely John Bluto Blutarsky (John Belushi), Eric Otter Stratton (Tim Matheson), et al. Unfortunately, Dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon) is not a fan of the Deltas, places the fraternity on double secret probation, and entices the rival, straightlaced Omegas to help him get Delta's charter revoked. This movie breathed new life into the fraternity concept, not to mention food fights and toga parties. While many critics and comments concentrate on John Belushi's performance, this film was successful largely due to Tim Matheson's portrayal of the smooth, ladies' man Otter and the use of music from the early 1960's. The bottom line is that National Lampoon's Animal House is great comedy for its non-cerebral humor and remains a common viewing experience for a generation.
