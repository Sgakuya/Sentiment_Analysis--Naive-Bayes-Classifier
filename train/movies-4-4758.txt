Critics slam-dunked it so bad, I didn't want to see it. But my wife deemed it mandatory family fun. Though I expected to snooze, Surprise!!! The movie was cute and entertaining. The special effects were stunning, although I must agree with the consensus that the facial features looked kind of rubbery and outright goofy. It kind of reminded me of the facial expressions I see with my son's Madden '04 PC Game. But that's trivial compared to the overall sweep of the movie, which is heartwarming and with a point to make. Though naysayers cited Polar Express as a flop based on its early box-office rake, it seems to have legs and consistently grosses $10-$15M each week. It has good potential to become one of those long-term holiday mainstays.
