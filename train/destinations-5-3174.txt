The height of American ignorance and self-obsessive stupidity is the general perception of Canada. I went to Toronto and nothing could be further from the truth. An incredibly clean, respectable city with friendly, helpful people everywhere. The city always feels really alive and there's lots to do. One complaint though: The beer in Ontario is controled by the government and they only allow the sale of a very small selection of beer, mainly the big brewers, so you can't really find a good selection of beer outside of a bar. Allen's is a restaurant located in the NW part of the city. It has an incredible ambience, great food, and over 200 DIFFERENT types of beer. When your done eating go next door to Dora Keogh's, it's a pub owned by the same woman who owns Allen's, go in and have a pint of guiness. Another recomendation is The Biere Market, it serves over 250 VARIETIES of beer and belgian food. Since they have universal healthcare its almost like they are our big brother.
