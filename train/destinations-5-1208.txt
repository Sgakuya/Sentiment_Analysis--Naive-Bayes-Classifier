I'm delighted to see that a once poor country is now thriving economically and has an extremely positive,forward-looking image.Ireland has rightly been renowned for its writers-Yeats,Joyce,Wilde,Shaw etc.It is wild and romantic,the people are welcoming.I particularly love the West;Connemara has a wonderful sense of open space and peace(the popular film The Quiet Man was filmed there).Kylemore Abbey is in a lovely spot.The Cliffs of Moher are dramatic,and further South,the Ring of Kerry(mountains and unspoilt coastline) is beautiful.I've been twice in May:it was gloriously sunny all week,though i know others who've been less fortunate.I shall certainly return in the not too distant future- to a real Emerald Isle.
