This movie is as incredibly weird and disturbing as it is strangely compelling. The dialogue/narration, especially at the beginning of the movie, is probably some of the most creative I have ever heard. Edward Norton gave an excellent performance and this is easily one of the most memorable from Brad Pitt. Helena Bonham Carter was extraordinary as Marla and looked so much as though she had just exited the set of a Tim Burton movie that I kept expecting to see sharp, pointy blades shoot out her fingers. She really took a daring trip to the opposite end of the range spectrum when you consider her past roles in Lady Jane and Room with a View . Overall, this film is like an episode of the Twilight Zone on mega-doses of steroids. And, even though I hated the violence and agree with Wiggum that the ending was unsatisfying, I would have to give it 4 stars due to originality, creativity and the high level of performances given by these three actors.
