I, like so many other people, didn't particularily care for this album the first time I heard it. It was nothing like Blue, it is nothing like any other Weezer album. It's very difficult to describe. But after many listens, this album is tied for first with Blue (if not beating it) for my favorite Weezer album. It was such a shock for people, and then suddenly the same people who shunned it began to give it the respect it deserved all along...too bad it happened so far down the line, perhaps we could have seen more Pinkerton in the later albums. I still have hopes of this in the future. If you absolutely loved the sound of Blue and are expecting the same thing on this album, it's not what you are going to get. But if you want a deeper look at Rivers, a heavier record, something besides solid gold pop, or are just curious, I highly recomend this album. Give it a few listens if you don't get what the big deal is right away. The Good Life should still be poppy enough for the poppy people, so give that track a try.
