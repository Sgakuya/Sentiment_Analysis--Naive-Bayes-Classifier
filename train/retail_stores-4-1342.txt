Macy's has the best sales and their stores carry all of the major brands. Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Calvin Klien, Jones NY, and more. During a huge sales event, the dressing rooms seem to have so many skirts, blouses,sweaters and dresses from previous customers, it's hard to find a fitting room with any room in it. But Macy's has it all. The styles are current and the quality of even the store brands of clothes is excellent. I think a few more sales associates would be helpful, but self-service is the keyword for shopping in this new milenium. Their pantyhose lingerie and bra sales have good prices and the lingerie department is usually well staffed. It's not Nordstrom, but the prices are reasonable.
