Jennifer is fantastic - and I didn't realise that Dark City had explicit sex and violence in it - and I have the film at home. I am a teenage woman (19 yrs old) and I am not inspired to become a 'slut' by watching films she has ACTED in. I doubt that the female teenage population is so easily influenced by films anyway. I should know as I have studied Media. Also, to get into Yale/Harvard, I think that the people who run those institutions aren't persuaded by the students breasts or anything else. Can I remind you that this is the 21st century, not the 18th. In regards to sex and violence, just switch onto the news and you have a whole load of it. Are we going to ban the news as well?
