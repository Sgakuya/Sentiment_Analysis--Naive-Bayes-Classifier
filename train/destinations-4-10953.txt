Maybe it was just a little kid's perspective, but Six Flags circa 1970's seemed like a faraway, exotic and exciting place. There was a sense of history and adventure in the heavily themed areas of France, Spain, etc. I loved the density of the trees, the jungle-like feel of the riverboat ride and I miss every single one if its cheesy animatronic figures (indians, witch doctors, wolves and the like). The park was pure magic to me. And I LOVED it as evening grew near making skull island even more spooky. I can still see the evil grin of the villain straddling one flume of the log ride and the lumber jack threatening riders on the other. Don't even get me started on the cave. Speelunkers rule! The park has become so commercialized (i.e. Looney Toons - loved the old cartoons, hate the characters INVASION of the park). The characters seem to have tamed the Six Flags too much and the huge themeless (or comic themed - might as well be themeless) thrill rides don't provide that special atmosphere the park was known for during its first two decades or so. Someone stated on here that the park has only one water ride when, in fact, it has four. Splashdown (multi-passenger boats, one good drop, major splash), Roaring Rapids, The Log Ride (technically El Aserradero) and The Cave (which has lost almost all of its charm now that cartoon characters have invaded it and evicted the speelunkers - when will the proper authorities confiscate Yosemite Sam's dynamite?!). I'm not impressed by the inclusion of so many mega-thrill rides to the exclusion of rides that stimulated the imagination and were family friendly. But it's still a fun place to go on occasion AND it's always awesome at Halloween! For a fun look at the park's golden days, pictures and articles on gone but fondly remembered rides, and lots of other cool stuff go to parktimes.com. Great website.
