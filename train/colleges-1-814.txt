As a very short lived former student with Western International University let me say the following: (a) the school is a joke (but then again it's an heir of the UOP; (b) Financial Aid is truly a joke; (c) My enrollment Advisor is nowhere to be found; (d) I have been told nothing but "unusual" lies I've never heard of in an educational environment; (e) They talk a good game until they get you in and then they think they have you hooked; (f) It took darned near 4 weeks into a 9 week program before my academic advisor contacted me; (g) They literally provide you with the paperwork which clearly implicates their "unusual" practices; (h) They assume you know no better than to believe their B.S.; (i) I reported them to a division of the DOE inturn, the DOE representatives have contacted the Financial Aid Office of Theft on several occasions regarding my case. To date, The Financial Aid Office of Theft has not returned any of their phone calls. Go figure. My next step is to file a complaint thru the Arizona Attorney General's Office based on Theft By Deception, Negligence and a few other choice words. Both institutions should be drawn and quartered for the numerous violations students have brought to the attention of the DOE and whomever else. You know a problem exists when EMPLOYEES post negative feedback about their employer. Take a hint: Find another online school to devote your time and hard earned money too or else you too will be SCREWED over many times.
