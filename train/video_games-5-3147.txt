Of the Silent Hill franchise, this second installment is the fan favorite and it's easy to see why. Every detail in the game has been designed meticulously with an excellent understanding of the psychological roots of terror. Sounds are designed to be unpredictable and are indescribably unique, avoiding as the sound director comments, the cliched groans and gunshots you might find in a Resident Evil game. Adversaries are designed with the concept of twisted psuedo-humanity in mind and are grotesque to behold. Backgrounds are all designed from the observation of dilapidated buildings to give the image of bleakness and desolation. All design elements though, despite their brilliance, fall prostrate to the plot and the characters. The moody scenario, that of the young widower James driving to the ominous lakeside town of Silent Hill because of an inexplicable letter from his dead wife, is ever evolving but constantly enigmatic to the very end. Along the way James meets Eddie( the lonely loser whose self-esteem comes from the barrel of a gun) Alison (a suicidal teenager who is pitiful but painfully inaccessible), Laura (whose playfulness is creepily incongruous given the setting) and Maria, who could just as easily be a manifestation of James' inner turmoil as a real person. The game winds its way to one of five possible conclusions and the one you receive is decided secretly as you play. The masterfully crafted horror game that is Silent Hill 2 is as much a work of art as it is a video game.
