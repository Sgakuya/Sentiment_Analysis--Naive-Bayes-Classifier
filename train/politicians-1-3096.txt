For all the obvious reasons. As a side note, as an African-American I am saddened and astonished that some of us have chosen to call Clinton the first black president. Was no one watching when he gave William Fullbright, a known segregationist and racist, the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest peacetime award? Clinton called this man his MENTOR! I'm sitting here shaking my head in dismay. And by the way, to all those wanting to holler about how great he made the economy, here's a class in economics. The cyclical economic upturn began before he came into office, and the downturn began almost two years before he left office...look it up. Not to mention that a little thing called 9/11 messed us up worse than any president could. And wouldn't it have been nice if Clinton had taken Osama bin Laden from Sudan for prosecution when they wanted to turn him over, instead of saying I don't want to get involved ? We had 5 terrorist attacks while this guy was in office, and he's cutting back on the CIA and FBI all the while. AND cutting back our border patrols. He wasn't just human ...not every man is a lecherous fool. I realize that Clinton made people feel better about their own aberrant behavior, and I realize that some people's only criteria of how good a president is lies in how well he plays the saxophone, but character counts. Remember character? It's what you do when no one's watching. His infidelities were not cute ; after seeing how he'd lie to keep them from coming to light, does anyone realize what a weak link he was to national security? The possibility for extortion he presented boggles the mind. So no NO and again NO...Clinton was not a good president. All those who like to giggle behind their hand about his indiscretions, and who like to ignore his dangerous policies will get a rude awakening 10 years down the road when all the truth comes out. Especially about all those bodies.
