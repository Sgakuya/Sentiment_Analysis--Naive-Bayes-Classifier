I wonder if Buchanan knows he's merely a tool for liberal media outlets. Far too often, I see Buchanan as the conservative representative in a left-right discussion. However, he is constantly criticizing President Bush and neo-conservatives (note: neo-conservatives is a code word by the liberal media and Buchanan for Jewish Conservatives, when in reality the actual term means new conservatives). The media's goal here is to say, See? Even conservatives like Buchanan are at odds with Bush's agenda! Sorry, we're not buying it, as most political observers are aware that the Bush Family and Buchanan were never the best of friends. I have no problem with Buchanan offering differing views to the current administration, but I'm sick of the media annointing him as the token conservative during political discussions.
