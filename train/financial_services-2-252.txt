Service is fair, but, at least in California, they are pushing Spanish as the business language of the future! My new checking account is called a Nuevo Future account (New Future); it's currently their standard free checking account here. Today, in the branch, I asked why they are using this nomenclature, and was handed a flyer touting the benefits of the account, and it listed: A. Direct Deposit B. Ease of sending money to Mexico! Now that's a big selling point to the majority of Californians - remind them how much of their economy is being siphoned off to Mexico! And, of course, the back side of this document has all the same data - in Spanish. All this is obvious pandering to the Hispanic market, but it seems they are trying to force everyone in that direction, or don't care about the English-speaking market. I'm beginning to wonder when their ATM's will stop offering English as a choice!
