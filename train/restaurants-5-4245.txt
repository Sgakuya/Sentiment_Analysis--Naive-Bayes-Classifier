All you people who are complaining about stupid things, like a customer coming over to take your cake, or having to wait to longs with your cranky ass kids, or that the portions are large or tasteless, or that the restaurant is loud, you need to wake up. It's not AT ALL the restaurants responsibility if a customer does something to disgust you. Yell at the customer, not Macaroni Grill. RMG is a resaurant, not a day care center. If you have cranky ass kids whining and bitching, then take care of them yourself. It's not RMG's responsibility at all. The portions at RMG are NOT big, and the food, if anything is too rich and tasty, rather than tasteless. All you stupid Americans who want the world to kiss your feet should go to Europe. They won't kiss your rosie asses over there, there's not free refills, and people come into the restaurant and don't complain about anything. If you order something and don't like it, then that's too bad. Why did you order it? If you want to sit there all night and drink 5 cokes and eat 6 servings of bread and drive the server crazy, then you're going to pay for it. And I don't know why you Americans can't just sit somewhere and relax. I'd rather sit down and look over the menu and take things in gradually before I order a drink, rather than have a waiter in your face talking asking you all sorts of things that you don't want to answer and could care less about, like "How was your day?" So, you people who have your complaints about anything, just take them and shove them up your ass!
