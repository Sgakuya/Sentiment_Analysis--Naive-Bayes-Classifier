I bought my wedding ring at Whitehall 6 yrs ago. I have since upgraded it on two different occasions. The final time was a custom job. I had absolutly no problems with them or their customer service! They allowed me to turn in all of my jewelry worth $4000 plus an extra $100 to upgrade. They helped me in my undecisiveness with patience and helpful suggestions. I currently live in a state that does not have a Whitehall. Every 4 months I ship them my ring to have it checked and buffed. They return it promptly. Recently a stone fell out and no questions asked it was replaced free of charge. Please ignore the complaints. They are GREAT to work with.
