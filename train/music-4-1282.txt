Some of the singles ( Just Want I Needed ) on this record were undeniably great, hooky pop songs - but let me relay one of the funniest stories ever. Friends of mine worked in a fishery in Alaska one summer, doing monotonous 12 hr shifts, where all they'd do is cut off fish heads while a CD chosen by the manager blared into this big factory. One day the manager was running out on an errand, so he put in the Cars Greatest Hits, put it on repeat, locked his office and left. One mistake: instead of playing the whole disc and repeating, he set the CD player to repeat the song Let the Good Times Roll endlessly. I now can't listen to the Cars without thinking about how miserable that song would sound if you heard it 20 times in a row while cutting off fish heads....
