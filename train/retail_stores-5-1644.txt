I absolutley love Kmart! They have great, quality products that last a long time. Their stores are clean and employees are very helpful and friendly. At wal-mart (the dirty w) their stores are dirty, their employees are not friendly and Their products are crap. Yes, Kmart has had their hard times they have shown that they are here to stay. They emerged from bankrupcy and learned their lessons. Since then they have become more customer service oriented. They have added alot of quality products and they truly love their customers. I also like target. they seem to be on the same page as Kmart. i would love to see a world without Walmart Kmart and Target have their priorities straight and truly value their customers.
