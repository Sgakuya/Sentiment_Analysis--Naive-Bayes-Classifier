Other than Marcus Allen, Hershel was probably the last real "football player" to suit up in the N.F.L. He could do pretty much anything asked of him on a football field. This is a game, (football) much like soccer, wherein statistics are almost entirely dependent upon the cohesive work of an entire unit. There are many individual battles fought, but the game is won or lost as a team. Hershel Walker the consummate team player, was named team MVP in at least one season for every team that he played for in high school, college, and in the NFL. You want somebody to run the ball, give it to Hershel. You want someone to catch the ball, throw it to Hershel. You want someone to throw the lead block, give the job to Hershel. The fact that he was often the fastest, most capable athlete on the field never stopped this man among boys to play a supporting role if it meant that the team had a chance to be successful. I think that the greatest individual play I ever witnessed in the NFL was the time that I saw Walker, while playing on the kick return team, throw the lead block for a teammate at about the twenty yard line, run downfield leading the guy the entire way, and throw the final block at the opponents ten yard line enabling his buddy to score. It showed up nowhere in the stats, but is indicative of the way Walker played his entire career. I doubt whether the Vikings were the only team that would have gladly traded ten players to get a guy like him.
