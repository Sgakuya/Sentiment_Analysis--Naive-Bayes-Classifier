I recently finished my Bachelor's in Business Management Degree and UOP. I would have to say at first I was skeptical, however the money was well worth it!! I don't know how you can call it a degree mill, last time I checked I worked my butt off to get good grades there. I am now ready to pursuit my MBA and have looked at other Universities to compare. I thought that if I had two different type of colleges it would look better. After looking around, I decided that I don't just want to be a number in a large conference room where the instructor doesn't care if you are there. At UOP the classes are small and you network with other working professionals and awesome instructors. I have NEVER had recruiters or employers frown upon my degree, in fact most of them really like UOP.
