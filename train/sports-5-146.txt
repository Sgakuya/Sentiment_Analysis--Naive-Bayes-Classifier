He's a legitimate 5-tool player. Sporting an unorthodox swing, Ichiro is able to cover the entire plate and more. His hands are so quick, he's nearly impossible to strike out. He won't walk, either, because of his unreal plate coverage. He runs like crazy, too, especially with that swing; he's already well on his way to first at the point of contact. He's probably the best baserunner in the majors, IQ-wise as well. And he's got more power than he's shown us. He's kind of holding back, since he's leading off, setting the table for Edgar and Boone. In the field, he is very scary. His jumps are great, Andruw Jones-caliber even. His instincts are great, also, and his arm is maybe he best in baseball. He's just unbelievable.
