Former Governor Jesse The Body Ventura is considering a run for the Presidency in 2008 as an independent. We'd better get ready! Although I agree with some of his positions, he simply made a lot of stupid political mistakes as governor of Minnesota. Strange that all the people who are a breath of fresh air in politics usually get tossed to the side, probably because they think it's possible to act outside the system. Ventura was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998 after running a quixotic campaign which relied on mobilizing young voters. His main defect both as a candidate and governor is that he didn't develop any ideas or a political agenda. He was broadly against the system, yet he didn't have a clue as to where he would begin to change it. He did have a mind of his own, particularly on education, where he supported higher funding but less support for the teachers unions. Since he was unwilling to work with either the Republicans or the Democrats, most his proposals were lost in the state legislature, which he advocated turning into a unicameral chamber. He intended to make it more representative of the will of the people and most importantly more responsive to the Governors initiatives. Ventura also supported much needed tax reform. He tried to work for the best of the people, but his proposals were lost in the controversy he stirred. He called religion a crutch for weak minded people, discussed a visit to a Nevada prostitute, and served as a host of the disbanded XFL football league. Ventura said the media focused too much on these points, but he brought it on himself by exploiting his popularity. He wasn't too bright and not very politically deft, that brought about his political fall at the end of the day.
