I have to give him a big 5 as he was offered to be King, and he said no, and reluctantly accepted being President, that was a very smart move by a man who knew his stuff and set the elected President as ruler of this country rather than an inheirited ruler. And, sorry, he owned slaves, who cares?? I mean, it was bad but the way of the times, just like we all drive cars now, polluting the air, using up all the resources, people 200 years from now will wonder where our heads were at (if they can still breath that is), you can NOT sit and judge people in a different time from your present one, different worlds! Africans at the time owned slaves in Africa, American Indians raided their enemy camps and made them their slaves, lets not get ahead of ourselves and decide that we or he was bad because of it! Heck, women are slaves in most of the middle east countries today, where is your outrage? Where is out governments outrage? There is none.
