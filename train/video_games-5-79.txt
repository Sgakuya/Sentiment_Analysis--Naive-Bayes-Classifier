I have to disagree with BalinChojin on the load times because I don't wait any longer than 15 seconds on an AMD 450 with 128mb ram. Anyway, this game is great. The graphics ar top notch, even today, with some truly great atmosphere. The sound effects are perfect and there is an awsome Tecno soundtrack that changes mood depending on whats going on in the game. If there is anything bad I can say about this games it is the multiplayer game and more specificly the Bots, wich are unforgivingly hard and they cheat. I mean what are these things, telapathic or do they just see thrue walls. All in all this doesn't efect my opinion of the game, A masterpiece, deserving to be in any true gamers collecton. Especialy now that Unreal Gold is out for about 10 bills and with all the extras incuded I suggest you go out and get yours today.
