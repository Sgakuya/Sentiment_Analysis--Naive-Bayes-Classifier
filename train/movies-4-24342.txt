Affectionately known as AVP. Sarted slow, but when it got going, it was a thrill ride. I liked it alot. No matter how many times I see it, I still squint my eyes when a dude goes into a dark room by himself and you know there's an Alien waiting to grab him and thrust his retractable mouth into dude's skull. Predator's are bad-asses too, but they have some good in them. I definitely was cheering for the Predators. But, come to think of it, Aliens have very strong maternal instincts. Rather than drill dude's skull with their retractable mouth, Aliens are apt to drag dude to the Alien nest and cover up dude with that sticky gunk so that MaMa Alien can lay an egg that bursts out one of them calamari things onto dudes grille and then ends up busting through dude's chest as a mini-me alien. MAD TV did a hilarious spoof of the movie called Alien vs Princess Diaries 2. Everytime the Alien did something like thrust its tail into the Princess's gut, the Princess would yell (while spewing blood), Shuuuut Up.
