well made and chill inducing fable on a strange unexplained phenomenon that hasn't gotten widley exposed. Too bad RichardGere is in it. The rest of the cast including Laura Linney make up for the lead actors hardcore lack of talent and scrap up what could have been a disaster. Effectivly shot to give of an effectivly dark and moody vin=be that lasts throught every second of the movie. The score also ads to the creepy sense of dread weighing in. The filmmaker made a wise choice in never giving us a clear shot of the mothman, and never gives any explination as to what is the mothman. Is it an alien lifeform? A ghost? Or some form of psychic energy? Very strange and spooky thought provoking film. The filmmaker seems to have studied the style of M. Night Shaymalan and David Fincher. Very visual and keeps you watching. RECOMENDED.
