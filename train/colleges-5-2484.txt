I received a BSME from BYU in 1995, and I must say that it is one of the best schools in the nation for Engineering. Upon graduation, I was quickly hired by Intel Corporation. They valued BYU so much that they hired at least 10 other people from BYU that week. All I know is that the program was extremely challenging and required everything I could give. And, I was a 4.0 student through both Middle School and High School. BYU welcomes members and non-members alike. Don't let the uneducated responses sway you. But, getting into the school is a challenge since so many top-notch students are trying desperately to get into the school. Anyone that rates this school less than 5 stars is extremely confused in my opinion.
