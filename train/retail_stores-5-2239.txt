I've been shopping at publix for many years, working there for almost three. I love it there... people are nice, store is clean (and trust me I get to see everything, from the meat department to how we handle spills) as for the high prices that always change its called a sale. Sales normally only last a week or two, its not our fault. If you decide that walmart is your place because its so much cheeper, good for you. Walmart is based on bulk and everything in one place principles, we on the other hand care about customer service and quality products, something walmart has none of (They inject saltwater into their meat to make it cost more and ignore experation dates). oh and if you want really high prices try Albertson's. We also have the publix promise, if something doesn't scan at the correct price you get it free, I don't see walmart doing that...
