I have been a DUKE fan for close to 15 years. I don't think that Redick is incredible but I think he is a good player. Each game he is the assignment of the oppositions best defender and he is constantly on the move trying to break free. He is the best free throw shooter in the country and can shoot the three better than most players I have seen. To call him the best DUKE player ever is a little premature. There have been great players at DUKE. I don't really understand the trashing of him as a person. I watch DUKE games on TV and have never met JJ. To question his sexuality, make fun of the fact that he is rich, and to call him names is just a low class thing to do. There are players on NC team who I feel are overrated but I'm not going to question their character as a human being. I had a basketball hoop in my driveway when I was younger but my family wasn't rich. My parents bought it for me because I loved the game so much and I used that hoop every day for years. Who cares what kind of car he drives or if he signs autographs or not? The indisputable fact is that he can play the game of basketball and his team shut down NC by playing as a team. I find it ironic that Dick Vitale says that NC is the best team in college ball but their weakness is the half court game. So they can run a fast break but they can't play five on five. Interesting, I thought basketball was a five on five game. JJ Redick is a good basketball player!
