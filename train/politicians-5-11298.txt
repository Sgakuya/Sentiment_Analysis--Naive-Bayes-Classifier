I am goign to bite my tongue from being nasty here and say instead that I had the great pleasure of meeting the Good Senator in person, and I got to speak to him. The comments stated here are biased and completley unfair to someone who genuinely cares abotu the people he reaches out to, and has a good heart and a intelligent mind. He CAN think on his feet and problem solve, I know that as I said I got to speak to him first hand. He isn't a ambulance chaser if you want to speak of his past as a trial lawyer then why not mention the 23 million dollars he won for families whose children had been injured from medical malpractice? I have been able to speak to him, and he is a charming, smart man with a good heart, quick wit and engaging demeanor. I'm sorry if you dont agree, but that's just what I know from first hand experience.
