Alan Keyes is what an American politician should be...decent, honest, straightforward, and selfless. In short, he is everything that almost every other politician is NOT. That is precisely why, of course, Mr. Keyes will never attain high elected office. He is too honest. He will make the people take personal responsibility, face the truth, and grow some decency. Obviously, that will never do in the new welfare state of America where criminals like Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Janet Waco Reno can commit the atrocities they have and never face justice. I pray Keyes will one day be President, but I know it is impossible as long as a majority of Americans say things like, It's just sex...it's his private life concerning Clinton's impeachment and We just want to count every vote! concerning Al Gore's attempt to steal the presidency.
