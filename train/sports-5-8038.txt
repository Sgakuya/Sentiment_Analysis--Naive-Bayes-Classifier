Man has this guy grown up!! When Iverson first came into the league his constant fueding with his coaches and finger pointing at his teammates made me question his commitment to his team and the game. But in just a few short years, with the help of Larry Brown, Iverson has turned into the NBA's most prolific players and one of its best team players as well. There is absolutely no other player in the NBA who gives up so much of himself night in and night out on both ends of the court. If their was a hustle award in the NBA Iverson would win it in a landslide. The reason the Sixers had the best record in the East this year is not because Iverson has improved as a player (though he definately has). The Sixers are a better team because Iverson has become a better teammate. He trusts his teammates to take the open shots, make the plays, and routinely sings their praises at the end of games. He's turned into a total class act and he's turning the Sixers into legitimate NBA title contenders.
