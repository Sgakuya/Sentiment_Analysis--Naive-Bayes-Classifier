People from Wisconsin have HUGE egos, and I believe that they are rating this school unjustly, without experiencing it. And an FYI Mr Desert Fox guy, I have seen much more racism in Madison than in Minneapolis/ St. Paul, which consistantly ranks as one of the Top 10 Most Culutred Metropolitan Areas as by USA Today. And the school is great. The only reason that it is lower ranked than UW is that they had a college (General College) which is now discontinued, that would allow almost anyone to take classes there, as long as they could pay for the class. This greatly helped people who did not have the best grades in high school still get a great education from a prestigious public university.
