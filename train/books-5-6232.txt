The title of this book is aptly named, it's about a bunch of, actual white men who seem to be making a career out of being stupid and making poor decisions, so what better title than this, as a white man,I don't find it racist in the least. In my opinion, from what I know of Michael Moore, he seems to be anit-stupid, not anti-American. The fact that so many Americans are upset about this book, is for many reasons I would imagine, but one imparticular might be that most of the Stupid white Men in this book, happen to be from the United States. This book could have just as easily been about members of any Gov't but as an American, he is writting about what he know's best, his own system of Gov't and it's effects on his nation. Micheal Moore is a man who does his research and I personally have not witnessed any occacions where he has spoken about something he knows nothing or little about. This western society, in my opinion, has come to a halt with respect to positive movement forward. Red tape, politics and money have turned us into a bunch of mush headed, money grubbers and I for one am refreshed by people like Michael Moore who do their homework and lay it on the line. People, so often, find themselves brushing off things they think they can't do anything about, I think Michael Moore is saying One person can make a difference if you speak up!, in almost everything he does. The Gov't has been holding the preverbial veil over their faces for to long and I am glad to see it pulled off, so I can see their real reactions, not the shallow prepared responses, we are so familiar with. The book contains a ton of great information, any way you slice it. I recommend the read, unless you are small minded and can't take constructive critisizm about the world that is going on around you. I'm not saying take Michael's word for it, I'm saying read the book for what it is, research more and then draw your own conclusions. HardCor
