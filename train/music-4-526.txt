Let me explain my four-star rating by first saying that I'm not a huge Chili Peppers fan. I thought Blood Sugar Sex Magic was catchy but ultimately did not pass the test of time (the song Under the Bridge, for instance, now causes me to change the radio station whenever it comes on). But I really liked the Chili Peppers' next CD, One Hot Minute. Maybe it was the influence of Dave Navarro (who is no longer with the band) that did it for me on that CD with great songs like Deep Kick and Aeroplane. When I first heard Californication, I was very disappointed, because I didn't think it measured up to One Hot Minute (and I still don't). But I gave it a chance, and after listening to it a lot I'm starting to get into some of the songs. Around the World and Parallel Universe are great, and Otherside is one of my favorite songs on the radio right now. But unlike some of the other people who have left comments here, I can't stand the song Californication, and songs like Get on Top and I Like Dirt just don't do it for me. All in all though, while this CD is uneven, the good songs outweigh the bad, and I recommend it.
