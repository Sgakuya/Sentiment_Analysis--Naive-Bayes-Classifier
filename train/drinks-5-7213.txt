During the Cannes film festival I went to the most stunning Villa with mostly A-list celebrities and Royality from Europe. I saw a Vodka Called Rodnik Vodka. I never heard of Rodnik and was so impressed by the response the gueats were giving Rodnik. Rodnik is served all over europe and is over 300 years old. The Russian Govt was sponsorning the event and giving out real diamonds to the beautiful girls complements of Rodnik Vodka. In all the years and parties I have gone to I have never seen anything like this in my life nor have I ever tasted such a great sprit such as Rodnik Vodka in my life. I was a Grey Goose drinker but no more. What class Rodnik Vodka is. I realized that I was living in a dream.
