I bought a 95 SC400 with 80k miles for $10,000 US. It is luxurious, powerful and has no problems except for minor instrument cluster lighting, which I have corrected. The styling is classic, my favorite look..long hooded 3-box coupe. This quad cam 32 valve V8 has 6-bolt mains and is rated in the top ten by Ward's for the 20th century. This engine with updates is still the Toyota/Lexus top V8 used. The car was overpriced a little when new... mostly because of a luxury car tariff placed on imports at the time. Getting a car like this in this kind of condition is rare. Other than high fuel costs, it's perfect for me. Mine came with a bonus.. 17 Enkei after-market wheels.
