Although i wouldn't say London is a terrible place.I certainly couldn't see muself living there.I do agree with some of the comments.I think it is very much over-rated.Maybe my expectations were a bit high.You certainly think of London as one of Europes great cities.But that probably has to do with finance more then anything else. The weather is not good at all.The life style seems rather bland.And the nightlife wasn't very impressive,apart from the famed club scene. I remember aproaching Trafalgar square with tremendous expectation only to find my self extremely dissapointed. The parks and greenery of the city is lovely though.But as a whole the word dissapointed is the word i would use the most when describing London.
