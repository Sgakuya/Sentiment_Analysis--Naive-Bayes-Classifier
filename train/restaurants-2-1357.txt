It's really amazing how Sonic drive ins can be so different. Just tonight, the Sonics in Pueblo West failed to put cheese on our three cheeseburgers. This has happened at least 5 times in the past year. They often keep the french fries too long and they can be terrible. The sonic burgers at this location are consistently less tasty than the Pueblo Boulevard location. Have you noticed that Sonics doesn't have a complaints format. That's probably for a good reason on their part. They would have to have full time people to answer the complaints. Finally, I wish that they would get better ad writers and get rid of the stupid ads they have on tv now. To be honest, I go there less than I used to because of those stupid ads.
