U might want to nail me on this one!!This guy is great and what makes him soo great is thaat he can lead a team into the playoffs when hes scoring under 20 points a game!This guy doesnt need points to lead a team!!But i dont think that OVERALL, that hes the best point guard!! Hes definately one of the best but i think the best is prolly iverson or right now francis or wade according to 2004-2005!!But Nash did deserve to be MVP!!AND hes rated where he should be on this site!!He is NOT better than Francis, Wade , or iverson!!! Well right now currently Nash is slightly above Wade and I hope that changes. The numbers don't lie but like i SAID Nash deserved to be Leauge MVP and hes a great point guard but i still think he should get a four becasue he hasn;t shown me anything other than passing and shooting!!HELLO???Ever heard of defense?? And if your going to tell me hes too short to play good defense, look at iverson averagin 2 steals a game!!! louiethe20th!!!Iverson and francis both finished their seasons with a 20 ppg+ average. If their points per game average were to go down, then their assists per game average would obviously go up to 10 or higher a game!!! Assists=team ball!!!ENOUGH SAID!!!
