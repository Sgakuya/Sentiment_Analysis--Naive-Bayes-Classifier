The tragedy of a small town family in the midwest, before, and during WWII. Five brothers are featured, as they are growing up. The five child actors are very effective, particularly Bobby Driscoll, as the youngest, who is always trying to keep up with his brothers. It's well-paced, and very charming! Thomas Mitchell has a choice role as their hardworking dad. Selena Royle plays the mother, and Trudy Marshall, (Actress Deborah Raffin's mother) plays the sister. Radio was the main means of communication back then. When the boys have grown into young men, it is the youngest, Al, who is the first to find a serious romance. But even then, he is the butt of an unintentionally cruel joke by his brothers. There follows a period of Al's deep hurt and withdrawal; the making of amends by his guilt-ridden brothers, and a poignant reconciliation with the girl, played by Anne Baxter, who wins him back. Their all-american story is brought into WWII. Like young men all over, the brothers decide to enlist in the service; but together, or not at all. They are reluctantly accomadated by the Navy. The ending is a beauty! Once again, Al is running after his brothers, and they turn to greet him.
