VERY UNDERRATED! I have used thrifty for about 3 years now and I am quite pleased with their service. Their prices are almost half of Hertz or Avis , and having used Hertz I can tell you there is almost no difference in service or product. Be sure to sign up for their FREE service called Blue Chip. Last Spring in Vegas the line for regular customers looked over and hour long. Using blue chip I was in my car in less then 5 mins. Their cars are always brand new and sometimes they even upgrade me. If you are a buisness man and price is no object go with hertz because on the number one club gold. But if you are like the 95% of the rest of us and need to save here and there, sign up for blue chip and use Thifty.
