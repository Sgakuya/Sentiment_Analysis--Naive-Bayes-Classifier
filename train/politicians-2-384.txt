I enjoyed hearing GuavaMonkey's comments on Tony Blair. I always wondered how the average Englishman on the street felt about Blair. I used to be one of the Americans who idolized Blair until he got his country involved in the Iraq war. I was puzzled by his decision to do so, as the British seemingly had no beef with Iraq, so why involve his country in this regrettable conflict? Then I saw how Blair became Bush's adoring sidekick. A friend of mine who lives in England told me that she thinks Blair involved his country in the Iraq war to obtain postwar contracts, and I wonder if this is so. Now thanks to Blair's decision to participate in the Iraq war, Britain is at risk for terrorist attacks. If I were an Englishwoman, I don't think I would support Blair at all.
