Man, I'm getting killed on this post ..... I'm gonna raise him a star, because he wasn't the worst. Watergate was not his worst offense either in my opinion. In fact, I would give him a three or a four if there wasn't so much damn blood on his hands. .... The administrations hand in the Kent State massacre was a good example of this, as well as the broken promise of ending the war. Also his opening of relations with China are paying great divedends .... for CHINA, that is. And anybody who's not a moron realizes that it was his own people who brought him down and not his natural political rivals (the Democrats). He basically had to sell out to neo con interests in order to get elected, so he became sort of a political bastard, who really had no friends from either side of the aisle. Poor Dick was doomed from the start.
