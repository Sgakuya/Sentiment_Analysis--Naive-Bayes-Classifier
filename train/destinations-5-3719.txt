If you're looking for a good year-round vacation spot, Denver is it. The city and surrounding areas provide an unusual combination of cultural and recreational activities. Don't miss the Molly Brown House, the Coors Brewery tour, or the Denver Museum of Science and Nature. If you want to venture off the beaten path a bit, have afternoon tea at the Brown Palace or visit the Butterfly Pavilion Insect Center. One of the nation's best bookstores, the Tattered Cover, is located in Denver's Cherry Creek area. Be sure to allow several hours for a visit, and you might want to have lunch or dinner at the Fourth Story, the Tattered Cover's restaurant. Even though you might find yourself fully entertained by Denver's offerings, don't forget to include some time up in the mountains!
