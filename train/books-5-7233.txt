All of my sisters recommended these books. All my friends at school did. It is basically like Revelation in modern day. Nobody knows what the last days will be like. The reason they sent these books out is because they want people to learn the truth about the end times, and want's them to be prepared for it. I truly believe in the end times and disappearing of All True Christians. I believe that me and my family are going to be going up to heaven when Jesus comes again. I don't know what it is going to be like though. I do believe that it will happen and life will go on. There will be a lot of death and destuction. And the antichrist will reign, with peice, but he will hunt down every Christian and have them murdered. I believe in the rapture and I believe these books are there to help to bring others to Christ and to prepare for the rapture. I don't know how the rapture will happen, but I believe in it. I believe in the word of God. God Bless Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. You are doing God's work. God bless you and my your faith in Christ stay strong forever. Amen.
