One of my fave cities to go to. Even though I live in Buffalo, I was born and raised here and still have family on the West Side, heading out towards Avon. The various Heights---Shaker, Cleveland, University, Mayville, Warrensville, Parma, etc.---each lend their own diversity to a very dynamic city. A fantastic medical center in the Cleveland Clinic (one of the planet's finest). Dynamic theatres and museums thrive along Euclid Avenue. And of course, my beloved INDIANS. CSU is a nice urban campus, and CCC is a decent juco. The Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame is here as well. To paraphrase Drew Carey (also a hometown boy): CLEVELAND ROCKS! CLEVELAND ROCKS! CLEVELAND ROCKS!!!! O-H-I-O!!!!!
