You New Jersey denizens don't know how good you have it, until you move to ass-backwards places like Ohio! I've lived in New York and New Jersey all of my life, until I moved here to the Cleveland area to be with my lovely wife (who is from Ohio) when I turned '30-something'. All I can tell you, is that I must REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVE MY WIFE, being stuck now in Ohio for the better of 10 years!!! Appreciate 'The Garden State' folks!!! You have nice beaches, nice suburbs, great shopping, restaurants, culture, concerts, educated people, good job opportunites compared to Ohio, proximity to NYC, etc. etc. etc. I would do ANYTHING to be able to move back there!!!!
