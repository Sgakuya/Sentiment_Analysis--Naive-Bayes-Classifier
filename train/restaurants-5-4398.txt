Breakfast all day--must be a dream! I love breakfast foods. Thick pancakes, thick French Toast slices... I'm in heaven. Not only that, but the dessert too is wonderful... at least the fruit cobblers are. Ooh, they are the best fruit cobblers I've ever eaten! MOST of the dinner items are equally as great, except one thing--the dumplings. The dumplings are flat and chewy, rather than fluffy and coushiny. Who wants to eat flat, chewy dumplings? I know I don't. The entire decor is, in fact, wonderful. Be sure to bring extra money, because you're sure to want to get something in the gift shop you walk through as you enter and exit--they sell lots of neat stuff. Even the outside has some old rocking chairs. How well they've worked on the appearance of the place. And for a sit-in restaurant, it's faily cheap, but not so cheap that it's Shoney's quality.
