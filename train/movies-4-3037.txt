Shaft was an entertaining and cleverly done movie. I didn't expect much based on previews on T.V., but when I watched it I enjoyed it tremendously. It has an interesting plot, humorous characters, and action packed scenes. I loved Samuel L. Jackson's presence on screen. He as well as his outfits were well picked for the role of Shaft. It presents a lot of issues such as racism, bribery, and vengeance which are not often depicted in recent movies. It shows that racism is still an everpresent issue today as it was years ago and that sometimes innocent people are harmed based on how they look. An excellent movie.
