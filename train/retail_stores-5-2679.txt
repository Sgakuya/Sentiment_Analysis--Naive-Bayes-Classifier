I have never really had a bad experience at a Kroger's store and I have been to at least four different ones in our area. The Kroger card is great and is mostly for the Kroger brands. If you can get past the name brand products are always better you will realize that Kroger has some great products and some are actually the same if not better than the more expensive named brand ones! I do agree that they should maybe do a little bit of restocking at a time so they are not crowding the aisles with employees stocking shelves why you are trying to get around them and they don't budge for you to go around! I try not to go late at night because that is when they do most of their major stocking. Also I think they should train their checkers and baggers to not talk amongst theirselves why they are checking you out. It can be kind of annoying hearing their life stories when they should be paying attention to what and how much they are putting into your bags and I know I am not the only one who hates having their bread get smashed due to this. For the most part the problems are minor and you deal with that kind of problems no matter where you go but Kroger is a decent place to shop for what you need when you don't have time to walk around a giant place like Super Walmart!
