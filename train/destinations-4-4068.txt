I was pleasantly surprised with the city of Norfolk. It has some nice, lovely old neighborhoods west of downtown. And the downtown area was no where near as bad as some mid-size cities I've visited. Norfolk seems to be on the upswing, rather than declining like so many old American cities. I have fond memories of Virginia beach as a child, but as a beach resort it's just average, like Ocean City. But there are some beautiful, wild areas to the north of the beach and along the North Carolina border. I have not been here long enough to find out what the people here are like, but the fact that Pat Robertson is based here is a real downside for me. I think he's demented, as are many of his fans. But aside from that, I'd probably consider living here.
