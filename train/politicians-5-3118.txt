When will this country overcome its puritanical beginnings long enough to get clear on this point? The president is elected to run the country, not serve as Morality Monitor. Let me state that I am a Christian woman who would love to have a president who is as successful in his/her personal/spiritual life as they are as president. This is probably not realistic, however. Most exemplary parent/spouses would not be willing to sacrifice 4 or more years of family time to serve as a world leader. We have to choose. In an imperfect world, we cannot expect perfection in all areas. That said, I'll vote for an effective leader every time. I have a pastor. I need a president. Say what you will about his shortcomings as a husband, our country was in MUCH better shape during his leadership.
