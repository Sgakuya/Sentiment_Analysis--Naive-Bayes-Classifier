Quebec is awesome. All this Frenchie stuff seems to be rubbing people the wrong way but I think it's cool that on this continent you can go to a place that honors is culture and customs. As North America (including Quebec) becomes more vanilla with strip malls and franchising it's nice to go somewhere different. If you make a small effort to communicate some French they will be very accomadating. If you go there demanding English then you should expect rudeness. There is a spirit and joie de vivre there that doesn't exist elsewhere and Quebec hosts many parties,festivals, and celebrations. Montreal ranks as one of the most cosmopolitan citiies on the continent. This city is upbeat and fun day and night. The food is fantastic, the people are good looking and dress well, and the shopping is superb. Quebec City is a magical place that repliclates Europe more than anywhere else. Rural Quebec is beautiful with lots of farms, wilderness, charming little towns, forests, and lakes. I love Quebec.
