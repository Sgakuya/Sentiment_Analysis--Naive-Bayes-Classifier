It's the only one I've ever tried and must say I have mixed feelings. The basic service has always been fairly reliable however...what I do not like is the mysterious way my bill keeps getting bigger and bigger with additional fees . I also didn't really care too much for the one time in 20 months that I went about 3 minutes over my time and was socked for something in the neighborhood of $10 more. I seriously think they should consider the rollover minutes or use/pay as you go type plans. Unfortunately for me, when I contacted them recently, they told me they not only currently do not have this type feature but apparently also have no plans to add it in the near future. So, unfortunately for them, I'm planning to do some serious shopping around and when my contract is up in February it will more than likely be goodbye AT T.
