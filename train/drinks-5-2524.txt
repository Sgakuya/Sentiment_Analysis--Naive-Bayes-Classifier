I don't know much about wine or champagne, but I know what I like and this is the best. It's not like I drink champgane all the time, but I've tried all the ones on the list and all say it again this is the best. The taste is very good and the bubbles go down well, but the one thing that stood out is that achohol warms your face like nothing else. I mean one sip and your face is warm and rosy. It's not like getting drunk, it's just comfertable. I think that's the sign of good wine. Some others make your face pale or give you bad buzz. Bollinger is special. As I said before, I may not be an expert, but I've tried alot of different champagne and liquor, and nothing taste and feels as good...whithout getting wasted that is, in that case anything would seem good. Later after sharing two bottles we both did not feel drunk, only warm and rosy, later still there was no tiredness or sobering-up feeling, just smooth. I don't know why this type of alchohol has such a smooth effect, it's just very enjoyable. No headache later or pale face later. What more can I say.
