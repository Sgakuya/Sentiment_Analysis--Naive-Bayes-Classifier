I got my Virage new in 2001 and have put about 60 or more hours on it and I have not had any problems with it at all. Everything is user friendly on it. I had never owned a jetski before and decided on a Polaris Virage because I felt the quality was as good if not better than other brands and the price was very competitive. I have not ridden my Virage roughly. I only go out to cruise around the lake on it with my dog Buzz . It has proven to be extremely stable with two people, not quite as stable with three people. That could be inexperience on my part!!! It is a fun machine to drive with comnfortable seating. I feel it is very safe and a lot of fun.
