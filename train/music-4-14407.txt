The funny thing about this album is that it's more fun than wonderful. All the songs come from the same-titled episode which was critically acclaimed and a fan favorite. The songs are all fresh, poppy pieces that were masterfully penned by creator Joss Whedon. Unfortunately the singers don't often do justice to the enjoyable songs. Sarah Michelle Gellar has a cute, monotone voice that doesn't hurt the ears but does prove she should stick to acting. Most of the other cast members fall short too. The exceptions being Billy Idol lookalike James Marsters who has a knack for singing angsty rock and Anthony Stewart Head who also does well. Honestly despite the apparent lack of great singing, the album makes up for it in it's energy and it's ingenuity.
