One of my favorites as a pretten, I will still pick up this book occasionally for a reread. Why in the name of all that's unholy is this in the children's books list? This book, however simple and easy-read it may appear to the eyes, can teach the enitre world a few things they need to know about the AIDS virus. Dealing with the story of a sweet, poetry-loving teenager who acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion given to her eight years ago, this is a more emotional, more factual, and altogether more interesting source of myths and facts about AIDS. If you haven't read Sixteen , I don't care if you are ninie, twenty-nine, or one hundred and nine, you have got to read this powerful book. Take care, everyone!
