The video and the song are both terrible. I mean, anything by NSYNC is terrible, but this video is just plain annoying...mainly because every time I turn on the television NSYNC is on it. It doesn't matter what channel, what time, what the show is about...everywhere you look, there NSYNC is. This video is really, really dumb...it is pretty sad if the climax of a video is Justin Timberlake painting some chick's toenails, then looking all sad and pathetic while whining about how she's gone . Hopefully, NSYNC, the Backstreet Boys, Britney and all the other pop garbage that is getting force-fed into the mouths of mindless teenagers everywhere will go away soon...I don't know if I can handle another NSYNC album.
