Not as good as I thought it would be. Maybe because I heard so much hype about what a great movie this was I had high expectations. It was about a very dysfunctional family.The dad leaves the family when the kids were still growing up. all the kids were prodgidies at something. all ended up messed up in some way. I think what made it hard for me to like this movie much was that the characters are all so messed up it is hard to like any of them. I guess there are a few humerous moments but not really laugh out loud. the actors are pretty good, especially Gene Hackman. I guess I was hoping for more from this movie. UPDATE I guess this is one of those movies that can grow on a person. I gave it a second chance and liked it better the second time around. a different movie for sure. good actors. not a movie with the most lovable of characters but a unique on at least.
