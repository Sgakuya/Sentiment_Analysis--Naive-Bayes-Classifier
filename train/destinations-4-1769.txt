The States is a vast place with much to see and do. The people are welcoming and try to do their best at all times. They believe in their personal human vision and to them nothing is impossible, which is one of their greatest attributes. Stores in the US are all the same, there are very few independents and when you find them, they are a breath of fresh air. Key West is a great place! I love this country; lately though the people have become too self-righteous and overseas vistiors may find the constant religious references rammed down their throats every minute of the day irritating and overwhelming. If they can handle this, they're sure to have a good time. UPDATE: Since writing this I have travelled back to my favourite country to find it is indeed becoming a very socially backwards place, the only one amongst the developed countries to resort back to bigotry, and the scariest religious fervour even seen in recent times. If you can put up with the hypocrisy in some of the smaller towns, fair enough, but I'd say stick to the more cosmopolitan ones where people are better educated and open to culture.
