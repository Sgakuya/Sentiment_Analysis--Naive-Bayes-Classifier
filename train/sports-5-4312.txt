I will have to admit it, last year I was angry at Tubby for the shape the team was in. But i come to find out that it was the players not Tubby ruining the team. After we lost to Louisville in December i was not ready to kick Tubby out of Lexington. I kinda figured that Louisville was playing better ball than we was and there was no reason to get rid of Tubby. For all i care Louisville can have the traitor Rick Pitino because i am very happy with Coach Tubby Smith. I am proud he was named SEC coach of the year because he deserved it. He had Kentucky on the longest winninest streak in basketball. And Yes we did lose in the Elite 8 but it's no reason to kick Tubby Smith out. I am glad Tubby is gonna be with us for the next 8 years. And i bet i will hear all of yall critics of Tubby coming back in a year or so when we have our 8th national title, saying you all love Coach Tubby Smith.
