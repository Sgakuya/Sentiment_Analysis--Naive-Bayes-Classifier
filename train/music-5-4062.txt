Ah, yes, the dreaded Hot Space LP. Quite an interesting album and still way more than worthy of a five-star rating. Hot Space contains that Queen song that everyone loves (and Vanilla Ice sucks for stealing it) Under Pressure . Oh, and the terrific Back Chat , Staying Power and the touching song in memory of John Lennon, Life Is Real . And we have the tune that everyone cringes when they hear the title of, the infamous Body Language , the song that the censors have chased after time and time again, along with it's single cover art and video. I hate to admit it, but I sorta like that song...the music is terrific even if the lyrics are sort of silly and it's got a good feel to it. And finally we have the cute little number Dancer with the German at the end. (Note to whom it may concern: that line means, Good morning, you wish to be woken up. ) That's always been one of my favorites off the album. Once again the performance of Queen Co. was superb, with quissential vocals on all songs by Freddie Mercury, the talented guitar chords by Brian May, the divine drumming on Body Language especially by Roger Taylor, and of course the terribly underrated Birdman who stands in the shadows belting out those gorgeous notes from his bass. Overall, a magnificent effort put up by Queen. I will always worship the ground Freddie walked on...that is sacred land. Take care, everyone!
