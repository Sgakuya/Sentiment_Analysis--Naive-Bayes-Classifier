Livin' La Vida Loca is a fun and bouncy song, easy to dance to, even for those of us with two left feet the beat picks you up and carries you along. The video shows Ricky performing onstage in a club with dancers, interspersed with snippets of the loca doings of the main characters. A classic red Mustang figures prominently in the craziness, and I love the facial expression I characterize as, Honey, I love you, but you're not helping, when she stands up in the Mustang and steps across his lap to give him a hug. You have to watch carefully to catch the short hot bits where the actress, nearly unclothed, drips candlewax on Ricky and kisses him with apparent passion. Guys, you'll love the wet ladies shown during the chorus of she'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain. Ricky is easy to look at, and delightful to listen to. His backup band are all excellent musicians. The video is well scripted, beautifully choreographed and the photography (videography?) is very fine.
