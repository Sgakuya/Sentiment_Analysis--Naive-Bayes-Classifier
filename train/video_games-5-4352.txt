this game is amaizing. a huge world to explore with tons of things to do, and a non linar story. the only problems are that the world traveling became extriemly annoying (way too many encounters), which lead to another problem, which is quests that force you to take LONG travels just to deliver a message and being sent back, which are fun but the travel makes them annoying. there are also long loadings, also, the combat system is f**ked up, cus your perception affects you too much, and you get to a point in which you have 100% small arms for exemple and you get 75% chance to hit. it' a bit hard to get mony in the early stage of the game, but if you overcome these obsticles it's a huge game that afterwards the first look so small and simple. at first i thought that the first one was better cus it lacked the problems of this one, but after i finished it i just couldn't go back, and i started a new game.
