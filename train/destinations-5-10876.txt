Cedar Point is the best place to go on vacation for roller coasters, if u like the tallest fastest roller coasters that is. If you are looking for a place for the whole family.. thats Cedar Point to. But for me im there for the rides. All of Cedar Points rides are awesome. I've been there about 20 times in my life, and im 16, for the past two years i went there 6 times. Everyone in my family loves roller coasters. If i was rich or had nothing to do for a whole summer and had a lot of money to blow i would stay down in Sandusky for the summer to go to Cedar Point everyday. I would not get sick of it at all. I love seeing differnt people, and alot of different stuff. If you want to take the family on a nice ride, go on the train ride, but get on by the Mean Streak because they have a lil skelton show that goes on, also on the boat ride to, thats so cool! I hope i have convinced u enough to go!
