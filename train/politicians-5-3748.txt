DEAR GOVERNOR BUSH; WE LOVE AND APPRECIATE YOU AND WHAT YOU STAND FOR. THIS COUNTRY IS IN A SORRY STATE AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS. AND GOD HELP US IF GORE STEALS THE ELECTION. PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP. WE ARE PRAYING MUCH ABOUT THIS MATTER. WE BELIEVE THAT RIGHT WILL PREVAIL IN THE END. IF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RULES IN GORE'S FAVOR WE WILL KNOW THIS WHOLE ELECTION HAS BEEN RIGGED, PROBABLY BY THE WHITE HOUSE. WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS NOT POLITICAL BUT SPIRITUAL. WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST EVIL MEN. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT OUR GOD IS GREATER THAN BILL CLINTON AND AL GORE. WE LOVE YOU, DANA NANCY BALDWIN CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA
