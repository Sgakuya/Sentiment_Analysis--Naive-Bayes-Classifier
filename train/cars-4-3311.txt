Always wanted a Jeep. Saw a silver 1995 on a local used dealer lot with 100,000 miles. Did loads of internet research and Carfax. One owner. Garage kept and MOPAR maintained. Beautiful. Was aware of some of the problems but got the Laredo with Selec-Trac and straight 6 Cyl which is best combo. Regular maintenance should keep it running for very long time. 126,000 miles presently. Had recent speaker wire break which I fixed. Small rear main seal leak. No big deal and common with Jeeps. Replaced neutral safety switch and oil sending unit. Inexpensive. 20+ mpg. Key is good maintenance, using ONLY Chrysler ATF for transmission fluid changes. DO NOT use Dexron. Could damage transmission (book says use Chrysler fluid and only Dexron if absolutely necessary). USE CHRYSLER FLUID. Also, READ THE DRIVERS MANUAL. These vehicles are fairly advanced and sometimes things can happen which may seem wrong but are normal; such as the transmission locking out overdrive if fluid temp gets too hot. This saves the transmission but if you didn't know what the vehicle was doing, you could freak out and possibly get screwed by an unscrupulous mechanic. Aftermarket sales are awesome for Jeeps with good prices and lots of excellent stock. Do your homework and maintain and you should get lots of enjoyment. Oh, almost forgot, nothing touches this thing for off road use.
