First off i think its funny how all these people can judge someone so harshly when they havent even researched what a person has done fully. They criticize him about views about the Bible like they are Christians but yet they are judging others when the Bible says judge not for thou shalt be judged. And what perplexes me more is how a white person can tell the black race and other minorities that this man who has spent his whole life trying to lift up and motivate, is the reason for all of their suffering when he was not alive during all of the years of suffering. Indeed our pains are not over but they are no where near those of our ancestors and I myself as a person will not let some white person take from me someone who is doing for me what everyone else is scared to do. If you do not know him personally i dont think you should criticize because you really dont know this man. So instead of criticizing his works and what hes done for ALL of us,lets see what you have done?!
