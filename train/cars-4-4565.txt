I got a 2003 XE Crew Cab about a month ago. It has good power, looks good for a new vehicle (I'm partial to the older vehicles) and has plenty of room for all the stuff I need to haul for my job! So far I only find 2 drawbacks, one being the gas milage, I average about 20mpg and I don't like the overdrive button on the gearshift (It's an automatic) I live in the mountains so it's not too often I want overdrive but the default is on and you have to push the button in to turn the O/D off. Not used to it and I forget. Guess I'll get used to that. Overall a nice little truck! For you Buy American people, don't you realize how much of your "American" vehicle is made in other countries?? By the way I'm a chick :)
