I own a 96 with over 140,000 miles now!! I've had it for almost four years although it's been in the family since new. I have the 3.1 liter engine--from what i understand this is the engine to get. The 3.4 liter has almost unnoticeable horsepower difference with many more problems. I rebuilt the transmission at about 130k which is normal with chevys, but very few problems other than a water pump and alternator over and above that. The seats are comfortable even on long road trips. The cupholder in the armrest is perfectly placed and there are many cubbyholes for those ever present necessities. This has been the best car i've ever owned and i plan to keep it for a very long time.
