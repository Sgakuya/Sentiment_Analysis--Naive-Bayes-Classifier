Pisa is a bit underrated. I had a great Danish tour guide who knew all there was to know about all of the four main buildings, which are all awesome. Didn't get to go in the tower but it's neat just to be there. Inside the cathedral there's a big painting of Christ on an eastern wall so that the sun rises behind him. Very clever. It is rumored that Galileo's study of pendulum motion was inspired by a swinging lamp in that very cathedral. The building is full of a wide range of art. Not many cathedrals in Europe that have such a variety. Just watch out for the gypsies and the vendors who sell all the same stuff.
