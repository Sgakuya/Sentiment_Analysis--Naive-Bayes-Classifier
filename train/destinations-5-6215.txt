Life long resident, although I've visited many other states. Theres an old expression that states 'it's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there'. GA is probably the opposite. We don't have a whole lot that would draw visitors...but it seems that EVERYONE wants to live here. We've got everything you need here. If we DONT have it, then you don't need it. I treat out-of-state visitors the same way that I treat guests in my home. We'll get along fine, as long as you don't wear out your welcome. So please, wear a watch. And yes, this is very much a church going state. I suppose it's because we have so much more to praise God for.
