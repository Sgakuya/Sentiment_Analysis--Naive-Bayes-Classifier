I have owned both the '00 and '01 models of the NRS1. Obviously I liked it so much the 1st time to buy it again. The 2001 model has a few upgrades in more raceface components, tubeless slicks, and a straight handlebar from the previous year. These are all major pluses. They even slightly changed the geometry and beefed up some of the welds. I don't think breakage will be an issue unless maybe its hucked off a 50ft. cliff. The odd little pad for the rear derailler is pretty dumb, but not a major issue. The tubeless wheels are fanatastic. I've only partially flattened them once in a stack. The only real flaw is a slightly heavier weight than a racing full suspension should have these days. Mine comes in just shy of 30lbs. The weight hasn't really been reduced from last year but the bike does ride lighter. Other bikes out there have less weight but usually compromise on other aspects such as less travel, no discs, and standard wheels. The componentry selection is top notch. Only a SIDSL and top range raceface could improve it. It fits a tall riders well, esp ones w/ long torsos. The value of the bike puts it as one of the best deals around. It is at least a $500-1000 less than bikes like specialized fsr stumpjumper xc. No reservation in giving a 5.
