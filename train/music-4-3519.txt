I give Moondance four stars because I only listen to the first five songs on the CD. But it's those songs that are constantly playing on my stereo. From the easy on the ears Moondance to the ethereal Into the Mystic , Morrison has shown to have such beautiful range and taste when it comes to songwriting and instrument arrangement. Caravan always brings to mind a hippie campfire where only peace and love reign and Crazy Love is the premiere love song of a traveling musician and the woman who loves him. And It Stoned Me plays like a man's distant memory of youth and happiness- not only the words, but the music! But I will always have a special place in my heart for Into The Mystic for this is the song that brought Morrison and the Moondance album to my attention. Sometimes I wonder how I got along without knowing these songs exsisted!
