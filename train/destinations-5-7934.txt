I've wanted to visit for years, and finally got to go there with my son just yesterday (7/5/04). It was incredible! The Kennedy assassination is one of the most jarring memories of my childhood and I've always wanted to get inside that building. It was hard to leave. Since we were in town, we also explored around until we found the area where Officer Tippit was killed, the Texas theatre where Oswald was captured, and 2 places where Oswald had lived: on Beckley and on Neely. There are warnings on the internet about avoiding the Neely house because it's in a dangerous neighborhood and people don't like trespassers there. But I didn't realize that until I saw it while surfing the internet just this morning. I'm not surprised though....my son and I were leaning over the fence taking pictures of the outside stairway (visible in one of the pictures Marina took of him with his rifle), and someone nearby either fired a pistol in the air or shot off a firecracker to scare us away. We jumped back into the car and left as fast as we could, but we got some great pictures anyway. If I can throw in one more commercial for Gerald Posner's book, Case Closed, reading that book will make a visit to Dealey Plaza that much better. Don't fall for all the conspiracy nonsense. Historical truth is much more fascinating than fiction.
