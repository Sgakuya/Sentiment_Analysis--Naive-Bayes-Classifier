Coach Zook is a great guy, I love him and believe he will bring SEC and National championships to Florida Gators once he swallows his pride and starts running Florida football just like Ole Ball Coach (Spurrier) use to run it. Coach Zook...If it isnt broke, (and I believe it wasnt) just maintain it and quit trying to make unnecessary changes. Two straight mediocre years of Florida football is unbearable especially after 12 straight years of satisfaction with the Spurrier system. My advise to Coach Zook is to learn and perfect what he already has in his back pocket/on hand (i.e. Spurrier System (at least on Offense) and just show us the money by deepening Zook's defensive prowessmaking the Gators defense a model for college football. Good luck pal and bring back the Glory days to Gainesville soonest!
