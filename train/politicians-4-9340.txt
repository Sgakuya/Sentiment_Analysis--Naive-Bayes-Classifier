When James Garfield was assassinated in 1881, Chester Arthur assumed office assuring the American people that nobody controlled him as President. He continued the policies of Rutherford Hayes in order to ensure Civil Service Reform, and due to his support of the buildup of a large navy made up of steam-powered steel cruisers. [1. Crisis Dealings/Leadership: **** out of *****] As President, Arthur faced no serious crises. He did alienate many members of his own party and destroy his relations with the Republican-controlled Congress with his activism for a reduction of tariffs. He called for a 25% reduction in tariff rates, and the Congress, in a slap in the face to Arthur, reduced tariff rates by 2%. While he won no battle in lowering the tariffs, his persistance set the political scene for the next two decades. He also dealt wisely with the Civil Service debates arousing in the country by signing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which established a bipartisan commission to prepare and administer competitive examinations for government offices. His unpopular standings on these two major issues proved that Arthur was no party hack, but rather a free thinking President. [2. Diplomatic/Foreign Relations: *** out of ***** Stars] Arthur signed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 which banned all Chinese Immigration for the next ten years in an attempt to control the American population. Arthur is best known as the father of the steel Navy due to his support of the construction of steam-powered steel cruisers, steel rams and steel-clad gun boats. He also move decisively to curb corruption and incompetency in the naval shipyards. Interests in the construction of a canal considered, and an agreement was reached with Nicaragua ceding a stretch of land to the U.S. for the construction of the canal. The treaty, however was rejected by Congress because it breached a treaty signed with Great Britain in 1850. [3. Economic Management: *** out of ***** Stars]. The country did see economic prosperity during Arthur's term in office. As I mentioned before, he supported significant reduction in tariff rates to benefit middle class families. He thought that surpluses should be returned to the people rather than spent on pork-laiden government expenditures. However, he contradicts himself somewhat with his significant investment and usage of that surplus to renevate the White House. Indeed a noble cause which is perhaps his most significant contribution as President, but a contradiction of his own financial beliefs. He spent over $2 Million dollars on White House Renevations. However, his willingness to fight for the middle class farmers and workers across America is admirable. [4. Vision For the Country/Legacy: **** out of ***** Stars]. Arthur's greatest legacy is perhaps his supporting of a large steel-powered Navy which prepared America for the next century. His advocacy of lower tariffs and civil service reform showed him to be a realistic thinker and a President who operated more on the interests of the people than his own political party. [5. Popularity/Morality: **** out of ***** Stars]. He was popular with the people throughout most of his term for his support of Civil Service Reform and lower tariffs. He was never really a devoted father, but he did love his son and daughter dearly, but was often distracted by his job. He had the sympathies of the people because of the death of his wife in 1880. [Final Score: 3.6- **** out of ***** Stars]. In the final analysis, President Arthur, like his predacessor proved himself to be a competent President who did not make decisions soley based on his political associations. Arthur found himself party-less in the Election of 1884, but he had no real desire to seek re-election due to his ailing health which he had kept well-hidden from the country during his Presidency. Arthur was indeed an important transitional figure in the post-Reconstruction era and continued to lead the United States to its eventual status as a world power.
