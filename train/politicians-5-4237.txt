Ralph Nader was brilliant on This Week, Sunday October 29 pointing out how unclear Lieberman's so-called Democratic position is. Nader was quite clear about how President Clinton has disgraced the office and should have been impeached. He also points out that if Gore was so great why isn't he able to beat the dummy from Texas. Furthermore, Nader points out that every person running for office needs to earn the vote, and not just be owed it because he belogs to one of the major parties. Nader spoke directly to Sam Donaldson's hard-ball questions and answered each and every one unequivocally. Compare that with the stammering around earlier in the program by Lieberman and the Mr. Nice Guy Trent Lott pretending to stand for principle while helping cause the budget deadlock in Washington with none other that Mr. Bill Clinton.
