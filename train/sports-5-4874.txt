Although I am a diehard UNC fans that bleeds Tarheel Blue, I know a good thing when I see it. Even though UNC managed to finally get another win over NC State this year, I was very impressed with Sendek. I still don't know how we lost to Clemson and managed to beat NCSU. It is an anamoly. But NC State is 7-2 in ACC play, whereas UNC is 4-5 in conference action. So, like many other UNC fans, I am once again jumping ship to a more successful bandwagon. Gosh, I wish Dean Smith had never retired. Dang, Dean Smith sure got a lot of DWI's in his day. I know because I am a UNC Insider. I am diehard UNC fan but GO WOLFPACK! If NCSU wins the NCAA tournament it will make us look good since we beat them.
