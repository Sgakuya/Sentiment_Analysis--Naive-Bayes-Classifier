Too Fast For Love is a great album. This is the album that changed the face of music for the 80's and helped to usher in the hair movement Sure, Shout At The Devil may have been a bigger commercial success, but this album was the fuel, where Shout was the spark that ignited it. At the time, music was boring and predictable. Then, along came these androgenous, quasi-Satanic punks who set the world ablaze. This album was made in 1 week for $7000. What's even more remarkable is that it is a multi-platinum effort, when, as Mick Mars put it, it was more or less just a demo. This album still holds up today. The song Live Wire is as good a song their is to kick off a debut album, introducing yourself to the world. And as for the song Too Fast For Love, I'm still curious as to how a new band could conjure up something so beautifully ugly. An all-timer without a doubt!
