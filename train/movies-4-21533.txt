(I won't go into the details of the storyline, as most people already know the gist of it) After the painful-to-watch Episode I, and the lackluster Episode II, Lucas has redeemed himself with Episode III. I was pretty skeptical about it, since I was unimpressed with the first and second ones, but it seems that the series had matured well (the few appearances of Jar Jar were brief and without dialogue, no childish announcers, etc.). I would highly suggest watching the animated Clone Wars to understand what happens between Episode II and III (I still have to watch all of it). Strong performances all around, (EXCEPT for Hayden Christensen, aka Anakin; he did well when whining, but that's about it. They could have had a mannequin do a better job.) The demises of both Lord Greivous and Mace Windu were a bit disappointing, not in that they happened, but that they, like Darth Maul in Episode I, were dispatched so easily (I'll give them this much, it WAS improved). Star Wars fans, you won't be disappointed.
