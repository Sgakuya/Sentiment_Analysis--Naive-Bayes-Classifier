Entertaining family fare. If you thought Jim Carrey ate the scenery in Grinch, check him out as Count Olaf. There's scenery splattered all over his face like a kid's face after all-you-can-eat rib night at Chili's. That doesn't mean he wasn't funny -- he was great. On the whole, the acting and scenery was splendid. I particularly liked Baby Sunny, whose talent was biting things. Her subtitled babble was hilarious. My son has read all the Lemony Snicket books and he was fairly critical that the movie greatly condensed the first 3 books into the movie and placed the book's sequence out of order in the movie. This was totally contrary to Harry Potter, where the movies are faithful to the book. That's why I deducted a star, but that aside, it was an enjoyable movie.
