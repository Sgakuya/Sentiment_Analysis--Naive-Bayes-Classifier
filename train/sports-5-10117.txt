better coach than bryant. much better winning percentage against top 10 teams. while bryant played vandy and kentucky as traditional rivals ommitting florida and georgia on an annual basis dye consistently ended the year playing top 5 hardest schedule in the nation in all but 3 of his years at auburn and still one of the best overall records in history despite rebuilding 3 programs that were in shambles. bama and bryant feared dye and dye is what led to bryants retirement. dye had recruited the bulk of tide players in their so called glory years. not only is dye's record far superior against top 10 teams but so is his bowl record. after all the bear has the most bowl losses of any coach in history and had a losing record against top 10 teams. can anyone say"myth." dye was the real deal, "anywhere, anybody, anytime."
