A few months ago my wife and I decided to go to Chi-Chi's in Des Moines Iowa. After sitting for 10 minutes with no service, upon approaching our table, our server, obviously embarrassed, announced that there was currently a 25 cent per peson surcharge for sitting down in the restaurant due to the cost of the air conditioning. Believe it or not, I am not kidding. Afer ordering our drinks it took 7 minutes for our server to return with them to take our food order. 20 minutes later our mediocre tasting room temperature foos arrived. The irony is there appeared to be only 5 other tables seated in the entire restaurant. Bottomline: Food, over-priced and mediocre at best Service, embarrassingly poor Management, seemingly desperate for money Location, Army Post Road, Des Moines Iowa
