I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE A RACIST THING. PEOPLE USES GOD'S NAME SO MUCH BUT IF THEY REALLY KNEW HIM THEY WOULD SEE WHAT AL GORE WAS DOING AND WHAT CLINTON IS UP TO. GOD HAS TRULY ALLOWED PRESIDENT BUSH TO REIGN. I BELIEVE THAT JEB BUSH HAS ACTED WITH GREAT INTEGRITY, GREAT INTELLIGENCE AND DID THE RIGHT THING BY STEPPING OUT OF THE PICTURE. NOT ALL MINORITIES THINK THAT BUSH LOST, I AM A MINORITY AND I BELIEVE THAT HE WON. GORE WANTED THE VOTES TO BE COUNT SEVERAL TIMES, EVERYTIME PRESIDENT BUSH CAME OUT THE WINNER. THIS GREAT COUNTRY HAS LOST ITS MORAL VALUE, HERE WE HAVE A MAN WHO HAS CREDITABILITY, NEVER CHEATED ON HIS FAMILY, HE HAS INTEGRITY AND BELIEVES THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION. ANY OF YOU OUT THERE, WHAT IF YOUR MOTHER HAD BELIEVE IN ABORTION, NONE OF YOU WOULD BE HERE. SO THINK SMARTLY, KILLING UNBORN CHILDREN IS A SIN IN GOD'S EYES. HE CREATED ALL OF US, HE HAS A PLAN FOR EACH ONE OF YOU, WHO GIVES ANY OF YOU THE RIGHT TO TAKE AN INNOCENT CHILD WHO CAN'T SPEAK LIFE. PRAISE GOD FOR JEB BUSH, HE DID THE RIGHT THING AND I HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA REALISES THAT THEY DO HAVE A GREAT GOVERNOR. KATHLEEN HARRIS DID WHAT SHE HAD TO DO, DOESN'T ANYBODY LIVE HONEST ANYMORE? UNTILL YOU PEOPLE WALK IN THEIR SHOES, THEN DON'T CRITICIZE. PRAY FOR THEM THAT GOD WILL GIVE THEM WISDOM.
