I have to say that this is the only book I have ever read that truly changed my life. I am now a vegetarian, and have been for 3 years, no regrets. This book is the best examination of how our food production contributes to the poor health not only of our people, but of the planet as a whole. It also suggests ways in which we can make things better. The discussion of animals is harrowing, but really made me realize how inhumane our methods of food production are and how we as a society are weakened as a result. Astounding piece of work, well documented and researched. Don't read it if you want to keep eating meat!
