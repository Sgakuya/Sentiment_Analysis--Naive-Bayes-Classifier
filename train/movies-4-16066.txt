I thought this was good. Denzel Washington is great as John Q the father of a boy who must have a heart transplant or die. Of course his crummy HMO insurance will not pay for the procedure. When He desparately tries to come up with a huge down payment to even get the child on the list for donors and the hospital is going to send the boy home John takes the emergency room hostage in an attempt to get his son the heart transplant. I am not saying it was okay for John Q. to go to these extremes but I sure can understand how he must have felt to watch his only child dying and to be told his lousy insurance would not pay. I think this movie sure had it's statement about the health insurance in the U.S.A.{which is getting worse every year.} As a parent myself it is awful to be told your insurance will not pay for a procedure or let you go to a doctor of choice.I can only imagine how awlful it would be for an insurance policy to refuse to pay for a loved ones health problems.
