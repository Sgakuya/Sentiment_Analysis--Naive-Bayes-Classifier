The most disapointing follow up ever made. Halloween is my all time favorite slasher flick. Why you ask? Because it relise more on the two REAL essential ingrediants that make up a good horror film mood and atmosphere rather than killing people and showing a couple bare breasts. Halloween 2 however took the easy and less talented way out. Michael looses a little spooky factor to merrly become a vehicle for dozens of wham bam thank you mam style killings. It would have been a much more credible follow up if the original actor who portrayed Michael Myers had returned. I saw on a documentary that the guy who played Myers in this film studied the walk and characteristics of the original. He did a terrible job. His Michael Myers is incredibly stiff and mechanic. Myers has a very loose and natural walk. He even strides and walks fast at times which this ingrade never does even during a chase. Donald Pleacense and Jamie Lee Curtis both give good performances. Jamie's was much better in the original while Donald... he's the man. Then add a completly unbelievable and dumb ass ending for a climax (Although it is creepy watching Michael walk down the hall completly a blaze) and you've got a horrible horror sequel. This film is still one of the best out of the sequels...it still sucks though. Not Recommended. See the BRILLIANT original and only see the sequals if you won't let them effect your judgement of the original.Or if you think gore and nudity make a horror film great. Just imagine the rest never ever happened.
