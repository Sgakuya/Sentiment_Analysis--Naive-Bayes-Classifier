Samuel L. Jackson is probably one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood today, but this stems mostly from the fact that he is not very judicious in choosing the films that he plays in. We often see him playing a secondary character in films when he would be much better suited playing the lead role. Despite this, however, Samuel L. Jackson is a good actor with a deep love and passion for his work. Probably his most famous role was as the religious hitman Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction. His best role, however, has to be his performance as the troubled inner-city high school teacher in the crime drama One Eight Seven. Jackson's performance was incredibly intense, and he didn't skip a beat. Jackson was also the perfect choice for the role of Shaft in the 2000 remake. As I wrote earlier, however, Jackson's greatest failure is his inability to judiciously choose the roles that he plays. The Negotiator is a good example of this. Although Jackson did a decent job, it was Kevin Spacy that stole the show. Die Hard: With a Vengeance is another example of this. Despite this, one cannot deny that when he commits himself, Jackson can certainly act. He's not in the same league as Denzel Washington or Morgan Freeman, but he certainly is talented.
