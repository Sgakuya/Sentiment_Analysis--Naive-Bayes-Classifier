Don't let the box art fool you. This is not a cute game for little kids. The characters make the game look like it's made for 5 year-olds, but it's not. The story line is good, it moves back to the more traditional FFs. I really like the world in FF9 as the cities and ancient civilizations bring it a lot of variety. The characters are interesting, dispite looking like freaks, and the enemy, Kuja, is someone that anyone can hate. The ending isn't nearly as cool as I thought it would be, but it was nice. The FMVs are awesome too. I didn't like it as much as FF7, but I thought that it was definately better than FF8.
