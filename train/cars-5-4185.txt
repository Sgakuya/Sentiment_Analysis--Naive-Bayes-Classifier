If you don't own, or use an Audi or any vehicle, on a regular basis, vehicle opinions from observers should be disregarded as they aren't speaking from experience. I've had my 01 Allroad tiptronic for several months, bought w/50k on the odo and optioned to the max. Winter/Summer/Navigation packages w/twin spoke wheels. Very satisfied, but did research in advance. Some options were no longer available after the '02 model, but the V8 was, beginning in 04. The 250hp V6 is fine; get the 6 speed for best control. Like most all Audis, it doesn't hold its value, so someone's $50k purchase was my $20k purchase. What else in the marketplace provides such luxuries, safety, uniqueness, style anytime you need to move-out quickly, rain or shine, you MOVE without effort wasted on tire slippage. Reliability has NEVER been a problem, the cars are in the Mercedes/BMW league. These "luxury cars" have frequently been left in the rear-view mirror because of their two-wheel drive systems.
