I just heard Julianna Margulies on the Howard Stern radio show the other day, and she came across as an intelligent and interesting person with a good sense of humor. Howard was giving her trouble for passing up some ridiculous amount of money ($20 million?) to stay on ER, and she explained that the show just wasn't fun for her anymore. Given that Margulies is already a multi-millionaire and can land huge paychecks for starring in movies, I guess that makes sense. But to the vast majority of the world population it must seem a little crazy to turn down $20 million for one year of work. Still you have to give her credit for doing what she wants to do. I'll miss seeing her on ER. The new characters aren't nearly good enough to replace her and Clooney.
