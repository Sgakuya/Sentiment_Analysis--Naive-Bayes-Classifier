How can anyone say that Kobe is a kid. Just ask the other NBA stars and they would disagree. A kid can't make a professional b-ball player look amatuer, like Kobe does every game. Yeah, he makes mistakes but who doesn't. I personally feel that Kobe has matured a great deal since he's been in the league. I also feel that he made a good decision to skip college and go straight to the top. The guy is an amazing talent and nobody should think any less of him because he didn't go to college. It doesn't take a college degree to be superstar in the NBA. College isn't for everyone and it shouldn't be forced on people. Kobe Bryant will continue to make every college graduate in the NBA look silly and make more money than most of them.
