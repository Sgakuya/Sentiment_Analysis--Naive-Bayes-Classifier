GIVE UP, TARBABIES! I am origionally from Nebo, NC. I lived it all. The hatred everyone felt toward me and the other Duke fans. The tarbabies always throwing their winning streak in our faces. The whining of the Deacon fans. The obnoxious braying of the wolfpack fans. Then, coach K came along. Duke started winning. Everyone complained more. Whined more. The howling got worse. But wait! When Duke went to the championship, all NC was Duke Fans! Until the start of the next season. And so it has gone for years. Come on! Did I read and hear that anyone could coach that team!? Well, least we forget that when K was down with his back several years ago, he left a team with 11 wins at the begining of the season and the team finished with only 13 wins for the year. K takes good players from high school and melds them together as a team. He doesn't have individual stars. The reason they win is they play well together. No one else in college basketball coaches that way save maybe Roy Williams. Mike is the best there is. There can be only one!
