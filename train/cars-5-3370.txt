bought my 2000 sahara new. It has 78,000 miles. I change the oil every 3000 with synthetic oil. It is affordable if you do it yourself and very easy on this jeep. I have changed the belts and have had to replace the wiper motor. No other problems. I have never changed the plugs or wires and it still runs perfect. Mine is a manual transmission. It is great off road and around town. It is a jeep so going over 70 mph on the highway is not fun. I can't complain. This has been a good reliable low maintenance vehicle since I bought it with 2 miles. The wrangler also seems to hold a good amount of value and demand if it has been well cared for.
