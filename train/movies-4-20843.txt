This movie is from a time when wholesome family movies were more popular. The score is by Rodgers & Hammerstein. The song, It Might As Well Be Spring, won the Oscar in a strong field. Other songs from the movie were hugely popular after the movie's release. Jeanne Crain is, in my opinion, breathtakingly beautiful, as the small town girl, who finds love at the state fair. Dick Haymes, of the extraordinary voice, co-stars as her brother. Dana Andrews and Vivian Blaine are their love interests. The supporting players add to the fun. Keep an eye on Donald Meek, as one of the judges at the fair. The music plays a major part in the enjoyment of this family movie.
