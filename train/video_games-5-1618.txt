Sonic the Hedgehog's latest three-dimensional adventure is MORE than amazing. Ditching the awful music of Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes starts blazing with an amazing theme song about saving the day, and Setting the stage for a heroes parade. A new gameplay innovation is having teams of three characters (for example: Mario, Knuckles and Tails) together. Each can be switched to the front where their special abilities can be used! In-stage music also puts one in mind of the classic Sonic games. The levels themselves are jaw-droppingly epic, featuring loops and even villains from past Sonic installments! Even better, the special stages are a callback to the awesome Sonic 2 and Sonic 3D Blast (Saturn) stages as you race down a tunnel!
