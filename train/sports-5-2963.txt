No one can seriously challenge the the notion that "Teddy Ballgame" remains the greatest hitter to have ever played the game. Tall and gangly, with eyes like a hawk and a work ethic (as far as batting is concerned) that has rarely been approached. This man literally wrote the book on hitting and has continued to teach many of his progeny through those well worn pages and references to his approach that survive on film. With nearly the power of Ruth and the single-minded focus on success at the plate of Cobb and Hornsby, Williams did under normal conditions what the steroid-enhanced Barry Bonds has been able to accomplish in recent years throughout the span of a miraculous career that was twice interupted by military service. The reverence held for Williams by both past and present players at Greatest Players Ever celebration in Fenway Park a few years back was a fitting farwell and a telling tribute to this baseball god. Ted always wanted to be known as the greatest hitter who ever lived. He got his wish.
