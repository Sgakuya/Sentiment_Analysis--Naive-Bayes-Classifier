I've had my jeep for 2 years. It's been a mess. Every 10,000 miles the engine light comes on and they have to replace the spark plugs. Every 20,000 miles they also have to replace the Crankshaft sensor. This jeep is a 5 speed. I have always had manual transmissions on my honda, toyota and mitubishi and never had a crankshaft sensor replaced on any of them. I didn't know that part existed. The toyota went for 250,000 miles and the honda 150,000 and the mitsubishi went for 130,000. The jeep has had to have it's crankshaft replaced TWICE already (and I had only gone 40,000 miles) After 30,000 miles, of course, the waranty expired. (that was $1000). Now at 49,000 (and no off road driving) the seals on my rear brakes went out, so oil soaked through the brake pads - that's another $600. My brake seals NEVER went out on any of my other vehicles. Those problems along with the poor gas mileage, I would NOT buy a jeep. (Though maybe I shouldn't have submitted the review until after I was able to sell it!) I DO NOT recommend buying a jeep - EVER.
