A great product to start you off in the world of video editing and DVD/VHS authoring. This product has got a plethora of functions including animated cut sequences, digital text, drag and drop scene editing, filters, sound track functions and a wizard for creating DVD menus and of course your final product. I have used various other Video Editing products like MGI Videowave and Pinnacle Studio but Ulead was so easy to pick up and gave me the functions I need to produce great home videos on any format. After using it for about a year I would prefer functions like slow motion and more tweaks on the soundtrack but while I have slow mo on the camera and cool edit pro I can get around these small issues. Overall, a neat, fun and easy to use package that gives great results.
