Very intelligent politician, a marginal (C) student (George W. Bush had a higher cumulative average) at Yale, who "cares" about one thing (like most politicians): his own political stature and advancement. He has become a caricature of what is wrong with the Democrat Party. Now, he decries the "subverting of the Constitution" perpetrated by the Bush Administration, when Jamie Gorelick, assistant Attorney General to Janet Reno, has testified to and defended the fact that the same liberties and authorities were taken by the Clinton Administration, in the name of national security, that Congress had authorized such, even prior to 9/11/01.
