The original Super Center, no one has more rebounds. Arguably the greatest individual player ever. It's hard for me to decide who's the best ever, It's Wilt or Mike, take your pick. Look at the things Wilt did with the Warriors with no help (100 pts. and they didn't even finish the game). Rules were changed before he even came into the league in anticipation of his arrival! It's easy for us born in the sixties and on to UNDERATE Wilt's greatness. Even if you don't think he's the greatest of all time, it's hard to deny (if you know the game) that he's had the most impact on the L than any other player. I mean Russell won the most titles so that's not the barometer, Bill was on the best team ever that constantly replinished its talent combined with Red's coaching. Born in 70, the more I learn about Wilt the harder I find it not to label Wilt the greatest. He was able to get past the worlds best (and most hated team) in his prime. Played every minute in at least one season, attacked on the court like none other, lead the L in ASSISTS one year c'mon. The greatest individual player. R.I.P. Wilt -- we'll always hold you on high baby!
