I too remember reganomics, or 'let them eat catsup for a vegetable' I used to always say during his terms that I was not a reagan MAN, as it seemed if you were a woman, you were nothing to his administration--he worked actively against every freedom women have come to know in this country. And he ran as a 'family' president, yet his own family hated him at that time, none of them talked to him. I firmly believe he was suffering his altzheimers DURING his presidental term, as there is no other explaination. NOT in touch wtih how the average or lower income American lives, he lived in a hollywood world where even during the depression and hard times he got $500 a week for being a stock actor, a FORTUNE in those days, heck, even today people don't make that much, yet he would tell people they had to 'tighten their belts'--yea, if you are poor and on welfare, how much more CAN you tighten your belt buddy? If you have a minimum wage job, how much more can you tighten?? this guy was a loonie toon, with a super agressive wife. I figure we already HAD a woman prez and it was Nancy behind her hubbys back, pushing pushing pushing him along or maybe dragging him in the end of his terms.
