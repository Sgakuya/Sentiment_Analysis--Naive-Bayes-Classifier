OMG! I'm sorry, but it has to be said: All of you MORONS who say that Coach Richt needs to go/be fired clearly have absolutely NO CLUE about football!! The guy has a winning percentage of ABOVE .800 (!!!) IN THE TOUGHEST CONFERENCE IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL!!! His teams are always competitive against our biggest rivals, even if he doesn't win every game! (and there is ample reason to believe that we'll start winning those games consistently.) UNDER HIM, UGA HAS GONE TO THE SEC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME 3 of 5 YEARS!!! I have to ask WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR??? A coach that will win a national championship every year?!?!??! GUESS WHAT! THAT COACH DOESN'T EXIST!!! It's idiots like you who drive good coaches away and destroy programs with your unrealistic expectations. I only hope that Coach Richt understands that you all are the tinest minority, and the majority (read: 'Rational' fans) appreciate him and his efforts. Yes, he hasn't been flawless, but I honestly have seen improvement in clock management, play selection, etc. every year he has been our coach. BOTTOM LINE: if you look at it rationally, Coach Richt is a top-flight coach, and we UGA alums should be glad that we have him.
