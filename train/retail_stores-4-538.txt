Yes, alot of Express's clothes are kind of teeneybopperish, but if you go for the dressier styles, you can find some great clothes! I love the dresses - perfect for that special date when you want to look like a scene in a movie, but not overblown and tacky. And they have some really nice clothes that I can wear to work. Advice for anyone who wants to buy that 'perfect' white button down shirt - look in Express, that's where I found mine! I just wish they would sell straight leg jeans, though, because I'm really not into flare leg, but that's all they had at my local Express. And also, the salesgirl at my Express was very rude. When I told her that 'no, I don't want to start up an Express credit account' she still wouldn't leave me alone about it. I work in retail so I know what the associates go through, but isn't good customer service about being good to the customer!! Anyway, the other associates were nice to me, and their dressier clothes are very classy!
