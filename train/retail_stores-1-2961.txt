I purchased a loose diamond in Kay Jewler located at 90-150 Queens Blvd, Elmhurst, ny 11373 space 2077 on 8/28/2005. It is 4 week from today and I still have not receive my diamond. I tried to contact them by phone more than 20 times but the manager was either stepped out or busy doing something else. The assistant manager who picked up the phone told me numeruous times that the manager will call me back but it never happened. I traded in my GIA certified Diamond + the difference in full on 8/28/05. It totally worth more than 10,000. I am very upset with their service and wanted a refund and return of my own diamond, guess what... they do not know the status of my diamond and wanted me to wait for their call AGAIN. I am thinking about report to FCC for this. For anyone thinking about purchase any jewlry from Kay... Think again...
