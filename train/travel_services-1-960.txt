Why can't you choose ZERO stars. U-Haul doesn't deserve one star even if it means terrible, which you only know if you add a rating anyway. TERRIBLE! I got home, had ordered half dozen furniture pads, discovered only four were enclosed. Had to go back next morning, 40 minute drive to get them. Got charged A FULL EXTRA DAY rental when I brought truck back 20 minutes late. I said, Fine, I'll keep it another day then. He said, No, you can't keep it, I've already checked it in. I said, You can't charge me for an extra day and then say I can't use it an extra day -- that's blatantly illegal. He said he only does what U-Haul tells him and that he can't take the charge off for the extra day because the payment goes onto a national charge system and it automatically charges for the next day whether you bring it 20 minutes or 4 hours late. So I was super ticked, but he gave me the national UHAUL phone number said tell them, and they'll probably give me a refund for the extra day, but there was nothing he could do about it. So I called the national number the next morning, and they tell me they can't do anything about it, that I need to talk to the local mover!!!!! After going around in circles with them being given different numbers to call, I got no where. The last guy said he had no power to issue a refund, and I keep asking Who Does? but no one does or no one knows who does. He said all he's authorized to do is fill out a claim form and submit the information. I say, who do you submit it to, let me talk to them. But he can't tell me. How much you bet no one will ever get back to me? They are absolutely CROOKS. You cannot charge a person for an extra day and THEN TELL THEM THEY CAN T HAVE THE TRUCK THE EXTRA DAY. IDIOTS!
