Phnom Penh is not for the weak of heart. It's really, really poor. I was not a big fan the first 24 hours that I was there... everything was so dusty, and poor, and depressing. But after I gave it a chance, i really liked it. The city actually has a lot going for it - big wide avenues, lots of trees, a nice river, some interesting historical attractions like the national museum and palace. And the people were great - smiling and happy, with some of the most beautiful little kids I have ever seen. Interestingly, there were far fewer beggars in this destitute place than there are where I live - San Francisco. I left Phnom Penh really rooting for it. The place has had so much bad luck, and seems to be just a couple breaks away from turning it around. Like with most really poor places, you need to take cautions not to make yourself too much of a target. That being said, I didn't find Phnom Penh to be any more dangerous than other third world cities.
