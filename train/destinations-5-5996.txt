I love going to Ocean City for vacation! My parents have always gone there, and I can't take enough vacations to there. LOL. I usually stay somewhere in Olde City, which has the boardwalk, the beach, the Ocean, the inlet, the Bay, and amusements all in one easy-to-walk-around place. To get there by car, just take Route 50 East. It'll dump you right into the heart of Olde Ocean City. When you're there, you should visit a few places: Jessica's Fudge House (where you'll find some delicious home-made fudge, and the best salt water taffy: Fralinger's brand), Thrasher's (awesome boardwalk french fries), Fisher's popcorn (kettle caramel corn), and Shenanigan's (Irish Restaurant and Bar). There are lots of other places to eat, drink, and spend money, too. Now, as a tradition when I'm in Ocean City, I make it a point to drive down Route 611 and go to Assateague State Park. There you'll find a visitor's center with some educational stuff (good for kids), and then cross the bridge onto the Island, and look for the wild ponies! There are ponies all over the island. That's a sight to see: 5 horses walking right up to your car to check you out..... Another place to go in MD is Baltimore's Inner Harbor. That's a fun place. Lots of places to get food, and there's a Hard Rock Cafe (if you're into those), the National Aquarium, Science Center, USS Constellation, Top of the World (for bird's eye view of city), Federal Hill Park, Fells Point, etc. Those are the 2 major places I've been in MD.
