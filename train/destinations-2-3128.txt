Ok, I just went to Toronto last weekend for Caribana, and I think this city, or country is creating some serious issues. First of all, immigration is out of control in Canada, especially in Toronto. I am from the Caribbean, but the Canadian government is seriously just letting any and everyone in from Guyana, Trinidad, the islands, India and some Asian countries in. It's getting to borderline ridiculous levels. Are they honestly surprised that crime is increasing there now? The immigrants' kids love to think that they are thugs like the American rappers, who hold a lot of influence there. On the upside, the influx of immigrants adds a lot of diversity and flavor to the city, but on the other hand, it has virtually pushed the other native Canadians, even the ones who themselves immigrated from the islands 20 years ago, aside. And the sprawl...oh my, Matamy houses and all that are just popping up like weeds around Oakville and Milton, among other places...it's insane, everyone's buying, 20K immigrants are coming in the city a month, isn't that insane? Will the Canadians stop the nonsense before Toronto becomes NYC x 2, crimewise? And in regards to the poster Tony, perhaps he hasn't been to Toronto in awhile, there was an article that detailed how much immigrant gangs are growing in Toronto and Vancouver. You can't just let a bunch of people in that can't get jobs, you know. That usually equals crime. No matter what race they are.
