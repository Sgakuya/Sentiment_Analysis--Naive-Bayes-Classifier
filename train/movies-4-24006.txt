This movie was definitely interesting. It seems that people either loved it or hated it. I can say that I liked it more than I hated it, but I would have loved it had Speilberg not decided to Disney-ize the last half hour. It could have easily ended and made a better movie if they just cut it off at the underwater scene (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). I can say the movie was not what I was expecting at all from the previews. I knew it would be dark since it started as a Kubrick film, but I was expecting some kind of war between humans and mechas (robots), and it didn't happen. It wasn't bad that this didn't happen, just different. The acting is really good in this movie, but the story is a little hard to make sense of. It was definitely worth seeing though. Oh, and Teddy is awesome...he's one of the best parts of the movie.
