Nelson Mandela is great! After his liberation of South Africa, it has become a better place, as pointed out somewhere by ellajedlicka21. Hmm, maybe my own country can arrange some kind of leader trade! To all you who think South Africa was better before Mandela became the President, I suppose you think apartheid was good, then. After all, that's what South Africa was like before Mandela came along. And I don't give a rat's a** whether he was a communist or not. Come on, you paranoid fanatics, being a communist does not make a person the Devil! Again, Paul Simon's Graceland ---a good source of info. Take care, everyone!
