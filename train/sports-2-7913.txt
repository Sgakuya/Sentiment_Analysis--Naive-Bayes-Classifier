He is seriously overrated. Just like Kevin Garnett, he plays the same way he did in high school, which doesn't cut it in the NBA. What's worse, he's not even trying to learn how to play better. Lebron doesn't play intelligently at all and charges the basket a lot. He's a very strong, fast player, but given the nature of today's NBA and its players, he won't get much better beyond that. I've seen it WAY TOO MANY TIMES. The high school ones are notorious for not knowing how to play right. Jermaine O'Neal is the only one that has transcended that. The two main problems NBA players have that draft out of high school are that they cannot play team ball well and that their skills are very inadequate. Lebron James and KG are guilty of those two problems and Kobe is guilty of not playing team ball well. I think a lot of people are fooled by KG and Lebron's body and their strength. If they had both gone to college, or just learned some fundamentals in the off-season, I guarantee KG would've already won a championship or at least been a perennially serious playoff contender and Lebron definitely would've reached the second round by now. However, I've seen this all a million times before, and all teams have to do to stop these jokers is put pressure on them. If these fools want to play like Jordan, they have to remember Jordan PASSED and actively looked for open teammates. The only way the NBA will get taken seriously again and superstars will actually accomplish something is if the league stopped guaranteeing contracts. Clearly, the players are just abusing the honor system that is currently in place. Good talent is now just showing up to the games and "putting in their time" while telling the fans they care about winning. KG and Lebron are the biggest offenders. Sorry, I don't believe you frauds, ok?
