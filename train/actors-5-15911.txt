Stephen Nichols is the consummate actor. He gives his all to every performance, whether it's a starring role or a minor role. The dedication that he has for his craft is what makes him shine in every role. He displays the utmost respect for all aspects of his craft. Respect for the writers, respect for the actors, respect for the crew, and most importantly, respect for the viewing audience. I have been fortunate to see Mr. Nichols on stage in the play, The Dead Boy; it was a privilege to have seen him in that play. I hope that I will have the opportunity of seeing him grace the stage many times more. Thank you Stephen.
