I have worked for Kroger as a florist going on 7 years. Floral is a sub department of Produce so therefore you don't get department head pay although you are solely responsible for the department. I really enjoy my work and I enjoy most of the people I work with, but I would like an opportunity to move up the ladder which is almost impossible to do when you are a florist. I act as closing Manager one or two times a week and take on projects like cultural inclusion or wherever I am needed (which is quite a lot). I feel as if I am just getting taken advantage of and I really don't want to go the extra mile anymore for a company that won't give me a chance. Kroger is on a downward spiral with their employees. They used to strive to be THE EMPLOYER OF CHOICE, but I really think all they see are dollars signs now and have forgotten the little people that have made the company prosper into the giant they have become today.
