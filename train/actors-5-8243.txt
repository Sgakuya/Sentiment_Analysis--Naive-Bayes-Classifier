Putting the Christina Crawford controversy aside, who can ever foget Joan Crawford...the grand dame of the silver screen during Hollywood's Golden era. She was awesome in such movies as Mildred Pierce (which she won an Oscar for) Whatever Happened to Baby Jane and The Women just to name a few. She was truly devoted to her fans, who to this day love her. And her look...the shoulder pads...severe eyebrows...wow!!It was a shame that stars like her were really taken advantage of by the Hollywood studio machines of the day. They may be a little corny for today's tastes, but I still enjoy seeing her movies. A tribute to her I guess!
