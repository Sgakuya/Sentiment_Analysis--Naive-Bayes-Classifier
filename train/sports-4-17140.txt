They've done a fantastic job this season (unfortunately), especially at keeping Plummer in a position where he can't lose the game for his team. They have a solid D and the "Browncos" d-line has done well, although the most impressive play all came from Trevor Pryce who was on the team last year. Plus, it's hard not to like their running game. However, I can't see this team winning the AFC championship. In order to do that they'll probably have to beat the Colts, something which this team just plain can't do. Whenever a team faces the Colts, it becomes a quarterback duel. Jake Plummer has shown a consistent history, even this year, of making mistakes when he's forced to make decisions. I don't care if it's a duel from the 1st quarter on or just the last 5 minutes, Plummer is almost guarenteed to make a mistake before Peyton does.
