With this novel, Stephen Edwin King has hit an all time low. I've been a fan of his since the beginning, and was even sent an audographed copy of Christine by the King himself along with a letter of encouragement (thanks, Steve). However, when I read a novel as bad as Hearts, I can't hide the bad taste in my mouth. The first story speaks for itself. King once wrote in the Writer's Market that to tell a story effectively, one must know how to edit his own writing. Mr. King should have taken his own advice when he wrote Hearts. The story is a drawn out, exhaustive read. It takes pages just for the main character to make it up the stairs. Even more pages for the next simple act to take place. And come to find out that the story is actually missing what King himself said that every story must have: An Ending. Sure, I don't need everything spelled out to me - it is fun to draw your own conclusions. However, part of the job of an author is to provide all parts of the story: The Beginning, Middle, and Ending. If you ask me, there are already enough incomplete King projects on so many shelves.
