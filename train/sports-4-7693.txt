He may not have the most prolific stats ever (though, they're still quite good) and may not be on everyone's Hall-Of-Fame ballot but Big-game James is one of my fav. basketball players of all time. Call him the Pete Sampras of NBA: Not very verbal and sometimes not noticeable but his game was very unique and very fun to watch. I used to pattern my basketball moves after his when I was a teenager (though I'm white and not as athletic). His jump hooks and quick turnarounds and underhand shots were very cool and futuristic and he even looked it with his goggles. A cool, underspoken but very classy person on and off the court who really shined when the it counted the most. I miss him a lot.
