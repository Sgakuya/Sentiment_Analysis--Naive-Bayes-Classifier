The original Child's Play, for what it is, is a very effective and clever horror movie and is deffinatly the best of the killer doll features. Puppet master has nothign on this truely frightning and slightly disturbed killer toy flick. After an explosive chase a killer known as the strangler is shot and mortally wounded. He seaks refuge in a toy store. Before dying he uses his knowledge of voodoo to transfer his still living soul into the body of a children's Goog Guy doll before his body dies. A single mother then gets this doll off the street from a bum who happened to have run across it. She buys it for a much cheaper price than the retail value ($100!) and takes it home to her happy little boy. Not too soon after (that night to be precise) people start to die. Now, The Strangler swore that he would kill his partner (who abandoned him during the chase) and the cop that killed his former self. He also would appriciate having a human body, so he wants the little boy to transfer his soul into. Chuky is relentless in his attempts to transfer his soul and get the vengence he believes he so rightly deserves. A very jumpy and scary little flick if you ask me. I watched it just recently and forgot how well made and creepy this movie is! Very effective little chiller. Definatly worth a look. RECOMMENDED!
