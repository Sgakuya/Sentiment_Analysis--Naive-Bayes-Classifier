Is George W. Bush smart enough to run a campaign? I think not. He makes little slip-ups which could cause world disasters. One time, when he meant to say, wipe that Russian sauce off my tie, he said, wipe the Russians out. Be careful, George, you don't want to kill yourself before the election. Another time, Bush called people from Greece, Grecians. Not to mention the fact that as governor of Texas, he allowed his state to become first in all major catagories of pollution emission. All of this, combined with the fact that he stole the 2000 presidential, his conservative views, and his bad record as president, make him a terrible candidate for '04.
