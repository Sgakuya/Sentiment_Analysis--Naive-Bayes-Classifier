Hertz take all the worst parts of what the other car rental companies in the UK offer then add some rubbish of their own. They charge so many extras - about USD25 just for renting from an airport. Insurances, road tax. They quote USD65 for a days rental, and you end up paying more than double. Their desk in the arrivals area is hardly ever staffed. Buses are irregular, the depot at Heathrow is dingy, tatty and always has a long queue and most of the customer service peope are sullen and unfriendly. Last time (3 weeks ago), from the time I got to the bus stop for the courtesy bus, to the time I drove away, was nearly an hour and a half. And they were not busy, it was 10pm at night. They give a gold card then don't give you any points if you prebook and prepay. So I have rented over 25 times and not got a single point. Why do I keep going back? Unfortunatey I dont have a huge choice.
