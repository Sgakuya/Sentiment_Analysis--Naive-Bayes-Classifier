Austin is awesome. Laid back and lots of fun. Pretty much whatever you want to do except for extremely fine dining. Don't bring your tux Houston is great. Vibrant downtown area with a ton of clubs. If you watched any of the superbowl festivities before and after the Bowl, you know what I mean. I have not talked to a single out of towner who had a bad visit. Restaurant selection, quality and service is outstanding. Dallas - not my favorite but a nice town to have fun in. You need to have friends that are local to know the good spots it seems. The only thing that gets me is that people from Dallas seem to think that Dallas is a cosmopolitan city compared to the rest of the state. I am not sure what they are smoking. San Antonio - Riverwalk is fun once, but you really need to check out the surrounding area. To get good food - stay away from the Riverwalk. Hit El Mercado instead. South Padre is a ton of fun. Galveston - can be fun but not really my cup of tea. Kind of a cleaner but less to do than New Orleans. I like Bolivar beaches better [less people]. Waco, Lubbock - Only there a short amount of time. Can't really comment. I didn't have much fun McAllen, Brownsville, Laredo - interesting towns. Not really my scene but if you want to trip over to a Mexican border town to shop and experience something unique, I suggest you check it out. Beaumont, El Paso, Midland, - I have no idea. Never been there, except to pass through. Texas is one of the friendliest states you can visit. It also has some of the most beautiful women. I was floored when I first arrived from the northeast. There is something for everyone in Texas. If you can't find it here, you can't find it anywhere.
