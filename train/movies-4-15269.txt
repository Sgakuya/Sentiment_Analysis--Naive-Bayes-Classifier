Can someone please explain to me how Denzel Washington has never won a best actor Oscar? I know he won a best supporting actor Oscar for Glory, but Denzel deserves to be recognized for being one of the top actors in Hollywood. His performance in Hurricane made the movie. I obviously knew the story before I saw the movie, but that didn't keep me from being totally taken in by his performance. He made Carter's disgust, hatred, and metamorphis come alive. Kevin Spacey was great in American Beauty, but Denzel's performance was far better and more deserving of an Oscar. Without him, this movie, with its loose attention to some of the actual facts, would have been mediocre at best. Thanks to Denzel, I definitely recommend this movie.
