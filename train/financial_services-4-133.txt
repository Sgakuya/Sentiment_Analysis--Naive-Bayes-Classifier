I am a customer service representative for Wells Fargo. I think all large banks have their issues, however I can't begin to tell you what some people will blame a bank for. A few tips, there are cut off times for deposits at every bank, you need to learn when they are. Never write a check from a deposit that you do not physically see or hear by automated system on your account. ALWAYS keep a check register. Sign up for free online service, which all major banks offer. Check the account at least every 2 business days and mark off any transactions that have posted. Always go by the balance in your check register, not what the bank tells you your balance is. They have no way of knowing what you might have outstanding. ALWAYS read your customer disclosures upon opening an account. ALWYAS read the fine print on your monthly statements. There just might be some information that applies to you; (coincidentally you will swear uphill and down that you never received in a later transaction involving this information). Remember that banks are not nonprofit organizations. They have to pay their employees that answer the phones, cash your transactions at the branch and post their payments, etc., etc. And last but not least, it doesn't matter in what order the bank posts your transactions if you have the money to cover them, there would never be an overdraft occurrence. We do make mistakes. Anyone in business makes a mistake from time to time, as do our customers. We are always willing to work with someone who is a good customer when an honest mistake is made. However, when repeat offenders call and cuss and scream that we are bloodsuckers that don't care at all about our customers, what do you expect? I learned how to keep and balance a check register in my 10th grade accounting class. If you don't know how, visit a local branch and ask. They will be more than willing to educate you.
