I have driven only the military version of the hummer. It has a purpose, just like anything else. Does anyone know how the military purchases there Hummers, trucks etc. Its called Lowest Bidder . I can personally atest that the military version is uncomfortable to drive for long distances (like convoys), it leaks (water comes in when it rains or when it is being washed), it runs very hot without the heater on (due to the transmission being between the two front seats) Oh yes I want to drive that across the scorching desert!! Not!! I would much rather drive some off the shelf SUV/4x4 with AC than the hummer. Way over priced for what it is.
