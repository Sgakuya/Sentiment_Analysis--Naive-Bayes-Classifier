Five years, five NCAA bids, a Big 12 Championship, one Final Four, and (in football-mad Texas) he is hooking hoop fans big-time. Actually, he has accomplished what football coach Mack Brown left basketball-crazy North Carolina for... to be #1 in his sport (Mack is currently about the 8th or 9th best coach at his own university). Barnes overachievers did the impossible in Austin this spring: drew more fans to their South Regional Championship (40,000) than the spring football scrimmage. Rick Barnes has accomplished the impossible ... and great things are on the horizon as Barnes recruits nearly as well as Mack (the difference being Rick actually gets his boys to play up to their potential!) There's a new #1 sport in Texas...it's got that ball that bounces.
