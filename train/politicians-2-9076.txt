Probablly its because hes just out of office or maybe its because he was such a charasmatic leader but in my opinion Clinton is one of the most overrated presidents we've ever had. While he does deserve praise for his welfare reform act that is the only success in his nearly decade in office. But he tried to steal the credit for the Reagan Expansion of the economy that happend under his term. The expansion of the economy was a result of Reagan's policies not Clinton's but we won't get into that now. Lets just plain forget about Monica, in fact, I dont blame him (look at Hillary) but the lying under oath did hurt him. Aside from that Clinton will be remembered for his other failures such as his health bill that crashed and burned. But probablly the biggest disappointment of his term was his inabillity to heal the racial tension present in America. The timing was right and he just couldn't do it. Hopefully Bush and his successors will be able to follow through on this key issue. Issue wise Clinton wasn't bad (for a Democrat) but the thing that stands out most about his presidency (apart from the scandal) is his inabillity to get results... the true mark of a great leader.
