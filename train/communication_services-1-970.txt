Centennial is the worst company of all time. I would recommend selling your soul to the devil before signing a contract with centennial. I had them for two years. first of all I was not made aware when I signed the contract that all the features were additional. they had led me to believe that voice mail, caller id, etc was including but it was a charge for everything. what they do is they give you one month of everything free and then charge you after that. you get your second months bill and it shocks the hell out of you. their website sucks. you can add features on the website but you can't take anything off. I was on the phone for a half hour today. mostly on hold. first the phone rang about fifteen times before it was even answers by their computer. all I wanted was to officially cancel my service I started with one person then they said they were going to transfer me to the cancellation department, but after waiting forever for the cancellation department they tell me I can't cancel on the phone. what bullcrap. then they tell me that even though my contract is up the cancellation won't be effective for 30 days. so even though I am not on contract, I have to pay for an additional month. what bullcrap. never ever ever ever use centennial wireless. I found out that the devil wears blue shirts.
