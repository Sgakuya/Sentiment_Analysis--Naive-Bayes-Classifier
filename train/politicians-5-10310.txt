Deeply focused on the only issue that matters. Defeating terror and mainstream islam is essential. Bush is doing what needs to be done and what should have been done many years ago. GW believes in his pre-emption approach and he will continue to do this whether he leads in the polls or not and even if he is defeated in the 04' election. Amazing that no known mid-east attack has occured since 9/11 on American soil. For 8 1/2 years our government underestimated the threat of terror until our wake-up call. Bush is determined not to have a WMD wake-up call and now is not the time to underestimate this threat. In fact thank goodness we appear to be overestimating this threat. But of course if a bomb goes off tomorrow then we will have to revise the accuracy of our estimate. No more wake-up calls!!! Everything else is gravy.
