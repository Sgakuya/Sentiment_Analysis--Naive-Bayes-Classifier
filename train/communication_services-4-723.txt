I live in Walnut Creek, CA and have been fairly happy with Sprint PCS for about four years now. It seems lately their coverage has become a bit worse - quite often I will have only 1 bar and I'm in a third-story apartment building right next to a major highway in a good-sized, dense little suburb town. Also, calls drop a little more often than they should. My experience with customer service hasn't been as bad as everyone else's - other than sometimes relatively long hold times (5-10 minutes) before getting through. One thing that I expecially like about them is the cheap nationwide coverage. I don't travel that much, but when I do, it's nice to have coverage almost everywhere I go, including long distance. For the price/value, they seem hard to beat, and I just spent all morning looking. MetroPCS seems very attractive, but their recent reviews on this site are considerably worse - and for more scary reasons (coverage problems) - than SprintPCS.
