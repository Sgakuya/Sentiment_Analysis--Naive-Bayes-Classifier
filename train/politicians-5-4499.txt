Can there be any question but that, if the Media were actually doing the job under which they hold their FCC licenses (effectively informing the public), ALAN KEYES would be President today? Look at the record. Alan Keyes won EVERY televised Presidential debate that the GOP candidates made in 2000 (check with Morris' voter.com). He was the ONLY candidate to take an overview on Americas problems and to propose a solution. Will ALAN KEYES go away now? I don't think so; not as long as there are responsible Americans who recognize the Republic is in danger and that there are leaders, such as Alan Keyes, who might actually be able to pull us out of it. Is America doomed? Not if we can get THIS man in the Oval Office! -----
