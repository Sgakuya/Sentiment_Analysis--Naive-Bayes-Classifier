Made a little after the end of the Tom Hanks "Blue Period" (where the off-beat roles had more appeal to him than the big-money ones, judging by how many of the eclectic ones he did during those four years), and you could tell he was gearing down from something "BIG". Joe Dante's uneven direction couldn't keep viewers from liking Hanks in this movie, as he again played the average-nice-guy-next-door who suspects his new neighbors are up to no good. The "family from hell" was a casting coup: NOWHERE else could you assemble freakier folk than Henry Gibson, Brother Theodore, and Courtney Gains (who runs neck-and-neck with Joey Ramone for the title of "Ugliest White Guy of All-Time"). Goaded on by fellow cul-de-sac crazies Rick Ducommun and Bruce Dern, they dig further and further into the bizarre doings of the Klopeks until it all blows up in their faces. Great supporting cast, sporting Carrie Fisher, Corey Feldman, Franklin Ajaye, Rance Howard, and Gale Gordon. Not a feather in anyone's cap, but it grafts enough mystery, suspense, and comedy moments together to warrant a disc purchase. Identifiably enjoyable.
