I guess in the eyes of some I am a loser because I do not like the taste of Starbuck's coffee. Just for the record, I am not an instant coffee drinker. My preference is Columbian Supreme which is stronger than a standard roast but incredibly smooth. I find Starbucks to be harsh and it probably has a high acid content as it has a tendency to make my stomach growl. If this is what it takes to join the ranks and get the approvel of the elite liberals then I'll brew a pot of Supreme, add a touch of cinnamon, put a little genuine sugar and half and half in my cup and thank God I'm a conservative. Enjoy your Starbucks my iron stomach friend.
