I would like to respond to Wiggum by saying the reason we are cranky is people like john430et. john430et well if you don't like the country you can do both of us a favour and stay the hell out of it. I would like to thank the rest of you for your nice comments about my country. Remember we are still alot like other countrys we have our violence, pollution, and jerks, the same as any other country. But like most people who live here I think the benefits far out shadow the drawbacks. If you really want to experience Canada come on Canada Day. Last year it started to down pour and there was like 1000 people wlking through the rain singing O Canada. I never saw one person even frown all day. Sorry so long I tend to drone on, I'm very patriotic.
