A most beautiful corner of the planet populated by natives who are liberal, easygoing and very pleasant. Great climate. The music there is compelling. Kauai, Maui and the big island are much more appealing than Oahu, although the north shore of the latter is very nice. The downside is everything is so expensive, it's virtually impossible to afford the real estate there, its isolated location tends to make one feel a tad out of it if you visit there too long (I spent six weeks there in 1992, so I speak from experience), there's too much dependence on tourism (which has its pitfalls) and too many of those Japanese milling around.
