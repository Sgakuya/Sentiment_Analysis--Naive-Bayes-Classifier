Mass as all of New England currently has a rather slow economy. However all of New England has much going for it- namely a rather compact geographic area with representation of 12 US Senators. Mass. has great educational instituitions that foster innovation and new ideas for the future. Boston itself suffers from overpriced housing- but then again so do many areas up and down the eastern seaboard. Taxes are indeed high- but the quality of life is higher then in low tax regions of the south and rocky mountain states. If you want decent schools, good police and fire protection, a safe envirionment, you will quickly realize you do not get these for nothing. Go to perhaps those 'cheap states' you may find lots of low paying jobs but also the reality of a lower quality of life...which will be disappointing to you in the long view.
