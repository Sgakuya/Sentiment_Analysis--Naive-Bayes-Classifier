As other comments have noted, one can almost always find something worth buying at a Structure, and often that something is on sale. Men's fashions do not change as quickly or as radically as women's fashions do so even the more trendy selections will be useful for several seasons. The best thing about Structure is that it offers clothes that are not all designed for those looking to be urban outdoorsmen (eg Banana Republic, American Eagle, or Eddie Bauer). Finally, with such a good selection, you and your significant other can find more than a few things that will satisfy both (ie comfortable for you, trendy for her). I should say that it has been some time since I shopped at a Structure, so perhaps things have changed for the worse.
