I am a big iced tea drinker and had usually made my own because I like splenda as a sweetener. I had tried several other brands but never really liked the taste. My son always drinks the sweetened Arizonia and when I was visiting several weeks ago he bought some of the diet for me. I was amazed how good it was and decided to buy a case with different flavors. I like all of them but the peach and lemon are my favorites. I now take a bottle to work each day and several of my co workers have decided to try Arizona Iced Tea. Now they are drinking it also. I had asked our cafe if they could get it and was surprised they did. They problem is more people are buying Arizona Iced Tea now and they sometimes run out. Since I am a diabetic, I have drinks with artifical sweetener or splenda. I definitly prefer splenda. Keep on making this great bmeverage since I gave up coffee I am drinking Arizona Iced Tea in its place.
