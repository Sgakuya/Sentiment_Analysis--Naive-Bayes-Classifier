This is one of the most complete and advanced of any that I am familiar with on this list. You typically only see it on high end servers that can afford such a product. For the home Linux hacker, it cost $900 and with the right modules, you can spend upwards of $5,000. Still, if you are using a hosting company of any size, it's not out of question since pricing is competitive in those situations. It offers a ton of options and is very graphic intensive for those that like to look at pictures instead of data. You can click all you want without being lost in the middle of nowhere on the web when all you wanted was the raw data of a particular graph. This is high end software for professionals that offers Business Ready Graphics to the more techinical server loading. This isn't a "Let's look at hits we got."
