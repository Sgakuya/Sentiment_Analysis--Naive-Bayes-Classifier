Sith was a heck of a lot better than 1 and 2 but not quite as good as the originals. Lucas tried to make some of the ships' interiors look a tad like those models from the 70's and 80's that dominated the originals but it was too little too late in my opinion. It's only about the last five minutes but I guess I have to give him credit for going for continuity, even if it wasn't achieved very successfully. The action sequences were pretty good as a whole, but only at the expense of flow and comprehension. For example: At the beginning, General Grievous is seen coughing multiple times and stops later in the film with no explanation. I think Lucas was trying to let the viewer know that he was part droid part alien, but it left me wondering what the scene that was cut had been like. I also was amused by a homing missile that, instead of exploding, dispatched several small droids that tried to systematically dismantle Obi-Wan's fighter in a kind of James-Bond-esque unnecessarily elaborate attempt to kill him. Other than that, I can't complain much. It's still better than most movies. My wife enjoyed the film too, but, as she informed me, mostly because of Haydn Christensen.
