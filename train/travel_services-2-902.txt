I used Allied for a move from Atlanta to San Francisco, and the experience was pretty bad. The crew they sent to pick up all my stuff hadn't been told by my moving agent that they were supposed to pack up all my stuff for me, so they expected to find a bunch of boxes instead of an unpacked apartment. Naturally that caused some problems and dragged out the pick-up process to a full day (even though I don't have much stuff). Then one of the guys in the two-man moving crew claimed to have a bad back, so I actually had to help the other guy move my couch and a big chair. Also, the movers broke a bunch of my stuff: they dropped my TV stand (which smashed it), they dropped my CD player, and they crushed a lampshade that I can't replace. I filed for reimbursement for the damages, which required a lot of annoying paperwork, but they rejected my claim because it didn't exceed the deductable. Then, when they were delivering my stuff in San Francisco, they showed up a day early and blamed me for not being there. I told them I could be there the next day, so they said they'd show up at 8 in the morning. Well, of course they showed up at 7 and were irritated I wasn't waiting downstairs. Overall, the experience was pretty bad. But I'm giving them one star instead of two because everything is relative, and it seems like everyone I know has a nightmare moving story to tell.
