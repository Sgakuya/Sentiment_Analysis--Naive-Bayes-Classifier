I am an atheist, and do not approve of the ruling Likkud government's policies. Neither of these facts has kept me from having the time of my life in Israel, visting for several months back in the early 90s. Israel is a GREAT place to visit, whatever your religion and poltics. Given the current unrest, now is not the time to visit (though you'd probably get a real bargain on your hotel room (-:, but when things improve there are many reasons to visit: 1. Fascinating historical and archeological sites-Masada is especially impressive, a mountain-top fortress out of Lord of the Rings that must be seen to be believed. 2. Modern infrastructure and mentality- Easy to get around, the food is safe to eat, the shops open and close on schedule for years now all the news has been bad, and the country founded by brave, largely secular pioneers is sinking into a swamp of religious superstition, corruption and militarism-much like my own country. But I believe that any traveler to Israel will still be inspired, as I was, by its great acheivements, regardless of how tarnished they have now become.
