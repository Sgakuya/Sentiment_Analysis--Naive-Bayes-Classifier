Chock full of history. Patriotic and chivalrous. Shows its redneck roots from time to time, especially when outsiders question her addiction to the tobacco industry. (Similar to Kentucky in that regard.) School systems are OK. Universities are decent. I can get there from New York in less than a day, so I would have reason to visit. Richmond has become just another Yankee megalopolis. The Tidewater region and Williamsburg are too tourist-y, and I strongly suggest staying away from Virginia Beach and Newport News...they were alleged targets for terrorism because of the naval presence and its stockyards. I prefer Dansville, Staunton, and places in the western part of the state, where it's more rustic and less infested with tourists. All told, it's an OK state, but I wouldn't live there.
