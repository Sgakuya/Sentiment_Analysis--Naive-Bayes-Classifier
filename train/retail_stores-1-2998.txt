My husband purchased my wedding set in 1996. It cost over $2300. I had worn the engagement ring less than 1 1/2 weeks when a prong broke. I spent about $80 to repair it. In 1999 I had another prong break. This repair cost me about $60. In 2000 I had a prong break, Kay replaced all the prongs on the solitaire with a sturdier prong, granted, this repair was only $60. Now, I take my engagement ring in for a prong that holds the bagget. I was called with an estimate for $258 to repair it. I submitted an e-mail to the consumer relations department. No help, except to offer me the extended warranty at $258 off the normal price for my ring. When I questioned the cost, so I would have enough cash, the offer was retracted. Now, lo behold, I go to pick up my rings from the repair and NO ONE KNOWS WHERE IT IS. I will NEVER purchase from Kay Jewelers again. They have absolutely lousy customer service regarding repairs or resolutions. What really gripes me is that when I took my ring in for repairs this time, the person behind the counter said, you can upgrade this if you would like. If I wanted to upgrade my rings, I would have done it on our 5 year anniversary. Now all of a sudden my rings are gone the Elkhart, IN store has had a changeover of employees. Makes me wonder where it is. Oh, another thing, no one seems to be able to find where it was originally purchased. Sounds very fishy to me. Now I am ringless, thank God I know I'm married I know my husband loves me whether I have my rings on or not. It really makes me feel ill that MY rings are lost and gone forever without any trace.
