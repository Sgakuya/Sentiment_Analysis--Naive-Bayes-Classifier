I recently stumbled on this movie while watching HBO, and ugh - what a blunder by me. I foolishly watched the entire thing, thinking that it had to get better at some point. Nope - it's pretty miserable all the way through. I usually like Johnny Depp, but no actor can single-handedly save such a dull, unengaging script. The movie's moral ambiguity is mildly notable, given it deviates so far from standard Hollywood conventions that there are no good characters. But it also turns out there are no likeable characters, so it's difficult to get emotionally involved. Lena Olin is especially annoying in her role as some kind of supernatural being who protects (or helps corrupt) Johnny Depp as he searches for copies of a book allegedly written by the devil. Even if you like dark horror/thriller movies, Ninth Gate is one to skip.
