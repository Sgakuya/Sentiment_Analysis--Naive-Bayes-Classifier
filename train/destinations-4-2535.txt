Honolulu reminds me a lot of Miami, very similar in layout and style. Waikiki has a lot of great hotels and nightlife, lots of stuff to do. My favorite experience was visiting Pearl Harbor, where you can still see plenty of evidence of the Japanese attack. The USS Arizona is still leaking fuel into the bay, it was something else. I went there on a day when veterans of the attack were holding a memorial ceremony; it was moving hearing about their experience on that day in which seemingly no one on the base was expecting an attack. Outside of Pearl Harbor, there isn't much of interest in Honolulu, just hang out at the beach in Waikiki and go to the nice restaurants in the area. Go out into the island. The best surfing is found on the Northeast coast of the island.
