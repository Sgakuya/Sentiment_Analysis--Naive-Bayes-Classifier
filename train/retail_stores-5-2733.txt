I have always had wonderful experiences at Home Depot. I have done many home improvement projects myself, and I have learned to always take the time and effort to do the project right. Research about what you need BEFORE you buy it, and if you want quality customer service don't go at a peak shopping time (like right after work). It's just like when dining out- you have to wait to be seated longer and receive less attention from the server during rush hours. When I've needed it, I have found the employees to be incredible helpful and informative. (Maybe it has to do with my direct questions). And the return policy is awesome! I once returned 5 bushes that had died (due to my own mistake- I'm still learning!) and received the full credit back because I had saved my receipt. I bought new bushes, and they are thriving now. So as you can see, I have only positive things to say about Home Depot and their employees.
