The Bell Jar is a symbol of oppression. Plath authenticly wrote about the struggles women face from society. The book follows her own life. The Bell Jar's main character, Esther, is thought of as crazy because she did not want to conform to what society wanted her to be. Society would let her be a writer or a wife/mother not both. She went through Hospitals and struggled with her depression, but in the end she did conform. She did not want to just get married and have children, she wanted it all. Plath told the reader Esther conformed on the third page, I cut the plastic starfish off the sunglass case for the BABY to play with
