Loosely based on Cameron Crowe' undercover observations of a real high school, Fast Times At Ridgemont High (1982) set the standard for the typical 1980's teenager movie. For the uninitiated, the film essentially follows several interrelated stories of a few of the students at fictional Ridgemont High. The most notorious is slacker Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) who dreams of being a professional surfer, orders pizza in class, and remains in constant conflict with his teacher Mr. Hand (Ray Walston). Other main characters are Judge Reinhold as senior Brad Hamilton who is stuck in a series of bad jobs, his lovesick sister Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and Phoebe Cates who plays Stacy's best friend. The movie is also notable for appearances by Nicolas Cage, Nancy Wilson, Forest Whitaker, and Anthony Edwards. The bottom line is that Fast Times At Ridgemont High is essentially a benign comedy that gets a bonus star due to its cult status, cast and influence on latter copycat films.
