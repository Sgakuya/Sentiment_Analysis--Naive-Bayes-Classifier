Alfonzo is easily the most underrated player in baseball. That will probably change now that the Mets have made it to the World Series. Few players in the league have as many clutch hits over the last few years as Alfonzo. He can hit for average and power. Sure, he gets a lot of good pitches hitting in front of Mike Piazza, but that shouldn't take away from his game at all. And, he is such a team player. After establishing himself as one of the better defensive third basemen a couple of years ago, he was perfectly willing to move over to 2B when the Mets signed Ventura. And now, he is one of the better defensive second basemen in baseball. Edgardo Alfonzo is a true superstar who is only going to continue to get better.
