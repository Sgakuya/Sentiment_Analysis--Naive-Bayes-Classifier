Over two weeks ago I ordered a phone and a monthly service online. A week later, when my phone hadn't showed up, I called and found out my phone was back logged. What that really meant was there was a problem with the port over of my number from ATT wireless which really is a horrible company. So I spend 3 hours on the phone trying to get them to switch over the port. The people were nice, but they were incompetent. So it ends up fine- they were going to send out the phone immediately. 1 week later the phone is still back logged and I call to see what's going on and they tell me that the phone has been phased out. I can't get the phone that they promised me when I ordered the service because of their slow incompetence. I willing to just go somewhere else, but I want to make Cingular pay for this extreme hassle and inconveniece.
