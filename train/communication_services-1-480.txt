I've been an altell customer since 2001. From ' July 2001 - July 2003 I had a contract for service that I was happy with until the last 6 months - 1 year of that contract. I opted to discontinue service after my customer service complaints and technical issues went unresolved. In November 2003, after some knowledge that plans, phones and rates were changing and improving, I decided to take a leap of faith and go with alltel again. This time the same occurrence, great service for the first year and declining service in the second. I've called continuously over the last 6 months to report dropped calls (in the city), static ridden service and roaming (in my call area). Each call was the same (see alltel employee response below), upgrade my phone software, update my roaming list...nothing helped....I even got another (I don't say new because they issued be a discontinued refurb) phone and that amplified my issues. Finally, I'm told that its my problem and they are not looking to do anything out of the way to keep me as a customer. No early termination without penalty...nothing. Alltel has piss poor customer service and technical service. I will never use Alltel again and will make sure that my negative word of mouth and web campaign does alittle more than provide me with the satisfaction of preventing one person from using them.
