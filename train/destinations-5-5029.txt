The Finger Lakes area of Syracuse and Ithaca are great! Some people may complain about the weather between November and March, but if it wasn't for the winters, the area would become over-crowded. As more people discover the quality of life and the low cost of housing in the Finger Lakes, I'm sure the economy will get better. IMO, the eastern half of Upstate NY has a brighter future because Albany and Syracuse have culture, sports, hills and are closer to the East Coast cities. Therefore when the price of housing goes up in Washington DC or Boston, you will start to see people move to the Fingers Lakes region around Syracuse and the Saratoga region near Albany.
