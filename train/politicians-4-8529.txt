All the great stuff that happened in Clinton's era (if any) is all because of Regan and Bush. They proposed, and then left office before they could sign anything. Clinton stepped right in to sign the already perpared papers. Reagan brought back trust in the gov't. to most citizens. As much wrong as there can be in our system and the people who run it,if we truly felt that the gov't. was out to screw anyone and everyone in every possible way and thought there was no hope in changing that, all of us and most U.S. citizens would be claiming residence and citizenship in another country right now. The one aspect of Reagan (and there is still not 100% proof of this) is him buying of the Iran gov't. to hold off on the release of the hostages until after the 1980 election. If ture, then that is truly dispicable to do that to any human being who gave their lives to protect ours. Like I said though, it's still questionable whether that actually happened. Other than that, Reagan was a relief after Carter. Quite possibly one of the best presidents in U.S. history.
