We love twisted tea, original, half and half, raspberry and peach (not really - peach is too syrupy). After years of drinking this stuff and wondering about its effect we finally got the caffeine count on this stuff. Original has 36 mg per bottle. I imagine the other flavors are similar. To put it in perspective, they are about the same as a coke or pepsi. We still drink them regularly but now understand that a sixpack of these is like drinking a 6 pack of pepsi as far as caffeine goes. The alcohol's depressant nature mellows the caffeine effect a bit but if you've felt the TT lift or had trouble snoozing after a few, now you can connect your cause and effect. Cheers
