Clueless. Ostensibly, OSTENSIBLY, one would think that reaching the level that he did would require at least SOME brains, or wisdom rather, the two are not necessarily a package deal, we've all known people who had great amounts of one and none of the other. WTF is a "White Citizen's Council?" Believe me, whatever it is, they don't share space with The Superfriends in The Hall of Justice. Lott did NOT just make some mistake, there's no errors or remarks taken out of context here, he was talking to Strom Thurmond- a reasonable candidate for most odious American politician of the last century, and the implicit message of those remarks is pretty crystal clear to me. It's not even a party issue in my view, the guy he was talking to was odious as a Democrat, as a Republican, and as The Know-Nothing he probably began as. Now, Lott comes from working class roots, so, if nothing else at least one can't accuse him of being a snob. Know what else I find despicable? The rich elitist bluebloods that still comprise a potent, if decreased section of that party, are doing what they always do, and have done since day one, pitting the poor against the poor by playing on racism and fear. In other words, people like Lott come from a comparatively humble background, but though ethnically and religiously they are often akin to the bluebloods, they are much poorer, in fact some of the poorest folks in the land. People in Appalachia and down South and elsewhere, are akin to the old money, yet behind their backs condescended to, manipulated, and laughed at by the elite of this land. I'd suggest that anyone doubting this, or wanting to defend this guy listen to Dylan's "Only a Pawn In Their Game" repeatedly until that message sinks in.
