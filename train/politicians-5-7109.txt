I am in total support of the Reverend Jesse Jackson and this trial he has encountered in his personal life. I am very proud of him as a civil rights leader and humanitarian. I commend him on his courage to face this publicized out-of-wedlock relationship scandal the media and, as has been accused by not only me, the new Bush Administration has slapped him. I sympathize with his wife and I sympathize with the new mother of his 20-month old baby. At the same time I do not feel pity for his wife because as a wife I believe she has been dealing with Jesse's faults for years. If both these women can live with Jesse, so should the (sin)less public. I refuse to cast the first stone at Jesse and so should every pot who finds the gaul to call the kettle black. Apostle Paul quoted somewhere in the holy bible, There goes I , meaning that baby's mama could have been me three months ago when I was going through my marital problems at home. Anyone going through marital problems are perfect candidates to be Jesse's crisis, if it is a really a crisis. The focus of what Jesse represents in the political arena has not changed in the African American community. In the holy book, King David sinned when he sent the woman he desired husband to the front line of battle so that the husband could be killed, and leaving the woman King David desired prey for his lustfulness. Though there were consequences from God and only God, King David was yet a great king and so it has been in the history of mankind. In conclusion, Jesse's pardon and chastisement should come from God and only God. The holy book has guided me to Touch not my anointed . Jesse has a mission, Jesse is gifted to do miracles with third world nations. Jesse in untouchable by mankind. I say all this in Jesus Name. AMEN.
