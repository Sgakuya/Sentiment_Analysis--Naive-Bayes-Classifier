I have been to 2 different Olive Garedens in the last 3 weeks. The first(the one I have gone to for years)was not up to par. the service was poor,and the food portions were half the amount we have had in the past. Not at all what the commericals lead you to believe. Thinking it was just a bad night we decided to try another one we have been to in the past and... We had very bad service and had to keep asking for things over and over again. Have you had some changes to your service and food policies? We will give it one more try. Also, we have never been asked if we would like more salad or breadsticks, if we wanted we have had to ask. At our table of 5 we were given 5 bread sticks and the same size salad as a table for 2.
