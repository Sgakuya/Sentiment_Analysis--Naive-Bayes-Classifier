'Bombay' isn't an easy entity to define. For a casual tourist, I guess this is not the best place but for someone ready to mingle with the mess, there's a treasure sitting in there. It is India's New York and Hollywood combined into one, for it is the economic as well as the fashion/movie capital of the country, where the super-rich and poor co-exist in perfect apathy. Beautiful Victorian buildings, palm trees, seaside promenades and drives, bazaars, college crowds and party atmosphere, excellent dining, lively and generally safe at night, with supercrowded yet functional mass transit system (not easy for tourists). Negatives - Dirty, smelly,nasty combination of slums and high rises and crowds that have to be seen to be believed. Your view of Bombay will mostly depend upon the your perspective and areas of the mega-city U see. As for rating, I don't know which aspect of city is expected to be rated here, but I give it an overall 4.
