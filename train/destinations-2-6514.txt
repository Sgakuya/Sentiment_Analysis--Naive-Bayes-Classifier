I spent a few days in Amarillo, a couple nights in Dallas, and flew into Dallas a couple times. I don't have quite the knowledge of Texas like other RIA members but my experience in the state hasn't been very welcoming. DFW airport wasa sprawl with a lot of unhelpful employees, Dallas is way too populated for my liking and I just never felt comfortable there at all. There are way too many poor Mexicans hanging out at convenience stores looking for trouble, character-less unkept homes and children, and long and flat stretches of roads with bloodthirsty drivers. These people weren't racing home after work to spend time with their families. They were driving like bats-out-of-hell to get to the bars for happy-hour or meet up with their drug dealer looking for their next fix. Combine the most brutal summertime heat on top of all the other foolishness and its a recipe for agony. Not to be confused with the breezy, tropical-heat of Fla. This was the clear skies and 100-110 degree variety. It sucked. Amarillo wasn't too nice either although the residents were at least polite. Texas appears to be a state of extremes in the residents attitudes. I didn't see any of these mountains people claim to see while in Texas and concluded it must be because they're situated near that part of the state that borders that dumpy country, Mexico. One final note, statistics are a very telling way to judge a state/region and statistically speaking Texas is close to the bottom of the 50 states in some very important categories (1=best, 50=worst). 45th in percent of population living below the poverty line at 15.3%(2002). 44th in per capita crime rate (2001), 43rd in unemployment rate at 6.3%(2002), and slightly better in per capita income scoring 31st (2000-2002). Stats are from the 2003 New Hampshire Economic Review. One statistic that Texas would have ranked first in is Assholes Per Capita.
