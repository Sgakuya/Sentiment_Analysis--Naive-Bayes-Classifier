Ok, being a long lasting fan of the Alien Legacy, I must say this movie is the worst of them all. Im not bashing the 1992 graphics, or even the poor casting (at least thats what I thought). The thing that gives this movie its downfall is its story. I mean, how much more can they put poor Ripley through? Not only do they kill of Hicks and Newt, they shave her bald! I feel sorry for Sigourney Weaver for taking the part! I feel even more sorry for her after seeing what they do to Ripleys character. Ok, get this. After Ripley crashes on the latest planet, see is forced to have to take company with a bunch of convicts. Well, apparently being around a bunch of criminals turns Ripley on so she sleeps with one of them. ITS OUTRAGES! I was shocked to see Ripley do such a thing, being how she is always the levelheaded one. But thats not all. THEY KILL RIPLEY OFF! I was disgusted! I couldnt believe that they would kill off the most important character in the whole series! The only thing I can say I like about the movie is the alien itself. Although how it got to the planet is one of the other things I cant stand in this movie, it did look pretty cool. The graphics arent very good for todays standards, but it is, after all, a 1992 movie. Anyway, I was intrigued by the fact that it moved on all fours like the dog it was born from. It gave it a more animal feel to it. But thats about the only thing I could find good about it. Everything else should have been left on paper.
