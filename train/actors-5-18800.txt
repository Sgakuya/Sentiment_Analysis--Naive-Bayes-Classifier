Where in the world is Quentin Tarantino? I don't understand! He proved himself to be a genius (not ordinary, run-of-the-mill genius, but Orson Welles-type genius), but it seems that alas like Welles, his flame burned too bright and too fast and just disappeared! By God, I hope that's not so! This is the writer for movies like True Romance and Natural Born Killers; and the director for movies like Resevoir Dogs (my personal favorite) and Pulp Fiction. I hope the world hasn't seen the last the last of Tarantino and his colorful violence! It wouldn't look good for the man who has his own adjective: Tarantino-esque!
