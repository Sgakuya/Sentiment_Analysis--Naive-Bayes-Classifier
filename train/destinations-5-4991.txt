Great place to live- especially if one is seeking peace and a less hectic life from the rat race. Portland and vicinity in southern Maine has over 100,000 people- so it has many ammentities that large cities have- plus ample arts, music and fine dining. All at a slower pace of life compared to the rest of the northeast Bath on the mid coast is a wonderful place to live and retire. Coastal Maine has winter conditions that are milder then many expect. Summer are very nice- with little or no air pollution that can plague regions to the south on the eastern seaboard. If you seek a peaceful retreat, with a liberal thinking populace, that treasures people, new ideas and the envirionment- live in Maine!
