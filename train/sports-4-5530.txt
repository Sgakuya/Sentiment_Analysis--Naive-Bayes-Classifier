Ok for all those non basketball players putting there 2 cents in listen up being from the same city playing pick up ball agaist him having watched him play highschool AAU and College I have watched him go from a hard nose scrappy player to a true point guard who performs A+ on both sides of the court he has the ability to take over a game with one quick step how many game winners has Hinrich Labron Melo Riece had compared to Gardner how many of them doubled there points averaged in a game from one season to the next goin from 12pts to 24pts the next season to pick up the slack but of course the rest of them have one the John Wooden award just to let you know the award is from the greatest coach of all time and how many of them are all time leaders statistically in over three categories at their college the only reason he wasnt drafted was because of his height which hes proved over and over again that thats not an issue Jason is a class act off the court when recieving the award for Mr.Basketball for Indiana he took it in honor of me (because of being paralyzed from the chest down after diving after a loose ball striking the gymn mat wall head first) and Big Jon Stewart falling dead on the gymn floor during a home game of unknown heart problems but Jasons' stats and accolades and awards speak for him thats all I have to say
