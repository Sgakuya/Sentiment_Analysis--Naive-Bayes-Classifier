While Kmart might be in some twine now, I truly believe they will fully recover surpassing Wal-Mart and Target. While their stores are possibly cramped and dark, I think their selection in some departments surpasses and exceptionally stomps competitors. Their products carry great warranties and service, and most of their merchandise is of the highest quality. Sales staff seem very polite and know their job. People giving sales staff bad ratings, should realize that certain asscoaites may not know the sales floor in specific, and therefore may not be able to help them accurately. But in most stores, their are CALL BOXES that you push a button and a sales associate will help you. I LOVE THEIR PRICES, SELECTION, AND SERVICE! I give them 5 stars! Stomp Wal-Mart, KMART! ONLY IN THE K! (this replaces Right here. Right now.)
