Basically a decent man who was blinded, I believe, by his own political ambitions. Not rocket science here people. Many lies and backdoor deals occured under Reagans administration. And I believe he compromised his integrity, as well as the well-being of his adoring constituents by giving in to the driving forces behind these acts. The Neo-Cons were pulling the strings here, anyone who denies that is only fooling themselves, and cannot be convinced otherwise. That's what playing Follow the Ideological Leader gets you... Trapped into an ideological corner, boxed in a lie you cannot see or hear but is constantly being pointed out to you. Snap out of it! Give credit were credit is due, learn your lessons and move forward, taking with you, to be your guide, not rigid ideology, but absolute truth.
