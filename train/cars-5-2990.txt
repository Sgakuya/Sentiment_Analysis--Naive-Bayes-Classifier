Jelly bean is somewhat appropriate but my Canadian version of Si (the EX in the US) is only 127hp sohc but kicks ass on most crap on the road. After enjoying the reliability and fine engineering of this machine for 3 years now, I can never go back to the American stuff I used to own. I hate to say that really, but jeez... 20 years of paying and fixing my American cars has made me bitter. Not all are bad but this little Honda '03 Civic Si (Canada) has truly impressed me. I can't wait for the 2.0L Si 2006 (which will be the same as the US Si... but that's another issue... so dumb... why did they go with the Euro SiG in Canada but sales slumped and so I think they dumped it, yayyy! that was very jellybean-like). The newest 06 tuned up will be nasty and, may I say.... RELIABLE!!
