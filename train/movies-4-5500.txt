While clearly well-directed, I liked this movie primarily for it's first half, as it reflects the well-honored classic tradition of a timeless, suspense-filled thriller. In particular, I enjoyed seeing early film footage of downtown Tucson, as well as the protagonist's getaway shenanigans as she flees her hometown, as it breeds an spiraling aura of fear, distrust and tension. However, IMO the second half is not only a bit too creepy for me, but the character is also quite unrealistic. I like films in part for their general plausibility - as if I am really there and it is actually happening - so this one scored low on points for me from midway on. Four stars.
