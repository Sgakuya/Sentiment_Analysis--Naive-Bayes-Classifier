This is one of my favorite places on earth -- the best time to go is early in the morning when before all the 'stupid' people show up. Make all the rounds to the outdoor enclosures to see all the animals either just waking up & active -- many times in the middle of feeding. Sometimes the keepers will show you how to feed them and etc. Then when you finish the outdoors, go back the same way you came by visiting all the indoor 'houses' just as they open up at ten am. By the time you finish, you'll have beaten all the stupid people and whining children, with no lines to the bathroom, AND just before the zoo becomes filthy from the visitors through out the day. Even though there are areas to be improved, it's still just a pleasant place to visit and enjoy and one of the few zoos left in the country that is free of charge to visit. Parking is pretty cheap too, and it has a Metro that pretty much drops off at the front door.
