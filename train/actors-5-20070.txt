ok let me cool down here for a minute. Ya I just finished reading IMetGillyA's comment and uhh.. i need a new keyboard now. K ive been loveing her and her work ever since she started on X-files like 9 years ago. And I still have not got a chance to see her in person and now I probably never will get a chance. So u see when some one all busts with ya i met her like 6 times and she like knows me I all like beat my keyboard and stabbed my computer a couple times. That is totally not cool. zfgfzdfgi sorry im still twitchin over here. But n e wayz i guess it was my fault for not goin to the X-files convention when it was here in Vancouver, but it wasint my fault i tell ya i was uninformed and it was to late when i was informed of this event. Well now id have to say that I totally admire Rachel and Elice (IMetGillyA) they met the only woman that I dreamed of meeting.
