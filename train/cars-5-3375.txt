I have a 94 jeep Wrangler. I drive it everyday and it is very fun to drive. You feel everybump in the road. and it gets 16 mpg on the high way and 14 in the city. 4 wheel drive works like a charm up here in alaska. You can get so many assecories for jeep and what not. I just bought a 3'' lift kit and big tires. its fast and gets up to speed quick. I haven't rolled it yet doing high speed manuovers i think all that crap is BS. I have a hard top on it right now. Its still very noisy but i just turn the music up. It only has about 94 thousand miles i bought it when it had 90 thousand. no problems yet with it. its a 6 cylender 4.0 liter automatic. my buddy's call it the Joop cause the last owner must of hammered in the e's on the side to make them o's. lol that a fun feture of it. Not a lot of cargo room but I've fit 11 people in it including me, one in the trunk 1 on the fender 2 in the back seat another on the other fender, 1 passenger one sitting on the middle console one laying across the people in the back and one sitting on the passengers lap and one laying on the floor in the back. lol, highly illegal but i was the desinated driver so. I love that you can just take the door off just buy lifting them up thats all you got to do. me and my mom drove 2 hours out to chena hot springs and back with them off. it made the trip fly by. the jeep has a short wheel base so its very hard to keep the jeep in a straight line on the road, it just takes some getting use to from your 1999 dodge durango or 98 honda accord.
