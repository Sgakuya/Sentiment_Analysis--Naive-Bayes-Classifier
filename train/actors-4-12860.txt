Now here is one scorchingly HOT Snugglebunny!!! Ms. Liu gets the whole herd a-mooing with her beautiful face, incowparable almond-shaped eyes, and one of the snuggliest lithe forms in the Biz. She is so tiny and petite, she seems almoost to be made of gossamer, or sugar. Unfortunately, she is being pressed into action-girl service, which, while its awsome to see her in tight little leather pants, just seems incowceivable. I mean, check out Charlie's Angels(a proposterously bad flick) - dew yew really expect the MooCow to believe that her tiny little form can expell enough force to knock around any full-sized man? This is not sexism, just physics: there is no way in hell anyone her size cud knock out a full grown man with 1 punch or kick, so she needs to stay away from these kinds of roles. Lucy Lui is best shown as a snuggly romantic lead - in fact, she would be best shown snuggling up to the MooCow, for a little bit of cow snugglies!! ;=8)
