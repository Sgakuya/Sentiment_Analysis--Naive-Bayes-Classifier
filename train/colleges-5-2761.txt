One of the biggest jokes in American education. Earn a degree on-line. How absurd. What do you mean??? Are you at all up to speed with technological advancement? Just so you know big Universities are also following the same educational pattern as UOP ( http://scpd.stanford.edu/scpd/default.htm) and these were some of the biggest critics of the UOP online program. Now dont get me wrong, I prefer to sit down on a class room and be able to ask questions and take notes, but thats just because Ive been conditioned to learn that way my whole life. Online education is inevitably the way most people will earn their education in the near future. In today's fast paced environment you just can't afford to loose 4 years of your life in traditional learning environments. It has been proven that professionals attending adult schools such as UOP or Standfords Professional Development program learn at a much faster pace than students attending full time and this is because us professionals are serious about learning, and we are able to immediately apply our newly acquired knowledge to the real world. Anyway, I can go on and on and on
