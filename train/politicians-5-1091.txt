I am an albanian from Kosovo, and for us Kosovo albanians and me personaly, Benyamin Netanyahu will be one of the greatest man in our recent history. We will never forget the help that was given to us by the Israeli Army and government lead by Mr. Netanyahu, during our hardest days in war in the year 1999, when nearly a million Kosova ethnic albanians were expelled from their homes to Macedonia and Albania. I had the luck to work with a team of Israeli doctors in a refugee camp in Macedonia in their Field Hospital where hundreds of refugees were treated in a terrific way, for which I`ll be greatfull for ever. Benyamin Netanyahu opened the door of Israel for more than 100 refugees, who were welcomed there personaly by Him. So he will remain for ever a friend of Albanian people in Kosova
