The only reason I give him a 2 is for winning WWII. Clearly though, he was overrated in many aspects. He was not some white knight who rode in an ended the great depression. To echo what others said, fighting the most important war of all time and winning will work wonders with a struggling economy. The expansion of the welfare state impeded the economic recovery. To be fair though, FDR also deviated from Hoover's protectionist economic policies and gravitated toward a global market, which spurred economic growth. I can't say much positive about social security; it's predicated on the notion that people aren't smart enough to handle their own finances and retirement, thus, we must create a government program coupled with the usual bureaucracy which generates a paltry 2 percent interest by retirement. Finally, I can't look past FDR placing Japanese-Americans in concentration camps during WWII. Just imagine the outrage and hysteria from the Left today if George W. Bush placed Muslims in concentration camps. Yet FDR is a hero to these very same people!
