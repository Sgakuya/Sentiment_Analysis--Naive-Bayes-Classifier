UPDATE: Thank you so much for revising your earlier statement helmut (formerly known as rupierce) I hope that this information will be taken into serious consideration by the people who produce plastic and bottled water. I won't be surprised if it isn't but hope springs eternal. I've been drinking bottled water for a long time now and don't want to go back to tap - filtered on not. Oddly, the only thing I've never liked about bottled water is the plastic. I can't imagine what the alternative would be. Hopefully they will find a way to improve the plastic bottles. ORIGINAL POST: Rupierce - you're either a dumb little kid or a total idiot. Aquafina is WATER and WATER does not cause cancer. And I hate to spoil your big scoop TriSec but it IS more than tap water. It is filtered but by a very effective method that most people would find cost prohibitive to have in their home. The technique is called reverse osmosis and it is one of the best ways to arrive at very pure, good tasting, and YES - healthy water. Aquafina is produced by the Pepsi Cola Company. Dasani is Coke's version of the exact same thing. Both are reasonably priced, great tasting and probably safer and more pure than most Spring Water.
