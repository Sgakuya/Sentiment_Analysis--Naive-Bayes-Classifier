Tonight, Jan. 1 I ordered Papa's perfect pan with sausage, pepperoni, olives onions and mushrooms as a carryout. I live about 13 miles from PJ"s and they do not deliver out that far. I have never had a problem wtth PJ pizza and it a favorite with my whole family. We pass by 3 other pizza rests. to get there. when I got home with the pizza, my husband son and I dove right in. my husband said, this pizza smells fishy and my son said it tastes funny. we checked and it was covered with anchovies. My son is deathly allergic to seafood. We all panicked so I called PJ's and told the girl what had happened and my son was bringing it back for what we had ordered and gave her my selected toppings again. Anyone can make mistakes but to make such a potential deadly mistake warrents an apology in my book. NOT TO BE HAD!!!! All the girl said was any comments are to be done online. she then replaced the pizza with one that I ASSUME baked earlier in the day. not only was it cold, it was as tough as shoeleather!!! so here is 26 more miles to drive. We decided to forget it and from now on we will get our pizza elsewhere. Jeanette Tucker Rome, ga.
