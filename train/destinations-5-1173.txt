Yo Rusty, Nice way to charactarize your people. As long as it is not America it is no good at all. Well let me tell you something. Queen Wilhelmina did not like girls and guys. I don't know where you got that story but it is total bull s hi t. Second, driving a 4x4 does not make you a tough man. And because of all the bicycles, you and your 4x4 don't have to line up in a traffic jam. And what is wrong with recovering land from water. I don't see americans doing that in the 1500's. Tulips and wooden shoes are only for the tourists like you. Legalized drugs is not for tourists like you. And there must be a reason why the country is overcrowded... (maybe people like it there?). Have fun in the US!
