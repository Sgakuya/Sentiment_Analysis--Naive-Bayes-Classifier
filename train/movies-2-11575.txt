I was dragged agaisnt my will to see this movie. I mean, I didn't want to pay $8.50 to watch a bunch of people do some seriously stupid stunts. But, admittedly, some things were pretty funny. If someone wants to do bodily harm upon himself, so long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, then heck, at least they're taking themselves out of the gene pool (with half the stuff in that movie, I think that at least half of them must be sterile by now). When it interfered with other people (I was totally disgusted by the bathroom scene with the father) or with places of business . . . that was just too much, that went way too far. This is NOT an intellectually-driven movie, if that's what you want, I don't suggest this movie. If you don't like seeing a bunch of nude men (in this case, this is NOT a good thing--they're not exceptionally attractive, and yes, you will see just about EVERYTHING), do not watch this. If crude behavior or language upsets you, REALLY do not watch this movie. And, most of all, if you've got a sensitive stomach, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! I pride myself in having a high tolerance to gore and gross stuff, but for one specific scene I seriously almost threw up on my best friend (it didn't help that we went to Taco Bell before watching this movie, either); that was a first for me, and an only occurance where I was that affected by a movie! Oh, and if you hate papercuts as much as I do, then you might not want to watch this movie. Otherwise, if you can handle it, more power to you!
