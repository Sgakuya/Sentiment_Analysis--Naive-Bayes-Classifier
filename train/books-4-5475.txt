I couldn't resist reading The Nanny Diaries, a novel about a nanny working for a dysfunctional Park Avenue family. It's an insider's look at the life of the rich and pampered living on New York's Upper East Side. Nanny, an NYU student, is hired to care for Grayer, a four-year-old boy, and also cater to the whims of Mrs. X, Grayer's snobby, aloof, shallow, insecure mother. The overall story is a sad one- a little boy bonds with his nanny because his parents view him as nothing more than a status symbol. There is quite a bit of humor (most of which is based on the unbelievable behavior of Mrs. X), though, which makes the read highly enjoyable. I've heard that the book caused quite a furor in the Park Avenue crowd because the authors worked in Manhattan as nannies and used their experiences to write the book (too funny!).
