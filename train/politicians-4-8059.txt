A Patriot! And a soldier. I put Ike up there with Clinton as far as them being EFFECTIVE Presidents. I believe that both these men were the most EFFECTIVE leaders of the 20th century...Ike oversaw what was at the time, the most robust economy our country had seen. A time of peace, prosperity and oppurtunity...just like Clinton...and that is how, you judge a President...By the numbers. The numbers of people who are working, the numbers of people who are healthy, the numbers of people who are happy, the numbers of those who are not dying in an illiegal war....and the number of those that umm, like you...Numbers...they NEVER lie... I like Ike!
