As a former exchange student from Switzerland to Orono, Me, I must say that i was a little worried about going there at the beginning. When i experienced the beautiful landscape and the lovely people there, i changed my mind... Maine is just so awesome! i loved the Acadia National Park and Baxter State Park! Mound Kathadin is one of the most beautiful mountains Ive ever been to (I know them all from Switzerland....). As to the people, they are a little slow and they do havde a funny accent (not all of them), but their hospitality couldnt be bigger.... Everyone out there, visit the most beautiful state..... the lobster state, Maine!!!
