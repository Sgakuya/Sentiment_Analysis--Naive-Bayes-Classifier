MY FAVROITE RAPPER HAS BEEN DA BRAT SENSE I WAS 4 I USE AND STILL DO.. ALLWAYS WEAR MY HAIR LIKE HERS THAT IS MY NIGGA FOR LIFE. HER SISTER YOYO HAPPENS TO BE MY COUSINS BEST FRIEND. BUT STILL I HAVE NEVER MET HER. WELL I REPECT DA BRAT BECAUSE SHE HAS ATTITUDE. CAN'T NO ONE TELL HER ANYTHING DIFFERENT. SHE HAS A HIGH LEVEL OF COFIDENCE AND DOESN'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS. WHEN SHE SPEAKS ITS STRONG AND VERY REAL SHE WILL NEVER SPIT NOTHING FAKE IT WILL ALWAYS BE THE HONEST GOD TO TRUTH. THEN SHE HAS RESPECT FOR HERSELF. SHE FEELS SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO FLOSS HER BODY ALL THE TIME, JUST TO SELL A RECORD. SHE CAME IN THUGED OUT AND STILL SOLD MILLIONS. IN ADDITION, SHE DOES HAVE BODY, NOT BEING GAY BUT THEY CAN'T SAY SHE DON'T. SHE SAID SHE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GET ON STAGE AND WORRY ABOUT A TITTY POPPING OUT OF HER SHIRT. WELL I GUESS I'M OUT. REMEMBER I WANT TO BE LIKE BRAT.
