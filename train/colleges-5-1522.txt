The people are really nice here. I got my undergrad from MSU and it's a lot of fun to go here. Unlike Southeast Michigan, MSU doesn't have that uptight Michigan attitude. It's filled with people from Illinois and the western part of Michigan. It has great programs and it is really flexible with degrees. East Lansing is specifically designed for a college atmosphere. They have the "student ghetto" for large parties, tons of bars downtown, and 3 malls within the area. There is Lake Lansing if you want to sit outside by the water on a warm-day. The city is drinking oriented -- meaning you will love it if you like to drink but if you don't like to drink don't go there. The tailgaiting for the football games is amazing -- thousands of people drinking. Lots of keg stands, girls, and fun. Great place to get a quality education, meet a lot of people, and have a good time. The negatives are that the weather is cold and the price of tuition keeps going up faster than you can believe. Beautiful campus and a lot of famous speakers come here. It's politically balanced and doesn't really lean one way or the other like many universities. It's really a fun place to spend your college years and you will not feel alienated here. This is a great school to make tons of friends and get a great education. Go Green, Go White!
