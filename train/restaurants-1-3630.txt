In fairness to them, I haven't had their pizza in 20-plus years. I had a part-time night-job back then in the wasteland that is central New Jersey (used to be referred to as "Cancer Alley"), working my way through college, and they were the only place that delivered. This was their sole "virtue." The pizza was a tasteless, gummy red paste on cardboard; the "cheese", what there was of it, had the consistency of hardened Elmer's glue. Better than not eating anything, I guess...on 2nd thought, starvation may have been preferable. Of course, it's been 20-plus years, and maybe they've improved since then, but I think not...not if that annoying, unimaginative commercial they're currently running endlessly on TV (skinny geek, enthused about crappy "pizza", with a microphone) is any indication.
