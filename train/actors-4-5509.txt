Mark Wahlberg in my opinion is a very, very talented actor who as his career progresses may eventually earn a 5 Star Rating from me. Wahlberg has never disappointed me in any of the movies that he has been in. I really didn't like Rock Star too much, but it did not have anything to do with his performance- it was good as usual. I didn't think I'd like him as the hero-type character in Planet of the Apes , but he did surprisingly well in that film. He was also good in Three Kings , The Big Hit and Biggie Nights . He also impressed me in Renaissance Man . However, his best performance in my opinion had to be as the charming, yet twisted teenager in Fear . Talk about intensity- he really plays the creepy character very well. In the final analysis, Marh Wahlberg has a very progressive career ahead of him, and I'm looking forward to the day when I can give him 5 stars.
