The extra star was for the fact that it did have a few funny moments, but on the whole, this movie was incredibly dumb. I don't expect a complex, American Beauty plotline from a Disney movie, but couldn't we at least have one that's entertaining? Sorry, but the story of a prince who gets turned into a llama just doesn't do it for me...oh yeah, and did I mention that anything with David Spade doing a vocal performance is likely going to suck? We Disneygoers got spoiled with all of the really great ones (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King, Mulan, The Little Mermaid) but this would have been a disappointment after just about anything, especially the critical rave. Take care, everyone!
