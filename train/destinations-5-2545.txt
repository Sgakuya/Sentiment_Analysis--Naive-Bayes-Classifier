10 day MAUI vacation in 2004.''My husband and I preferred the laid back atmosphere of Kihei compared to Lahaina. If there's only 2 of you--absolutely get a Jeep. You wont regret it. We drove the road to Hana where the smells alone are worth the drive! We snorkeled Molokini (and all over the south shore), saw the sunrise over Haleakala, shopped Lahaina, took in the Old Lahaina Luau, Watched whales from our lanai, Went on a deep sea fishing excursion(and dined on fresh Mahi Mahi for supper as a result), we saw Iao Valley, the black beaches on the North Shore.....I could go on and on and on....We're going back in a few short weeks and recommend visiting this island at least once in your life (and then you'll be hooked). Drink lots of water, dont forget the sunscreen and you'll be set. We stayed in a condo on the beach and ate meals at 'home' as it were. Spending $$ on food doesnt really trip my trigger. I wouldnt do it any other way. This trip can be as cheap or expensive as you make it. We did it under $5K for everything, including souveniours and film developing!
