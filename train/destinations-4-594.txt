Surprisingly, visiting Santo Domingo was one of the best decisions we made on our cruise this past year. We arrived in La Romana, only to find that no one spoke English (which I don't hold against them at all, after all, WE came there not knowing THEIR language) which was discouraging. There wasn't a lot around the port and from what we were told by the ships crew, there wasn't much to see in La Romana. We were just about to turn back and head for the pool on the boat, when another cruise ship passenger approached us, he asked if we wanted to join a tour he had negotiated with a cab driver, we said yes . It turned out the passenger spoke fluent Spanish so we basically had a translator. We ended up traveling to Santo Domingo and it was something else, all the history and culture, it was unbelievable, I've never been anywhere so historic. The impoverished people around the city took a little away from the tour, but they were very nice over all and we weren't approached as much as I thought we would be by solicitors. I would definitely go back to Santo Domingo, although I would definitely brush up on my Spanish, as this is a must if you want to get anything out of the trip.
