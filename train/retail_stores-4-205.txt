H M has great sales and the clothing I have bought has been high quality. I tend to stay with the classic styles that they offer (sweaters and cords for my kids, great little baby outfits etc..) The trendy stuff is a little too much for me but seems to do the trick for teenage girls. The store is large and bright and fairly easy to navigate, the sales people in our area are pretty nice, some seem to think they are too good to be answering customer questions (hello, it's your job). Overall, I have had good experiences. I am not an avid H M shopper, but will stop in now and again and can usually find a bargain. The only thing that I don't understand is some of the whacky styles..remember that God awful coat last year..the one that looked like your upholstered sofa from 1974 with the shag rug attached around the collar? I understand that the girls who bought this thought that they were making some sort of statement?! Look at me, how original and unique..hello, the coat is sold at a nationwide store, look around the mall..every teenage girl is wearing it. Ok, that is my only rant about H M..trying to mass produce the same funky style..which is an oxymoron in itself.
