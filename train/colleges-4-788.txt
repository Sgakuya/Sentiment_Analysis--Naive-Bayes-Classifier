I am on my second class at Capella and I am hapy with the registration process, student services, the classroom environment, and the quality of material covered. Like many traditional learners, I expected online learning to be easier. Well, it isn't. If anything I am finding it more difficult, but in a good way. The number of assignments and required discussion post realy has honed my writing skills, critical thinking, and time management skills (having a full time job, 2 kids under 3, my own business, and everyday life to contend with). I am sure it isn't for everyone. Costs are high if you just look at the per class cost, but I have no travel costs (gas prices sure drive up what you would pay driving to a campus) and I can log on and work when and where I want. For me, it is about the same cost, but I do get to complete my degree in half the time it would normally take me. Bottom line for my experience so far is: - Positive registration experience - Other learners in my class have been challenging to keep up with and are of a high caliber - Course material is current and relevant - It has worked right into my busy life after just two months to adjust. - If you don't put anything into learning, you won't get anything out...and you'll have the grades to prove it. Good luck! Michael
