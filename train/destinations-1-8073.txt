We started the 1.5 hr tour with great excitement. After hours in the children play area it was time to get on the tour. We got to Mission Control which started out alright. Upon taking our seats in the stadium seating area of mission control-this blonde crowd control girl was shouting out commands on moving to the right, keeping quiet, etc. She sounded like she meant business. As the host came out to talk to us my baby became active. He wasn't crying, but making some sounds. This blonde girl came over to me and told be to get out. As she followed me to the back she told me to go into these tiny phone booth-like rooms and shut the door. Let me tell you that this was humiliating. I am a doctor and an officer in the armed forces and am not used to being so disrespected. It is one thing to be told to leave a room, but another to be forced to go into a room that is as small as a tiny closet. Asking us to be quiet when there is nobody working in mission control is a joke to begin with. So if the staff at NASA wants to have a completely silent room full of robots than perhaps that should have been the criteria to enter this tour. But if they wanted kids to go on this tour than perhaps they should have done something completely different than what they did. I am sorry I didn't get the name of this blonde girl because I would have had her head on a platter. I was just too frustrated at the time to think about it. We asked to leave asap and they made it sound like a big deal that they had to get someone special to get us. Ofcourse they had to get the most unfriendly person who worked in NASA which made it even a more entertaining trip back.
