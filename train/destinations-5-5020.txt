I have lived in upstate New York all my life and I am very happy here. Beautiful countryside, mountains, rivers, farms, and friendly people. Upstate New York is very different than New York City. I have many people tell me they never knew there was this much to the state, and despite it's stereotypical image, it has much more to offer. I have heard it all. Yankees are always rushing, we're rude, we don't have values, we're all materialistic but I would like to point out that is an unfortunate misconception. I'm sure if they visited the state they would realize it is not true, and how it's very diverse in it's landscape. Some excellent places to visit (but not limited to) are the Adirondacks, the Catskill moutains, West Point, The Finger Lakes, New York City, Niagara falls and the Shawangunk Ridge.
