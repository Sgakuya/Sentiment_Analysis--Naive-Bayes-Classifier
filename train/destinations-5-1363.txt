A Small country with a variety of lovely scenery and its own ancient language; the home of the original Arthurian legends (at one time Welsh was the language of England and much of Scotland),later transposed by English writers.Unfairly stereotyped as industrial-the mines have gone and most of the country has always been wild and unspoilt.It does rain, (but then so does Ireland, which is another lovely Celtic country just a step away),and it's extremely green.Excellent for lovers of castles and legends.Many American presidents were of (varying degrees of)Welsh parentage.Famous names include;Lawrence of Arabia,Roald Dahl,David Lloyd George,Henry VII,Dylan Thomas,Alfred Wallace(originator of the theory of Evolution,though his richer contemporary Darwin's now got all the credit),Anthony Hopkins,Tom Jones,Bertrand Russell,Richard Burton,Catherine Zeta Jones,Owain Glyndwr,Henry V,Aneurin Bevan...Frank Lloyd Wright was proud of his Welsh parentage. Wales remains a poor country in the shadow of England,which has hampered its self-confidence-for instance there's a scarcity of striking modern architecture ,and the Housing is poor.But Snowdonia is beautiful,the Gower beaches and Pembrokeshire coastline are lovely,Mid Wales has undisturbed rolling hills amd lakes,the Wye Valley in the South East(with Tintern Abbey,praised in Wordsworth's poem)is also one of the most pleasant in Britain.The Italianate village of Portmeirion's worth visiting.The small village of Beddgelert was the home of the Rupert Bear author,and the local scenery features in the books(it also sustituted for China in the film The Inn of the Sixth Happiness). A land of magic(Merlin and dragons),and well worth a visit!
