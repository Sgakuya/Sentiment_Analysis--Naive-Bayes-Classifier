While clearly failing to live up to Kiss the Girls, Along Came a Spider nevertheless delivers as a suspenseful thriller. Freeman is as usual solid as the savvy forensic psychologist Alex Cross, who is on the trail of a man suspected of kidnapping a U.S. senator's daughter. Monica Potter, a relative newcomer bearing an uncanny resemblance to Julia Roberts, is quite impressive as the Secret Service agent who is helping Cross. The movie is quite suspenseful and exciting. The ending was quite surprising, although it seemed that the filmmakers were too intent on the shock value without ensuring that it corresponded with the plot of the film. You'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the film. Despite a few holes in the plot and the surprising but nevertheless somewhat unbelievable ending, Along Came a Spider is a decent thriller filled with loads of suspense and quite a bit of action.
