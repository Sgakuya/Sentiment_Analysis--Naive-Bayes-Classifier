I agree with PBeavr here. Schwarzenegger has little or no talent, but he was shrewd, or had a shrewd agent. Unlike Stallone, he had no pretensions of being a serious actor, and took parts that showcased the unusual (ahem) talents he did possess...namely a massive and cartoonish physique, an odd face, an exotic accent. The Terminator was a great movie (although a bit of a rip-off of Harlan Ellison's Demon With A Glass Hand) and Schwarzenegger didn't have to do anything besides look freakish and evil. He did do his share of out-and-out crap as his career progressed, but he also displayed a surprising flair for light comedy. Now he's a politician. Seems logical to me. Was it Adlai Stevenson or anti-Irish bigot Winston Churchill who said, In a Democracy, people get the kind of governement they deserve... If true, America deserves George W. and California deserves the Terminator...
