I graduated from Tech in 1974 (Class of '73, but I took a break), and found Va Tech to be a fantastic place. The town of Blacksburg is great, the setting in the Blue Ridge Mountains is incredible, the people are down to earth. Va Tech offers you the opportunity to study until you drop, or party until you puke, or both. Academics are as good or better than you'll find in any public, and many private universtities. Your university experience is what you make of it. You go to college to set yourself up for what you will spend the rest of your life doing. Va Tech will enable you to succeed in whatever field is out there. But if you want to party, there's plenty of that at any school. Va Tech is just a nicer place to do either.
