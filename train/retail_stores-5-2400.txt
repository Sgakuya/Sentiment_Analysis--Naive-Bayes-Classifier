Since their makeover, I think Farmer Jack is the best grocery chain in Michigan! A few qualites I like about them are their low prices, fresh and tender meats and seafoods, friendly and helpful service, modernized stores,great customer service and their involvement in communities where they conduct business.I would also say that Farmer Jack is the most improved grocer.Plus, with the introduction of the no frills Food Basics stores to the Detroit Area by Farmer Jack has made it a even better store in my opinion.That's why our family has exclusively start shopping only at Farmer Jack and Food Basics for our groceries and I would advise others to do the same.
