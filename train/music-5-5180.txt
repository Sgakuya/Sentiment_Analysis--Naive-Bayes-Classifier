This is one of George's better cd's of the last few years. Not that any of the others are bad, but this one has the stronger set of songs than the last most of the more recent ones. All three single releases from the cd are excellent: Run, Living and Living Well, and She'll Leave You with a Smile. Also, there are some killer songs that for some goofy reason were never released to radio: the title song The Road Less Traveled is one of the best songs he's ever recorded and I find it hard to believe MCA didn't want to release it. Also, My Life's Been Grand is a sincere remake of an old Merle Haggard song, and Merle himself said the song gave him goosebumps when he heard George's version. Another couple of songs, Stars on the Water and Don't Tell Me You're Not in Love could have easily been radio hits. Not many artists can keep putting out solid music over a span of 20-plus years, but George is one who can. And by the way, you George Strait fans need to get on here and start rating more of George's stuff. This one has been out over a year and it still hasn't been rated enough to be put on the main list!
