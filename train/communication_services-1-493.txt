I have been a Alltel customer for many years, as in I switched from GTE however many years ago that has been. Never had a complaint, customer service always helpful until yesterday. I had a Motorola V-60i with a broken antenna and no insurance, was told by customer NO-service that there was no fix and the phone had to be discarded. Seems as though this is a common problem with this phone and after searching E-Bay I found a repair kit that included the necessary tool to open case, all for less than $15.00. Now I feel that customer no-service only wanted to sell me a new phone and extend my contract. Wonder how many other consumers have been taken by this tactic? I know of at least two, the person in line in front of me and the one behind me.
