I bought my wedding band from Kay Jewlers, a men's .5 ct diamond channel set white gold band, and on the second day of my honeymoon it had what appeared to be rust on the setting of one of the diamonds after the ring had come into contact with water. When I got back, I took it to the store I bought it from and they offered to repair it, citing it 'must have been a harsh mineral in the water or high chlorine content' that caused the white gold to 'react'. After two days, I got my ring back and it looked great. However, the first day I wore it after being repaired the rust spot came back right where it had been before. I called the same salesman who sold it to me and asked for a refund, and he agreed, but not before offering to order me another ring. I turned him down and opted for the refund instead. As it turns out, this isn't the first ring I've bought from Kay that's 'rusted'. I bought a gold and diamond ring about 5 years ago, and after the first year it developed a few rust spots on the side after sitting in the box for a long period of time. I took it in and had them buff them out. That ring hasn't rusted since, but after the ordeal with my wedding band I don't plan on buying from Kay again. The quality just isn't there.
