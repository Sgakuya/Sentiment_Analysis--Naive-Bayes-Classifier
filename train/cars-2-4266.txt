Have a 2000 Chevy Venture Warner Bros. limited Edition. Bought from Bob fisher Cheverolet in Reading PA area. 52,000 miles has either cracked head gasket or intake manifold gasket. Dealer and GM both tell me they know nothing of this problem, however finding out differently, being pretty common. Would not recommend buying GM product ever again! Told basically S.O.L. its on me. Wife drives it, not hard etc... Been loyal Chevy customer for 25 yrs. same for rest of my family. Not any more!Curently family has 2 Monte Carlos, Camaro, Venture. Had Trans problem with 2001 Monte Carlo with 41,000 GM/ Chevy would not fix. Disgrace for these products. No More Chevy/GM!
