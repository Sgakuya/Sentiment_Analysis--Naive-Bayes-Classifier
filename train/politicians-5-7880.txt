Harry Truman, given the situation he took office, must be considered one of the better presidents. As other comments have noted, Truman was essentially thrust into office unprepared for the immediate challenges due to the failures of FDR (ie the latter did not keep Truman in the loop despite FDR's failing health). Nevertheless, Truman, among other accomplishments, 1) made the decision to utilize nuclear weapons against Japan, arguably saving lives and definitely shortening the war and reducing the monetary costs, 2) reacted to Soviet aggression and expansion in Europe (eg Greece, Turkey, and Korea), and 3) established the Marshall Plan (though its namesake deserves more credit). The bottom line is that Harry S. Truman (note the S was added as Truman had no middle name by birth) was a principled leader who made difficult decisions at the time those decisions had to be made. Revisionist historians need to keep that fact in mind. (I would also speculate that Truman would be considered a Neo-Conservative by contemporary standards.)
