If Bergman's towering status(in the late 50's and 60's his name was virtually synonymous with serious arthouse cinema) has slightly diminished over the years,there's no denying his immense contribution to World films.Smiles of a Summer Night is an elegant and highly enjoyable farce involving aristocrats' sexual antics.The Seventh Seal(in which a medieval knight plays chess with Death) made his name and is still one of the most popular international classics.The meditative Wild Strawberries has also had many admirers;The Magician is an underrated,fascinating drama with elements of horror;The Silence intense and enigmatic;Persona his radical masterpiece;Cries and Whispers a dramatic combination of angst and lavish colours;Fanny and Alexander unusually uplifting and magical-a fitting finale to a famous career as director(though he's continued with occasional screenplays).An imposing figure;i give only 4 stars as i've found his style and occasionally ponderous diet of doom and gloom not always to my liking.
