An almost four. If you are willing to just go along with this movie and not expect it to be serious and have fun with it, this is a cute movie. Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor star. Takes place in early 1960s. Along the lines of an old Doris Day Rock Hudson style. there are quite a bit of double meanings sexually speaking. Barbara Navak writes a book called Down With Love that encourages woman to concentrate on work and sex for fun and not love. EWan McGregor is a casanova who writes for a magazine who always has dates. This book ruins his chances for fun for the girls so he sets out to pretends he is someone else to get her to fall in love with.him.Of course this is pretty predictable with a couple surprises. a fun ovie to watch. No academy award winning writing but the actors are good. and a nice change of pace.
