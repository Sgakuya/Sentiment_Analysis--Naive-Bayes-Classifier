Croatia surprised me very much. It is a country in the Balkans that is only beginning to open up after a few years of warfare. There aren't too many American travelers here but Northern Europeans have been going there for years. Zagreb is very nice, unlike most European cities it is surprisingly unspoiled, it's how Europe was about 50 years ago. The food is great, it has a combination of Eastern European and Meditteranean influences, making it quite unique. Get out into the countryside and to the coast if you can, you won't regret it. You will see some of the nicest towns and fjord scenery in all of Europe. It has been a resort area since Roman times but it isn't as popular as it used to be once. It won't last however, big resorts are beginning to go up, so I suggest you come soon if you want to see one of the last areas of Europe to be fully developed. If you don't have time, just go to Split and Dubrovnik. Both of these cities have completely intact city walls with a medieval core overlooking the Adriatic Sea. The sight is something to behold.
