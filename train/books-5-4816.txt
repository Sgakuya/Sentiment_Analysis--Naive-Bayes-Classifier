Most of the posters on this page are sorrowful idiots who wouldn't recognize a great work of literature if it stole the TV remote control from them. Being easily bored with a work of literature is the sign of a small mind and limited acculturation, and it's obvious that these posters lack the intelligence and literary consciousness to realize what's so great about this book. I guess if you don't hit a donkey over the head with a 2x4 he's not likely to get it, and if you take bells and whistles pinball game novelty away from a retarded child, he's apt to say anything else sucks. I especially liked the moron who wrote about the Cliff Notes version of the book, saying it was a compelling and brilliant read, suggesting it was superior to the original because she got an A on a pinheaded paper she wrote for a pinheaded course at a pinheaded school somewhere. This person obviously has mashed potatoes for brains. Moby Dick is one of the most majestic and evocative novels ever written. Just its examination of the ambition and vengeance of Ahab on his futile quest mutating into evil is enough of a literary topos to keep one busy for years. The establishment of atmosphere, of mid-18th century sensibilities, is the work of a master. The amazing wealth of knowlege about the sea and whaling displayed by Melville is impressive in its own right. The undercurrent of Biblical allusion in this book anticipates the emphasis of leitmotif in the ethos of modernism, making Moby Dick perhaps the first of the fully realized, conceived and executed novels in literature. An extremely contemporary book for something that was written nearly 150 years ago. And if that guy who said he hated everything Melville ever wrote thinks Moby Dick is over his head, I have to laugh at the idea of what he'd make of Pierre or The Confidence Man.
