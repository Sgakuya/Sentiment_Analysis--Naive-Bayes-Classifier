You'll love Ohio if: (1) You love your taxes high. The tax code (like much of the state) is depression-era. If you make anything above minimum wage, prepare to pay. A lot. (2) You hate seeing the sun. To say it is cloudy here is an understatement. It's also cold 10 months out of the year. It's like living in a crawl space. With your mother-in-law. (3) You love stupid people. There are a lot of very uneducated folks here. Only a small pct have any kind of post-highschool education. A tech mecca this is not. Most people I have met spend their time thumping bibles and watching NASCAR and the Buckeyes. (4) You love the Buckeyes. You love the Buckeyes, right? What the @#@!! do you mean you don't love the Bucks, you @#$@# ##!!@#!! !!@#!$$ especially given the ultra-high gasoline taxes. And Ohioans cannot drive. They can't. They'll cut you off, hog the passing lane, run red lights, and slam on the brakes if a drop of rain falls. If it snows, they roll their SUVs over and commit suicide. (6) You love strip malls. There are more strip malls than flies on Courtney Love. (7) You love Radon gas. Radon capitol of the country here, folks. (8) You hate your job. In fact, move here and soon you won't have to worry about a job. With this state's anti-business, anti-education, high-tax climate, businesses are clamboring to get out. So do yourself a favor, make sure your tank is full and keep on going. Nothing to see here.
