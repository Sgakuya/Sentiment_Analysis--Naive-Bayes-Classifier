It helps to be in the proper frame of mind to enjoy this 1982 who'll-do-it. Directed with the refined wit of master craftsman Sidney Lumet, this isn't just something you can glide in and out of and hope to figure out; just when you think you've got the plotline handled, it blindfolds you, grabs you from behind, and wheels you into a different (yet familiar) direction that'll keep the suspense wound up for the next twist. Michael Caine is tapped-out playwright Sidney Bruhl, so desperate for another hit that he's not only willing to rob former student Christopher Reeve of his promising first draft, he's ready to convert him into fertilizer in the process. I'd love to go into further detail, but that'd undermine your chance to see some of the most dreadfully sneaky cat-and-mouse moves ever depicted in a black comedy. Pay close attention to the sets, the lingering looks, the vivacious Dyan Cannon as Caine's situation-stricken wife Myra, and Irene Worth's scene-stealing turn as flustered psychic Helga Ten Dorp. A killer thriller whose stylish comedy is matched only by its drop-dead audacity.
