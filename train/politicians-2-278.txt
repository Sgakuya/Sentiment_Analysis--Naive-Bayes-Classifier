A man who would execute his most loyal subjects (Cardinal Wosley, Thomas Cromwell), friends (Nicholas Carew, Robert Ask) his wives (Anne Boelyn and Jane Seymour) and bastardize and re-bastardize his own children (Mary and Elizabeth) when the occasion suited him. I agree with irishgit, Henry was initially a loyal servant of the pope and the pope titled him defender of the faith on him condemning Luther (the most popular anti-papist reformer), he only actually began the split with Rome when he needed money from dissolving the monastaries and a divorce from Catherine of Aragon. A man with few morals, a greedy nature and a quick temper (want to know why he so often warred with France? It was probably because the French king beat him at wrestling at the Field of the Cloth of Gold). Not a nice bloke.
