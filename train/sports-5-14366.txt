Anyone who truly knows football and follows the game of football know that Marino had the physical ability to throw the ball unlike anyone else. His quick release, his quick decision making, and his incredible velocity enabled him to compile yards, first downs, and touchdowns and turned the Dolphins into a offensive force with his presence alone. Not only that, he probably had the best pocket presence of anyone also. He could sense the rush and sidestep just at the right time. Bottom line: In his prime, i'd take this guy over anyone who has ever played. The two biggest keys to winning a ring are a proficient running game and a solid D. Marine never had a proficient running game and when he had a solid D, he was way past his prime. He's the greatest ever.
