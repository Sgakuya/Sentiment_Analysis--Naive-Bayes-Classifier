 Harriet the Spy was one of my favorite books growing up, and out of curiosity I recently re-read it. I was pleased to note that it had not lost any of its luster. The story is about a quirky 11-year-old girl who lives in Manhattan and spends most of her time spying on her neighbors and recording her thoughts in a notebook. She doesn't exactly fit in at school, and things become even more difficult after her classmates get ahold of her notebook and read what she's written about them. The story delves into lots of interesting issues that are still relevant today (the book was published in 1964), and it never feels preachy or heavy-handed. I was surprised to learn that Louise Fitzhugh (the author) also illustrated the book. I remembered every single illustration vividly, and I liked the way she captured a person's look or mood using simple black and white drawings. I highly recommend this book, especially for girls (ages 9-12).
