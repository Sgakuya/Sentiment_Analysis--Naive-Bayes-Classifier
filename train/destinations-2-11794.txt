Expensive and pretty overrated; with all the hype I genuinely expected more. This zoo certainly has a good - if somewhat deceptive - PR machine going for it, with numerous shows relating to it on the Discovery Channel especially. However, it seems to be always crowded, you cannot get very close to most of the animals and it's petting zoo is small and pathetically inadequate. The pandas are cute and all but are they really worth waiting in line 45 minutes just to see? If you have kids in particular, I reccomend a smaller, more traditional, less glitzy-style zoo - you'll save yourself a ton of money and likely have a better, more hassle-free experience.
