This President is terrible because he chooses to be. He has nothing inside driving him to overcome mediocrity. Laziness is easier! People often fault GW Bush for not being bright or well-spoken. He is not afflicted with stupidity. His problem is ignorance, willful ignorance. A saying goes, Stupidity is forever; ignorance can be fixed. Well, if this President would regularly read and think for himself instead of going out of his way to avoid reading, thinking independently and otherwise informing himself, this country wouldn't be in the sorry situation(s) we now find ourselves in. Be it foreign policy or the economy, this president has intentionally squandered his brain, the previous economic surplus and the good will of many nations. Being a genius is not a requirement for the Presidency. But willingness to take the intellect one has, and use it, is the hallmark of a leader who cares. George W. Bush does not care; he chooses not to think, and that is the saddest thing of all.
