Best truck I ever owed,2004 Tacoma.Just dumped F-I50[2000]that was a working mans nightmare they need to change slogan from 'BUILT FORD TOUGH' to 'YOU BOUGHT A FORD.....TOUGH'.Trans failure at 40k,plug blew out of cylinder head at42k,idle air control valve at 50k,DPFEA at 57k,ABS MODULE AT 61K,three different sets of rotors and out of here at 69k.I pity the fool that buys that truck.My TACO showed me the difference in quality from day one and with double the workload of former truck[I now can drive outside of public transportation service area without fear of being stranded].DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE YOU BUY A TRUCK IT COULD COST YOU THOUSANDS.
