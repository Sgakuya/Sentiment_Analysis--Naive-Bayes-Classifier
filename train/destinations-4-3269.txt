Moved to Seattle a couple of years ago from Washington D.C. What a surprise. Pretty nice place. Kind of small townish, with lots of natives complaining about everything from Californians ruining their city, the weather being too hot at 80 degrees, too cold at 45 degrees. What's good is a large influx of people moving in from all over the country and beyond. The people are pretty nice. One of the lowest crime rates of any major city. Seattle housing prices are very high with no end in sight. Largest metropolitan area with no lightrail/subway, but thankfully it's on its way. Traffic congestion is really bad if you live in the suburbs. Freeways seem so out of date for an area of 3.8 million people. Not much rainfall like people think, but can get dreary in the winter. Breathtaking natural beauty, great downtown with excellent shopping and dining. Plenty to do outdoors. Glad I came here but getting way too expensive. Probably move somewhere in the south in a few years.
