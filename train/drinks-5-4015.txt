As a loyal Bacardi rum drinker since my early 20's there was no other rum or liquor that could top it. (Of course it also helped that I am a Cuban-American and as most people should know Bacardi is originally from Cuba, not P. R.)Well I ended up marrying a Dominican woman and the first time we visited the Dominican Republic I was introduced to Barcelo rum. Man I loved it right from the start. This rum is so smooth that you can drink it straight from the bottle, without any refrigeration and it goes down smooth like a liquoer. The only problem is that it is very hard to get here in the U S. but I am sure if you get to try it you will love it too..
