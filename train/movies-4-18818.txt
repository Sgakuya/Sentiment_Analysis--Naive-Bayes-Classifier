This was definetly different. I thought the story was well thought out. I really could of done without the crotch shot of the lead actor, whoever he was, but other than that, a good effort. I think the concept of running dead was first brought to life here in this film, so cudos for that. The whole movie kept me guessing, I didn't know what to expect from the advertisement. When I went to see this movie, it was an accident, because I went to see Freddy vs. Jason and it was sold out and this was the only other horror movie on at that perticular theater. All in all, I own it, I liked it enough to watch it twice in the theater. So check it out!
