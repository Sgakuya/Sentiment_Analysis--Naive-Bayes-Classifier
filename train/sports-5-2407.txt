If you live in, around, or near Milwaukee, you will feel a sense of loyalty for the Brewers. I know I like the Brewers. Davey Lopes has done a great job with the team. This year the Brewers will be Division Title contenders. Davey Lopes is a seasoned veteran of Batting, but not necessarily Skippering. His inexperience at the position showed until the Brew Crew obtained Richie Sexson. The Crew was 2 games over .500 in his presence. Sexson adds power to the lineup, as well as Jeffrey Hammonds, aquired in an off-season trade with the Rockies. With the new ballpark Miller Park being built, fan turnout should be the highest ever. The stadium is great, very much better than County Stadium. Hopefully, the Brewers will have some memories for the over 3,000,000 fans that WILL turn out, to see.
