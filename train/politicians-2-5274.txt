I just finished watching your feature on the Florida election fiasco and have some things I would like to share. Our country is based on a constitution that Gore publicly commented on this exact senario. The question on popular vs. electoral votes and majority was asked to Gore and his comments were to follow the constitution and award the election to the electoral winner. In Florida, they have had a hard time determining a winner but by the slimest of margins Bush has won. It is ridiculous to consider a revote because of those who were not able to cast a vote on a ballot they received well before the election. For someone not to request help when dealing with one of the cornerstone rights we have as a citizen is ludicrous. It seems awfully odd that a very small portion had trouble but yet we are considering changing the rules to accomodate them. Whatever happened to majority rules?
