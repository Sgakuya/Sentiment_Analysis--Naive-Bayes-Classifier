Great driving vehicle, totally satisfied , have had no problems since purchase 4/01 and meets expectations. It has a lot of power and speed with the V6 (fast). Handling is far superior to the Explorer it replaced and still has plenty of interior room, far more then the Rav4 and C-RV I test drove. Comfortable for both front and rear passengers, with plenty of foot room. Mileage has been 19-20 city, 23-24 on highway trips. I didn't want some kind of mini suv and this isn't. You don't feel like your in some kind of little box like the other smaller suvs. I got the leather power seats and better stereo package and recommend both. Center console on the XLT is great, again lots of room.
