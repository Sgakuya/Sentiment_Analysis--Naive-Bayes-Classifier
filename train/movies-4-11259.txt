It wasn't what I expected, but it wasn't bad. I liked her stand-up on Comedy Central, and I heard this was a pretty good movie. It's got its moments (I didn't really like the beginning cartoon thing much, it was a little slow going for me), and I had a couple of really good laughs. But, please be warned that the contents are EXTREMELY graphic (lots of bi/homosexual jokes, ah, just sexual jokes in general), and a lot are racially based (she's Korean). This is DEFINATELY not for everyone, and you probably won't want your 5-year-old watching this (unless you want to answer some very embarassing questions). It's very adult-oriented, and please keep that in mind when renting. Otherwise--it was alright.
