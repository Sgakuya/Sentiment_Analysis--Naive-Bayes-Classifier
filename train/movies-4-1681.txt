overall, this movie was pretty damn good. although, having to read the subtitles distracted you from juding things like the acting and the screenplay. it had beautiful visuals and enticing fight scenes. but the love story between the two kids wasn't holding the movie together like it was apparently supposed to. instead of doing that really drawn-out flashback of their history, why couldn't they have done a flashback of chow yun-fat's history with jade fox? since that's what the story was based on. i totally appreciate the focus on the strength of the of two main women, but i think if chow yun-fat and jade-fox's characters had been developed a little more, it would've been a little more complete.
