There was an interesting discussion on the 7/18 Hardball show with Chris Matthews, in which a panel discussed whether infidelity should be cause enough for an elected official to lose their seat. The general consensus among the panel members was that infidelity, by itself, should NOT cause some one to lose their seat, but infidelity plus should. In the case of Gary Condit, there is clearly infidelity plus. By putting his career and self image over the safety of Chandra Levy, Condit has shown what he's made of. Who knows if he had anything to do with her disappearance - I am not ready to pin that on him yet. However, his shady handling of the situation to date is, and should be, enough to end his political career.
