Baltimore is a wonderful city. It has a little of everything. It's location is prime for an abundance of activities. A excellent mix of old with new, comtemporary and traditional, urban and country. It is a northern and southern city all in one, with no pretentious attitudes. Note- you must see more than the inner harbor areas to appreciate Baltimore and it's unbelievable breadth of culture. This city truly does not follow trends. It marches to the beat of a different drummer (which coincidently hurts it international appeal). If you ever visit, I know you will not find a more pleasingly strange and quirky, yet balanced city in America.
