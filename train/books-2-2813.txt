Informative as the book is, you can not feeling that this is merely a flag waving exercise in hollywood history This works with band of brothers/ citizen soldiers as they focus on american exploits. Here however all americans are seen as highly motivated super soldiers the equal of their german counterparts ( and russian)- they never could be.(apart from elite airborne/rangers) Their British counterparts are often sniped at with the occasional patronising pat on the head for good work. If you are interested in the subject I urge you to read Overlord & Armageddon by Max Hastings. If you are American you may, for once, see things from a wider perspective
