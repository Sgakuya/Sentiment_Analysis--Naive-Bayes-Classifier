Nebraska is part of the heartland of the north American continent- 'middle america' you can say those values are good or bad. The state is rated at 41 out of 50 states here for reasons that may or may not be objective. The state is not diverse- and seems rather insulated from the regions of the country that BugahaNE below says suffers from; crime, blighted cities, drugs moral decay, etc. Well all those ' bad things' are part of life- and not having them does not make a state have a high quality of life-where people desire to live. Nebraska certainly could not be called a state on the cutting edge of social change. Seems much of the culture here remains focused on thhe fear of change and 'radical ideas'.... and football. What can be stated with a fair amount of objectivity is; the majority of the nations wealth, creativity, culture, superior educational institutions, and 'most socially enlightened' people live either along the 'elitist' northeastern coast, or in the 'energy sunbronzed' landscape of the 'left coast'. Nebraska appeals to a certain kind of person- I doubt it would be appropriate for me.
