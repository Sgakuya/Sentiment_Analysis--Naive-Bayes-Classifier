Okay, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not take this the wrong way, Beatle fans - I think it's fine that you like the Beatles and they were revolutionary (no pun intended!) in rock n roll, but I just don't like this album. For some reason the songs do nothing for me and the fact that the album is so heavily related to drugs and linked to (by no fault of the Beatles themselves) the Manson murders in California makes me uneasy to listen to it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of I Will I heard that song in the movie Love Affair and it really is a sweet song. But other than that, sorry fanatics, but I just don't like the white album.
