Five stars for Black Bush; none for the white label version. THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF BUSHMILLS WHISKEY! One - Black Bush - is very good indeed. Black Bush is one of the two best Irish whiskies you can easily find in America - the other being Powers. The other Bushmills comes with a white label that merely says "Old Bushmills". It should be used only for cooking and cleaning shoe leather. Old Bushmills, which perplexingly is both widespread and popular in America, is so nasty that I haven't drunk any in years. Who knows? Maybe it's improved lately, but I'm not about to waste 30 bucks a bottle to find out. So, spring for the good stuff, or stick to Powers.
