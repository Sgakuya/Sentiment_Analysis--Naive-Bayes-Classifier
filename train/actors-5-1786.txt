Walken is the epitome of a character of what a character actor is! When he plays the creepy, bad guy- you believe he's the creepy bad guy! When he plays the frightened good guy- you believe he's the frightened good guy! The only thing that bugs me is sometimes this man plays a caricature of himself (ie the halting phrases, the stooping shoulders, etc.) but I think he's not offered enough roles that would let a talent like his break out and show us something completely different. Let's see what he could do with a leading man role in a romantic comedy. I know he could suspend our belief long enough to convince us that he could be the knight in shining armor. Here's a man who has been in the business since he was, like, five and has proven to be phenomenal but I know he hasn't shown us his best!
