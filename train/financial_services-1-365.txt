This is the worse credit card company. I had this credit at 9.99% fixed. Been a customer for a year and half. It was initially to pay off debt, so I never activated the card. Never made expenditures on it. In May, I got legitimately unemployed by the company. They gave me a good severance package, enough to last six months. I called the credit card service to ask for a lower interest rate to help me out. They could get back their principal, just in case I can't find a job at the end of my six months. I never skipped a payment for a whole year and half. I was with a customer service agent for a full 30 seconds, and without asking whether or not I was able to pay, I was sent over to the collections dept. They asked me if I would like to post a payment. It was 15 days ***before*** the payment due date!!! Wait until I am officially a deadbeat before you report me. Just because people are unemployed does not mean that they cannot pay. That would be discriminatory. Some can. All I wanted was a reduction in interest rate. That was last month. Today, I got a statement in the mail. They not only did not give me a reduction but ***raised*** it to 17.99%. I still have a good credit rating and enough collateral at my local bank. They gave me a credit card with 0% for six months and after that 7.9% fixed as well as overdraft protection. So I said good bye to Fleet.
