I have to give it a point for great special effects but this movie had problems. The two rebels who were the stars weren't 1912 people. They were kids from the 90s transported with their attitudes into 1912. Did they think they were doing Back To The Future 4? How many young ladies in 1912 do you seriously think went around flipping people off? Not only that, but it was so stereotypical. One quintessential example is when our soft-hearted hero notes, Half of the people on this ship are going to die! Then the rich guy replies, Not the better half. All that was missing was a glass of champagne in the hand of this cartoonish character. And it may have been okay for a cartoon, but we're expected to take it serioiusly! Just before I saw the movie I saw a documentary on the true story of the Titanic. What impressed me was the courage and chivalry of many of the people who went down with the ship. But the movie totally disregarded all of that in favor of a more cynical perspective. The only heroes were the two spoiled brats who were at the center of it all. Then isn't it sweet how Rose, as an old woman, has refrained from any other man for decades because of her sentimental attachment to a young rebel she had an illigitimate romp with decades earlier? I'm sorry but it's just too unbelievable to be any good.
