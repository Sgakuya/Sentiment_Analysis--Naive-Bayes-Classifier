Like almost all of Coppola's movies of the past 25 years, this one was interesting to look at, and had some great actors in it, but was ultimately empty and soulless. First off, Dracula was written as a horror story, not some half-assed romance. If I want a love story, I'll watch Romeo and Juliet or Thelma and Louise. I don't say there's anything wrong with altering a story so that it conforms more closely to the personal vision of the person making the film based on that story, but if you're going to title your work Bram Stoker's Dracula why would you eliminate 90% of what made Stoker's novel so effective in the first place? Just what the world needs...another dull, romantic Victorian soap-opera dressed up in the trappings of a vampire story (or Penny Dreadful as they might have called it in Stoker's own time). Isn't that what eventually killed the whole Hammer franchise in England, this forsaking of horror in the interests of some plotline dealing with tepid, insipid love? I liked the scenery in this movie, the atmosphere, and I love the cast (Keanu Reeves isn't a very interesting actor, but then the character of Jonathan Harker isn't all that interesting a role; let's be fair) but even the best cast can't turn a piece of chicken-s**t into chicken-salad.
