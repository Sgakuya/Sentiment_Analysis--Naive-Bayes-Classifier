I love Thai food, and I've heard many great things about Bangkok, which is Thailand's biggest city. Bangkok has an exotic mix of ancient and modern culture with beautiful canals, palaces, Buddhist temples, huge outdoor markets as well as grand shopping malls and eye-catching high-rises. Bangkok's friendly, service-oriented culture and unique allure help make it a popular Southeast Asian tourist destination. Unfortunately, the city has also gained some international notoriety because many tourists help the (illegal)prostitution business thrive, much to the embarrassment of many Thai people. As a bad joke goes, male travelers are taking the two syllables in Bangkok too literally.
