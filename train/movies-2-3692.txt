I like both DeNiro and Burns, but this movie is just plain bad. Not worth renting, not even worth watching if it happens to be on HBO. 15 Minutes tries to combine action and suspense with commentary on the overly-influential role of the media in the USA, but the movie fails in just about every category. The good guys are underdeveloped and paper-thin, the bad guys are so cartoonish they're hard to watch, the acting is below average, the jerky hand-held digital camera shots they insert throughout the movie are shamelessly overused, the plot is predictable and so far-fetched that it's hard to take seriously... Is that enough? I could go on and on. Do yourself a favor and just skip this one.
