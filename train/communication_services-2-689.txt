Let me preface this by saying that it has been over 6 months since I left the Cingular Network, and at that time they were talking about overhauling their network, so I have to allow that it plausible their coverage may have improved. During the year and a half I used themm though, I had an absolutely terrible time getting a signal. There were times I would be in a wide open area, and I would still have to find a hill and climb to the time of it just to get ONE BAR of signal, when everyone around me was milling about chat chatting away without a care in the world. I would maybe concede it could have been my phone, if it weren't for my fellow Cingular users with different phones having the same problem. For $39.95/mo I got 250 anytime minutes and unlimited nights/weekends on a regional plan (for the same price w/Verizon I am getting 400 anytime minutes and 3000 nights/weekends on the america's choice - which is basically national - plan), and I was supposed to be notified whenever I was in a roaming area, but never was. The only good thing I have to say for Cingular is that after my year was up and I went month to month, they did let me terminate w/o any hassle. :-)
