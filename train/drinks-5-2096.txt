I love Brisk Ice Tea more then beer. My problem is this. I can't seem to buy it anywhere! Can you tell me where you stock Brisk? I've tried Sobeys, and there is never any in stock. The staff are not very helpful when I've asked why the shelf is empty. The stock manager assured me he would increase his order. Today, before I spent time and gas to go to our local Sobeys, I called to ask if they had any Brisk in stock, the answer was NO. We have a brand new Great Canadian store which opened a few days ago in Chatham where I live. I drove there today, Oct.8-2005 and everything but Brisk Oce Tea was available. I've talk to store managers till I'm blue in the face! COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME FIND A STORE THAT CONTINUALLY STOCKS BRISK IN THE CHATHAM AREA? Thank you for your time.
