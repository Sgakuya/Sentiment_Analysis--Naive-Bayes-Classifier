Although not a completely original concept, 28 Days Later... is definately a thought-provoking movie. I was relieved also to find out it wasn't another Final Destination -like, teenie bopper killing fest. It is actually very intelligent and suspensful, with lots of subtlties (showing often rather then telling) with great visuals (the digital filming). However if you have a short attention span, and/or just want some cheap thrills, this movie isn't for you. This modern apocalyptic tale had me clinging to my boyfriend quite a few times, cringing with what was happen next. Afterward, my mind was happy to delve into the concepts the movie had presented-- something I think any good movie should make us do. Highly recommended!
