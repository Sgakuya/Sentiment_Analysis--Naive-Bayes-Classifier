Garbage. Over-cooked, over-produced, over-directed. The story was a trite rip-off of countless earlier Camille/La Boheme yarns that added absolutely nothing to a shopworn and tired idea. As usual, Kidman was insipid-looking and limp as an actress. Her singing was notably weak. McGregor sang remarkably well, and this was one of the few strong points of this waste of film stock. Predictable plot line adorned by cartoonish and unbelieveable characters. What was absolutely bogus and mentally retarded was the use of Elton John songs and other contemporary ditties in a fin-de-siecle Paris setting: what was supposed to be, I suppose, a post-modernist take on anachronisms fell decidely flat, a gambit that came out totally ridiculous. The only thing about this popular culture abortion that had any merit was the art direction, which was, admittedly, top-knotch. So, two stars for the stunning look of the film and McGregor's performance.
