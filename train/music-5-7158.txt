This video is no cinematic masterpiece, nor does it offer any theatrical storyline or drama. The greatness in this video lies in what you don't see, namely: Kurt, Krist and Dave. Think about it: this is the group's breakout song and video, and there's not a single closeup, preen-shot, or perfectly-lit profile of the band members in the entire cut. When you do see the band, especially Kurt, his face is covered by his rag-top hairdo. Contrast this with the typical Poison, Winger or G'n'R footage, circa early 1990s: just a bunch of girls on the runway, if you will. What you're left with is the low-fi, low-budget energy and imagery of the pep-rally from hell, backed by the audio soundtrack of one of rock and roll's greatest anthems. (Or anti-anthem, if you prefer.) With so much left to the imagination, the viewer is left wanting to see more of the band members, not less. In the end what propels this video is the backdrop of the music. But the video's 'non-featuring' of the featured artist was a most profound punk statement, a big f-you to the makeup and hairspray rock bands that Nirvana eventually drove to extinction.
