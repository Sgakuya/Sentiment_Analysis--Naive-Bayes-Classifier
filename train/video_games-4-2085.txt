This game is incredible , but not as astonishing as the Wind Waker. As a 9-year old, I clearly remember the time we rented it. It was in the year 1999, I think. Awfully confusing! Later, I (for some reason) missed it. The game itself was like one of MY beloved and invaluable friends. I felt as if I were to drink honey. Later, in the dark mists as the days grew chillier and the porchlights were dim, I almost cried uncontrollably. Beside the distant river from our house, teardrops- starting mildly, later being hysterical- fell into the rushing waters. 5 years later, The Collecters Edition came in the mail. My brother ordered it in 2004. In those 5 years, I almost forgot about it. I later played it, and besides the Wind Waker, It was the most spectacular game I'e ever played! Tears of joy replaced my worn out tears of disappointment of losing the game. Byfar, this game beats the Ocarina of Time for N64 OR the Master Quest edition everlastingly! Even so, I still made game guides, creating take-offs of both OoT and MM. This game is a timely favorite!
