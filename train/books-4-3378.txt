I recently finished this book. I read mostly commuting to and from work as well as before bed. I need to read something that is somewhat easy and light for the commute. This book was perfect. The author (David Sedaris) wrote this book about his life and it is written in first person. Sedaris knows what stories in his life to write about for his readers to understand his life. He is a good writer with a good sense of humor. The book simply goes through his life and how he got into writing. It is interesting since he didn't get into writing for a long long time eventhough he always tried so hard to be in the 'arts' but failed at all the outlets. He didn't even like to read that much. As I read this book, I didn't feel so bad that I haven't found my hidden talent yet...(whatever it may be). It is a really quick, easy, good read.
