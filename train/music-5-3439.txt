This is my favorite album of all time. Bernie's lyrics really conveyed to me what the social scene in UK was like at that time. From bulldogs, waves crashing and hoofbeats, the special effect sounds framed the songs well. Davey Johnstone played a Les Paul on some of the songs, which by far is the best sounding guitar. This is the album that put Elton over the top. The art work and lyrics printed inside the vinyl album cover were unique. A semi-remake of Candle in the Wind called Goodbye Egland's Rose recorded 20 or so years later became the largest selling single of all time. Could someone inform SmileyFace that Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is the title track of a two disc album containing many more great songs.
