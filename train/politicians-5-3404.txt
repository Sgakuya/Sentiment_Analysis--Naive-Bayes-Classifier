46 million married couples(not gays) have benefited under Bush's plan that removed the marriage tax penalty! Which was an utter crime to begin with! People were punished by getting married and doing what was right! 34 million families benefited by the child tax credit increase, which was long overdue. 35 million Americans who receive dividend income that is taxable benefit under Bush's plan. More than half of these people are senior citizens. Basically, this plan eliminates the dividends being taxed twice. Which in turn returns 20 billion dollars to the economy! The President is committed to taking good care of our military personnel. His fiscal year 2004 budget builds on pay increases of 4% or more in the last two budgets. The budget funds a range of military pay raises from 2 to 6.5% by rank and years of service. These are just a few things that I think Bush is doing well besides his standards and morals. I feel much safer with Bush in command than I ever would have with Forrest Gore and God help us all, Hanoi John!Update:I can gurantee you Bush is for the Laci Petterson bill.Update:Right on Swanoak!Update again:Chalky Studebaker I want a valid reason why you hate him.
