Here is a man who, like Ehud Barak, is a decorated soldier and one of Israel's better-known public figures. Like Barak, he is very sensitive to the needs of Israel's concerns, most notably a strong sense of security. He is a strong believer in parliamentary democracy, provided it suits Likud's and the right-wing wacko's agenda (not unlike that of the late Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein, the fanatical American-born Israeli nationalists whose dream of Eretz Yisra'el would exclude all who weren't Orthodox Israelis). Lest we forget, this is the same man who helped launch Israel's June 1982 invasion of Lebanon to eliminate the PLO and set up an Israeli buffer zone to protect Israeli settlements in southern Lebanon (they were later forcibly evacuated) and in the Golan Heights, which was never Israeli or Palestinian territory to begin with---it belonged to Syria prior to 1973. Sharon's reasons were for Israel's protection, to be sure, but to defend one's country and massacre innocent Palestinian, Druze, and Lebanese civilians in Israeli internment camps (which helped launch the intifadeh and give international credibility to the PLO) is no worse than Palestinian bombs going off in Ramallah or Hebron. War knows no good, but for a decorated veteran such as Sharon to represent his country shows little respect towards those who view the peace process to be settled with ballots rather than bullets. Sharon seems to speak for the obnoxious settlers (ironically, many of whom are American-born) who feel that wherever an Israeli sets foot, there (s)he will stay forever, often at the sacrifice of Palestinian families who are forced to leave for the semi-security of Jordan or to Israel proper. Unlike Barak, Sharon is not known for being exceptionally erudite or intellectual. His disdain for Barak's approach to the peace process and for Israeli doves in society and in the Knesset is well-known in international circles and his victory coalition only sent a hard-line message to the PLO: You had it easy, but now you answer to the fist and the gun. Talk is a waste of time! Israel must protect itself from you terrorists who still want to destroy us! The peace process will only be on our terms, and our terms only! If you don't like it, tough! Is this the sort of person the world wants to see directing the tone of the peace process? Me thinks not. If I were an Israeli, I would be embarrassed by the determination of this man who wants to keep forging the plowshare into the Uzi. Oy Vey!
