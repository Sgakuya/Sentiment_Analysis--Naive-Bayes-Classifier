Whitehall Jewelers has a fantastic trade-in policy. As long as you have your receipt and the original piece of jewelry in good condition you can trade it in and receive credit at full purchase price on any other piece of jewelry you might want to upgrade to. There are no conditions placed on the upgrade amount. The new piece of jewelry can cost as little as $1.00 more. In addition, there is no limit to the number of times you may trade in. This liberal trade in policy will always keep me coming back to Whitehall Jewelers. If there is one change I would like to see made, however, it is that Whitehall Jewelers has a perpetual one-half off sale that isn't really a sale. Just give me the real price and if you have an occasional per-cent off sale advertise it as such.
