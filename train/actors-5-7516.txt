Freddie is the hottest guy in the world!!! Raji is obsessed with him =, but I just think he is extremly hot and has a great personality. I can't believe some people (Sarah) think he is ugly (like a chipmunk) he is so hot! Freddie James Prinze Jr. is also a great actor. His nickname when he was little was pie. Isn't that adorable. I have pics of himeverywhere. Even my French teacher at school said he was cute! He was born on March 8, 1976. I think Freddie and Sarah are cute together, but Raji is aiming on marrying him!!! I love Freddie, he is s hot, I hope you think the same thing and if you dont, well poo up a flagpole!!! HAHA hee hee hee hee, I love you Freddie, I even wrote a coule of letters to you!!!
