Oh, dear me, some people don't get out of their neighborhoods very often. The fact is there are still many racists bigots in Gahgha - just like there are throughout the entire country. You don't get rid of this kind of thing by wishing it not to be so. However, attitudes have seemed to evolve over the years. This may be partly due to so many people playing musical states with their jobs causing the culture to slowly change in the south along with the accents. I personally have enjoyed spending time in Georgia - mostly in Atlanta. There were lots of beautiful tall pine trees, odd-looking red dirt, many things to do, warm weather much of the year and friendly people. Oh yes, and the last time I checked it was still considered to be in the so-called Bible Belt too - but in some of the more genuine instances I would consider that one of the pluses.
