Theres a lot more to this movie than just a group of teenagers being locked up on a Saturday at school for detention. The punishment only serves as a backdrop for what this film is truly about. In The Breakfast Club we see five high school students from different social backgrounds forced to spend time together. Through this punishment the geek(Anthony Michael-Hall), the criminal(Judd Nelson), the jock(Emilio Estevez), the high school princess(Molly Ringwald) and the recluse (Ally Sheedy) disuss their fears, stereotypes, peer pressure and gain a valuable understanding of their lives and each other and at the end of it all become better people. They went into their detention as vile and arrogant teenagers and came out as somewhat wiser adults.
