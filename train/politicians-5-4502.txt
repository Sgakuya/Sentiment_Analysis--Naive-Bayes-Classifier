MR KEYES PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHY IS THE WORD MINORITY USED TO DETERMINE IF A PERSON IS A WHATEVER AMERICAN. I FIND IT A WORD TO BE USED NOT TO END RACISM. I FIND IT A WORD TO BE USED TO DEGREGATE ANYONE PORTRAYED AS SUCH. WHY CAN'T WE REMOVE THIS WORD FROM POLITICAL AND EVERDAY USE? IS THIS WORD SOMETHING THAT JUST CAN'T BE RID OF. I KNOW AND YOU KNOW WE AS PEOPLE ARE NOT MINORITIES, OUR OPINION MAY BE OF A MINORITY ... SEE WERE IM COMING FROM. THE WORD MUST BE USED IN ITS PROPER CONTEXT! MR. KEYES, I AM AN AMERICAN AND SO ARE YOU. I GUARANTEE TO YOU THAT IF YOU WERE TO USE THIS AS A PLATFORM BASIS TO WHATEVER I KNOW YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE CANCER IN THIS HORID, RACIST, BY DESIGN, MIND YOU, WORD. MINORITY PLEASE REMOVE THIS WORD MR. KEYES AND WE WILL BACK YOU. REMOVE THIS WORD AND LET THE TRUTH BE KNOWN, THAT WE ARE ALL AMERICANS, NOT RACISTS!
