I've found that Stephen King's books always leave me feeling empty inside, like he has taken something away from me. The Long Walk is no exception. If indeed the Long Walk is supposed to be a metaphor for life, King seems to think that life is one big, painful competition. If you like a book with cheap philosophy (the philosopher of the group makes a pseudo-observation: Isn't it too bad the great truths are all such lies? ), sexist themes (the females in the story are described almost exclusively in sexual terms), and a lot of gore (Those who have read the Running Man, also, may agree with me that King, or Bachman, rather, has some sick fascination with intestines falling out of bodies), this book is for you. For the rest of you, King would like you to consider your life in terms of death as you take the 'Long Walk' of your life.
