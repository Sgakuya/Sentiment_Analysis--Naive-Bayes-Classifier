I've played Blackjack in five different continents. I've played in Macau where Hong Kong millionaires were placing 10,000 dollar bets on my spot because I was so hot (you can do that in Macau). And I've played in Djibouti, where the dealer drops the card behind the table, reaches down, and pulls up an Ace for 21(I assumed he had even more aces under there and I literally ran out of that casino). And of course, there was Panama, where a patron didn't like the fact I hit on 12 against the dealer's 2 (the correct play), busted, and allowed the dealer to kill the table; He cursed me out in Spanish (and looked like he was reaching for a knife). I've won so much money in a night that I was able to buy a $2,000 ring for my dad. And I've gotten killed so bad, I had to sleep in my car because I didn't even have money to get a motel. But blackjck is losing it's luster. First off, Texas Hold 'em is a more challinging (and profitable game). Second, the casinos have made it impossible to win with 8-deck shoes and an automatic shuffler that eliminates any possiblity of card-counting (or the players advantage of having the end of the show heavy in high-cards). I played blackjack at a reservation last week, lost 12 straight hands, and vowed never to play again (but I know I will -- That's gambling for you).
