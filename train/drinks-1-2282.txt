UPDATE TO CASTLEBEE(who is addressing me as rupierce, which was my old username): I understand that water, in and of itself, does not cancer. However, phthalates do cause cancer and they are often used to soften plastic. These chemicals were found by the 2nd place winner of this years national science fair in bottles of Aquafina. The findings suggested that either the substances were seeping into the public water supply through which the water was bottled and were somehow not removed by filtration, or was being released directly into the water from the plastic bottles.
