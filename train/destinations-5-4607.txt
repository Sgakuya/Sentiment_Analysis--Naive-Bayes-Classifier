As a previous reviewer has mentioned, a very underrated city, perhaps the most underrated in America. This is really a complete city . It has great cultural attractions like the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Pabst Theater, the Mitchell Park Conservatory and the Milwaukee Public Museum. It has great modern stadiums for basketball and hockey(the Bradley Center) and baseball (Miller Park). It has about 20 miles of lakefront. The downtown, while not immense, has some really cool looking architecture, specifically the courthouse, the library, and one of Northwestern Mutual's office buildings. For a large city ( 1.7 million in the metro area), it is quite clean and well manicured. Surprising number and variety of trees, too. Milwaukee has 4 distinct entertatinment districts (Brady St, North Ave, Downtown and Walkers Point) , all with a different flavor and vibe. The city is laid out very logically. There are nearly 15000 acres of parks /green space. And thanks to global warming, even the winters are not nearly as severe anymore. No joke. Temps in December and January routinely reach the 40's now. Politically, it is just right. Not too liberal, not too conservative. Practical for the most part. Chicago and Minneapolis get all the hype, but in my opinion, Milwaukee is the best city in the midwest.
