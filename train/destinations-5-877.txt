spain is great. it has more to offer than other european countries as far as climate, geography, and culture go. If you like mountains go north or northeast, if you like beaches go south and east. madrid and barcelona and other big cities aren't as crimminal infested as some other cities like rome or milan (most of the crimminals in spain come from the UK and eastern eu. countries). As far as polution goes, spain is heaven compared to rome or venice. and most people complain about the people which don't like americans: get used to it, it's europe, nobody there likes americans, not just spain. And I agree with RicardoDESantiago, Spain needs more popularity, for example: how many people know of Notredame cathedral in france? ALOT. Now, how many people know of Santiago de Compostela? Not many, considering it is one of the three holiest cities in the world along with rome and jerusalem, it also has one of the oldest cathedrals which serves as the tomb of St. James the apostol. Or how many know of spain as an ancient celtic land? or many other things. If you go to spain you won't be disappointed and you'll get more than you expected.
