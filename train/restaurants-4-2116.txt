Good coffee, and decent food. I don't know what people are talking about with stale donuts, all lcations either make or have them delivered fresh twice daily. The toasted bagels are good for a breakfast snack. Sandwiches are a little pricey for what you get though. The coffee is very good. It's just quality, regular coffee without all the fancy-shmancy sizes, names and flavours. People wouldn't be lined up out the door every morning if the coffee was bad. Consistant, tried and true, at a fair price. If your into the whole double-tall-non-fat-mocha-cocoa-frappa-cappa-al-pacino-latte type thing, you might not like it. If you just want a good, fresh cup o' joe then Timmy's is the place to go.
