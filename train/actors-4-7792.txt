I recently watched the movie, Nuremberg . Which had Baldwin playing the lead prosecutor for the United States in the trial against the heads of the Nazi regime. I thought that he did an excellent job in that movie, besides the stupid love interest, which he seems to always have in his movies. But I read the news articles on him, and some of the things he has said. I am very disappointed. He seems hypocritical to me. He can accept to do a role like Col. Doolittle in Pearl Harbor, and then bash our great country and out great president. I think that there are too many actors that use their exposure of the media to voice their usually unwanted opinions. I think that everyone is entitled to an opinion. Like I am entitled to mine. But if I had said those things, as he has, I would not be potraying roles of great Americans, and even hereos. He has no right. I am very disappointed in him. There are millions of people that would love to come live in our country, and then we have people like him that just bash it. I think that he should be put into a country where he has no freedoms and is prosecuted for believes, or the way he lives his life. Then he should come back and make a formal statement to the American public of apology for the way he has bad mouthed OUR country!
