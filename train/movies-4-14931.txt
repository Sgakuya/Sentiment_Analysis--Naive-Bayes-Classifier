Patriot has everything you want from a good movie..Family loyalty, action, romance, a bit of comedy thrown in every once in a while and a compelling storyline, and an amazing historical event. I really enjoyed it and my interest never waned throughout the entire three hours. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger gave remarkable performances as well as the rest of the cast. The battle scenes are pretty wild. I just can't imagine these men fighting in a open field like that. Definitely some violent parts, but come on, it's about the Revolutionary War. In my opinion, this was a great look into one family's fight as well as the fight for our Country.
