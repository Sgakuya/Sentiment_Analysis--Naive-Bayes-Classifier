Giuliani lead New York City decently and competently. The primary problem facing NYC at the beginning was the high crime rate, and despite some political opposition, he handled the problem vigorously. By the time he left office, the crime rate was down to the same level it was in the mid-1960's. Investment poured into the city which lead to higher tax revenues. Rudy made the city run like clockwork. His methods might have been too rough sometimes, but overall he left NYC in better shape. I took off a star because he didn't really address the endemic problems with education, but that's also a state issue. His strength with crisis management was exhibited during the 9/11 attacks. He's a very skilled politicians and has a very sharp mind. I don't like some of his views on foreign policy, which might be a hindrance for me voting for him one day for President, which will probably happen by 2008. Watch...But otherwise a good politician who's Presidential timber.
