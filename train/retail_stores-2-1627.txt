My parents had used the Sears credit card for years and had never been late, not even once on their payment. Well, when they had to file bankruptcy about 15 years ago, Sears called them and said that they needed to cut up their card. My mom explained to them they were not filing bankruptcy on Sears. They told them that they didn't need their kind as customers and they needed to go else were to find credit because they were not represting my parents credit from that date on. You know, there a lot of people that must file bankruptcy for various reasons. They are allowed to list whomever they wish on the filing report and I understand that that a credit company may refuse to have them as customers, but they had been customers for over 15 years. It was a bad time in my parents life, they will never shop at Sears again.
