If I could have a young, developing QB, in between Ben Roethlisberger, Eli Manning, and David Carr (we'll leave Carson Palmer out of the discussion since he's already pretty well developed), I would take Carr. Carr's failures could all be easily pointed at other people... his god awful line... a defense that leaves him in bad positions and blows his leads... so on... but he doesn't do that. He's a team player, modest, and a solid leader for such a youngster. If he had a solid o-line in front of him, he'd be a top 10 QB. If he were on a team with a killer o-line, like the Chiefs or Seahawks, he'd be a star. It's hard to be a good QB when you only have 2 seconds to release the ball before you're hit. Houston's problems aren't his baby. If they change management and coaching this offseason and get rid of him, prepare for him to kick ass elsewhere.
