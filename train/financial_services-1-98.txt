As a wells fargo employee I must agree...Wells Fargo Sucks. They dont care about their employees, they dont care about their customers. They only care about sales, referrals...and sucking the life out of customers and employees alike. I am trying HARD to find employment elsewhere, it isnt easy in the area I live. I have worked for Wells for 10 months and seen at least 23 people leave out of pure frustration. They set unrealistic sales goals for tellers and bankers. We have to harrass every customer that walks thru the door. If we dont, we are treated as naughty children. The goals they set are very high...unable to attain. We get no incentive pay if we do not reach our goal..if we do not meet our goal..we do not get a raise. We are set up for failure. I am sorry to all the customers out there who deal with sales pitch after sales pitch...we are just trying to get our paycheck and support our families. Wells is so desperate to make a dollar, they make tellers go through business deposits looking for new customers to call. Example: Joe Blows Auto Care brings in a deposit with 12 checks; the teller posts the deposit and then goes and looks at each check; he/she then has to call every person that has written a check to Joe Blows Auto Care...if that check was from another bank; the teller then goes into a sales pitch as to why customer of Joe Blow should open a wells acct. Talk about privacy issues. I suppose Im not supposed to disclose such practices. But...Im burned out and frustrated!! As for long time wells employees, the seem to become robots. The lose their personality, they become completely and totally obsessed with sales...and climbing that corporate ladder. It is scarey to watch. I just hope I can get out before that happens to me.
