On the surface, I would have given SF a 5-star rating because it has everything most people want in a city. Extensive public transportation, arts out the wazoo, tons of great food, a vast array of cultures, and plenty of entertainment. And housing is not as overpriced as many people say if you're willing to live without a garden, deck, and fireplace (most hispters aren't). What slayed me whan I lived there is how conformist everyone is in their non-conformism. You can be any way you want, so long as you're part of the clique for being that way. As a gay man, I didn't do drugs, wouldn't talk to anyone on crystal meth, refused to date men in open ralationships, and had a full-time job. That made me the antithesis of most SF gay men and they despised me for it. If you already have a circle of friends in SF, you'll be okay. Otherwise you'll get fed up with all the people who are so into it they're out of it.
