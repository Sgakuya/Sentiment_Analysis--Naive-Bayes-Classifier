McDonald's is a decent enough fast food joint. I mean, are you actually expecting gourmet cuisine for under $5? I don't think so. But I do think much of Mickey D's popularity has to do with its advertising. They have had some of the most popular commercials out there even if you hate them, you just know those little jingles stick in your head anyway! I bet I'm not the only one who remembers: Big Mac, McBLT, a quarter pounder with some cheese, Filet O'Fish, a hamburger, a cheeseburger, a Happy Meal, McNuggets, tasty golden french fries, regular or larger size, and salad, Chef or garden or a chicken salad oriental, Big Big Breakfast, Egg McMuffin, hot hotcakes sausage...ok, so I can't remember the rest but it's been at least 10 years that damn jingle is still in my head!!!!
