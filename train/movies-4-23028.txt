Highly entertaining movie. Makes you forget about the real world for a couple of hours, and that's what movies are all about. I wondered about Tobey Mcguire at first, but he did a great job. And thank God they got Willem Defoe to play the Goblin instead of, say, Nicholson or Jim Carrey. What makes me like this even more is the fact that spidey can shoot webs out of his wrists naturally instead of having those lame cartridges like in the comics and tv show. After all, he has the wall crawling capability and the spider-sense, so it just stands to reason he would naturally have a way to make his own webs. About the only thing I would have changed would be all the computer generated effects. When they are doing a building or something else inanimate, you can't really tell if it's fake or not because you aren't really looking at it all that close. But, when it's a real person they are trying to put on the screen, it's very noticeable. That may not bother a lot of people, but for me, it's a distraction, but only a small one. Overall, I would highly recommend this to kids and adults alike.
