I would give Pittsburgh five stars, if the people were nicer. Pittsburgh is a beautiful, clean city with an excellent skyline from Mount Washington and atop the Duquesne Incline. With the exception of the Hill District and parts Braddock and Wilkinsburg, Pittsburgh is a low crime rate city. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Oakland is perhaps the largest medical campus in the country. Pittsburgh is said to have more hospitals per capita than any city in America. University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University are both havens for young people, the Carnagie Mellon students are quite snobby. Pittsburgh also has excellent Italian food(I got a massive four cheese vegetarian hoagie for three dollars), especially along Carson Street. If you can dismiss the rude people, Pittsburgh is worth visiting.
