My fast food (burger) restaurant of choice. They're not too bad, for a fast food joint; they offer burgers and chicken sandwiches, as well as fried chicken! They've got a pretty tempting array of salads (I haven't yet to try 'em yet, though). The burgers tend to be a little on the dry side at most locations I've tried, but nevertheless it seems a lot better than most places. The fries still don't top a well-made McDonald's french fry, but they're not bad. The chicken sandwiches are great, second to Chik-fil-A in my opinion, and tend to be quite tender. Out of all fast-food burger places, this is the one I'd pick.
