this game is so cool!! it got tons of great cinemas, a great graphic, good idea and alot of imagination. unlike in the previous game, here the missions are very original and diffrent from each other, and you got to be creative to win them. every mission got a gimmic of it's own. in one you got to use a drak elf to snipe at the eenemy guards, in other you need to secretly infiltrate into the enemy base using hidden doors to cover your tracks, in other you need to hipnotize the enemy etc etc. the game world is great too, it's very humoristic, and very varieted. your creatures have a whole life there, and alot of cool animations, when a creature wins money in the casino, there's a party and everybody start to dance, every one has it's own bed in the lair, diffrent way of eating, diffrent way of praying, diffrent way of cheering when there's a fight at the fighting pit, and everybody gather around to watch. it's also alot of fun to posses a creature and explore the world through it's eyes. too bad that we probebly won't get to see dungeon keeper 3...
