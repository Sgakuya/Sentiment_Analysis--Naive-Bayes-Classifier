Lionel Jospin is your archetypal third-way socialist. He did some good things as Prime Minister of France, like introducing a shorter working week and offering more health insurance to the poor. Sadly, he also pursued privatization of many state companies and various other right-wing economic policies, losing support from much of the French left. He also lied about his involvement in a fringe communist organization during his youth. The French, having a fairly well-established tradition for radical politics, probably would've forgiven him for his involvement in the radical group. The fact that he lied about it did more damage to him than anything else. Ultimately, Jospin caused a fragmentation in the French left which led to a humiliating elimination of the Socialist party in the first round of the 2002 presidential elections, making the second and final round a competition between the center-right Chirac and the far-right Le Pen. Chirac's party gained control of the French parliament in an election shortly after. Not a very good showing, overall.
