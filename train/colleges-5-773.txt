I am a fifth year doctoral candidate in the Capella University School of Business. What I like about Capella is the flexibility it offers adult learners. Prior to attending Capella, I earned a masters degree from Georgetown University (as well as a bachelors degree from Temple University, and diplomas from the Command & General Staff College, the Defense Language Institute, and the College for Financial Planning), and although Georgetown enjoys the better scholastic reputation, their program requires a significant commitment in terms of travel time and scheduling. The bottom line is that my time is now too valuable to allocate to resident attendance at a traditional university. At Capella, I work with learned faculty with earned doctorates in their fields from across the nation. Capella learners interact through access to the same groupware technologies that drive information flow, team processes, and decision-making at our nation's largest corporations. My classmates include senior executives from such venerables as Intel, Boeing, Microsoft, as well as senior officers from various branches of the armed forces. For those in need, financial aid is available through various programs of the U.S. Department of Education. One of my classmates earned her masters degree from Harvard, another from Stanford. Critics of Capella are probably longing for the good old days of resident matriculation at a bricks and mortar university, while technologically enabled collaborative work environments are becoming the norm in public corporations. For this reason, many companies are contracting with Capella to provide online education for future leaders. Of course, there will always be certain outspoken critics suffering from sour grapes evidencing a personal lack of self-confidence -- these cynics will be there regardless. Capella University deserves credit for advancing their vision of what education can become into the 21st Century.
