I can't give any higher than a 4 because I've only heard the title track, and I don't know if I like the rest of it or not yet! But I just wanted to say that Drops of Jupiter is a song that will stay with me for a long time. When it first came out I loathed it. All of my friends kept telling me what a cool song it was, but somehow I just couldn't get into it - until last summer. I had one h*** of a summer in many ways, and all the while, I kind of was 'looking for myself out there' while trying to help the people close to me through our troubles.....let's save that story for another day, okay? :) But now Drops of Jupiter has become a theme song, almost an anthem for the experiences of last summer, the good and the bad. One of those defining songs for your generation, etc.'
