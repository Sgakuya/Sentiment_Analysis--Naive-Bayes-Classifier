Ah, another victim of hateful little right-wing bashing. They just don't seem to know what winning with class and grace is all about. Not all of them, of course, simply the one's who have to vent politics on a best actresses list. Seems a bit silly to me. And who said she actually has millions to dole out to what could be a very large family? Me thinks you over-estimate her pay scale. She's a very good actress. That's all that should matter here. I'm 30 and I lose weight if I don't eat four or five times a day. It's called high-metabolism...look into it. Not every thin person sticks their finger down his/her throat whenever they clear the table.
