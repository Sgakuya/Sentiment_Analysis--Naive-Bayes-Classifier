All my life I'd wanted to see the pyramids. How many buildings that we construct now will still be standing in 3 millenia? Barely any. What do we know about how the pyramids were built? Very little. We headed out of Cairo in the evening then suddenly, inbetween the modern buildings, there it was. The great pyramid. off to our right. We watched the Son et Lumiere, or sound and light, giving some history about the pyraminds. Fantastic. The next day we went back, we drove right up the them and got out the car. Looking up, in the midday sun, being able to touch these stones that were carved and put together thousands of years ago, was just awe inspiring. We went down into the second pyramid, way down and into the centre. I could hardly breath. it was really intense but well worth it. Really quite an amazing experience and whenn you consider the years, the ages, it is humbling. And raises so many more questions. Like, what will THIS generation leave behind for our descendents to be proud of 3000 years from now? Probably nothing.
