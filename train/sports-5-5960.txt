I have been a DUKE fan since I first started watching basketball, all of my life. JJ, who, appears to not be very athletic, is in fact an excellent player. His ability to come off screens, square his body, and shoot the J is phenomenal. He can take the deep trey or slash to the basket with ease, and he is almost automatic from the free throw line. Another great aspect about his game is his intese defense and ability to read the defense. I can't count the number of times he has adjusted his shot to get a better one or to dish off to a teammate. JJ is the perfect mix between aggressiveness and selflessness. Although he is not the model athlete, I believe he is an excellent ALL AMERICAN player and a true asset to the Duke Blue Devils basketball team.
