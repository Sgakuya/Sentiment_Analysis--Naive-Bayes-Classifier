Arguably the most dominating Center in the game right now, Kevin Mawae has went to the last 6 straight Pro Bowls. He is one of the biggest reasons why Curtis Martin has been so successful. He's extremely durable and tough. At the time I'm writing this he's started 172 games in a row. That's not to say he hasn't been injured during that time, which illustrates the mental and physical toughness he has. Mawae is equally proficient both in run and pass blocking, as well as he has the speed to get to linebackers when lead blocking. He's a little smaller than most Centers at just 289 lbs., but his tenacity more than makes up for it. Plus, at 6'4" he has long enough arms to help hold off defenders. Kevin Mawae is straight up one of my favorite linemen in the NFL.
