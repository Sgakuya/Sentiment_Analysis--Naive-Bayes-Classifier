You know I can not even begin to tell you how worthless this game is.Wait this isn't a game at all,it's a chat room with graphics.On a quick glance it looks to be for children.You create a cute,bipedal animal character and go around this bright and pastel little world.You have no goals,enemies to kill,quests or anything of the sort.Basically you chat to people.This is often more trouble than it is even worth.Why?This game is filled with lunatics that confuse the game with real life and will kick you out of their dreams(player created worlds)if you try to just leisurely chat instead of taking the game seriously and pretending it is reallity.These are pathetic geeks of the lowest common denominator!Now someone must have a bad,bad life if they are going to consider Furcadia reallity.You might meet a few nice people but other than that..Then you have furn. Furn is the adult section of Furcadia and the worst of the low hang out here.These are the people you see on Jerry Springer that like to dress up like animals and do weird and perverse things.The most frightening thing is some of these people seem to truly be into bestiallity! In furn and the rest of furcadia you will see things you would never want to see.Rape fantasies,snuff fantasies,pedophiles.The staff of the game knows this and they do not care.Infact I think they favor it.When I was playing I got in a huge confrontation with a bunch of idiots calling me a racist because my description showed pride in my German heritage.It turned out they got a guardian which is a sort of moderator for Furcadia.Right infront of the guardian I get death threats and one of the sick people I was fighting with saidAll women should be raped.The guardian then told me he was going to ban me.I confronted him about the death threats to me and this sick persons rape endorsement and why they weren't banned and then he simply banned me.See something wrong with this picture?Furcadia gives prefferential treatment to rapists and other such degenerate scum.These people on this game are simply the worst of the worst and the world would be a happier place if they all contracted ebola.In short do not play this game.Parents do NOT let your children play this under any circumstance!It might look cute and family oriented at a glance but it is far,far from it.
