An upbeat fluff piece, almost in the spirit of Gidget. The female leads are attractive and sing quite well. The male leads are just kind of there as far as singing goes. There are some humorous aspects to the filmincluding the male jock continuously having to pay fines and the smart guy in the group trying to find a girl he met on the internet. The Star Trek reference involving this character is quite hilarious, possibly the most amusing part of the movie. As for the musical numbers, they are more enjoyable than your typical Disney songs, and one or two are above averagebut nothing comparing to most of the selections on your local Oldies station. The cinematography is bright, which is another plus. It does slow down at times, and there are some sexual references that are surprising for a PG (G in Canada) rated movie. Overall, enjoyablebut nothing spectacular.
