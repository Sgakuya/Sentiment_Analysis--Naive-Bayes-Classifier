This movie is so harmless and good-spirited that it's hard for me to imagine someone hating it. At the same time it's hard for me to imagine someone loving it. Sure the soundtrack is great, and the movie has a warm nostalgic feel (for those of us who can remember the 70s), but Almost Famous is not deep, it's not complex, and it's not powerful. It's just a nice little movie with a good story and good acting. Kate Hudson is really cute as the band-aid (her character, like any other groupie, hates the word groupie ) who latches on to the band Stillwater and serves as a kind of touchstone for the movie's main character - a young kid (Patrick Fugit) writing a story for Rolling Stone magazine. The fact that Almost Famous is in many ways a true story (it's based on the experiences of Cameron Crowe) makes the movie even better. But keep your expectations in check - Almost Famous is good but definitely not great.
