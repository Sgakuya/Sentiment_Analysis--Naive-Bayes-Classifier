I had three Panasonic CD portable players. Two of them were 40 second anti-skip players, and the last one was a 3 second anti-skip player. the players that were 40 second didn't last as long and the 3 seond that I had owned for a whole year or so. The two 40 second one were either stolen or are now broken. The one that was 3 second I gave to my sister. If I remember properly the 3 second anti-skip CD player allowed me to play it while running to catch the bus to school, and the others had always forced me to walk very slow. What I'm doing is letting everyone know that the 40 second anti-skip players that you probably bought for $50-$85, you should take it back and get one like a 3 second anti-skip because they last longer and they're cheaper.
