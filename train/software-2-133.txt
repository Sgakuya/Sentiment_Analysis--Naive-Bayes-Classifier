I have used Quicken since the 95 edition. Each release gives a few more features, most of which I never use. I find the customer service unacceptable. It appears that their main source of revenue is to force customers to call for the most rudimentary information. The frequently asked questions cover NO program issues (bugs) that would the most likely reason for a customer inquiry. For instance, when I installed the 2002 edition I had several problems. Suddenly my credit card account would not balance on my spending reports AND my category grouping reports no longer worked. After scouring the Quicken website for several hours trying to find out if it were a know issue, I gave up and coughed up the $50.00 to help Intuit debug the program. The support rep/cashier on the line had never heard of that problem and suggested that I delete and re-create all the reports I had created for the last 7 years. It did not fix the problem, after spending a week on it I found a transaction in the credit card account was corrupting the report. The report category problem is the result of Quicken removing the grouping feature from the reports. Now I cannot get my categories placed in logical positions within my reports. In summary, for the most basic functionality the program works, however it is a little overboard for balancing a checkbook, an Excel spreadsheet would suffice. If you plan to use Quicken for any kind of investment management, stock account management in particular, FORGET IT, you will have nothing but frustration. I have waited years for enhancements to this portion of the program but to no avail. It does not handle splits, spin-offs, mergers at all. If you choose to use Quicken, good luck.
