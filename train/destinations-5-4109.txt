I went to Las Vegas last weekend for the first time as an adult, and nothing could have prepared me for the experience. I was expecting to be only mildly amused by all of the glitz and cheesy entertainment, so I was totally taken aback when I found myself loving every minute of the Las Vegas experience- especially the gambling and touring the casinos. With the help of some really nice dealers (at the Monte Carlo and the Mirage), I learned how to play blackjack and ended up spending hours at the table. Since I expected to lose money (for the price of entertainment), it came as a huge surprise to finish with more than ten times what I'd invested! (O.K., so I started with $20. It was still a thrill to win.) When I was able to pull myself away from the blackjack tables, I toured the casinos. It was incredible to see entire cities inside massive casinos like the Bellagio, the Venetian, Aladdin, and New York, New York. On my last night in Las Vegas, I saw Cirque du Soleil's Mystere, which was showing at Treasure Island. I enjoyed the acrobatics, dance, and feats of strength, but the annoying baby character who appeared throughout the show almost ruined it for me. (I recommend seeing Cirque du Soleil's O instead.) Overall, I had a fantastic time in Las Vegas, and I hope to make a return trip in the near future.
