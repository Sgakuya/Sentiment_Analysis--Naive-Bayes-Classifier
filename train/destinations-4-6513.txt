If anyone who thinks Texas thinks of Bush only, then they are a redneck fool, not the people who actually live and have lived here, that know that it's only Bush's homeland and Texas is MUCH MUCH more than BUSH.I am sorry but if you are going to start pointing at crime rate and what politician comes from here and pollution, then it's pretty much evened out with every other state in the union. I have a hard time getting used to restaurants that stop serving food at 7 and stores that are only open 9-5 but if you go into cities it's not so bad and I like living out in the texas country side where me and my dog and my kids can do whatever we like without worrying about disturbing the neighbors with my loud rock n roll or what have you.
