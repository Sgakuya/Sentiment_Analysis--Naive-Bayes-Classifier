I think that enough is enough,its about time that Gore and lieberman think about what's right for the country instead of what's right for them.How many recounts do they want(I know, until it comes out that they won no matter what it does to our country)Leiberman said yesterday that whats this going to do to our children not seeing the votes counted correctly well I say they been counted correctly at least 3 times(Bush Won,GIVE IT UP)what is going to do to the children seeing that we can bend the law any way nessessary to get what we want.The counting board had a deadline made by the supreme and they missed it,so what, go ahead and bend the law to accommidate Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.JUST GIVE IT UP and quit with at least small amount of dignity.
