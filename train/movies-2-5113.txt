The should have called it, Oy, Robot. These Robots should be Terminated. I found these awful automatons to be incredibly boring. I needed a robot just to prod me awake every 10 minutes. Where do you want me to start: The stupid and predictable Rockeyesque story, the lamest cliches, the stale jokes, the so-so animation. What really took the cake was Robin Williams incessant schtick, which was about as annoying as the schtickiest of Borscht Belt comedians (He reminded me of the movie Heatbeeps from years ago where there was a robot named Catskill). I don't know, maybe I'm just tired of these computer animation movies. I had seen Shark Tale the day before Robots and thought that stunk too. Maybe the whole genre of Robot movies (A.I., Bicentennial Man, and I Robot) is just too mechanized for my tastes (I did love Terminator). You are a stinko Mr. Roboto.
