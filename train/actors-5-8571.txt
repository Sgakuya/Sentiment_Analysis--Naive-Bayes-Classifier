Those engaging eyes were the first thing that set Natalie Wood apart from all other actresses for me. When I first saw her in West Side Story I knew that Natalie was special. She held so much compassion in her eyes that I knew immediately she had a story to tell. I found 'Natalie Wood' the actress to be brilliant and a delight to watch on screen, but 'Natasha' the person to be a truly remarkable yet helpless figure. When I see great talent I'm always eager to know more about them personally. After reading and watching biographies and learning more and more about 'Natasha' I learned that her surroundings controlled her. Deep down she was yearning to be herself, whomever that was. At times her 'Natalie Wood' persona overpowered her inner self, but throughout Natalie's life she became more aware of who she was. I believe that Natalie was a generous person with whom one would have been honored to be in her presence. Unfortunately, her presence is no longer with us and that deeply saddens me. She had so much life left to live and so much more to accomplish, but hopefully now she is at peace. I will always remember 'Natasha' and think of her fondly. May she rest in peace.
