Can't give a 'terrible' because I watched it to completion, and I don't finish terrible movies. However, it did make me mad thinking about what p*ssies Americans have become. Some people don't care about their health - that is NOBODY'S business. If you don't like it, don't eat it. Personally, the flick just made me hungry. I'm not uninformed, brainwashed by ads, etc. McDonalds taste good, my kid liked Janet Jackson's t%tty, I'm well read and intelligent enough to listen to Eminem without killing my wife, and I smoke tobacco just like people have for centuries. Lay off! IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT- DONT F%CKING EAT IT. What I do is nobody's business. And yes, I'm going to hell, Christians - have fun in heaven with all the boring people. I'll say hello to Hendrix and Hemingway for ya.
