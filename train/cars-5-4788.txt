I bought my '01 Edge in September of 2001 from All-American Ford in N.C. This is one clean looking truck that does get attention. Price was darn good for what I received, 14,000 if I can remember correctly. If I could complain just a little I would say that the seats are a little unsupportive, but it's not a big problem. Oh! It's got a 3.0 with an automatic transmission and 40000 miles. The ranger in any level is a fairly trustworthy truck. If I could, let me add to this report some more. The day after I typed the above report I broke the handle on my tailgate. What I forgot to mention was that about a year after I bought my truck I started noticing the tailgate was getting harder to open. Looking at my truck from the back on a flat surface you could tell that the bed of the truck was higher on one side than the other putting the tailgate in a bind. well it finally put to much of a strain on the handle and it snapped. I'll keep everybody updated on weather I can get satisfaction out of our local small town dealer.
