ALOT OF THE MANSON YOUTH RULING THE ROCK WORLD THESE DAYS( ANNONYMOUS )REALLY DO HATE ALICE BECAUSE HE DEFUSES THE ORIGINAL FRESHNESS IN MARY'S VISIONS. HAVING SAID THAT,AT MY FIRST LISTEN COLD MACHINES SEEMS HAUNTINGLY LIKE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE OF THE MANSON CATALOG.BUT I HAVE GROWN TO BELIEVE THAT THE RIFF RESEMBLANCE IS INTENTINAL AND LYRICALLY DIRECTED TO MANSON FOLLOWERS. ALICE COOPER HAS NO TWO ALBUMS ALIKE.SOME I LOVE AND SOME I WILL HAVE TO DUST OFF BEFORE I PUT THEM BACK INTO MY ROTATION.THIS ONE I CAN'T TAKE OUT OF SLOT 4 OF MY 5 DISC CHANGER.ALICE(ONCE AGAIN)RE-INVENTS HIS BEING WITH THE STYLE OF THE DAY,WITH A FORCE WE(THE DIE-HARDS...Y'KNOW WHO YOU ARE!)HAVEN'T TASTED SINCE THE LIKES OF RAISE YOUR FIST AND YELL WHICH,UNTIL NOW,I LABLED ALICE AT HIS HEAVIEST.THANX FOR STAYING ALICE,ALICE!
