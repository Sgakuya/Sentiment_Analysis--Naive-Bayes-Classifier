Many believe that Bill Clinton brought us out of a recession. But that myth has long been debunked. The recession ended in March 1991, before Clinton even announced his run for the presidency. Furthermore, most of the bills that became law under the Clinton Admistration were the ideas of the REPUBLICAN congress! So by the looks of it, Clinton got it pretty easy, he got credit for ending a recession that didn't exsist and got re-elected on the basis of all the laws he passed, which most of them weren't even his idea. But NO, Clinton decided to have some fun and gave no regard to his title as president and decided on having an affair with an intern. He disgraced this nation and destroyed its reputation.
