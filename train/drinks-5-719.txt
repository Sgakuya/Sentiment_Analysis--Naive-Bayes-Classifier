This is the best stout I have ever had in my life. The sweetness of this stout brings me back again and again. The ingredients are perfect for my palate, it;s like chocolate milk in a bottle. This is my dessert stout. I have even poured in on vanilla ice cream and was able to drink the residue. Yeah, I know, it sounds nasty, but they went well together. Some reviewers have stated this is bitter stuff. Are you kidding me?? The stout must have went bad on you. This is desribed as a milk stout, which has tons of lactose. No way should this be bitter. Bottom line is that it is a sweet stout, and I prefer it as a digestif.
