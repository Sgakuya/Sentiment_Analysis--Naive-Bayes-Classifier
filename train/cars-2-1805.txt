I have a 98 SE Contour. It started off great, but I've had a lot of trouble with the electrical system (bad on 98's, better on 99 and up) some structural integrity problems, and a lot of recalls. It's a well-desgigned car that was executed badly. I have to say the ride is superior, and the ergonomics are very good. Ford wondered why they didn't sell a lot more. I'd say because of lousy follow-through. I had 2 Escorts before this that we 1/1984 very good, 2/1991 Excellent. This was a let-down, and I don't see much hope considering the current Taurus and the re-call fest that is Focus (again- a better idea with sloppy craftsmanship. (my folks have one). I'm looking for an Accord or Mazda 6 in a year's time- if my transmission will just hold out that long. You'll excuse me- I have to replace the ($$$) oxygen flow sensor this week.
