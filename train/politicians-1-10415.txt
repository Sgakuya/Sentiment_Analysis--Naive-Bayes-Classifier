The only things he has accomplished is breaking down the US' economics and starting wars. He thinks that the USA is almighty and all the other countries should bow before him. He doesn't accept the fact that different people have different opinions: Has he never heard of democracy? Disliking the way a state is ruled/disliking the americans is not terrorism unless you do something illegal about it. Then there's abortion. How can he be so stupid that he wants to make it illegal? The result of that would be that the whole thing would move underground and there would be more deaths. I sincerely hope that the next president will be better.
