I have lived in Mass my whole life, that being said I have traveled all over the country as well, places that are worth discussing like California and Arizona. Those are the states of real beauty in my opinion, Not Mass,or Massahole as my husband I and like to refer to it as. We are planning to move west soon and looking forward to it. I am proud not to have an accent, growing up in one of the few normal towns in Mass, I CAN actually move and not be ridiculed. I have never felt as though I have fit in here. I actually like wearing makeup and having my hair done, the same things that are frowned upon by women here. Most dont even clean themselves up to go out on the town, something I have never understood. I think that New Englanders are so defensive because deep down in their hearts they realize this place is miserable. There are no jobs, the houses even the most expensive, are dumps, most importantly there is NOTHING TO DO! Sometimes I wonder If I am the only person (other then my husband) that feels this way. Unless you have been to other states you are fooled into thinking there is anything going on here. Let me tell you, in California, there are beautiful shops outdoor dining and loads of other entertainment and housing is no more expensive. Plus you do not have to deal with such extremes here. Extreme cold, extreme accents, extreme costs, extreme rudeness, extreme nightmares.... GOOD BYE MASSACHUSETTS.... HELLO CIVILIZATION!!!!
