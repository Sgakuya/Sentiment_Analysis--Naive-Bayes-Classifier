Rhode Island deserves to be rated numer 9 on this list- Momey magazine voted Providence as the best place to live in the northeast 2 years back. Its a wonderful city that has been totally rebuilt. The downtown is pedestrian friendly, there is a great historic district that has been preserved and restored. Brown Univ. is an iconic place to visit in the city center. Great places to eat or have a martini. Culture abounds. The rest of the state has great places like Newport and Watch Hill along with clean sparkling beaches and ocean views that are cooling to the mind. Small in size- big in stature- has more going for it then states 30 times its size.
