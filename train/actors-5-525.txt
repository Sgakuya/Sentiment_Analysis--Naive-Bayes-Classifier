Best All Time. Everyone focuses on the Godfather, which was one of greatest characters ever portrayed onscreen, but just observe his other work. In Streetcar he embodies a character that will be read in high school and college literature courses forever with perfect accuracy, in On the Waterfront he creates an iconic being that could be replaced by no other actor now, then, or ever, the list of examples would be too long to elaborate on, but, Viva Zapata, Young Lions, Julius Caeser, Wild One, Guys and Dolls, Sayonara, Last Tango in Paris, APOCALYPSE NOW for crying out loud. Even if you don't like some of the films listed, they show an incredible amount of diversity and talent. And to those who say he hasn't done anything in the recent past to credit his talent: he has made numerous movies in the last ten years (Don Juan Demarco, Score, Island of Dr. Moreau, The Brave) and even if they were subpar for Brando, when is the next Jimmy Stewart movie coming out?
