I think that Sarah Jessica has everything required to be in show buisness; brains, BEAUTY (contrary to what some of you are saying), and good stands on SOME political issues. She has been getting alot of slack for a comment she made about President Elect Bush possibly cutting welfare, and most of you are all saying things like 'why doesn't she support her own family?' and (my personal favorite 'hey Sarah, how about one less Mercedes.'. What you people aren't taking into concideration is that her family might not want to put their daughter, cousin, sister, etc. in the position of having to provide for everyone. Someone commented about Uncle Sam's motto of supporting your family, and how she was un-American, but isn't America about being able to support ourselves, and be able to live with the wages that we are able to provide? I will probably get slack on this too, but I think I am right. Grant
