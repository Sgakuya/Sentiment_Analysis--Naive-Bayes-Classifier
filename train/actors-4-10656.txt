I have always been happy to see Minnie Driver in films ever since 'Circle of Friends'. She has a charm that would make me want to hang out with her. I love her square jawline and all that curly hair. And she's awesome when it comes to accents! Remember the Jamaican accent in 'Gross Point Blank'- Ya can't com in! ? That made me laugh every time I thought of it! It was such a shame that she got caught up in the whole 'Matt Damon dumps Minnie Driver and wins an Oscar!' thing. But that's just another example of the media going to the lengths to destroy a person's ego! If anything good could come out of that, I hope Minnie gained the strength enough to be mighty and continues to give us wonderful performances!
