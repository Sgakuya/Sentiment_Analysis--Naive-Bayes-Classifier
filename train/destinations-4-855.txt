I guess DickDirk would have us believe that Canada is a proud country of grunting beer guzzlers (::burp::), who can out drink Americans (oh boy!) and have some kind of strange paranoia that the U.S. wants to attack them (boo!). Well, even though several people claiming to be Canadian have posted disparaging remarks about my own country, and have, at times, been known to be rude visitors here I am willing to give Canada the benefit of the doubt and not hold Dick s remarks against his entire country. After all we too have our share of drunks and mental patients. The fact is, as a place to visit, Canada has a lot of diversity in scenery, culture and people. I really enjoyed seeing the pristine beauty of British Columbia and Sault Saint Marie several years ago and would love to see Montreal (a place my mother and father really enjoyed) and the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. Apparently many Canadians do manage to overcome this alleged national fear and revulsion of the U.S. because I ve known several who live in Florida all winter long and work with two (very nice) women who have chosen to live here permanently and raise their children here. Oh, yes and I ve also managed to travel to several countries other than Canada and be treated with respect even though they knew I was one of those most hideous of all creatures - an American (gasp). The trick with that I have found was to behave well, to be respectful and, in most every case, this courtesy will be returned.
