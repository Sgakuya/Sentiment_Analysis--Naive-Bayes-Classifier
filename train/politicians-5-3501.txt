I support our president. He is doing all that he can to make our country a better place. He has had to make allot of tough choices over the past couple of years and I think he has done a good job. I may not agree on everything that he has done but he has my vote in 2004. I thank him for the tax cut, it wasn't a larger amount but it's better than the democrates zero tax cut or tax hike. I like to keep my money, my family can use it. George Bushes tax cuts are going to create an upward swing in the economy it's just going to take time. I support his war effort. We all knew that it was going to be a long war. Glad this generation was not involved in WWII, Hitler would have won because we have become a bunch of wimps. We need to stick it out to the very end, no matter how long it takes. America has forever changed after 9-11-01. Anyone who does not support our troops and the US should pack their bags and get out.
