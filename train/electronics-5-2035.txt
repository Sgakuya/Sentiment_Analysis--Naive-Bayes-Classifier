It was a sad day when Sega announced they were giving up on the Dreamcast, but thankfully my smile returned when they announced they were bringing Sonic to Nintendo (Who would have imagined such a thing?). The Dreamcast was a great console, and should have easily defeated the Playstation 2, leaving Nintendo and Sega to battle it out (which is how it should be). There's a good reason why I only own Sega and Nintendo consoles. The controller is great and comfortable, and the innovative VMUs were quite nifty. The console also looked great and was quite reliable. While the discs were a bit more easily damaged than your average CD, they held over a GB of data. Great games included Sonic's first true jump into the realm of 3D, and numerous Sega games. Daytona USA, Crazy Taxi, Virtua Striker, and many others were simply great games that showed Sega's brilliance. Third party support was great, including the amazing Marvel vs. Capcom 2. While it may no longer be produced and sold, the Dream lives on for me.
