College football's top tier consists of perhaps four to six elite programs. These schools are always in the hunt for the national title. Some come and go, but the group is pretty small. Texas A M wants desperately to belong to this group, but they have been unable to put together a complete season, much less the several needed as ante. They remain a top twenty school, with a solid program and are capable of beating anybody on any given Saturday. I place them squarely in the second tier. Now the Univ. of Texas is also in this group. The biggest difference is that UT knows it, and the Aggies don't. UT will go 9-2 and say, Good year, we'll try again next year. The Aggies will go 8-3 and say, We should be pre-season #1 next year, we're going all the way..! I think that RC Slocum has taken this team as far as he can. It's time for someone else to take what he has built and try again to assault that hill.
