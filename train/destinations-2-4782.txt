Hartford, city of over 1 million, has no grocery store of movie theatre inside it. It's bizarre - life is not at all catered to residents. The vast majority of working people commute in. There are some great work opportunities in the finance or insurance industry. But once 5:00 rolls around you will find the city to be a desolate place. I know of one hip coffee shop to speak of downtown, besides Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. There is one park - Bushnell Park - which is a bright spot. However, you will find no pickup basketball courts or baseball fields. Trinity College is located within city limits, another bright spot. Cost of living is not cheap, I spent more on rent living there than San Francisco.
