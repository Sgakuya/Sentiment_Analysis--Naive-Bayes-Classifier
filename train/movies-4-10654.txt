This movie is funny as hell, but I can't rate it a five because of how many times I had to watch it to catch all the dialogue. When I first saw it I barely understood a word that was said or what was going on - mostly cause of the way it was shot. It was shot like a play, very few head shots. So an entire scene would be done with just one camera angle, thus you wouldn't be focusing on the person who's talking. As they would all spit out the dialogue pretty fast I had a rough time understading what the hell was going on in this movie. The first time I watched it I felt completely baffled. The next few times I watched I only waited for the Jay and Silent Bob scenes. Finally I was able to catch more and more dialogue and understand what it was all about. Very funny. Not the least because Jason Lee is so hilarious by himself.
