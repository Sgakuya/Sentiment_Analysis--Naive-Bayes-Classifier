I have been attending UOP for nearly two years, things apparently came to an end because the inability to handle issues in a timely manner. My financial counselor and her manager dropped the ball, when I called to speak with another manager or director they put me on hold for 25 minutes which was convenient for them because at that point it was after 5:00 pm MT. My financial counselor is a liar and her manager is a coward. Over time I have been experiencing issues with many of the faculty, their feedback (individual) came during the last week of class, they were unresponsive or they didnt know the material. I honestly have to say that UOP is in it for the money rather than the success of their students.
