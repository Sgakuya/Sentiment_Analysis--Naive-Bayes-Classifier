It takes a great Man to stand up for Godly princeables and not surcome to the preasue of the world openion. That is why Bush is hated by the people who don't want to it God's way. They are sold out to darkness and the ways of evil. Bush and his family have had High standards in their living and lifestyle. Thay are not ashamed of the Gospel and what God wants for us as a nation. They care about our children and don't sell them out to sin and corruption. They don't want babies killed from the mothers womb and give this country Hope and Dignity. Our country is divided down the middle DARK on one side and LIGHT in the middle. The truth is the Christians win either way because we put our trust in God and after all is said and done we have promise. The rest will fall by their own hand. So lets PRAY.
