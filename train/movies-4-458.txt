Not quite as good as Raiders, but a definite improvement over the overly dark Temple of Doom. There isn't the real sense of excitement or newness to it as there was in Raiders. He does have a very noble crusade in this one, finding the lost Holy Grail and recovering it before the Nazis get it. It starts out with a neat little segment where River Phoenix plays the young Indiana Jones, and it cleverly explains, among other things, how he got his scar, his fear of snakes, and how he got his famous signature hat. It was very impressive on the theatre screen when it first came out, but like so many other movies, it just doesn't have the same oomph! when you watch it on a t.v. screen.
