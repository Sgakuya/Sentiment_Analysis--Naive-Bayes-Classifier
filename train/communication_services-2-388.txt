I'll have to agree with fodesskiy and ballerbd4, customer service is rude and uncooperative. (When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told that there was no supervisor there.) I had previous Cell One service and was attempting to go back to them, but needed to get something settled from my previous acct (-something that was their error, not mine). My conversation with the customer service rep reminded me of the problems I'd had before. Needless to say, I decided not to go with them again. Now, I'm trying to find another wireless service, but it looks like they all have problems with customer service. Isn't there something we can do???
