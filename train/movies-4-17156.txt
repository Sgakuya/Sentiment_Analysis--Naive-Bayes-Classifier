I liked it. The Interpreter does a pretty good job capturing the maddening cycle of violence in many African countries - a strongman is overturned by an idealistic man of the people who brings hope, and then becomes a strongman himself. The plot is this: a UN interpreter (played by Nicole Kidman) overhears what sounds like a plot to assasinate a dictator of a fictional African nation while he speaks at the UN. Kidman turns out to be a white national from that African nation, with strong feelings of her own about the dicatator. Sean Penn is the US federal official sent in to ensure that the assasination doesn't take place. Kidman and Sean Penn are both pretty good actors and are able to make you forget about a few plot inconsistencies, and the level of detail about this fictional African country's political violence is pretty compelling. Recommended.
