Yeah, how could a team from Kansas belong anywhere in basketball? I mean, the savior of North Carolina basketball and man who made it who it is today, Dean Smith, is only from Kansas and only played at Kansas....The creator of the freakin game (James Naismith) was the first coach at Kansas, is buried in a cemetary overlooked by Frazier Hall which is on the University of Kansas campus, the street named after him runs right out infront of Allen Fieldhouse. Yep KU sucks...So does Simien, he's only averaging 20 points on 55% shooting, 11.1 rebounds a game and shooting 82% from the line....That number would be a lot higher if it weren't for his thumb injury in which a brace screwed up his touch....I believe last year he was 89% from the FT line. You're right Simien and Kansas suck.
