I've heard the Sun Studio tour can be disappointing if you get the wrong tour guide (for ref., check out the funny Sun scene in the great Jim Jarmusch film Mystery Train). Maybe I was just there on a great day, but I was blown away by this great $10, 30 min tour. For rock and roll fans, the story of an 18 year-old Elvis Presley entering through the front door, being asked by receptionist Marion Keister who do you sound like? , and responding I don't sound like nobody, is like the one about Adam Eve in the Garden of Eden. Imagine finding yourself IN the Garden of Eden. It's just staggering to walk in that door to Sun, and see the desk with the Marion Keister nameplate on it, then realize that YOU'RE RIGHT THERE where it all happened. During the tour you get a well-done audio history of Sun Records, which recorded the best work of so many unique artists, its really quite amazing. And somehow you can just FEEL the ghosts of great recordings in the room. What it must have sounded like to be with Ike Turner and Jackie Brenston knocking out Rocket 88 in 1951... or the Prisonaires recording Standing in the Rain in 1953 ... And you can just picture the scene in the summer of 1954 when Elvis, Scotty Bill stumbled into an old blues tune ( That's All Right ), playing it in a way that had just never ever been heard before. A cultural revolution was born in that room at 706 Union St (you can touch the microphone that Elvis used on those very records), and the joy and adventure in those first Elvis records is still there for anyone who cares to understand it.
