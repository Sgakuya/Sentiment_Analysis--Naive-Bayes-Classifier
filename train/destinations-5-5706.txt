I've lived in FL, GA, DC, VA, and MI, and have visited nearly every major metro area in the country, and I have to say that Minnesota is a wonderful place that hardly anyone knows much about. And that's probably why it's so nice. Not really any tourists or transients making it overcrowded and such. Yes, it's cold in the winter, but if you don't mind that--or can at least tough it out, you're wonderfully rewarded with near perfect weather several months of the year. You don't really need A/C in the summer, and spring and early fall are beautiful. The Twin Cities are indeed one of the cleanest metro areas you'll ever see. The University of Minnesota has a beautiful urban campus. There are lots of great clubs and restaurants in downtown Minneapolis, St. Paul, Uptown, and other places in the Twin Cities. And there are indeed some really beautiful people here with the Scandinavian blood prevalent in the population. The population is active, healthy, educated, and friendly. Real estate isn't outrageous. You're never far from nature. Wildlife is all over the place, even right in the Cities. Lake Superior is one of the cleanest places in the country--and the biggest freshwater lake in the world. Nowhere in the Twin Cities is more than a half-hour from the beaches on Minnetonka. Minnehaha Falls are beautiful--just 10 minutes from downtown. Most people will never move here because it's one of the coldest cities in the country. But that's fine by me. Keeps out the riff-raff. :-)
