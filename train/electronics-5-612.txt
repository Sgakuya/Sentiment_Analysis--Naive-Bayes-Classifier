This is without a doubt one of the best handsets I've ever used. The Windows Mobile 2003 SE OS is pretty fast and stable, and very easy to get used to. I've copied over some MP3s to listen to, and the sound quality through the stereo headset is great. ActiveSync works great with the USB cable but is kind of a pain with bluetooth. The screen on this phone is big and bright. The keys are kind of flat, but I've gotten used to them. Call quality is as good as all my other phones that I use with Cingular. Clicking down on the 4 way navagational buttom takes some getting used to. You can easliy push up or down when you're trying to click an item. All in all, this is a great device. Very easy to use, and should be considered by anyone before getting an MPx220 or a bulky PDA style phone. Pros: Small phone/LARGE SCREEN! Stable OS Great Battery Life Bluetooth Tri-Band Speakerphone Easy Syncing via USB Windows Media Player 10! Expandable Memory Infrared Cons: Pushing down on the Navigation key is tricky Bluetooth snyc is a pain No edge
