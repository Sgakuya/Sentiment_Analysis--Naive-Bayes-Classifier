Ah, Gwyneth, so many hate her and so many like her. After reading through the majority of comments on her, I would say most were based on someone's perception of her personality and looks. Leaving those accusations of snobbery and anorexia alone, I will just judge my rating on her acting alone. Yes, in the majority of her films, she has gotten herself into a typecasted rut- where she consistently plays independent British women with emotional baggage. I have yet to see her in a role that really causes her to work hard to step outside herself. That being said, I actually find her enjoyable in most movies. I found Shakespeare in Love pleasant and many others entertaining. I would have to say that Gwyneth possess moderate talent that I believe could get better if she extended her boundaries.
