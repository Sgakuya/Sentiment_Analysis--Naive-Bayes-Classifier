Only a liberal Socialist, or European Communist could have loved Clinton's presidency - oh wait, they did. If Clinton had been a conservative, the NOW gals would have called for his head on a platter due to sexual harrassment. Thankfully, the nation voted a Congress to keep him somewhat honest, but it didn't have the courage to convict him of the high crimes and misdemeanors he was guilty of - perjury, abuse of power, etc.... Any person who stayed on in his administration after he admitted to lying to the American public should do some serious soul searching. Hillary's 'vast right wing conspiracy' turned out to be her husband's inability to respect the office he held.
