Montreal is one of the finest cities in North America, with great restaurants, sightseeing and some of the best nightlife going. Clean, orderly, safe, affordable vacation spot. The Old City is particularly intriguing and Boulevard St. Laurent is a hoot, block after block. The French environment makes you feel like you're in another country, when going to any English-speaking Canadian city makes you feel that you're out the Midwest somewhere. Quebec City is a tad touristy, but if you go off the beaten track in the lower Old Town, you'll find it charming. Great restaurants here, too. The Quebec countryside is quite beautiful and unspolied. The people can be a bit standoffish in Quebec, but if you make an effort at being friendly, you won't have any problems here.
