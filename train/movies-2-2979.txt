Well, you see, being a lover of fine cinema, and recognizing the Silence of the Lambs as a modern masterpiece, I obviously knew from the start that Ridley Scott's Hannibal would never be able to live up to its predecessor. I did, however, decide that although I had my doubts coming into the movie, that I would critique this film as if Silence had never been made. At first, I actually grew to like the film, it was moodily paced, beautifully shot, and the anticipation of the connection between Lecter and Starling had me on an anxious edge. I also truly enjoyed the performance of Gary Oldman, the film's true guilty pleasure. He looked worse than the elephant man, and had a raspy twang that sounded like a malevolent Jimmy Stewart.His character, while as constrained as it must have been for Oldman to talk through the made up face, showed one of the films only enigmatic complexities. Quite surprisingly, and disappointingly, Hopkins and Moore's characters were lost in the works. They drag and drabble through the unimportant quirks that they both had in Silence, and it made the 130 minute running time really hit hard. Also, since the Thomas Harris novel was as bland as the development of the heroine and villian, there was truly no material to work with, and thus, no logic in the script of this inanely plot driven film. Ridley Scott, who had fifteen minutes on the A-list of directors will surely plummet, (although will make much profit), and his Gladiator success will have been in vain. Also, on a side note, if you are a devoted Silence fan, do your self a favor and avoid this film. It actually decreases one's perception of the fine original.
