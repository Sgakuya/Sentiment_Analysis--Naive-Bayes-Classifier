Look, I'm real tired of all the whining on this board about all the UoP horror stories. I am about to get a very comfortable six-figure position, in LARGE part due directly to the MSCIS degree I received from UoP. The UoP MSCIS degree was a lot of hard work, and while it validated a lot of work I had already done in the IT field, it helped me become 1)more well rounded and 2) very marketable. OK the Financial Aid folks could be more helpful, and I had one 'horrible' professor - only so because he worked us to death. But all and all, it was an experience that I would put on par with some of the best schools in the country (and I know because I graduated from one of the best), and many employers recognize the value of the degree. A diploma mill - hardly!!! It's a lot of hard work and a lot of learning.
