What can I say. Best Buy has found a niche and thus destroyed an industry. They have figured out how to destroy it's competitor's prices by hiring punk, pimple faced know-nothing kids my age to sell thousands of dollars of crap. Basically this store is only good if you know what is what and know what you already have in mind. This way you'll get a good price. Otherwise stay away. Their prices are the only thing that saved them from me giving them a 0. Customer service is the worst in the industry, and good luck trying to find someone that actually knows what their selling. It's truly a store that makes me feel dumber the longer I stay there. If you have the opportunity to go to either a Tweeter, or Circuit City do so. It's definatly worth the little extra money to get someone to help you that know about what their selling. Not the college kid looking for a extra buck working for Best Buy.
