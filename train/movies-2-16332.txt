Something that concerns me is that many people may think this movie is a completely accurate depiction of the last hours of Christ. Mel Gibson added some fictional touches like having Pontius Pilate offering Jesus a cool drink. Somehow I doubt this hard-bitten Roman governor was such a convivial host. There is also a part where Claudia, Pilate's wife, gives Mary and Mary Magdalane cloths to wipe up Jesus' blood after a particularly vicious beating. There is no proof that this happened;nor do we know if the Romans' beating of Christ was as bloody as was depicted in the movie. The Passion of the Christ is the Gospel According to Mel, and should be taken with a grain of salt.
