This extrodinary school has a huge variety of majors, many different types of students, and great opportunities in which to study, learn, and follow a successful career path. So you don't like the Greek system? Fine, it doesn't have to be a part of your life (it wasn't part of mine). I spent my entire college career at USC and found the most diverse, intellectual, and unique group of friends I could have found anywhere. Most professors are extremely helpful, and, importantly, USC offers a broad spectrum of scholarships and financial aid-- the spoiled children image is a myth. If you're the type of person who is sociable, ambitious, and interested in exploring one of the most exciting cities in the world, come to USC!
