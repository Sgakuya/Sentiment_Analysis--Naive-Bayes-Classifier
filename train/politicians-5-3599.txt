Only four stars now Mr. President. You'll need to irritate a few more left wingers before you get the complete rating. Didn't Mr Clinton run Arkansas ( squeak, squeak ) , didn't he protest against our nation during Vietman, didn't Loral pay him huge amounts of money to lift the technology ban Mr. Reagan put in place to insure our safety. And on and on and on. Just remember, think the opposite of what the media tells you my dear liberal friends. Our air is going to be fine. Arsenic is not an issue if you understand the complexity of the situation ( which of course you can't) Give our president a chance. Believe it or not I didn't think Mr Gore was all that bad, when compared to Mr. Clinton. So stop letting others tell you what to think and study these topics for yourself. Not only will you be refreshed that to discover your own opnions, but maybe you will be able to actually admit the truth about your position on socialism. Now take your milk and cookies and read up on current affairs.
