It is hard to believe that she and her sister Ashley are seventeen-year-old young women. They've both spent their entire lives on television and in movies, and they grew up before everyone's eyes! I haven't lately been able to get into their movies, but it looks to me like their parts, even as teens, are still pretty decent. Also, they seem to dress more conservatively than many of the other young actresses. Mary Kate and Ashley just may be some of the better contemporary role models for today's growing young girls. They have succeeded in coming of age without getting dirty. I think it's dreadful the way people have made fun of them... I think they are both talented and show some promise for the future. I hope their squeaky-clean image doesn't change.
