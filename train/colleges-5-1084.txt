I'm a recent Cornell grad, who has also had the experience of attending two other colleges. By far, Cornell stands out as one of the best schools in the country. People who claim that Cornell su*#s should be taken as seriously as their limited vocabulary and articulation allows. Yes, Cornell is in a small town, but many people who hate Ithaca have never taken the time to explore it. From a rich and varied background, Ithaca has developed into a sort of cultural haven in an otherwise rural area of New York. Yes, the school is challenging. This is one of the best reasons to go there... but challenging and 'cut-throat' are entirely different things. I never felt a sense of competition against other students for anything, beit grades or attention of professors. The competition I felt was with myself, striving to succeed in an environment that breeds a healthy respect for diligence and perseverence in one's studies. Yes, central New York can be incredibly cold. what can I say, deal with it. Or complain about it, but don't blame Cornell for the bad weather. The positive aspects of the school are too numerous to list here, but among them are a world class academic faculty who are active in cutting edge research, and who 9 times out of 10 have (and take) the time to help students who ask. The facilities are also cutting edge, the setting is beautiful, the people are interesting (and there are enough students that you're guarenteed to find people you like)... I can't say enough good things about the school. And as far as other Ivy's go, you will find no overt curving of grades or GPA 'padding' to make the school look good. Every 'A' that is given here is thoroughly earned. -atw23
