I am a native Texan and this moron left my state 7 billion dollars in debt with his irresponsible dealings in office and heavy handed tax cuts to corporations. His flagship voucher schools in Texas were a complete failure. He is too hawkish on this impending war with Iraq while being a total hypocrite when it comes to North Korea. We haven't even finished the job in Afghanistan or found Bin Laden. He did nothing but harm the economy in Texas and now the same is true for the whole nation. He, like his mantra 'compassionate conservatism' is a total oxymoron. I am sure that we will not have our basic freedoms provided to us in the Bill of Rights if he manages to finagle another term in office. God help us all.....
