Wendy's is one of the best restaurants in the fast food business with reason. The food is a step above any other place in freshness and variety. The chicken sandwich there is one of the best; the spicy chicken sandwich is especially tasty. The burgers are much better there than in Mickey D's, but the fries aren't. If there is a McDonald's and a Wendy's on the same street, what I do is I buy the Chicken Sandwich or burger there then I buy the fries at McDonalds. Call me crazy, that's what I like to do. Also the salads and baked potatoes are good at Wendy's. That is the nice thing about Wendy's; you can have a healthy meal there, which is unusual for a fast food joint.
