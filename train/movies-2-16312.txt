Although it was an accurate portrayal of the physical situation I don't think that it really covered the idea behind it. It's easy to show the brutality of Roman punishment and the strong hate of the High Priests towards Jesus. Gibson's main failing was in the true passion it self. There was a stong sense of Christ's suffering, but what for? Jesus died that we might live and be forgiven of our sins, but no where in the movie did I sense that. What is sad about this movie is that it seems it's only true purpose is to be a catalyst in further stirring the controversies of religion more so than moving the hearts of those who believe.
