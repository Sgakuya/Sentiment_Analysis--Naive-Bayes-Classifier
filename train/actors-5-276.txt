Charles Chaplin gave his all in pictures and he changed them forever. He opened a new door for comedians by proving that comedy could be just as good as drama. I highly recomend Charlie Chaplin films to anyone who wishes to see true entertainment and comedy. He brings you to tears in "The Kid" and fills your heart with smiles in "The Gold Rush". "City Lights" was by far his best film with the best ending in cinematic history. His last feature made in America "Limelight" which Chaplin made in his sixties is also a cinematic classic. I also recomend this film for the seen where Chaplin and Buster Keaton perform on stage together-brilliant and touching, not to mention funny. Charles Chaplin was the funniest man who ever lived, but don't take my word for it see for yourself. I also recomend: "Modern Times", and Chaplin's first talkie "The Great Dictator" a satire on Adolf Hitler. Keep in mind that this film was made when Hitler was in power and at that time the most dangerous man alive. People cheered and cried as they watched this comedic man step up to someone so evil and hatefilled. And there's rumor that Hitler may have liked the film himself. Chaplin was an artist and a Genious, if only America hadn't turned on him.
