As with anything, you can argue both sides. So, instead of fawning, I'll play detractor and rag on my all-time favorite strip for a bit. What bugged me like that irksome relative that you nevertheless love unconditionally? I think Snoopy blew up a bit too much and became too human and too marketable for my tastes. So did the other characters. Get Met - It pays (uugh!). The characters seemed to lose their defining traits in the 90's. Lucy wasn't LUCY anymore. With that said, break out your Fawcett Crests and crank up the Vince Guaraldi, Sparky was a genius and the bittersweet world he created is a great gem of American pop-culture that will never die.
