The G35 coupe is one of the most beautiful cars I've ever seen. To me it has some hints of the ferrari 360 modena for a mere 30'000(roughly). Compared to its competitors (BMW 3-series, Acura TL TYPE-S, Lexus IS300,SAAB 93 etc) the G35 litteraly takes the lead of the pack. The G35 definently wasn't a me-too kind of car for infiniti it was the car to blow all the other cars in it's class out of the water. The BMW comes in at a close second :O and for those of you who are going to say Yeah, well a Mclaren F1 is better it is, but the G35 also doesn't cost 1million$ like the Mclaren, don't get me wrong I love the Mclaren but we got to think reasonably here.
