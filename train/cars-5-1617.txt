A friend of mine had a Sentra in college, and it was an excellent vehicle. It is a good looking car, and got us where we needed to go comfortably. Also, she wasn't always up on maintaining like she should have (what college girl is?) and it never gave her a problem. Until that fateful day we were returning to our apartment from campus and an RV (winnebago..whatever, a very large, bus like vehicle about 27 times the size of that Sentra) did not realize that we were stopped at a light (with an ambulance coming through the intersection lights, sirens and all) and did not find it necessary to stop. Well, I can also attest to the seat belts in the old Sentra..the trunk of the car was nearly up my arse after being hit by that whale of a vehicle..however, the Sentra kept us safe. We were so shaken up, we even drove it home (which, BTW isn't such a swell idea when the car is scrunched up like an idle accordian)..but she saw us through. I miss that Sentra. An economical, fuel efficient, good looking and safe vehicle. You can't go wrong.
