People who hate Massachusetts obviously are morons...It's got everything..from Mountains to plains to coastline to the best foliage around..to country fairs to the Halloween capitol of the world, Salem..recently named the best place in America to live...It has bar none the best Universities and Colleges in the World..ANd it has the World Champion New England Patriots as well as the storied franchises of the Boston Red Sox, Bruins, and Celtics...It's also got Fenway Park and oh yeah without us there wouldn't be a United States..you'd all still be a British colony...and you wouldn't have Thanksgiving..Maybe people hate on Massachusetts because everything got started here..maybe some of you out there in Oakland because your A's and Raiders couldn't beat our teams...I don't know but here in Massachusetts we cling to old and blend it with the new..you cannot beat a fall day here in Massachusetts..or a beautiful winter landscape of snow...Our 4th of July celebration is copied everywhere..as is our Marathon...Mass Rules!!! Salem, Mass #1 place in America to live...
