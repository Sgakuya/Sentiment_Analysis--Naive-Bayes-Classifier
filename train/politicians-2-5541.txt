Corzine is a Senator from New Jersey; generally liberal on most issues. This guy spent about 61 million dollars to get into office four years ago. He was an investment banker with Goldman Sachs before getting into politics, he never held public office before going to the Senate. The Democrats look to him for guidance on economic matters but he knows relatively little on those types of issues. I think he won in large part because he managed to overwhelm his opponent by spending a huge amount of money. The guy who opposed him only spent about 5 million to Corzine's 61 million! His opponent had a better portfolio in government and was no doubt more suitable to represent NJ, but still lost by a narrow margin despite the monetary advantage Corzine had. I understand that it's all part of the game, but it tells you the role that money plays in politics and defining one's opponent.
