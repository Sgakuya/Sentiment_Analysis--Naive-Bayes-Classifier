My experience with Citibank is in New York City. I think this institution is purely focused on money and profit statistics and is not attentive to customers as people or the quality of service overall. To Citibank, a customer is a dollar sign. As with many large corporations, this institution goes easier on RICH PEOPLE and harder on not so rich people. I find this a shameful practice and behavior of many many corporations. You can bank practically for free meaning, fees waivers and no monthly service charge if you have over something like $10,000 in your checking account. Otherwise, poorer people are charged fees and are fined for many services. Citibank does not seem to be too unlike other large banks such as Chase or Fleet in the way they charge and treat people. They are all part of a sad system where the poorer people, the ones who really need to hand onto their dollars, pay more. I do not recommend Citibank and suggest that the consumer look into a neighborhood or smaller bank.
