I love our president. I'm happy to see the changes. it is easier to see them from outside than from within the country. I left the country for NY when the PRI won in 1994, and now I wouldn't mind going back. PRI's Madrazo is the biggest latent cancer of Mexico nowadays, and threatens every good idea Fox comes up with. Even Mexico City governor Lopez El Peje Obrador has soften his relationship with the president. Hopefully PRI will stop hindering Fox's ideas. Why the hell we want PEMEX to be still a goverment owned company if they probed to be worst CEO's? Just because it was expropriated about 60 years ago? Or just is it just a silly inertia?
