Wild, mercurial, very talented, total hottie - all these accolades describe Drew to a T. The MooOw almooost never wants to see her moovies(they are always soo stupid), but she always manages to rescue them from the dung heap(except for Boys on the Side, whcih stank) - that is the mark of a either a great actress, or a total hottie. Drew is a little bit of both - she is a very good actress, for her generation, and she simply smoulders on screen. Fair marks to her for not joining the Herbalife crowd, and keeping her Reubenesque form. Above all, you have to say that Drew Barrymoore is an individual awash ina sea of lookalike Hollywood bimbos ready and willing to unstrap their wonderbras for the first Hack director with a cellphone. SHe commands your attention and your respect, and she has a bright future - she just needs to calm down that partying lifestyle!
