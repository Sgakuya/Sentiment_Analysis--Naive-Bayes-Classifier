Overall, a haven for militant lefties and yuppies. In addition, this is probably the most overcommercialized new age/yuppie city I have ever seen. It's also notorious among New Mexicans as the most overpriced city to live in as far as the state is concerned. I was offered a job there, but refused the offer because of the living expenses. The city has zoning regulations mandating all buildings within the city limits to be adobe, a living wage, and pretty high local taxes. No wonder why so many businesses are leaving town and going to Albuqueruque. However, it does get 2 stars for being in a gorgeous landscape, and within easy reach to larger and more modest places.
