To everyone who said Walmart treats their employees bad,u dont know what ur talking about,because my husband has been an employee at Walmart for some time now, and they treat their employees great....and to the comments about the people greeters all being old geezers ,what other company do u know that would give older people a chance to work and feel like they matter.all u people that talk about Walmart r the people that r always Bitchin and tryin to get something for free and thats what makes shoppin at walmart a hassle when u have to be around ur whiney asses! ur just unhappy and dont have anything better to do then to put down the BEST STORE around!!!
