GOAT Greatest Of All Time!!!!!!!! They said it John Wooden: "I've always said that Dean is a better teacher of basketball than anyone else. I couldn't begin to teach players the things Dean has taught them. I've admired him because there's more to him than just wins." Bobby Knight: "I think it's a great achievement [breaking Rupp's record], indicative of a guy who really knows how to coach and has decided from day one that things are going to be done the absolute right way." Mike Krzyzewski: "Whatever is written about him in a positive sense he justly deserves. I know he'll give credit, as we all would to the players who have played for us but the praise for him should rise well above that for the players who have played for him."
