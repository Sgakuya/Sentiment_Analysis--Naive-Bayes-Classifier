Jim Carrey is so hard for me to rate because in order to give him more than 3 stars I would have to defy my grading scale for most actors which is based a lot on the actor's range. Jim Carrey's forte is definately comedy, and he rules that realm very efficiently. There were a couple of less than stellar performances (Me, Myself and Irene), but he generally puts on great performances and becomes his character , literally. When he was preparing to film Man on the Moon , he modeled his daily activities and habits after those of Andy Kaufman in order to become his character . He did a pretty good job as the Grinch, and Dumb and Dumber was a classic. He also proved that he can star in serious roles (i.e Truman Show ). Jim Carrey seems to be a great person who is unique in many ways, and although he'll never win an Oscar, he is a star in his own right.
