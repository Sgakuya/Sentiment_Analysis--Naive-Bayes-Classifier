This is a really fun store to shop at. One of their trademarks is selling products that are organic with no pesticides used, and avoiding products with preservatives. I bought their barbecue sauce and cream sodas (both preservative free of course), and both were quite good. If you like chocolate, you're in for a real treat. The stuff you get at TJ's will make you renounce Hershey's forever. And yes, their wine selection is remarkable. I'm not a huge fan of wines myself, but a friend of mine makes trips of 150 miles to get his wine at Trader Joe's, so there must be some tasty ones there! The clerks and cashiers were friendly and really helpful. As I checked out, the cashier kept mentioning that I could return anything and they'd refund my cash with no questions asked, because they like their customers to try new things. My brother regards Trader Joe's as a snob store (for the upscale clientele they appeal to), but even if that's true, who cares? They carry a lot of unique things and have a friendly and inviting atmosphere. I always walk out feeling like a million bucks, and that's worth something.
