I am proud to say I am a graduate of University of Phoenix. I attended UOP for two years earning my undergraduate degree in business administration. I already had an associate degree. So I will be honest, if you are not transferring a significant amout of credits you will not graduate in two to three years as they say on their ads unless you double up classes. In addition you have to be serious about your education and prioritize in order to graduate. It is a very challenging curriculum and you have papers due every week, one individual and one team assignment. On the bright side, this has improved my written communication skills drastically. In addition you have at least one presentation due every course, so I also have excellent presentation skills and can do powerpoint with my eyes close. Another thing, don't think you will be missing alot of classes you are only allowed to miss one class, if you miss another you are automatically dropped from a course, no exceptions. And trust me even if you have did well on all assignments it seems their is a hidden rule that the abscence will significantly impact your grade. I know you may not feel encouraged hearing all this, but when I look back I can truly say I work for my degree. When I started at University I had approx. 20 peers, in my last class thier was only 7 left that started with me.
