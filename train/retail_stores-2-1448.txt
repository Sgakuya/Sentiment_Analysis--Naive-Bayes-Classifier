In recent years I have developed a real dissatisfaction with Target that has little to do with the quality of product (which is the same as Walmart and K-Mart, only over priced) My gripe is the personnel. Just because the isles are a little cleaner than Walmart doesn't make them superior and yet many of the clerks seem to have superiority complexes, WHY? For God's sake Target is just another discount store. Maybe it has something to do with the sate Targets current financial standing. Sales are down, stock is off, layoffs are anticipated. Geeeee...I wonder why. Looks like I'm not the only one who's tired of paying a surcharge for snooty attitudes.
