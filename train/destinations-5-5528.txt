Where do I start? I am in love with Oregon, specifically Portland, OR. Bend, OR is also amazing. In the past couple of years I have been on five different occassions, during all times of the year, winter included. It is the most beautiful state. It has the forest, mountains, coast. What more do you need? It is not crowded like California. It is clean and everyone is so nice. It is the most down to earth place I have ever been. If all goes right in my life, I will live in Oregon someday. I really suggest going to Bend and doing some hiking if it is summer, or sking if it is winter time. In Portland go to a McMenimens (specifically the Bagdad sp?). Try a little Video Poker when you are out at the bars. They have VP machines where you can gamble when you are in a bar. Go down 23rd Ave. Visit some of the great breweries. And if you are scared of because everyone talks about how much it rains, don't be. So you may get a little wet, just bring the right gear and you'll be just fine. This past week, in OR, it was sunny but cold. I had a week of beautiful winter days. I heard that I was lucky, but I have seen the rain there and it isn't hell. I really could go on and on....but I'll wrap it up by saying if the outdoors are appealing to you at all, Oregon is a place you should check out.
