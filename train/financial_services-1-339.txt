A repeat of the same story many others have told. Longtime credit card holder, high balance, excellent payment history. Notice received in December '04 that APR would change to 28%. Closed account to freeze rate and am paying off balance quickly. Bank One takes full advantage of the license given by the government to steal from the customers. And they are only the worst of a bad bunch (of banks). Our only defense is to discipline ourselves to quit using credit. Good luck to the thousands of people just chucked that envelope with no Bank One ID will get their first notice that their rate was jacked when they get the bill and it's too late to escape it. I'm no brick-throwing revolutionary but this experience has moved me one step toward simplifying and doing less business with American buisness.
