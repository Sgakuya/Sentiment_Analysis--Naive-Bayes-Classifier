I'll have to disagree with my mentor PBeavr on this one - I thought this movie was pretty damn good. I'm a big Alex Garland fan (the guy who wrote the screenplay), so admittedly, i was a little biased in the film's favor going in. I thought the early scenes in an empty London, with buzzing indy rock blaring in the background were effective, and I really liked the plot. I thought the no name actors were passable, but the movie is made by the cinematography and really cool storyline. There are all kinds of allegories you can read into the plot - how sometimes protection from the danger can be worse than the danger itself. Read into that as you may.
