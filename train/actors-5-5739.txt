He s one of those rare actors who can be chilling, creepy, hilarious, pathetic, and sexy all at the same time. He has a wonderful deep voice and the most amazing penetrating eyes. Certainly he will always be most remembered as Dr. Frankenfurter which is both a good and bad thing. Still, his talent should have made him way more visible than he s been over the years. Of the roles I have seen him in since then one really outstanding one was his portrayal as the abusive drunkard Bill Sikes in one of the Oliver Twist adaptations for television (1987). His expressions alone did more than any dialog could have to convince me that this character was a cold-blooded murderer. He was also very convincing as the hideous supernatural clown in IT . I wasn t surprised to read that he does a lot of voice work - but I would still love to see his captivating presence more often on the screen.
