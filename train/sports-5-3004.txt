The Iron Horse does not get enough credit! First of all, though I believe Ruth was the greatest player of all-time (see my review), he was also a moral flop of a role model for little American boys. He was a drinker, womanizer, glutton, etc. Gehrig was someone that any father would be proud to have his boy imitate. Second, HE COULD HIT! .330 lifetime average from a cleanup hitter! The year (1927) that Ruth hit his magical 60 home runs, Gehrig drove in 175 runs. Do you realize how hard it is to drive in that many runs when the guy hitting in front of you has cleared the bases 60 times? He was awesome. A great player and a great man.
