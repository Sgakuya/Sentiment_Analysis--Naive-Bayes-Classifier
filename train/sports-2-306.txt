Is it time for Yankee fans to turn ugly on this guy yet? No, I mean really ugly. When you buy the best all around player in the game, you buy a guy who ought to be able to hit his weight. When you plug a guy into a stronger hitting line-up, his average (and power ratings) should go up, not down, not into the toilet. No more excuses, no more allowances about how tough it is to learn a new defensive position, to go to New York and play, blah, blah, blah. Bring a friggin' bat to work with you and start producing. This guy should be competing for the Triple Crown, not struggling to stay above .265 with the manager thinking: hmm, down one run, runner at first, nobody out. Do you bunt Rodriguez? Start producing or go back to Texas. Or Seattle.
