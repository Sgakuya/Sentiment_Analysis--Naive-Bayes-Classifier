Revolutionized the quarterback position with his never before seen running abilities. Became the best rushing quarterback ever and the highest rated passer in NFL history which enabled him to become the most exciting quarterback in NFL history. Toughness, leadership, and heart were all a major part of his game. Never had the supporting cast (especially a good pass blocking offensive line) of Montana but should have won at least one more Superbowl. Took a beating his last couple of years but was still the best QB in the game until his retirement. Only recent player I know of where defenses admitted they were afraid of playing him PRIOR to a game. Cleary, the second best QB ever. Have to give the nod and props to Montana due to his clutch playoff performances. However, the NFL is not the same without him.
