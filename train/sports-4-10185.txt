First, let's set aside the issue of strength of schedule. If you look at Sagarin's computer rankings in usatoday (http://www.usatoday.com/sports/sagarin/fbt05.htm) then you will see that Oklahoma had the toughest schedule of any team in 2005. Do I think that the computers are 100% accurate? Of course not. But the #1 ranking in strength of schedule should take this issue off of the table. If anybody claims that Oklahoma has a soft schedule, then that person does not have credibility. I'm a big OU fan, but I can't give Stoops a five-star rating because 1) he seems to have lost his touch in big games recently because 2) his teams don't have enough mental toughness. They get punched in the nose, they fall behind, and they panic. If he can restore the program's mental toughness, then this guy is one of the greatest college coaches of all time. Too bad for Oklahoma, because if he does restore the mental toughness then he'll go pro.
