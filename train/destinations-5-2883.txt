A friend invited me to live there one summer. It was unbelievable! I couldn't get enough! The people were very hospitable to this poor guy. However, I regret not having spoken to the ferry worker who had to listen to a Californian criticize NY'ers, regarding hospitality. He patiently listened; but I could have told him I lived in Calif., also, and was very charmed by my experience in NY. I walked to as many exciting places as I could. So many, many favorite moments! I even went into the church where George Washington had worshipped! We saw Coriolanus at Central Park; The free shows at Washington Square; The Irish pub, where about six patrons of both sexes, and mostly young, sang a most dreadful version of the Mercer/Jenkins' song, P.S. I Love You;(This was before karaoke came on the scene); And yours truly, being absolutely charmed. I walked along the waterfront after closing time, through Battery Park, on to the ferry to Staten Island, walked to Lafayette Park, where I was staying, quite a few nights. I was unmolested. Saw so many things, that it would take a book to relate it all! Yes, I love NY. My taste of The Big Apple left me very nourished!
