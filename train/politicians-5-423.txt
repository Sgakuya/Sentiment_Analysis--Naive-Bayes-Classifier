On behalf of many grateful Americans, I want to express my gratitude toward Prime Minster Tony Blair and the great citizens of the United Kingdom in their support of America in her time of great need. Unlike France, Germany and Russia, whose very existence as a free, independent countries is owed to the great people of the UK and USA, the great citizens of the UK have stood shoulder to shoulder with America as we move into a military campaign that will surely see a great deal of death to many a Desert Rat and GI. In America there is great support to liberate Iraq, as is there a persistent minority voice against war. As a citizen who appreciates his freedom, I respect any one's right to protest war in any country. There has been no major world war for almost 60 years which is due in large part to the politics and military presence of our two great nations. I am of the firm belief that proactive measures to disarm rogue nations, such as Iraq, are necessary components to long term peace. War should always be a last resort, but it should be also noted that appeasement, via false world resolutions by false allies, will only lead to a more civil unrest throughout the world. As leaders of the free world, we cannot turn our backs to those people who live under tyranny and evil. September 11, 2001 has forever changed the world, and we must all make the sacrifices necessary to regain the peace. Thank You Great Britain for your sacrifices to freedom, and thank you Mr. Blair for your great leadership and loyalty to the United States of America in these troubled times. Most Sincerely, Michael Richard Van Every San Jose, CA
