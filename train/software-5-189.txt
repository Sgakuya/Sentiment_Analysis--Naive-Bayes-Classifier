I tried out Operas new FREE version and I haven't stopped using it. The broswer is stable as a rock and has not crashed once in the 2 weeks I've used it. The deafult user interface is cluttered at first but it is very customizable and after downloading a streamilined skin and removing uneeded toolbars I've got it to take up minimal screen space. It also has an auto form fill "key" just press one button to fill in your username and passwords. It even has voice controlled browsing capability and can even read the text out for blind people or for people who are too lazy to read. It also uses very little system resources and it browses very fast. If there's one thing about this browser that could be improved is compatibility with certain websites but all non-IE browsers have this problem, thanks to MS.
