I got the prepaid Virgin mobile when I lived in MD. In MD the phone worked great. No problems. Then I moved to Miami area. The phone works in Miami from what I have seen and works in Key Biscayne where I live but does not work in my apartment or the courtyard, only on the sidewalk. However, for those who don't live on our island it's a great deal for people who want to be contract free and don't talk on the phone a lot...I am trying Verizon and it comes in in my apartment on KB and only dropped me while riding the metrorail. Both are very clear. However, Verizon is expensive so I am going to try T-Mobile for their free trial period...
