This state really is below average. The highways are terrible, and in total need of construction. The people are very stand offish, and it is humid as hell. Don't even think about driving here in a snowstorm, as your life could depend on it. Everytime they have a snowstorm, it makes national news with all the horrid wrecks. I am not saying everyone is bad here, as I do know a few that are awesome, but the state in whole is just gross. And stay away from the metropolitan areas...UPDATE: you can say that again Kerry04...but the state has always been backwards, regardless of their idiotic ban on same sex marriage. I haven't been to every nook and cranny of the state, as I am sure there are some really cool places, but overall I still think it is below average...
