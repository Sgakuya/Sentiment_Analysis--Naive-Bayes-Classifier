The worst comic ever. Utterly without any redeeming feature or hint of skill. The drawing would shame a four year old. I have to wonder what she does with the other 23 hours 59 minutes of each day. All in all, I'd honestly rather read Dennis the Menace or The Family Vomit. Even the observations, such as they are, are mundane, and are often not even her own. So what exactly is she being paid for? That her garbage shares the same pages once graced by the work of Bill Watterson and Frank Cho is too depressing for words. I disagree with UHGrad. The 'art' looks the way it does not because Ms. Price draws it to 'fit the humor', but simply because she cannot draw at all. At least she is consistent: she cannot write either.
