I love Tennessee for several reasons. These people know how to have fun and they do it in style. Whether you're sitting in Neyland Stadium enveloped by a sea of orange and white spirit so strong that you feel it the core of your bones or experiencing the beauty of the Smokey Mountains or dining at the elegant Regas Resturant in Knoxville or celebrating July 4th on the waterfront in Nashville with the Nashville symphony (fireworks rated #3 this year in the nation)or strolling one of the many riverfronts in the state along with friendly and down-to-earth people who are too smart and confident in their own rite to flaunt the fact that they have more class in their little fingers and more money in their bank accounts than to give a moments glance to those who call them backward hillbillies, you will love this place. And for those of you who haven't figured it out yet: a flat drawal is not the equivlent to stupidity and neither is the geographical location of one's hometown. Tennessee's a great place -and believe it or not, they don't have the corner on lard assed cigarette smoking junk food junkies. Just take a look at Michael Moore and Bill Clinton...know whut ah mean Vern?
