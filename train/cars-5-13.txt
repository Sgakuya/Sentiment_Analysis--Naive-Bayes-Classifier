Great all around bike. I bought mine new in 2001 and have had no problems since I drove it out of the showroom. I ride with friends with the big boys , 660's and 700's and never get left behind. The first thing you need to do after you get a Wolverine is to get the Warn unlocker. It allows you to swap to 2 or 4 wheel drive. It isnt cheap. You can find them online for about $250 or you can get them through your local yamaha dealer for about $325. They are fairly easy to install with no special tools needed. The cost is high but the reward is well worth it. Its basicly like getting another bike for 300 bucks. When and if mine ever dies I'll got straight to the Yamaha shop and buy another one!
