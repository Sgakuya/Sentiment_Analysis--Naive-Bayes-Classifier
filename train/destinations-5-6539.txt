I have lived in Texas all my life and i love it! For those who think that Texas sucks and its full of rednecks, your wrong. I think everyone should visit Texas and if u dont ur missing out. Galveston is absolutely Beautiful.San Antonio is very fun,if u go here u must visit the alamo,6 flags fiesta texas and the river walk. In Houston the space center is awesome and so is Keyma. The culture is great and people are generally friendly and im proud of my texan accent. No state is perfect and Texas isn't an exception. Texas has really hot,humid,and weird weather. Rigt now its in the middle of november and its like 81 degrees and just yesterday it was 52. thats crazy. the only part of Texas that really gets any snow is the panhandle. There is a lot of illegal people from Mexico but they came here for a better life and i dont blame them. I love Texas and if u don't then u haven't experienced it or your just biaist because you think we are all steers and queers but seriously come visit.
