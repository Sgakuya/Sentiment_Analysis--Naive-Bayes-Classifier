Phil and his wonderful friends are keeping the Dead spirit alive by using the original songs as a foundation to launch into new musical territory and arangements. His inclusion of younger musicians and willingness to let the songs grow has resulted in a new incarnation of the Dead's music. Jerry would be proud. Check out the extra CD included in There and Back Again that jams out some of the older stuff with new energy. Jimmy's and Warren's guitar work weaves a melody line that's jazzy and saturated in psychedelic rock roots at the same time. Of course, the live shows are the thing to see... especially now that Phil and Bobby, Mickey and Billy are all together again. Yeah!!!!
