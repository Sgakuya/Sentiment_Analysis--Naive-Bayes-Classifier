Lived here for 6 years. People say it's boring and cold. I'll stick up for this okay state - lots of history (both good and bad), the Black Hills are very beautiful, excellent outdoor activities (hunting, fishing, and skiing out in the Black Hills) and Sioux Falls is one of the more underrated cities in the US. There aren't many cities in South Dakota but Sioux Falls is a must-see if you do plan on visiting. On the downside, it's very poor (even more so than Mississippi or Alabama), the people are as ignorant and bigoted as they are good-natured, the public school system is a joke, not to mention it's very cold and boring.
