Being a big fan of Audreys, I highly recommend this film, to any and all people, that appreciate a film, full of layers, and deep sentimental value, that goes beyond the obvious. A story intermitten with love, comedy, tragedy, controversy, and of course a "cat", is a treat and sweet release from the narrowminded, witless films that we have in cinema today. I personally felt this was one of Audreys strongest roles, and she played it brilliantly. Moon River is one of my favorite film scores, and I can't get enough of that fabulous mile long cigarette holder! So the next time you decide to watch a film that is out of the norm ( but in a very good way ) have a little "breakfast at Tiffany's "'
