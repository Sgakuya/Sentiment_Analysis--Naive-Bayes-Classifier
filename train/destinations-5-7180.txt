Nothing could have prepared me for the beauty of Venice. I arrived in the city at dusk, in the mist, and it looked like something out of another time. I spent three days there sightseeing, touring the canals, visiting museums, shopping, and wandering the streets. St. Mark's Basilica and the Palazzo Ducale were magnificent, and I really enjoyed a couple of hours at an outdoor cafe (Caffe Florian) in St. Mark's Square. One day I went to Murano, the island famous for glassblowing, which was a lot of fun, and I spent quite a bit of time at the Rialto market. The best part of Venice, though, was just walking around and marveling at the incredibly beautiful old buildings and breathtaking views at every turn. I loved watching and hearing the gondoliers as they made their way through the canals, especially at night. Venice is an extremely romantic city, no doubt. On a more practical note, Venice is pretty expensive across the board. You also need to be prepared to carry your luggage on your own for long distances (there are no cars in Venice) or be willing to pay for a water taxi. I was fortunate to be in Venice when it was dry and smelled fine, but I know that it can flood and be pretty stinky. Despite these drawbacks, Venice is definitely worth visiting. I've never seen a more attractive city.
