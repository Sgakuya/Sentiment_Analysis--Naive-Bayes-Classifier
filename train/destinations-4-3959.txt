As a native of Miami, logically I would give my own home a very high rating. I do think that some of the negative comments on this board about Miami are true, granted, they may be a bit exagerated at times. Yes, there are a lot of shallow people here, but not everyone is part of Versace crowd in South Beach. Sure, you could hang around with them and fall into that kind of life. I personally live in the humdrum suburbs of Miami and I commute everyday to my university, Florida International. It is a fine place to live with great winter weather and great beaches. Great schools too like the University of Miami and Florida International. There's always something to do, whether you're into the club scene or the arts and nature. There are great sports clubs down here (GO DOLPHINS!!!) to keep us entertained. In addition, this city is better than any city up north. The air is cleaner down here and crime is down to boot. I encourage tourists to come down and visit our beautiful city.
