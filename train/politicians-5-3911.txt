There main question everyone has to ask themselves on their choice of president is whether you want liberals controlling the Supreme Court or whether you Conservatives controlling the Supreme Court. With Bush in office, we will have a Supreme Court who will choose social policies for the country which are morally and Biblically sound. Keep Gore and the Liberals out of the white house and our country. Especially keep them out of the Supreme Court! Vote for Bush and change a nation that has gone so far away from where the founding fathers wanted it to go. Economically and militarily we are doing great-but morally our country is dieing. Gays will soon raise children together and are now being allowed to get married, don't let this and many other liberal, nonBiblical issues pass in our country-CHOOSE BUSH!!!!! A key phrase is for all to love the person and hate the sin. Homosexuality is a sin and the person needs help to get out of sin, like all people need help getting out of certain sins. Choose Bush and Choose Jesus Christ!!!!!
