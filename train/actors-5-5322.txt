He has been called accomplished, audacious, brilliant, convincing, delicious, forceful, impish, impressive, incredibly funny, intuitive, remarkable, riveting, scene-stealing, spectacular, talented, transfixing, versatile... He's an incredible artist, actor, writer, person and individual. Who else could have single-handedly saved Ally McBeal? Who else could have helped the soundtrack albums become best-sellers? Who else deserved the SAG award and the Golden Globe? Who else deserves to win the Emmy? NO ONE!!! Judge him on his professional abilities (he has several, just pick one) not his personal life. Robert has the ability to say more with a single look, a smirk, an eyebrow lift than other actors can say with a whole monologue. His acting speaks for itself.
