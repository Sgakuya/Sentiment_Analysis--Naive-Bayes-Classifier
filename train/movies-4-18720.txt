If you have not read the original unabridged work by Bram Stoker I suggest that you do. It is a romance, not a horror story. The terror is merely the background, but as for this movie I would have to say that Reeves needed to be removed completely. Winona Ryder on the other hand I thought came off exactly the way she needed to. She held her acting at a certain level in order to give grace to the story. I feel that when I see her playing the role of Mina Harker that she truly grasped the characters torn essence between two men. One she loves, and one she use to love and finds that she loves him again. Ryder, I thought, looked enchanting and seductive portrayed through her devious forte as a superior actress. Gary Oldman, probably the most 'real' actor in Hollywood right now, once again pleased me, but still I sensed that he could have pulled himself into the role more.
