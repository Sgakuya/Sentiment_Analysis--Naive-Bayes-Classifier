So you say to me Do you think you'd like to go back to Scotland sometime? and I say In a second! What a beautiful, beautiful country. So many wonderful things to do and see I don't even know where to start. Edinburgh Castle was magnificent, Endinburgh as a whole was incredible. Wonderful people very helpful, very friendly and very approachable which can be very comforting. Take the train and admire the mountains, hit the coast and ferry over to some of the islands, then spend some time in Edinburgh, it'll be a trip you will look back upon fondly. An example of the type of country/people you'll encounter..we arrived in Oban checked into a bed and breakfast, and me being eager to explore asked the woman where can we go hiking? She looks at me and says What do you mean? I mean where are we allowed to hike, are there any trails? She says to me Anywhere!, as long as you don't bring a dog or a gun nobody cares. When was the last time you found someone hanging about in your backyard and you didn't care?
