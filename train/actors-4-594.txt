I'm a character actor fan. I think they make films better. Peter Lorre is no exception. He is one of the best character actors ever to appear on screen and probably the most mimicked. Peter Lorre was a dynamic, charismatic and unique character actor. He was a versatile actor with a talent for playing villians and psycotics and in many of his films he added a touch of humor. Lorre was known for his short stature, his bulging eyes and his distinctive Hungarian accent. He was born Lazlo Lowenstein June 26, 1904 in Rozsahegy Austria Hungary. He trained to be an actor in Vienna Austria and acted in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In 1931 he was cast as the psycopathic child killer in Fritz Lang's M , a film which garnered Lorre international attention. He moved to London in 1933 where Alfred Hitchcock cast him in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Mad Love was his first American film. From 1937 to 1939 in 8 films he played Japanese detective Mr Moto. He was paired with Sidney Greenstreet in some films. Some of my favorite Lorre films that I've seen so far are Arsenic and Old Lace(my favorite), Casablanca, and Around the World in 80 Days. Lorre died March 23, 1964.
