I'm a huge Carl Thomas fan! I think that Emotional was the best album (r b) of 2000! Carl keep up the good work, and by the way will you marry me? Al the bad remarks about Ccarl had to be from people who 1) never heard the album, or 2) hate slow music. Which is fine I have friends like that. But Carl Thomas is where it's at!!!! I think his album will increase our population for 2001 at least by 4 times! This is the most awesome love-making music that's been made since silkk had a meeting in their bedroom. If any of the readers know Carl Thomas personally, tell him he is making all kinds of single (and otherwise) women fall in love with him. I might go to Hollywood for a map to the stars just for Carl. He is so sexual! I haven't felt like this since I met my husband of 6 years! He always wanted kids, and now thanks to Carl now he just might get them!
