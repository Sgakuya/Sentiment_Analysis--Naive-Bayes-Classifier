It's hard to put into words why I love Lucky Strikes so much. I dunno if it's the great taste, the elegant package, or the image associated with it. For me, Luckies will always contain memories. With each one I smoke, I think about the time I kissed that girl under the stars, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't wash her smell out of my sweatshirt. Maybe it's the time Tim and I let our legs dangle off the dock, as we talked about what we were gonna do after we got out of school. As somebody who lives in a permanant state of nostalgia, Luckies are important, because they remind of good times, good tunes, and good friends.
