A new side of Joni Mitchell that is a treat to hear. She's singing mostly old standards such as At Last and Stormy Weather with full orchestration. A real departure from any of her other recordings. She also performs 2 of her own previously recorded songs, A Case of You, and of course, Both Sides Now. You can tell that this music has meant a lot to her in her life and that she is enjoying taking a swing at it herself. If you like Joni Mitchell and admire her for continuing to do her own thing, as I do, then you may enjoy this latest groove. It may also bridge a gap for people that haven't liked Joni much in the past but like the style of music she's working with here.
