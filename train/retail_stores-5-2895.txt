I have always choosen Whitehall in Hamburg, NY. They have always treated me with respect and kindness. Their jewelry is impecable and can not go without saying the best in the industry. I have purchased over $5000 worth of jewelry from them to include wedding bands, earrings, necklaces, and tennis braclets. They stand behind their warranties and have very inexpensive protection plans that protect their products over 3-5 years against all defects. I mean ALL defects. If they can't fix it they will replace it at no extra cost to you. They also have a trade in policy that allows you as the buyer to trade in your Whitehall jewelry for what you paid for it and you just have to spend 25% more than the trade in. Not a bad plan when looking to upgrade a wedding band or trade in that piece of jewelry that you don't wear or use anymore for something better and more glamorous.
