Locus of most of the problems in this country. A sterile antheap overrun with a**hole Republicans and Democrats alike. A morally corrupt haven for influence peddlers, political groupies, gladhanders, greedheads, powerhungry twerps, and clueless pundits to ply their mutant and questionable scams and getover schemes. The food sucks here, but you could hardly tell by the average girth of all those hippo lardasses in Congress, an august body (aha) that has a per capita tonnage of about 375 pounds (see Hyde, Sensenbrenner, Jerrold Nadler, etc.). Has two fine museums and several meaningless memorials that would be put to better use under the wrecking ball. This would allow private industry to erect some more strip malls, drill for oil or establish toxic waste dumps. Remove yourself from the touristy areas, and you'll find yourself in one of the most depressing, despairing, menacing, and unsafe cities in the country. Just remember to bring your flak vest, uzi and rottweiler.
