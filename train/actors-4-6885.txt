Arnold is one of the most colorful Hollywood stars around today if you ask me. He's had such a successful career and has rarely delivered a bad performance (OK, maybe in Batman and Robin ). He was the perfect choice for the role of The Terminator in both of those films, and I cannot wait until he returns to his roots in T3. His resume includes a long string of action films, most of which were good. Eraser , Predator and True Lies . One of my favorite of his films is True Lies - he and Jamie Lee Curtis had such chemistry. I also appreciated his branching out into more comedic roles in Twins , Kindergarten Cop , Last Action Hero and Jingle All the Way , all of which he performed pretty well in. I also enjoyed his recent performances in The Sixth Day and End of Days . Espescially in the latter, Arnold seemed to undertake a somewhat different role than he did in other roles in which he has played in the past. I can't put my finger on it, but he performed excellently in that film. In the final analysis, Arnold is a good actor except for one thing: his Austrian accent. There is just something about that accent that takes an amount of believability away from most of his characters. Despite that, nobody can deny Arnold his place in film history- he'll still be famous 100 years from now.
