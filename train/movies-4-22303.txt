When I was a kid, this was the best movie ever made. Now that I'm older, and familiar with the original novel by the gifted and talented Michael Crichton, I see that the film wasn't quite as good as it could have been. Still, it shows us what we want to see. Aside from the dinosaurs, which were probably the best CGI animals created until Attack of the Clones , the cast was perfectly casted. Everyone was in good form, I just wish we could have seen more of Dr. Wu, and the late Bob Peck as Game Warden, Robert Muldoon. The cinematography was excellent, the settings were perfect for the plot, and John Williams once again produced a brilliant soundtrack that holds the movie together as a whole. Don't bother with the sequels, this is the definitive modern dinosaur movie.
