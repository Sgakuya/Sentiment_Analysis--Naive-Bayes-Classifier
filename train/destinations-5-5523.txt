Oregon is beautiful. Its serence and peaceful even in the city there is a certain calm to it. I am not sure why. The coast is gorgeous. Try Seaside Oregon. You will like it. The water never gets too warm though so you have to be brave to go swimming in it. But the beach is beautiful there and also in Bend. The east coast is beautiful over by St. Joseph and Enterprise. Its very rural and there is Wallowa lake which is beautiful. You can see where chief Joseph was buried and its a little strange. The Snake river runs along the coast of Oregon and Idaho and its a big recreastion area both on Oregon and Washington and IDaho state which it borders. Don't be shocked but its state law that the you can't pump your own gas. I guess it had something to do with creaing jobs. So basically just pull up to any gas station and the attendant will take care of you.
