Baldur's Gate 2 represents one of the few must have games in one's library-if you love RPGs. BG2 picks up, and improves upon, where the first game left off. Let's discuss basics first then gameplay. Visually the game is a treat. Beautiful backgrounds and 3D enhanced spells; a redesigned interface; 800X600 resolution are some of the visual facets. The audio in this game really shines and is what probably propels this game into an almost living entity. There is much more audio than the previous game, and many of the same actors have returned. The actors are top-notch and make you believe you are truly interacting. They voice their opinions, their needs, and possibly even romantic undertones. If you are familiar with the original game then you will know Emoen, Jaheira, Minsc, Edwin, and Viconia. Good or bad Jaheiras partner does not return, nor does Minsc's. The main villain is voiced by Hollywood actor David Warner. He adds a wonderful element playing the villain. Now finally we discuss gameplay. The original Baldurs Gate was a great game but had too many fetch me this tasks which took away a bit of the continuity of the game. BG2 is much more direct in that you must complete worthwhile, and challenging tasks that will affect your outcome. Your characters begin at a much higher level thus your enemies are much more fearsome. The Mindflayer is a particular enemy that had me cussing more than once! Other examples are the vampires that drain your levels, Golems that can only be defeated by a certain weapon, and powerful wizards and sorcerers. Fortunately you can create a team that is just as fearsome. There are many more spells than previously and many magical weapons to be found. There are many lands to be explored...well, actually there is so much depth that it cannot be possibly all reviewed here. So my suggestion is to go and get this game today. And be prepared to set aside a few weeks of your life.
