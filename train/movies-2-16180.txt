What a disappointment! I thought about leaving the movie before it was even over. Historically, it was semi-interesting. The history was totally covered up by the blood, gore and just general grossness in just about every scene. I love Daniel Day-Lewis and feel that he did a really good job with his part. He carried the movie as all the other characters were so weak. They seemed to not really have a part in the history that was trying to be shown. When I left the theatre, I wished that I had never even seen the movie. I will certainly think twice before seeing another Martin Scorcese film again. In fact, I will probably just avoid any connection with it.
