I remember watching Tim Duncan in college and I thought he was better than average and that's it. I never imagined that he would immediately become one of the best NBA players I've ever seen, which he is. His footwork is great, he has excellent moves and fakes, and with a very accurate, pure release, being 7 feet tall and having a patented jump-hook, backboard shot and straightaway shot, he's unstoppable and shoots with a very high percentage. His defensive presence is no less noteworthy. He's not quite as dominating defensively as Shaq, but he's still great. A shoo-in for the hall-of-fame and maybe even the best center ever.
