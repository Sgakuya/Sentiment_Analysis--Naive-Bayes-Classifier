I work for toyota and trust me when i say that this is the worst car the company has ever put out. yes it get good on gas but look at the big picture unless you just plan to lease it the car is not worth the big bucks you will be spending down the road. Oh and to all the environmentalists out there just think about this for a sec, yea it puts out less Hydrocarbons,Nitrogen oxides and Carbon monoxide but think of all the electromagnetic radiation that these hybrids put out your just tradeing one bad thing for another in my opinion hybrids are a faulse sence of securty there just as bad for the environment as a disel suv just in a difrent way
