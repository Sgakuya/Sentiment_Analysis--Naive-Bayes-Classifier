Philly can definately offer a stimulating experience. It's so rich in history and full of many significant sights to recall the roots and beginnings of this great country. Penn's landing on the waterfront also has some neat ships and submarines you can tour including a battleship dating back to the Spanish-American war. The archetecture in Philly is fascinating, especially on Society Hill which has an abundance of brownstones, cobblestone streets, horse and buggies and sort of reminded me of Boston a lot but Philly definately has it's own individual character. City hall right in the middle of downtown is like an archetectual centerpiece for the city with an impressive clock tower and a commemorative statue of William Penn. This is probably the best looking city hall I've ever seen. The food here is great, especially if you like Italian dining, check out South Philly. Philly definately is an impressive city yet something seemed like it was missing while I was there yet I couldn't quite put a finger on it. Perhaps smiles and civic pride seemed to be a lacking factor in this city.
