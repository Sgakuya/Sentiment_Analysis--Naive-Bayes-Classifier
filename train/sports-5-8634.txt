Anyone who saw Kobe's overtime performance in Game 4 of the finals Wednesday night will agree that he is one of the top 5 players in the NBA right now. I'm not quite ready to jump on the he's the next Jordan bandwagon that resurfaced right after the game, but I am willing say that Kobe is beginning to show the same blend of talent, clutch play, and killer instinct that made Jordan such a dominant player. And this guy is only 21! So if he had gone to college instead of jumping straight to the pros, he'd be heading into his senior year. Instead, he's helping Shaq lead the Lakers to an NBA title. (Jordan didn't win his first title until he was 28.) It's going to be a lot of fun to see how good Kobe gets over the next 10 years.
