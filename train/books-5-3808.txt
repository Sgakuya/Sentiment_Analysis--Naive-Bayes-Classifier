The protagonist of Catch-22, Yossarian, is my hero. He his able to simplify all of the insanity that surrounds him into one simple premise - everyone is trying to kill him, and he is determined not to let it happen. Whether it be the Germans, the attack planes of Milo Minderbender, the sadistic tendencies of his commanding officers, or Nately's whore - everyone IS in fact trying to kill him, and no amount of government doublespeak is able to convince him otherwise. It is this basic survival realism, combined with his profound love for women and loyalty to his comrades, that in my opinion, makes Yossarian one of the most hilarious and interesting and tragic characters of modern literature.
