Dwayne Wade should be given serious consideration for the Rookie of the Year award. He doesn't get the numbers that LeBron and Carmelo do, but he doesn't get the playing time that they do either. Wade is more solid all around, he is good offensively and better defensively, which is what a lot of coaches look for more often than not. He also has a family, a child. If he gets the award it'll mean more money for his family, I don't know about you, but I like it when kids are well off. Dwayne Wade is also more of a man than the other two. Unlike LeBron he went to college, and unlike Carmelo he stayed in because he wanted to help his team, Marquette, and not be selfish. Dwayne Wade is one of the best players in the NBA already and will be for many years to come. He has already drawn comparisons to Jordan, because of his stellar performance in the Elite Eight two years ago against Kentucky, when he earned a triple double, one of few in NCAA tournament history. Wade should win MVP, but because he is a rookie, Rookie of the Year is deserving enough.
