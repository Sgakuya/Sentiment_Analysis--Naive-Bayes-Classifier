I watched almost all the Senate hearings on John Ashcroft. I have concluded that while I wouldn't mind this man to be my neighbor or a friend (I have several friends just like him), I do not think he'll be able to enforce those laws which he finds personally offensive. How can he? I don't see how he can turn off his beliefs like a faucet. While Ashcroft does not appear to be a racist, he does at times appear to closely follow his own agenda (which is based on his strong religious beliefs). There is no room at the Attorney General's office for such rigidity. His very job is to protect those in our society who still face persecution and discrimination. Reading through these comments, I find many who profess to hold Christian beliefs acting in a decidedly un-Christian like manner, which only enforces my fear that Ashcroft may act the same. ***As an aside, Democrats do not hold the market on sleazy activities...or have some of your forgotten Watergate, Iran-Contragate, Newt Gingrich, Bob Livingstone, and Bob Packwood, etc??***
