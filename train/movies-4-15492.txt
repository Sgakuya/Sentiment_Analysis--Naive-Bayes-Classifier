 Thirteen Days is a gripping, emotional account of the Cuban Missile Crisis shown through the eyes of Kenny O'Donnell, Special Assistant to the President. The movie does a great job showing what went on behind the scenes during this extremely stressful time. Since I didn't know much about the event before seeing the movie, I couldn't tell if the portrayal was an accurate one or not. Later I heard that Ted Sorensen praised the movie, and the only criticism I came across was that the relationship between O'Donnell and JFK was overblown. (So I felt somewhat reassured.) The acting is pretty good, although Kevin Costner (playing O'Donnell) has a terrible Boston accent. At first it's quite distracting, but I got used to it as the movie progressed. The portrayal of JFK's struggle to balance all of the variables involved was very effective, and I could almost feel his emotions as the crisis mounted. Assuming that Thirteen Days is a fair representation of what went on during that time, it's worth seeing for the history lesson alone.
