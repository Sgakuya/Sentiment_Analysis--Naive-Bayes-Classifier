Scary that so many people think that the general public has the right to all the information on which the government must choose to act. Do you really think the information released is the whole story??? The press puts out the stories with whatever slant will draw listeners (hence... advertisers). The days of hard journalism are gone in favor of who looks good. The people with the more complete set of information are the ones making the hard decisions. George W. is only following through with the mess others have turned their back on. And the lazy, uneducated masses are only moaning about gas prices and economic slowdowns. You may want to think about the real alternatives to ignoring this problem. And anyone who thinks Hussein did not have the ways and means to make war is TRULY fooling themselves.
