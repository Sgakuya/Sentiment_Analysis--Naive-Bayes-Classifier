definently the greatest running back of all time. but if he had a good offensive line then we probably wouldn't have seen him make all those great plays becase he would just be running through the gaps and hole the o. line had made for him, that means no jukes, breaking tackles, or explosiveness. but it would make me happy to have seen him on a(n) half decent team then he would have probably have had double the yards but not in a more gracefull style of his godly running back years for my home-town team of the Detroit lions. the lions showed his skills but also constricted him by sucking and never winning a superbowl.
