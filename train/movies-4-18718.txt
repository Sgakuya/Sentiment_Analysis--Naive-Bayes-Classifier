A beautifully shot film that is mildly lacking in story and acting credit. The original story of Bram Stoker's Dracula is a very romantic story. Francis Ford Coppola has turned this classic story into more of a modern slasher vampire yarn. The romance is watered down to the point of transparency. Gary Oldman gives one of his best performances as Dracula. His performance is hypnotizing it is imposable to keep your eyes off of him. He inhabits his character so well, so perfectly you forget you are watching a fictional character. Anthony Hopkin's gives a swell performance, not one of his most memorable but still well acted and I couldn't see anyone else in the part. Wynona Rider, what can I say. Another blah performance from the queen of cute hollow acting. She doesn't quit fit the mold of this character and never really transforms. We never see the termoil she is going through. Then, of course, the biggest poo performance in this film (drum role please...) KEANU REEVES! What a dink! Every scene with this kid seems to just drag like a transexual on a Saturday night. Keanu has no buisness even being in the same flick as Gary Oldman. But, despite these short comings in the film, it is made up for by a strong supporting cast and interesting, artful directing and cinematography. Beautiful to watch even if the acting is whatever. Still recommended. Go see it if you are a fan of any of the actors in it or if you are a fan of well orchestrated horror films. A treat for the eyes.
