I loved this place as much as any place that I've been the last 10 years. It sounds a little weird, but Kaui has this strange energy to it - apparently you either love it, or you hate it. I stayed on the North Side in Hanalei Bay, and it was totally chill. There was a nice spot for beginning / intermediate surfers with a nice long break right by the pier. The hiking up on the Na Pali coast was out of this world. I hiked in four miles to a deserted waterfall, swam, hung out, and it was perfect. I also rented a jeep to check out the big gorge that kind of looks like the Grand Canyon. The gorge was nice, but even better was driving on the beaches on the south / west side of the island. Not a soul there. Kauai does not have any nightlife - in fact there is only one major road that loops the perimeter of the island... This place is also not the safest place to take a vacation. A bartender at a restuarant was telling me that a number of tourists drown each year in the crazy currents, or disappear along the rough Na Pali coast. Danger aside, Kauai is a beautiful, rugged, chill place.
