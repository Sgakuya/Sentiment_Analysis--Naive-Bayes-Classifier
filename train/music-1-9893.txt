How can anyone seriously like her?? I mean, you'd have to be brain-damaged to dig this chick. How can any guys really think she's hot, when she's skinnier than a toothpick she dresses like a skanky crack whore who hasn't taken a shower for the past week is strung out? And how can girls think she's sweet wish she was their best friend? This chick thinks she better than all of us she is sooooo stuck-up a real backstabber I'm sure. And her music?? I just don't get how anyone can like her music! It is just terrible! That song I Turn To You is sooooo fake insincere just terrible! Oh my God, I just hate Christina Aguilera so much! She is the worst of the worst in bubblegum land. Ugh!!!!!
