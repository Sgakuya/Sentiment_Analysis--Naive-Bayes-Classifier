Josh Groban is a man of true talent. Whether he is put into the pop or operatic genre does not matter. What matters is that he has the talent to continue in the harsh, and sometimes cruel music industry. Any artist that can endure the hardships and rejections and emerge with such a moving album deserves respect, no matter what your personal choice of music could be. As a singer with an absolute passion for music, one can appreciate the technical points as well as the artistic. There is much more to a singer than simply the surface in which most people hear. Dig a little deeper and you may scratch the depth in which was put into this album. Josh, you are truly amazing. You have been able to create an album suitable for everyone, which can be very difficult to do. Congratulations on your well deserved success. -Krystal (aged 18)
