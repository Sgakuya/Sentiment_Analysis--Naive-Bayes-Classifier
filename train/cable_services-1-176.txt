I switched from DirecTV, thinking this "service" would be better. The DVR feature is good, but the programming is mediocre. And, with the arbitrary decision to pull OLN, I have no more use for this company. They have reported that it was a consensus from the customers that influenced their decision to pull OLN, coupled with Comcast's unreasonable demands for more fees. Untrue! I was never consulted... otherwise, I would've cancelled my subscription on the spot! Well, the DISH Network's fees are unreasonable, given the fact that they do not deliver on product for which customers are charged! I will disonnect soon and go back to "airwave" TV!
