You can always tell an artists first video by how pitifully low the budget obviously was. After the first one and a little money comes it they open up the spigots and it's a whole other story, then they usually just get cheesey and gratuitous. This video of Jewels is a great example of something filmed with about a $1,000 budget, maybe, I mean they filmed it in a public bathroom, the two people making out were a couple that someone knew, and Jewel doesn't even move int he whole video because that would cost extra to have to move the camera, and lights, etc. instead it was cheaper to just have he stand there in the Johnny crapper and lipsync in a tight little T-shirt. This is just an observation of the economics of video production, as a result the video itself is pretty lame.
