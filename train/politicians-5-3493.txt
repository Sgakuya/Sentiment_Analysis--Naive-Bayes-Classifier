NEWSFLASH! The deffacit is only 1 Trillion dollars, not 6, and not that much more than Clinton ran it up. The national debt? Newsflash! We need it! It helps the economy. It was President Clinton who ran the economy down, and then just after Bush got inagurated (seriously, the day after) it was suddenly Bush's fault. Jobs lost and the economy was Clintons fault, and Bush is getting blamed for something he's been helping. The whole thing with countries being our enemies? I've been to MANY MANY countries (including many of the anti-war countries) most of the people I talked to were supporting the U.S. and did not support the government for not helping us. France, believe it or not, was one of the main ones. The war made America Safer. Saddam Hussain was cutting out peoples tounges for not supporting Saddam. That alone was grounds to go to war. We will find weapons Iraq moved them all we got there. Saddam knew we were coming, so he hid them, duh!. Bin Laden will be found, if he's not already dead! 37102002, I don't know if you noticed this, but it was Al-Quada who was the cause of Sept. 11, not bush, Sept. 11 was a wake up call for our country. As a person who attended 20, yes twenty, funerals and visited 14, yes fourteen, people in the hospital in relation to Sept. 11, I still am praising Bush, I lost friends, and relatives on Sept 11. I truly love our president and support him all the way! Ask yourself... had all this happened with Al Gore... would you blame him for Sept 11 etc.? would you bash him? Bush is the president you, America, elected and if you don't like him you can vote for someone else or leave the country, but I believe no matter who your president is you should always support him/her even if you don't agree with them. (except Hillary Clinton) This is random, but when a democrat wins the presidetial nomination PLEASE let it be John Edwards!
