Bill Clinton! Even the repetition of his name causes momentary nausea to set in. Without question he is the worst President of my lifetime (1951- ). He accomplished absolutely nothing of lasting value in either domestic affairs (eg. check out the phony economic prosperity he harps about in the stock market plunge) or in international relations (eg. disasters in Somalia, Haiti, No. Ireland, the Mideast, etc., etc.).But when all was said and done, it was his corrosive effect on civic discourse and public truthfulness that may be his most costly and deleterious legacy. People who still goo and coo over this PIG after his last days in office (pardoning criminals like Mark Rich, attempting to make off with White House furnishings, etc.,etc., etc.) shouldn't be allowed to call themselves Americans. Oh, and for you Clinton lovers, parlez vou merd?
