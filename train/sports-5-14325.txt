Greatest QB of the modern era...easily. The only person that may come close to his career stats is Peyton, and not if he has a lot of seasons like he is having this year. Marino not only had great seasons, he had them consistently. Favre is still 10000 yds behind Marino, and I don't see him catching him before he retires. As others have posted, Marino had no support. You can't tell me having a team around is unimportant. You can't tell me that Montana having the greatest WR in the history of football or Roger Craig on his team did not help him win Superbowls. Football is a team effort, and Marino carried his team as much as any single man could. Give him Rice, Craig, Clark, Terrell Davis, etc., and he gets the Miami Dolphins several Superbowls.
