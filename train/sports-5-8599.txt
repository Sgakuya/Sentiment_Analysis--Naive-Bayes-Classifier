Charles Barkley: Kobe at 22 is better than Michael (Jordan) at 22. I can't believe I just said that on national television. Phil Jackson: Kobe Bryant is the best all around player that I have ever coached. (inculding you know who!). Need I say more. You can't argue with Phil and Sir Charles. Ball hog? I think not. Only Kobe haters make such STUPID comments. Jordan shot the ball more, and had fewer assist. Same with Iverson. Look at the stats. Kobes' stats have steadily increased over the past five seasons, with the exception of blocks. Of course you block less when you're needed on the court more. Can't risk the fouls unnecessarily. Iverson better than Kobe? NO. Iverson is great, but Kobe will be great for a long time. Iverson, stop abusing yourself in vein! Be like Kobe. Mickael, don't come back to the league. Kobe will embarrass you. (Like he did in the all-star game, only much worse!) Listen to your friend Charles.
