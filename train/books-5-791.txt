One of my favorites of the HP series (Tied with Prisoner of Azkaban ) Some people argue about the series, saying that it is evil and promotes the occult. Personally, I don't think that reading Harry Potter books makes you want to practice witchcraft any more than Titanic makes you want to jump off a ship. The underlying theme o the books in general is good- that friendship and love triumph over evil, and that you must be able to recognize evil in order to fight it. The message is good, and is a joy for all ages to read. The books, especially this one, have all the twists and turns of a great mystery, with the element of a fantasy world where nothing is impossible is thrown in. Who wouldn't like that?
