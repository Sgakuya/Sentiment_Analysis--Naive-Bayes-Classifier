Let me start by saying that I have never been to DisneyWorld in Florida so my Disneyland experience might be different to someone who can compare the two but the times that I have been to Disneyland, I loved it. I went a couple of times as a kid and it was my heaven. I would run around taking my picture (all embarssed but so excited) with characters like Alice In Wonderland, Snow White, Micky. I loved the rides, the stores, the shows. It is really hard to remember a lot from back then but when I was a freshman in college, I met my family (ages ranging from 19-8)there for Easter. We had these passes that got us into the park at 6am before the gates were open to the public and could ride the rides with no lines. It was pretty hard waking up but well worth it. It was right when the Indiana Jones ride came out and the line was usually 3 hours long but we rode it 3 times. It was great. My favorite rides include, Magic Mountain, The Jungle Ride, It's a Small World (I know it may annoy some people but it was a big memory from childhood, so I love it still), The Pirate's Carabiean (I have never eaten at the restaurant but have always wanted to) and The Submarine Ride. We all had so much fun. You definitely become a kid again when you go there. It is expensive, especially taking a family there but there are a lot of package deals you can get. I love DisneyLand.
