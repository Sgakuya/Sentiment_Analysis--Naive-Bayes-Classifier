Lived in Portland 11 years, still have enormous affection for it. Besides some good friends, here are the top 10 things I miss about Puddletown: (1) Big green trees everywhere and clean, green environment; (2) low crime rate; (3) Hawthorne St.; (4) good public transportation even to the 'burbs; (5) high rate of political literacy and activism; (6) social tolerance for alternative lifestyles; (7) thriving African music scene and dance clubs; (8) KBOO, one of the best community radio stations in any city; (9) wonderful and inexpensive restaurants everywhere; (10) Powell's City of Books, my all-time favorite bookstore. You may be wondering, with all that great stuff why did I leave? Well, I did get weary of Portland's lack of racial/ethnic diversity (95% white at the time I lived there). But in the end I left because Portland is characterized by the deadliest combination: high housing costs combined with almost no economic opportunity. It's a very tough place to make a living.
