Heads up guys. Last year the Jags were the only team to beat The Coltst at home. This year, they won at home against the Jags, but wait a minute, why did they only beat them by 5? How is this possible? You've got two teams here that are very very decent, and I'm going to tell you now that I am not a Colts fan, but I have great respect for how Manning is leading this team; how in the world could a souped up defense only give their offense enough for a 5 point lead? After boosting up their defense, I think Jacksonville is another team to look at especially when talking about Playoff capabilities. My point is, either the Jagaurs are very very under rated, or the Colts arn't much better this year than they were last year. Superbowl? It looks good, but we'll have to see how well they play against their next opponent. In my opinion it's too early to tell.
