I have no respect for this crook. Even though Powell is still popular with many people, it has slipped considerably - mostly because he heavily supported the case for war when there was no WMD. On the outside, he appears to be an intelligent and well spoken man, but on the inside Powell is a typical high level politican with an obsession for greed and power at whatever costs. He, like many powerful politicians, has no heart, no morality, and no longer knows right from wrong. As a side note: Although Powell is part of Bush's cabinet, he takes sides with many liberal issues such as affirmative action, pro-choice, and gun control.
