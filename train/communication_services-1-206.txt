I have found that verizon has the worst coverage area, all my friends phones work fine where I hunt, but my phone does not work at all. The customer service is worst of all, we have called twice to get an account in two names, this has not yet been done. We have not recieved our rebate since August of last year, we have called once and e-mailed twice with no response. I have called three times to get something done through customer service with the proper code, social security number, phone number and biling address and cell phone numbers, we have two phones, but because my name is not on the account I get nowhere. The person on the account has no time to be put on hold, I do, so I am the one who handles all business during normal working hours. I'm sure that this e-mail will be ignored also, I will not go away!
