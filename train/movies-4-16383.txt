I thought this was a wicked, funny movie, with a lot of witty dialogue and good acting. Sure, it wasn't Oscar caliber, but it was just good dirty fun! Sarah Michelle Gellar made the pefect villainess as the bitch from hell Katherine, while I stare at Ryan Phillippe and wonder how he can be so damn hot! Man, Reese Witherspoon (who's also in the movie as the sweet, virginal nice girl) lucked out bagging him! Selma Blair was hilarious as the twitwad Cecile -she has some of the funniest lines, and so is Christine Baranski as her stuck-up mother. The movie gets a little overdramatic and hammy sometimes and the characters somewhat one-dimensional and predictable, but it's still a fun movie to watch. The music is pretty good, though I normally don't go for that teeny bopper crap.
