One of the worst actors in Hollywood history. Overacts in virtually every frame except in those where he deliberately crawls under the radar, and I can never figure out why he resorts to this option. Maybe to give us all a break. In half of his roles he virturally shouts you to death, and he typically displays nothing in the way of taste and delicacy, ever. Approaches every role in the same emotional register. He also has been in several truly crappy films because he is notorious at picking lame roles in bad scripts. This indicates he's none too smart and that his artistic judgment is suspect. Truly bad in Dog Day, totally histrionic in Scarface, altogether unconvincing in Panic..., predictable in Serpico, out of his depth in Author, Author, and incredibly dreadful in that horrible and inane Scent of a Woman. Furthermore, the man is a shrimpy little midget with a man-sized chip on his shoulder, which makes him seem even more ridiculous. It's hard to believe that someone with so little talent has had such an enduring career. His saving grace is his passable performances in the Godfather films, but those movies sucked too, so that's not saying much.
