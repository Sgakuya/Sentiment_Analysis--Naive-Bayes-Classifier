A worthy parody: intelligent, clever, fast-paced, and likable. Unlike its comrades in modern comedy, this one knows not to be degrading or moronic, but gives its lovable leads- Jay and Bob- a fun send-off that's well-constructed, well-acted, and generally hilarious. It manages to entertain through the credits, even. Definitely the funniest mainstream comedy of 2001, Jay and Bob 's only flaw is its simplicity: It never elevates to the level of supreme farce achieved by masterpieces such as A Fish Called Wanda , and Some Like It Hot . Still, it stands as a worthy successor to such laugh-a-minute escapades as Airplane! .
