'Fanatic', Sean wasn't named ACC player of the year. Although he would've been if the votes din't have to be turned in by late January. However, he did just two days ago get named ACC ATHLETE of the year, which in my opinion is much more impressive because basically that means he got All Around Best Sports Star in the whole ACC. Football, baseball, tennis, rugby, whatever. That means he's not only the best basketball player in the ACC, but the best EVERYTHING in the ACC. I'll take that because if he got hoops player of the year, he probably wouldn't have gotten that honor that only the greatest of athletes like Peppers and Hamm have gotten- 'ACC Athlete of the Year'. Plus, he just got named NBA Summer League MVP. 7 players made the summer League All Star team. 3 were from the Bobcats- Felton, Carrol, and May. No Deron Williams or Paul - what a shocker!- lol! I think May averaged almost 20 and 10 despite playing only 2 minutes of one the games. I know, I know, I'm as shocked as you are.............A Carolina guy doing well in the NBA???????...............No!, it couldn't be true! HA HA! How stupid do the Lakers and Raptors feel right now?- Villanueva and Bynum?! Thank God, Bickerstaff and Johnson have some sense. And WHATTA YA KNOW! - after all that talk about Felton being the third best point guard in the draft............. this is a quote from the New York Times, It's early, but so far, Raymond Felton's game seems better suited for the NBA than Deron Williams and Chris Paul's. WHAT A SHOCKER! Who would've thought? A Tarheel better for the NBA than a Wake or Illinois guy?!?!? NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!? Seriously though, I'd draft a Carolina guy over ANYBODY................even if I hadn't seem him play. In other words, I'd bet my life people will struggle to remember who Bogut is while May is being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Remember I said that, because it is sooooooo going to come true . Wait and see. I just knocked on wood. Sean May sucks....... ......wink wink.
