The woman has a presence that you can't deny. Whatever she exudes...sexuality, charisma, weirdness, what have you......the woman commands a room. I think she is very talented, she has proved she can act. She is a GOOD person with a very kind heart. So what if her personal life is a little messed up? Maybe she hates her father because he's a bad father....ever think of that? Maybe growing up in a broken household has made her work much harder at working through her personal issues than the average person. She doesn't abuse the media...the media abuses her. If you're tired of hearing about her...then stop buying magazines with her on the cover.......change the channel....quit watching her movies. Nobody is holding a gun to your head. And after thinking about it, if Angelina Jolie was my next door neighbor, I would welcome it. Unlike some people, I've heard she is one of the nicest human beings the world has to offer. She doesn't judge others the way SOME people do.
