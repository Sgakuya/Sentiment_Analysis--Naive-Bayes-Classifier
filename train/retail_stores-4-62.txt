Barnes and Noble is a big improvement over the tiny B.Dalton and Waldenbooks bookstores I remember growing up. The selection is pretty impressive overall, and the atmosphere is very pleasant and conducive to browsing. I love the comfortable chairs and couches placed throughout the stores, and it's nice to have access to a coffee shop (in most stores). Surprisingly enough, I've gotten some pretty good service at Barnes and Noble, both in the store and over the phone. Salesclerks are fairly knowlegdeable and friendly. Certain sections stand out as being especially good: magazines/newspapers, travel, and audiobooks. Barnes and Noble is one chain I'm glad to see popping up all over.
