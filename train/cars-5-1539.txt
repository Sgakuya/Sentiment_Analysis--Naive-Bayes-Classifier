I just got my new beetle in feb of this year and so far this is the best car ive owned.. i had a toyota tercel(three engines in two years) then i had a golf(constant tranny problems including jerky gear changes..) i have never gotten so much attention driving a car as i do this one of course there are little problems but every car manufacturer has little issues no ones perfect and the dealership i take my car to is always tip top and very fast and friendly. there name is bozzani vw in covina ca and if you have a new beetle under warranty that is the place to go. awesome people..the people who owned my beetle didnt take care of it so when i got it it wasnt in the greatest shape..luckily it is still under warranty. i got the little things fixed. the thermostat the air conditioner and a few other things at no charge. they always try to find a way so that i dont have to pay for things and if i do they make it up with car washes and great service. i bought a glx and i am in the process of turning it into a show car ..it will look awesome its black/black/black leather....its the best car ive ever owned...and i mean that....
