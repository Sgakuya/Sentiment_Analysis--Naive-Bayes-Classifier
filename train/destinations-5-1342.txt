A delightful country. Frightfully expensive though: I stayed at a 'cheap' hostel in Geneva back in my student days, and despite skimping on meals, drinks, etc...it still cost more than pigging out in France or Italy. Those pretty mountains, and being outside the EU, makes for much higher prices. Also, during turbulent economic times people tend to stash their money in Switzerland, so it's probably even more expensive nowdays: the Swiss Franc is the strongest currency in the world. This tells you it's a pretty nice place to live though, what with all the money from Saudi sheiks and Russian 'biznessmen' being recycled there. The people are quiet, but you can have a good time there, especially if you like winter sports and hiking. Maybe not the attractions of France or Italy, but fewer of the problems too. A five-star country-if you can afford it.
