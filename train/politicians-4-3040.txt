Remember him? The president who was in charge when we (1) weren't attacked on a grand scale domestically (unless you count Timothy McVeigh?), (2) had a prosperous economy and job market, (3) wasn't villified by every first-world nation in the world, (5) didn't begin a war based on a lie and kill 10,000 civilians and (5) managed to provide late-night television with hundreds of jokes about sex. Anyone else sad the 90's are over? My investment numbers sure are. . . I love it how people try to parade Clinton as a whacko leftist - he was as much a friend of big-business as any Republican I've ever seen. I miss that redneck dirtbag. (Can't believe I would ever say that.) Of course Clinton takes heat for not being able to be discreet (a must for policians in any age) but the vilification of him is nothing but pure amusement to me. Clinton-haters have got to live with the fact that the 90's rocked- He had a bl@wjob and lied! WAAAAH! He is responsible for every attack/military failure! WAAAH! Bill Clinton will be remembered as a dirtbag who got away with it- deal with it, folks.
