Chicago is a great American city! It has to be one of the, if not, The Best city in the USA. It is a large city that is rather easy to get around. It has a distinct look and feel to it with the most amazing Archiecture you'll find in the US. There's plenty to see and do. There are lots of people from all over that flock there and it has some of the best bars and restaurants you'll ever go to. It's a city on a lake that has a beach. How cool is that? It's a big city without the stuffiness or aggressiveness of a New York. I cant say enough about how much I like the city. There also are some really good, cool people who grew up and come from the city. Meet them and you'll realize they're just good folks. People say the weather is a drawback, and from what I've seen and heard about it, it is, but that doesnt distract from this town being a wonderful-all-around place.
