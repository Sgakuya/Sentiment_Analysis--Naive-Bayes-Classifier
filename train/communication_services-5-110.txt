I have subscribed to MCI for many years and have never had a problem with my service. I especially find their website and Online Account feature to be very helpful. I just log into my account online and pay my bill each month. All of my account information is listed on this site and anytime I have ever sent an e-mail to customer service from this site I have received a reply back within an hour. Not only are they fast, but they have always provided me with answers and have been very helpful. I have used many companies online services because I work with websites and I like to see what other companies have to offer. I have to say that MCI has provided me with the best online experience of all the companies I have ever dealt with. Not only is their website easy to use and full of information, but to receive a response to my e-mail as quickly as I have with MCI is remarkable. I wish all online services worked this well.
