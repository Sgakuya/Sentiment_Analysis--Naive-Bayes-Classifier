I shop at the store in Roseville. The prices are fantastic. I have taken the Winco receipt to Safeway and Raley's and I find that overall I am saving about 30% by shopping at Winco. Even brand name milk is almost 1/2 off. The employees are pleasant, but as you bag your own you don't have much interaction with them. My only complaint is the produce. It's as though they buy produce which other stores have rejected. And you can't always tell from the outside. Almost every week I get at least one bad piece of produce, which is rotten inside. This is just unacceptable. I think I wll stop buying produce at Winco and go to Raley's for produce I can rely on. But I can't stand having to stop and shop at two stores. Other than that, I'm totally satisfied.
