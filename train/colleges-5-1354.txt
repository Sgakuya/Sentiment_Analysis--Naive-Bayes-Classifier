I graduated from Johns Hopkins (B.A. English, '99) and am in my third year at Columbia Law School. The undergraduate research opportunities at Johns Hopkins are unparalleled and JHU's placement success rate into graduate schools is probably the best in the country. In 2001, 100% of Hopkins grads applying to law school were admitted to at least one of their choices. In 2001, 93% of JHU first time medical school applicants were admitted (and 89% of re-applicants were admitted). I don't know of any college with more impressive graduate school placement statistics. Johns Hopkins grads are highly represented in America's leading law firms, corporations, government offices and hospitals. Hopkins kicks ass!
