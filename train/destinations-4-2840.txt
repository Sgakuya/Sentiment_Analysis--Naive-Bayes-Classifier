Lived here for 9 months now. My favorite things about Philly: (1) my neighborhood; (2) lots of public transportation options; (3) great cultural life (Museum of Art, Fairmount Park, South St., concerts, clubs, etc.); (4) city is dirty yet surprisingly beautiful; (5) so much history (and not just white male history); (6) real diversity (racial, ethnic, political, etc.); (7) political awareness and activism. My gripes: horrifyingly bad local services and government; the rude and obnoxious (who are either in the majority or minority depending on what kind of day I've had); ridiculously low environmental consciousness; crime; corrupt politicians; parochial social attitudes including very narrow and conventional ideas about sexuality and lifestyle; in-your-face brand of sexism and disrespect of women. In 9 months, this place has grown on me...but not sure yet whether I want to stay.
