Acadia National Park is beautiful! It has my two favorite land features, mountains and ocean, in one park. The park is situated on an island in the eastern most part of Maine, and is a very nice area that is heavily wooded. You can drive to the summit of Mt. Cadillac for some really spectacular views. According to the plaque at the top, it is the very first place in the U.S. to see the sun rise. Unfortunately since it's so far north, the water is very cold and isn't suitable for swimming, and the warmer mountain lakes within the park are used as freshwater drinking supplies, so swimming isn't allowed. It's great for boating and kyacking though. On the island is the town of Bar Harbor (or Bah Hahbah as the locals pronounce it) which has great shops and restaurants.
