I'll never understand why this state isn't ranked closer to the top. South Carolina is unique in many ways. Part of the reason it received high marks from me is because of the mild weather. It does get brutal for a few months of the year but I'd rather suffer through the heat for a few months then struggle with the cold in the Northeast and Midwest. The beaches are nice and there are many golf courses near the coastal areas. There are many sexy women with nice accents. Many that I would like to get to know a little better. In fact, I was amazed how many beautiful women there are but, then again, it is the Old South. One thing I did notice about the people. They seem very friendly but almost seem as if they might just be putting on an act. What I like about the state is that it is less transient than the bordering states of N.C. and esp. Georgia. By the way, I've heard some disparaging remarks about this state and I can tell you I don't want South Carolina to be just like every other state. Hopefully it will stick to its southern tradition. And, as always, if you're going to bash this fine state then don't go there.
