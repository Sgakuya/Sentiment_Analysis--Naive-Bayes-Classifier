Adam Vinetiri can Kick well in the snow or rain but a lot of the time when it's sunny he misses like in one patriots home game he kicked a 50 yarder in the cross bars and could barely see a few weeks later he missed a 29 yarder in miami that I thought was strange and I also think that's why he is hardly ever picked for the pro bowl since in hawii it's sunny and he never gets it through the cross bars maybe he sould get a visor or something so he could see better if he doesn't have one He is also great at winning superbowls he beat the rams and in the 2003-2004 superbowl against the panthers he won the superbowl for the patriots maybe the nfl should move the pro bowl to the northern region so they could have Adam vineteri be the prow bowl kicker.
