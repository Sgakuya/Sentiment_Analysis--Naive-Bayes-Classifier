Good actor, bad name. It's RALPH as in RALLLFFF. R-A-L-P-H, that spells Ralph. Ph is pronounced as the letter f. It sounds like eff. His name is Rrralph. Not Raif. Not Rayf. Not Rayfe. Not Rolf. It's Ralph. Stop trying to sound so Hollywood, Ralph. Ah, I've recently been informed that in jolly old England Ralph's name is, indeed, pronounced Rafe. Hmm, well, here in the stereotypical States Ralph is a fairly working-class name. I can just picture the scene when King Ralph bellies up to the bowling alley bar in downtown Milwaukee & say's to his buddies my name is Rafe from now on. Not a pretty scene...but one I'm sure that Mr. Feiness could pull off convincingly. He is a fine actor.
