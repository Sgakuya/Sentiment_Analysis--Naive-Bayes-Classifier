During his tenure as senator, Mr Kerry has done little to alleviate the financial burdens of the American taxpayer. Candidates will say almost anything during a campaign but with Sen Kerry there is a voting record which contradicts his current rhetoric. For example, on the campaign trail, Kerry is for Ethanol. He said I'm for Ethanol and I think it's a very important partial ingredient of the overall mix of alternative and renewable fuels we ought to commit to. (MSNBC / DNC, Democratic Presidential Candidate Debate, Des Moines, IA, 11/24/03) Yet Kerry twice voted against tax breaks for Ethanol. (S. Con. Res. 18, vote # 44, 3/23/93. S. Con. Res. 18, vote # 68, 3/24/93) He also voted twice to increase the liability on Ethanol, making it equal to regular gasoline. (S.517, vote # 87, 4/25/02. S.14, vote # 208, 6/5/03) Sen Kerry has voted against a balanced budget amendment at least 5 times. Other fiscally irresponsible votes include at least 3 key votes against lowering overall spending. (S.J. Res. 225, vote # 45, 3/25/86. S.J. Res. 41, vote # 48, 3/1/94. H.J. Res. 1, vote # 98, 3/2/95. S.J. Res. 1, vote # 24, 3/4/97. H.J. Res. 1, vote # 158, 6/6/96) Sen Kerry voted at least 5 times to raid the Social Security Trust Fund. (H.R. 3128, vote # 379, 12/19/85. H.R. 3545, vote # 419, 12/21/87. H. Con. Res. 268, vote # 167, 6/6/88. H.R. 2264, vote # 247, 8/6/93. H.R. 2014, voye # 211, 7/31/97) Sen Kerry voted against a $1.35 trillion tax cut package to reduce income tax rates, alleviate the marriage penalty, and gradually repeal the estate tax. (H.R. 1836, vote # 165, 5/23/01) When the tax cut passed, he voted to reduce the size of the cut (H. Con. Res. 83, vote # 69, 4/4/01) He voted against reducing federal taxes by $792 billion over 10 years. (S. 1429, vote # 247, 7/30/99) In 1998 he voted against eliminating the marriage penalty relief for married taxpayers with combined income of less than $50,000 per year, saving taxpayers $46 billion over 10 years. (S. 1415, vote # 154, 6/10/98) Most small companies are sole proprietorships or subchapter S corporations so they pay taxes at individual income tax rates. In 2001 Sen Kerry voted against an amendment providing $70 billion for tax credits for small business to purchase health insurance. (H. Con. Res. 83, vote # 83, 4/5/01) He voted at least 5 times against capping punitive damages for small businesses. (H.R. 956, vote # 153, 5/8/95. H.R. 956, vote # 156, 5/9/95. H.R. 956, vote # 44, 3/20/96, S. 648, vote # 184, 7/7/98. S. 648, vote # 188, 7/9/98) No politician is all bad and a few times Sen Kerry has reversed his decisions in favor of the taxpayer. (none of the above) However, the few times that he has voted to lower taxes or give tax credits are far outweighed by his hundreds of other votes which either favored raising taxes or his voting not to cut them. Talk is cheap, but for the American taxpayer a Kerry presidency, according to his voting record, will be very expensive.
