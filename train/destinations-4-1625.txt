Israel is a nation with an incredible priveledge therefore an incredible responsibility.As I write they are at the crossroads once again fo it is 2 years past the first jubilee of the remnants return to Jerusalem.At a time when many nations are in inexcapable debt I am pondering the mathematical logic in the laws of jubilee. Abraham had 3 wives each of which gave birth to a nation- Sarah gave birth to Israel which is Zion Hagar gave birth to Ishmael which is Islam Keturah gave birth to Midian who took a parcel of land and called it the same, it was there that Moses recieved the covenant and the daughter of Jethro the Kenite(who is the eyes of Jesse) for his wife. In as much as many things are being said by Israel and Ishmael about Jerusalam, where is Midian and what has he got to say about the city of Malkizedek?
