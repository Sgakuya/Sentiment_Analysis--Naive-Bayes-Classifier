Sholay is an Indian western that actually holds up, minus a few screwball scenes. The fact that no one can believe Thakur Singh is armless is besides the point. Add to that the unusual freindshio between Jai and Veeru that results in Veeru mounting on top of Jai in the first song of the movie is odd, but not that bad. Oh, there is a memorabale death that occurs, but strangely you wonder about these two characters and how deep their freindship runs. So what is good about this movie? The acting is actually actually quite good for an Indian movie. Amitabh Bachan really has those moments where he could give old Clint Eastwood a run for his money in the laconic stranger role. Action scenes are top notch and worth watching.. Gun fights. Some good songs added to spicen things up and you have a perfect mix of a movie.
