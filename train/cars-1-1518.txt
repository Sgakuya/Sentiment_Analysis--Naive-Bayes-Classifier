Awful! I had a 1992 Saturn SL2. It was the worst car I have ever owned. I bought it used; it had 50,000 miles on it. This car had so much wrong with it, the problems were well known and the manufacturer refused to take responsibility. I won't bore you with a complete list of the problems. BUT- for example, I had to replace the alternator, and the battery, three times in 26,000 miles. This car had an oil leak (hemorrhage) that the dealer and four independent mechanics could not fix. I spent about $3,000 dollars in repairs until I got fed up with this car and traded it in for a wonderful Nissan Altima. I don't know why I hung onto the Saturn for nearly 2 full years. Saturn did not back up its product; I also notice that they have quit mentioning customer satisfaction in their ads. I think their fan base has eroded.
