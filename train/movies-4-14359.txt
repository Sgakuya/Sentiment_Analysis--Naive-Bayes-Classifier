i have seen some pretty horrible stuff, but this movie might be the worst. not to say that it isn't well-made, or that the characters aren't totally compelling -because if they weren't, i wouldn't have had such an effect on me, positively or negatively- but it is an unrelentingly dark, perverted, and ultimately desperate vision of apathy and social and personal decay. bleahk. hope you've got a strong stomach if you endeavor to enjoy this well presented nightmare. i have to wonder, what's aronofsky got to prove with all this horror? at least in 'pi', the plot made all the darkness necessary. hey darren, why not write something about fuzzy bunnies, or christmas? just on a lark.
