Kirk Hinrich is my favorite basketball player of all time! This season he was AMAZING!! He is great at about everything. He can play the 1,2, and 3. He is a great guard that can pass, handle the ball, as well as take some great outside shots. He is so quick on defense that there are few that can get by him. He, unlike many other players, can see the whole court, so he is able to make great plays. He has the ability to finnish the plays that his teamates set up for him. As a guard myself I hope to be half as good as he is. I think is AWESOME, and would have loved to see him leave KU with a National title, but I really hope he has a great, long NBA career so I can come to his games and cheer him on! Maybe even get to meet him some day :)
