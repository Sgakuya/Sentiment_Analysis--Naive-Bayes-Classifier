Imaginativly shot, o.k.acting bit what it lacked most was the story and its ability to draw you in. I felt not one thing for any of the characters. What was memorable were the way too few comedic moments through out the picture. Large animals stepping on mines, Marky Mark calling his girl on a cell phone in the middle of battle, these touches are great. George Clooney once again proves to be an all right actor who is alot of fun to watch and adds alot of energy and wit to all his characters. One of my favorite directors, Spike Jonze, plays a role in this picture and does surprisingly well. All in all this is an o.k. movie. Worth watching once if you have nothing at all else to do.
