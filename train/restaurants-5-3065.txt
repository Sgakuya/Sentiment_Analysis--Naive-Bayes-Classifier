ok so ive worked at cold stone for a year now...literly , i started workin ther when we first opened an i LOVE IT, i mean readin yall comment about cold stone sayin its nasty an u got poor service, im really sorry.but just becuase ur visit was bad doesnt mean our franchise is...if you came to the many ones in the north carolina area.....cary/durham/chapel hill you would change your opinion on cold stone, if you got bad service im really sorry, if the people were rude its not like that at all in all of them, to each its own, and it makes me frustrated that my fellow coworkers in your areas made your visit bad b/c they didnt keep up with the store ,or were rude or nasty toward you...thats not the way cold stone is supposed to be. As far as yall not liking the taste of the ice cream, i've been workin there for a year, an gettin shift treats each shift....yes there are some flavors that id rather eat from another place,and yes the mix-ins are a huge part in the cold stone expirence, without those you dont get the whole enjoyment of coming to cold stone, but the ice cream is still good, its homemade there in the store, maybe becuase yall got bad service when you went you used the ice cream which u might not of disliked to make your expirence sound worse.But on behalf of those cold stone employees that made your expireince crappy, i apologize for them, an ask you to consider not bashing the whole cold stone franchise!Yes i agree that the prices are a bit high but the quality is well worth it and the fact that the emplpyees are happy an polite an there for to do as much as they can for you, and we try to make your ice cream expirience as enjoyable as possible. As for tips, its part of our payment, most of us get paid minimum wage + tips so we really appriciate them, we dont try to sing like a professional singer, its jus for fun an to show appriciation for the tip...an to make yall smile, we dont do it becuase we feel the need to sing...ha, and if you wish for us not to sing, jus politely tell us to save the singing for the next costumer that tips an go about your way....ALso we do have floats, smoothies,milkshakes, etc...we have just bout everything, so if u have anymore questions or comments...jus email me at inlovewiththeboy42@yahoo.com thanks an for those who commented good things bout cold stone , thanks an keep commin back , we love yall! ....Casey
