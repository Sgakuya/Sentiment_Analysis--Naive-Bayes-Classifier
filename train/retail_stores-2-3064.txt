The first time I entered the store absolutely nobody was in site and when I did see someone they didnt ask me if I needed help just walked on by as if I wasnt there. Products are all comparable. They have a lot of electronics but the help can do a whole lot better. Willie_A It does make a difference otherwise they wouldnt have so many and you wouldnt be going around rating each and every one fairly. If they were all the same they would probably be called Depot Max Staples. anyways I'd rather not shop there until they fix their customer service skills. A lot of people differ in what a office store should have I like good selection & customer service.
