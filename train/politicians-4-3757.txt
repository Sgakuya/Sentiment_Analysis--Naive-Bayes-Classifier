I would just like to say that I am so fed up with Al Sore wanting to recount the votes until he is decleared Pres. elect. The media is totally blind to this, I just wish someone had the balls, other than Rush Limbaugh or G. Gordon Liddy, to take a stand and finally declare what the rest of the country already knows: GWB has already won 3 times. In my book that is declared a win. Who in their right mind would want another Clinton in the White House! Clinton is an idiot and Gore is too. And what the hell is this dimpled ballot arguement about. It's just like that old saying A drowning man will grab a toothpick if it floats by. Al Gore is drowning and dimpled ballots are his toothpicks.
