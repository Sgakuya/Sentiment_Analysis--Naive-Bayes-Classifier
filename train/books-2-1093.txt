*extreme shudder* I never really liked these books. There was something that seemed so phoney about all of the characters. I would try to imagine myself as a teenager and it was nothing like these girls. The story lines were always predictable and cheezy. They are the Harlequin Romance novels for adolescents. Sure it gets them reading, but it's mindless reading with very little depth. If you absolutely need to get your kids to read then sure, but it would be an insult to buy these for an young and avid reader. And I don't see the girls as such good role models because it seems as though they have simple decisions to make with simple answers. It never seems difficult for them to decide to do the right thing, when in the real world it is.
