Elgin Baylor was the finest palyer I have seen in the 35 years I have watched basketball. Before his knee injury, he was an unstoppable player and as teammate Tom Hawkins said, 'He could post up Bill Russell, pass like Magic and dribble as well as the best gueards in the league. Wilt once said in an interview (when taling about how many players he'd seen dunking over Kareem), 'no one dunked over me - I still get nightmares thinking about the time Elgin Baylor did' Bill Russell said that he has what he calls his 'firsts' - never saying which player he thinks is the best, he said Jordan and Baylor were the 2 in his list of 'firts'.
