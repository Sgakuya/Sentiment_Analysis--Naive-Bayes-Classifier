Before reading this fascinating and horrifying book, I knew nothing about the Congo. And that kind of ignorance is one of the primary reasons Hochschild wrote King Leopold's Ghost - most people just aren't aware of the tragic slaughter of millions and millions of Africans around the turn of the century. King Leopold of Belgium basically set himself up as the owner of the Congo (now known as Zaire), and the system he established there for harvesting ivory and rubber was responsible for suffering and death on a scale that rivals more well-known atrocities like the Holocaust. There's an amazing novel called Riddley Walker (by Russell Hoban) that opens with a Bible quote that kept popping into my head as I read KLG, Jesus has said: Blessed is the lion that the man will devour, and the lion will become man. And loathsome is the man that the lion will devour, and the lion will become man. I'm not sure I entirely understand that quote, but to me it resembles something Carl Jung often addresses in his psychoanalytic work - the capacity of people for evil, which is especially troubling when people view evil as something that exists outside themselves as opposed to something that actively exists inside all of us. Either you're going to recognize and incorporate the dark side into yourself in a way you can control, or you're going to be affected or possessed by it in a way you can't control. If you end up reading King Leopold's Ghost, I recommend reading or re-reading Conrad's Heart of Darkness, too - taken together, both books are even more powerful.
