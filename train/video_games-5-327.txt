Kings Quest V was the first fantasy game I had played on a computer years ago. Not only was the story fascinating, but the beautiful graphics and music took me away while playing. My first version of this game was on floppy disks, but now with this CD version they have included voice dialogue. Then comes along Kings Quest VI which, as I recall reading, was the first game to utilize a fully animated opening sequence. The sequence, still amazing to watch today, laid the framework for a fantastic game which features incredible voice-acting. The graphics are very similar to KQV. Kings Quest VII really opened the color palette, featuring bright graphics and animation similar to that of a Disney movie. KQVII is just as enjoyable to play as it's predecessors. I am not going to review the earlier Kings Quest games, but it is neat to see how the entire series evolved. Kings Quest IV was hailed as a musical breakthrough in it's time, as it was one of the first games to use the Roland audio board. All in All, this is a must-own for Kings Quest fans.
