How can a team that goes to the NFC Championship game 3 years in a row be just an average team? Hmmmm, I know they aren't the best, obviously, but average?? I would think it takes quite an above average team to get as far as they have 3 straight years, albeit losing in the conference championship each year, so I give them a 4, a good solid team. For those that rate the team a 1 because of the fans, ummm that's plain ignorant. This isn't a poll about the fans, is it? It's a poll about the TEAM, which has NOTHING to do with the fans. Start your own poll for worst, obnoxious fans in the league and then give them a 1.
