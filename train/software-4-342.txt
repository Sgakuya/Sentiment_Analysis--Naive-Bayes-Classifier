Say what you will, Windows XP is still the best desktop out there. Yes, it has problems, but show me an operating system which does not. I manage a network of Windows 2000, Windows XP, Linux and FreeBSD. I run Windows XP on my desktop and laptop. No, Windows XP is not limited. It is however dumbed down a little so the average user won't shoot himself in the foot. However the extra features are accessible. There isn't anything that Windows 2000 can do that XP cannot. Basically, no crashed for over a year. I do not particularly like the new control panel, so I do switch back to classic control panel. I also do like icons on my desktop, so I re-enable my computer and related, which ends up looking a lot like Windows 2000. I do not think that the default theme is the most pleasing. The buttons and toolbars are too big and rounded. I can see how this would be a good theme for novice users, but I prefer thin lines and small buttons. I run at high resolution as well (1800x1600 usually) and prefer a flatter interface.
