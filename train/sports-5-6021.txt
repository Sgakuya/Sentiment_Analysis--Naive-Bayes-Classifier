He has one of the best free throw percentages in the country, something which all basketball players should strive for. He has a great shot. Contrary to popular belief, he is a very versatile player and is able to drive to the basket when his three-point game is off (just ask his opponents in the acc... they'll tell you). Another underrated skill of his is his defense, which has improved greatly since he came to Duke. Rashad McCants, I'm sure, will remember having the ball stolen from him at the end of the Duke-UNC game in 2004 to seal the victory for the Blue Devils. While jeering at opponents is common practice in college basketball, it isn't common to be so insulted as to force an opposing coach (i.e. Gary Williams) to talk to the fans about their behavior. As for his attidue, I applaud the way that he does what it takes to get himself and his teammates fired up to play their best game. I'm sixteen years old, and I've been watching Duke teams since I was seven. He is one of the greatest Duke players that I have watched, and I'm sure he'll only get better over the next to years. And in my memory, he's also the hottest player I've seen play at Duke. Go JJ!!!
