I purchased a shared plan with one standard phone (came with the plan) and a Nokia 6100 for myself ($350.value). My need was to have service in Denver CO, Boise ID, Spokane WA and the Seattle/Bellingham WA area. The Nokia's contact and schedule capabilities are excellent. The service has been a problem since day one. I had no bars of service at my Spokane Location, however was assured that Cingular had towers going up by May or June of 2004 in Northwest Spokane. While working out of Boise Idaho, I may get as many as three bars, calls drop regularly, and the reception is broken. Initially, I tried different phones, returning them within the 15 day required time period. There was no significant improvement. I've had a number of technical service tickets on the Nokia. Because of the poor service I kept my Qwest plan active, and have to rely on it at least temporarily, in hopes that Cingular does have improved reception/towers/service. The rollover plan is excellent, so I persevere in trying to successfully use Cingular. I've asked about an even better phone, however can't upgrade until one year into the contract. I have no problem breaking the contract and paying the fee, however am hoping for the promised improvements to happen soon. BTW, the cheaper phone, the one that came with the contract plan, actually has more bars than the Nokia 6100 in the Seattle/Birch Bay area. SUMMARY: More expensive is not necessarily better! and, mergers may not improve cell service.
