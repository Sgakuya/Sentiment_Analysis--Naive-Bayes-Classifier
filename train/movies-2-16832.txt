Everyone told me this movie would be a tear jerker...but the only thing making me want to cry in this movie was Keanu Reeves' painful attempt at a deep character. His dynamics are non existent and his emotions are not only limited but quite few. His character was wholly contrived. When he speaks it's as if he has someone telling him to say as he goes. The script was flat and the story was so incredibly cliche and predictable. Charlize was beautiful and her dynamics and show of emotion were enough to make me feel the emotional parts of the story...but only when Keanu wasn't there to remind me I was watching a not-so-fabulous movie. The soundtrack was nice and I liked the costumes...although I'm wondering why they chose to highlight the fact that Sara Dever (Charliz's character) only wanted to eat Vegan food YET she fried eggs (Vegans don't do eggs) and had a dead bird on her table at Thanksgiving? Only see this movie if you're too young to care about quality acting or the movie happens to be free for you.
