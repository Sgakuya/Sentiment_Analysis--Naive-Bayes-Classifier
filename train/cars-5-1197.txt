I recently purchased a 1999 3.2TL. Amazing amount of car for the money. For only a fraction more than an Accord of the same period, you can get a loaded entry-level luxury car in the 3.2TL. The 225hp engine delivers fantastic acceleration, and the Sport Shifter offers the performance and *most* of the fun of a manual transmission (my only partial gripe is that a manual was not offered on the 3.2TL back in 1999). Very quiet on the highway, and the leather and tastefully-done wood grain on the dash and door inserts let you know that you're truly driving a well-made luxury car. A Bose sound system is standard, and navigation system is optional. All of this, plus Honda's famous quality and reliability, make for a well-rounded blend of performance and luxury that won't break your budget.
