As an LA resident I detest this woman. She sees everything in terms of skin color. There is little that takes place in her universe that has not been caused by bigotry and discrimination by whites. In short, she is an intolerable pig. I have no sympathy for anyone who would make excuses about the riots in '92 as she did on national television; the worst type of shoddy race hustling. I would have rated her lower but I give her credit for obtaining a college degree and achieving a good deal of success as one of about a dozen children who was raised by a single mother. Ironically, her success in America serves to disprove the very Soweto-like conditions she sees lurking around every corner in this country.
