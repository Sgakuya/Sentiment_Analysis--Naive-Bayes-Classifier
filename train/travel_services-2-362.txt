I am basing my opinion on the one time I used America West Airlines. They were the cheapest for a flight into Minneapolis at the time. I spent more time in the plane waiting for it to take off and land at the terminal than I did on the actual flight. I had an infant with me, which didn't make the experience any better. They also lost my stroller on the way to Minneapolis (they kept it up front, but they didn't have it when I got off the plane). Needless to say, I had a heck of a time trying to cart an infant through the airport and had to purchase a new stroller (they never did find it). They also changed gate numbers/flight numbers almost every time I went to board a plane. Next time I won't go by cheapest price, I'll stick to the major airlines.
