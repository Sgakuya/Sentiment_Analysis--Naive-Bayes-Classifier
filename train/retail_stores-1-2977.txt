I Had a custom engagement ring made during one of Kay's supposed big diamond sales last year before the holidays. First off when my fiancee brought the ring for it's ESP checkup, they said one of the side diamonds was loose & they would need to ship it out for repair! I spent over $14K for this ring & wasn't about to ship it out. She ended up bringing it to a local Jeweler who found both side diamonds loose and repaired the ring on the spot! While there we had an appraisal done only to find the $14K ring was only worth $10K!!! What a rip-off! Never again. Dont buy from Kay Jewelers. They lie and tell you you're getting a deal..untrue! Go to a reputable jeweler. Also, I had financed a portion of it with them and they tried to insist I had a bounced check. They charged my account a penalty and an NSF fee of $49! After being tossed from one rude Customer service rep to the next for three consecutive days, I finally went to the store and had a sales rep call the finance dept for me to resolve the problem!
