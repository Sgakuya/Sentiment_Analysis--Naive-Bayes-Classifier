I haven't read Goodnight Moon as a child--I only flipped through it after watching the Simpsons (and, yeah, the Christopher Walken thing was hilarious, I couldn't get that out of my mind when reading it), but I can see where this would be a good children's book. Very simple sentence structure for young children, very bright and basic colors for the illustrations, and very clear in word-image identification (like, having a picture of that object by the one phrase on the page that says goodnight insert object here to help children learn objects. I can see this as one of those books that are one of the first that a child can read on their own.
