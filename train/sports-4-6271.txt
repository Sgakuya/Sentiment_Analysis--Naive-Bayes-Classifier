First off, I have to say that I hate everything about CRAPOLINA, yeah that's right. I hate their pansy shade of sissy blue, I hate their goat mascot and I hate their idiotic fans. CRAPOLINA is the biggest joke in the college world (remember last year when the players shaved their heads? ha, need I say more?) they constantly fall on their faces and their coward fans run and hide when they do. Duke is superior in every way to CAROWHINA, I know and every unc fan knows it to. Roy Williams is a pointy nosed, stump jumping, backwoods, pig humping, goat roaping hillbilly with the iq of a rock. He is a two faced traitor and I don't know why stupid unc fans adore him. I wouldn't, look at what he said about not caring about unc when he was at Kansas...duh. But unc fans are not known to be the brainy types. Unc sucks, their fans suck more. MeCants is a project punk, Fatty Felton is a reject from the hood and Gay May is a fat bloated moron. Doherty should be the coach, he was 100% unc material. Dean Smith was a joke too, a fat country hick with no brains at all. CRAPOLINA's winning streak will soon fall, just like they always do and then all unc fans will say what they always do what until next season or we almost did it or better we played as good as Duke. Royal blue is the only shade of blue and Duke is the elite school of the ACC. CRAPOLINA BLOWS....
