I was charged 700 dollars for an early termination fee. My bill is now over 900 because of 20 dollar a month late fees for not paying it in full. So even if I make a 100 dollar payment a month they are charging me 20 for not paying it in full. I called one day to tell them the manager of my local retail office said she would waive the fee because of the reason I was ending my contract(moved and no service at new residence). The 800 number said they could not honor her word and transfered me to a loyalty department which i held for about 45 min.! to no avail it seems im stuck with a 900+ bill on my credit with late payments every month!
