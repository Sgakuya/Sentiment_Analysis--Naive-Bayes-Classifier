As a diet drinker I've learned to tolerate the taste of this, it's not THAT bad, but it's strange. There are better diet sodas on the market. Diet Dr. Pepper is AMAZINGLY close to the original. And my personal favorite is the recently released Diet Vanilla Coke. There is a slight difference in taste from the original but it's astonishingly close, the vanilla flavor really helps to give this a smooth taste that's missing in most diet sodas. I recommend it to Diet Coke and Vanilla Coke drinkers alike, you'll love it, and this is coming from someone who was a Vanilla Coke-oholic until the diet version came out. It's certainly better than that nasty Diet Coke with Lemon Dish Detergent...I wish they'd take that out of the vending machines in my dorm and replace it with Diet Vanilla Coke.
