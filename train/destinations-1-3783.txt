one of many pretty places in wisconsin. unfortunately this town is overrun with egocentric students. yes, students are a protected class in madison. worst of all city government is often filled with former nutty students. in addition to the students, as the capital, madison is filled with bureaucrats. better yet many are america-hating socialists! what more could you want?? oh yes there are the lakes. well in a state with over 11,000 lakes there are about 10,995 other choices. madison would in no way be the best place to live in wisconsin. the criteria used to create the best place to live stupidity is wholly unscientific. but of course bike trails are more important to students than jobs. lived there and left........
