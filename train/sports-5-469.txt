I wish I could rate him higher. Put down the crack pipes, negative people. This guy is one of the best pitchers to ever take the mound. He's a GIANT among men. Let's see....Phillies. They sucked and choked until Curt. Then, World Series. D'Backs? They blew until Curt. Then, World Series. Red Sox? Sucked, choked, gagged, cursed and generally screweed at every turn until Curt. Then, World Series. Anyone here not see the trend? He makes average teams CHAMPIONS. This guy is worth 10 times what the Sox are paying him. And my buddy met him and said he was a hell of a nice guy. And now he's paying out of pocket for a whole family to live in Boston from New Orleasns for the next year? Plus his ALS work? Please. We need more guys like Schilling in the world, let alone baseball. When he retires, let's elect him to something. End of story? Curt Schilling is a cut above. That bloody sock? Priceless. He's a first vote H.O.F. Thank you for ending the 86 year drought, Curt. You and big Papi are the best!
