AI was a movie with a lot of philosophic ambition behind it. It started out with the question should we love what has been made to love us thus begging the question of our own relationship toward God. Then, the movie turned into a classic Cain and Abel plot. And, like Cain being banished, so was the robot-child. After that, the film took on some typical anti-Christian bashing when Spielberg added Jesus' famous words Let he who is without sin cast the first stone to be used as mockery. And again, Christians were ridiculed when a robot-gigolo claimed he picked up many female customers as they came outside from a church. Hollywood never misses a chance to put down Christians. The film went on with the Pinocchio plot, with the robot-child looking for the 'Blue Fairy'; while insinuated that having faith for over two thousand years (another Christian reference) was pointless. In the end, the robot-child was not saved by his faith, dreams, or love, but rather, the robots that replaced 'evil' mankind. Spielberg's movie may be very touching and caused philosophical debate, but the anti-Christian sentiments were uncalled for and quite rude. And, the overall message of the film was that belief in 'God' is fruitless, and mankind is a horrible race that deserves to be extinct; this is what Satan would have one to believe.
