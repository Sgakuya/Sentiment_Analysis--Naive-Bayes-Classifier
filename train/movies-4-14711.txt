Good is the just the right way to describe this movie. It isn't great, but it's better than average. Critics said a lot of nice things about this movie, but I resisted seeing it because the previews just looked boring. Yeah, some assistant in a law office uncovers a big PG&E toxic waste cover-up and helps initiate a huge lawsuit, OK, I get it... And that's pretty much the movie. But Julia Roberts does a really impressive job as Erin, her character is interesting, and it's a nice change of pace to see a true-life David and Goliath story. All in all a worthwhile rental, but I'm glad I didn't shell out $10 to see this in the theater.
