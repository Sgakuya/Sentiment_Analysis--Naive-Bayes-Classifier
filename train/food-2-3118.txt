I agree with Frank15 on this - these cookies are a tad like little chocolate chip hockey pucks. However, to be fair to Mr. Amos, back in the day when he first started his cookie business, I think these were much better cookies. I don't know the details, but sometime after his initial success, he was ripped off somehow in some shady business deal and his product was essentially stolen out from under him. Now only his name and perhaps a semblance of his recipe remain. I have a vague recollection of trying the cookies years ago and then again after Famous was no longer in charge and there was a marked difference. I'm only guessing, but it could be they are now produced in much larger quantities and, having lost their novelty, simply remain on the shelf longer. If so, it probably serves the people who ripped him off right.
