This is the worst service money can buy at least in Atlanta. HORRIBLE coverage, especially indoors- forget using it in your home or business in Cobb or Douglas county, even downtown Atlanta it doesn't work in Lenox Mall or Perimeter Mall. The network itself is overloaded, people will have to call you several times. It may not even roll over to your VM. Metro PCS is a joke. You get what you pay for. RUN don't walk to another provider for Atlanta. Unlimited useage is no bargain if it doesn't work where you need it to, and there is NO ROAMING other than expensive outgoing call only credit card roaming (at 2.00 a min) when you leave their skeleton of a network. (but at least you can call 911 on VERIZON'S system which works everywhere in georgia) I went back with Verizon and though I pay 60 dollars a month, I can actually carry on a conversation in my house, at work, and even in the mountains of Tenn. of all places. And Metro PCS customer service, well , it doesn't exist. STAY FAR AWAY from this company unless you don't mind flushing 40 bucks a month down the crapper.
