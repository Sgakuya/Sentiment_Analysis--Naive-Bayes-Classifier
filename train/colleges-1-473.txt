It's a low class b-school and it's all about getting that diploma. I know of some people coming from low quality high schools and colleges who have easily entered into the mba basic program specifically a ms. sy who is currently first year. i'm unimpressed by her resume and she's just there to find an easy way to get a professional diploma. makitid ang ulo and malandi. and believe me, she ain't the only one. there are more people i know who have entered and got the diploma relying on being spoon fed by their professors and on groupworks with professors don't care much for what the kids learn, but instead, the money they make spending a few hours in the rockwell campus. that doesn't say much for folks who have entered into the program. baka naghahanap lang ng asawa. napaka sagwa.
