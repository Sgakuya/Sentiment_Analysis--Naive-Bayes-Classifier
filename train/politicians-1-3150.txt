I couldn't care less what the man does with his cigars, not many of us could walk the high road when it comes to sexual behavior and so what if it was in the office? The man is President 24/7, everybody needs to let off a little steam now and then. My problem? Under a policy of engagement , his administration helped China bypass 40 years of research and modernize their nuclear arsenal as well as their tactical capability, seriously compromising our ability to intervene in the pacific should China act on their expansionist machinations. That man cost us our future and put children who will one day serve in our armed forces at risk. I believe he knew exactly what he was doing, because even I have to admit the man's as smart as they come. Perhaps one day he will be remembered as a good president, but even further down the line, he'll be the one they point to as the man that sold America out.
