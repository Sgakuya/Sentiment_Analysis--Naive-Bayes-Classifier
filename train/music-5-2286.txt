Jump5's debut album is, for me, the best of them all. Later albums would gravitate toward 10 songs per disc and with either a recycled song or remixes - but this is the debut, and it's new and exciting. I had never heard of a Christian teen pop group before J5, so I was excited in 2000 when I heard of them. I went and bought their cd, and wasn't disappointed. Their first hit was 'Spinnin Around', and it still remains one of their highlight songs. Now, to be sure, they do sound very young compared to their newer cds, but that doesn't deter from a fun piece of pop. I enjoyed the whole cd through, so listen to all the songs. Later versions of this cd include the bonus tracks 'Start Jumpin' and 'God Bless The USA'. 'Start Jumpin' is OK. It's primarily good for when they're in concert and everybody wants to jump around, but when you're sitting at your desk relaxing - it just doesn't work that well. It almost feels tacked-on for fans. God Bless The USA rescues us from the last bonus. It's a very heartfelt song, and it's my personal favorite version of that song I've ever heard. It's great to know there are still God-fearing teens in the world. Overall, a great cd and one I don't believe J5 will ever top. The running time is perfect for a trip in the car if you've a mind to travel.
