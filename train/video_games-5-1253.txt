Mao is another one of those crazy insane games that everyone either loves or hates. It is similar to Uno and/or crazy eights, except that, You have to figure out what the rules are as you go along! No one is allowed to tell anyone what the rules are, so either you knw them or you don't. The only things you can tell people is that you can' t tell them the rules, and that it plays like Uno, and that every time they break a rule, they will be given a penalty card, along with being told what they did wrong, but you can only tell them with certain phrases, so you don't give it away! It's liek the best game ever! My friend got pissed cause she didn't understand, she threw the cards at me, said in a quitting scale of 1-10, this was a 15, and then threw a chair at me! it as great!
