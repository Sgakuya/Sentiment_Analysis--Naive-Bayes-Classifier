This one of the best games ever made for Playstation. It has alot of action and can be addictive. The fights are the best part of the game to me. The onl thing that I hate is walking around the world. It gets so confusing for me that sometimes I have to shut the game off and take a break because I have a headache from thinking on the location of some place. Then when you do find the place, you feel stupid because it was right on top of the palce you just left. I even have to admit that some of the fights are too hard, that's why I gave up on the last disk. But if you're going to buy a game for your Playstation, go get this one.
