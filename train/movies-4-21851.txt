this is about a 4.5 . I loved this movie about a teenager named Marty who is friends with a scientist. His friend has invented a time machine in a Delorean while showing Marty his time machine car, Marty ends up back in time in the mid 1950s. He gets to meet his own parents when they are teenagers.One thing leads to another and now Marty has to get his parents to attend a school dance and have them kiss by a certain time or he will disappear. I t turns out that since he went back in time it changed history. What I liked is of course his parents did end up kissing but in the future they come back different. His dad had been a geeky teen who was still kind of a geek as an adult and now he is a successful writer. real cool movie.
