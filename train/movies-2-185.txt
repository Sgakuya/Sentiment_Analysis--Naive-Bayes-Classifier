Mel Gibson is the world's biggest twit. His ego is the size of Jupiter. Despite the accolades of millions of people, this movie is not brilliant. It is competent, but it is such a Hollywood piece of trash designed to appeal to the broadest demographic possible. I mean, Americans don't like the British, so let's make them the villains. Americans love the underdog, so let's make a movie about a ragtag bunch of lovable misfits who overcome the odds. Throw in some personal revenge (which Americans love, as they are a vengeful and violent people) and you have the perfect movie for an American audience. After winning an Oscar for this 'guyjerker', Mel went on the make another half-dozen historical epics hoping to recapture the glory. I hope his faux-aussie ass chokes on a sausage.
