Jgay is the worst kind of p%ssy. That kind that pretends he is not. You can see it in his eyes. Man, I can read that kid like a book. He is that guy who starts blushing and saying, 'you are not worth it', when you challenge him to fight in front of his girlfriend. That is, if he likes girls. We all know about Christian Laetner. I don't know.- there is just something infuriating about a Dookie who thinks he is cool. Carryin' on like G Unit after he hits a 3? It's like a woman from up north claiming to be a good cook.- it just doesn't seem right. It looks awkward when he does that. I mean, if this kid were here right now, I'd tell him to give me some money for pot, promising to pay him back tomorrow. Know what I mean? And yes, he's a good shooter, but he will never be a good PLAYER.
