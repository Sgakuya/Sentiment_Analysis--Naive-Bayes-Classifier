With Ashton Kutcher in it, they should have called it, Dude, Where's My Mind. At first it was quite disturbing with profanity, implied child pornography, and the worst of all...abject animal cruelty. My wife was about to hit the STOP button but I insisted she give it some more time. In the end, it was a fairly decent treatment of the time travel theme. There really is no way to go into detail about the movie plot without giving it away; but I will say the ending was kind of unexpected and will emote mixed emotions on whether it was a good or bad ending. Definitely a worthwhile rental. Kutcher wasn't that bad (that probably got him kissie points with Demi).
