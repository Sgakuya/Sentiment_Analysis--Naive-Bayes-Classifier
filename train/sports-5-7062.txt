Why is Jordan even on this list? It should be, who's the best besides Jordan. I feel silly even rating him. Duhhhhrrrrr, I don't know who's the best. Well let me see. To explain why Jordan is the best is like explaining why your mother's death makes you sad. It's not even a debateable topic! Be reasonable people! Think about what all these guys ahead of him looked like against him! When you truly can't decide who was better, such and such or Jordan, imagine such and such guarding Jordan, and the decision will be easy! Nuf said ! PERIOD! THINK ABOUT IT , FOLKS! It almost makes me sad..... ..................how quickly we forget! You all know damn good and well who's the best. You are not original by saying he's not, you're retarded. Put it this way, in the words of Larry Bird, Michael Jordan is better at basketball than anybody else is at ANYTHING! Jordan played ball better than Michealangelo painted, better than Hitler killed, better than Carlin made us laugh, better than Pam Anderson makes us horny..............Micheal Jordan is better at basketball than JESUS is at forgiving. Honestly people, get real!
