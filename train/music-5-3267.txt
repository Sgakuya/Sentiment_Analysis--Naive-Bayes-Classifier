My favorite Stones album, put out during that golden era when they truly qualified as "the greatest rock band ever". This was the pinnacle of their raucous magnificence; everything after this was a depressing descent into commerce-fueled self-parody. "Sway" is an amazingly hard-edged song and "Sister Morphine" is, next to "Heroin" by the Velvet Underground, the most effective anti-drug piece you'll ever hear. As overplayed as it is, "Dead Flowers" contains the kind of joyous f-you lyrics they just don't write anymore and fills me with exuberance every time I hear it. For those of the younger generation who justly consider the Rolling Stones as they're presently constituted to be a joke, check this collection out, or any of the earlier CD's. When they were great, they were the greatest.
