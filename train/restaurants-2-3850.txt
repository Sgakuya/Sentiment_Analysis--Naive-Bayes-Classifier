This is not only a sub standard pizza place with entertainment targeted at the 5 year old level but apparently also a public testing ground where toddlers learn to control their parents. Here's an idea parents - if your brat leaves screaming because the little darling didn't get what they wanted - instead of pleading with THEM to tell you what's wrong with YOU - do society a favor and take charge of the situation. You're the grown up now - at least allegedly. You get to drive the car, go to work, and make the rules. Their job is to learn from you. And one of the first valuable lessons they should learn is that YOU DON'T GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN LIFE. Maybe Chuck E. Cheese's is as good a place as any to start learning that fact. Dare to be in charge parents...because if you aren't you're really doing everyone - including your kid - a diservice.
