Let's start out by looking at why no Yankees manager should have a chance to get 5 stars - they've got George's money behind them, and so they should win. But, other Yankee managers have had that blessing also. And, this is the only one that Georgie has actually stuck with. You've heard the term player's manager. This is a player's manager. He stuck with Chuck Knoblauch when the guy played second base like the Bad News Bears. But, what he gets for that is absolute loyalty from his players. They take on his gutsy personality and go out on the field to win like professionals. Yes, it's probably easy to win with that much talent, but it's tough for a manager to keep that much talent happy. Keeping George happy, keeping the players happy, winning the World Series more often than not. 5 Stars.
