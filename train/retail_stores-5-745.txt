Old Navy is my favorite clothing store for several reasons. I hate clothes shopping with a passion. For one, it has an excellent price to quality ratio. I can buy a decent pair of jeans for $20. Second of all, I like how the stores are organized. I can usually find what I'm looking for pretty easily. My last shopping trip I spent 30 minutes and ended up with 2 pairs of jeans, sandals, sunglasses, and 5 shirts for about $100. Most of the stuff I bought has been pretty good too. The clothes are all pretty basic, and for someone like me who is not really concerned with the latest styles and doesn't like to spend hard earned money, I can find what I want. Sure the commercials are annoying and there's some cheesy stuff, but people remember them, right?
