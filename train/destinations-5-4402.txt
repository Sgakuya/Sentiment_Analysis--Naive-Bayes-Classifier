Raleigh is the ideal place, by far, to live. It's ideally the right size, so you can still retain the small-town feel while enjoying all the comforts of a large metropolitan area. The shopping is second to none in NC, with too many chic boutiques to name, combined with three mega-malls hosting the likes of Saks and Nordstroms. The public education is great - even the most highly competitive students don't flee to boarding schools, but instead stay and infuse the system with vitality, garnering it the nation's highest education honors. The climate's fine, although I will admit that the hurricanes can be a problem, but the humidity's no different that elsewhere from the South. The nightlife can sometimes be a little bland, but the number of festivals, etc., helps fill in the gap. This place is up and coming, and you've got to come experience it for yourself.
