I earned an MBA in Management at the Puerto Rico Campus and could not be happier with experience. The faculty had real-world experience, as well as outstanding academic credentials. The curriculum is relevant to today's needs. Shortly after completing my degree, I was requested to attend Six Sigma training at the company I work for (a Fortune 500 company). I was extremely pleased to discover that I could apply much of what I learned (Statistics, Operations Management, Team-building, etc.) in the process and actually make a difference in my work team (yes, we also have to work in teams in real life!) The team concept at UOP is a microcosm of what we often find at the work place. It allows everyone the opportunity to lead, use conflict resolution skills and, when needed, use termination tactics if no other method of conflict resolution will work. (My team had to terminate a teammate for poor performance). I do agree, however, that there should be more emphasis on quality rather than quantity of students who enroll at the UOP. The aforementioned teammember would have never had a chance at graduate school should steeper requirements had been in place. By allowing lesser quality students at a graduate level, there is a risk that those students will take advantage of the team concept and finally earn a degree, misrepresenting the University and its Alumni in the process. While we wait for the UOP to recognize this serious flaw, team leaders should step up to the challenge, and face underperforming teammembers.
