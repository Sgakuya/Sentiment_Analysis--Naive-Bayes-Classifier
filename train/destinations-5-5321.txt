I have never been to Philly, Lancaster or State College. But Pittsburgh, is nice. Pittsburgh has arrogant and rude residents, however, Pittsburghers have so much more than other cities, who wouldn't be arrogant about a city like that. I mean lets be honest, Pittsburgh has like 30 hospitals for 300,000 people. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Oakland is a world-class medical center. I also read something that Pittsburgh, is sitting on billions of dollars of endowments from all those big fortune 500 companies they have had over the last 150 years. The Public Transit is the cleanest in America and the houses are cheap. Not to mention, Pittsburgh has the best Italian food in America.
