I own a 2003 2wd XE 4 cylinder. After reading many of the reviews on this site the low ratings come from people who do not seem to own one of these wonderful vehicles. My family owns nothing but nissans. My dad used to think like many people that domestics are the way to go. After owning his first nissan he has bought nothing else. They are one of the toughest vehicles ever produced. my mom's company buys only Ford's and they are in the shop more then on the road. Our '93 maxima had an oil change and the plug wasn't tightened all the way and all the oil was lost. we had to drive it two blocks back home and when a new plug was installed ran the same as before for another 100k miles. My truck is awesome it has unfornately been in three accidents and just keeps on running. You cannot break these cars. They are amazing.
