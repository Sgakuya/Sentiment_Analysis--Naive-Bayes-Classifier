Released in 1993 and directed by Andrew Davis, The Fugitive is based on the television series of the same name. For the uninitiated, the story of the film involves Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife. Kimble escapes on the way to prison and is now on the lam trying to solve the crime himself. On the hunt for Kimble is Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) who couldn't care less if Kimble is innocent or guilty as he simply has the job of finding him and letting the courts decide Kimble's fate. The pace of the film is quick and suspenseful as Kimble has no time to waste or chitchat as he searches for evidence and the one-armed man given that he is now a fugitive. As the story is nothing new, the key to the success of this film is the performances of both Ford and Jones, especially the latter who essentially steals practically every scene with his dry wit and frigid apathy which slowly thaws as the movie progresses. The bottom line is that The Fugitive is a pleasure without any guilt.
