Only Lincoln was better. The biggest accomplishment to occur under Reagan was the Cold War victory without a single shot being fired. I am sure liberals and Europe was convinced this would not happen. They are still in shock over this. Ask them if they would prefer that the Americans and Soviets fought it out in central Europe? Reagan reshaped the world's view on government's role in economics. With this he continues to provide a blueprint for growth all over the world. SDI, missle defense or Star Wars which was a rip at the time has become the preferred term by which the younger generation refers to what they thought already existed, and now find essential. Clinton patterned most of his strategic tactis after Reagan and in fact adopted NAFTA which would have made Reagan happy today. Beloved in eastern Europe.
