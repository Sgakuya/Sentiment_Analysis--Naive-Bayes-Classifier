I have the Motorola StarTac 7868, which I was told is the best of the StarTacs and why I got that particular model, and what it doesn't have in all the latest whistles and bells, it more than makes up for in reception. For anyone familiar with I-40 through TN/NC, this phone will go almost clear through the gorge without cutting out. Some posters have complained about no caller id, my model does have caller id. It does not have a volume off functions, another thing some posters have disliked, but I can set it to vibrate, so it makes a whirring noise but not an actual ring. Unfortunately, Motorola has discontinued the StarTac. I purchased mine off e-bay, and initially it would not hold a charge; I put a replacement battery in it, and it's been holding a charge fabulously now.
