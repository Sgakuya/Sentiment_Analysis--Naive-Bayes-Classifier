Wow I love this movie. It appeals to the little kid inside me I guess:) Even though, with further thought, it's not much of a kid movie. Those Goonies have little potty mouths:) My theory is that it was made for adults in order to appeal to their own 10 year old inside. Oh well, reguardless of all that, it's still immensly entertaining. I would like to see a person who doesn't laugh their asses off at Data. Or sloth, for that matter (who looks to me to be a cross of Eric Stoltz in The Mask and Al Bundy). Goonies, in my opinion, is the best of the kid-adventure movie fare. You know, the ones with the token nicknamed characters (and there is always at least one fat kid and one really smart kid, not to mention like a older wiser sibling) running away from some sort of evil something or trying to find some sort of something while being chased by some sort of evil something. In trying to come up with better adjectives to describe it, the only one that really stands out is entertaining. It's not a brilliant film, it's not a standout film of the century, but it is a classic in all it's complicated simplicity:) HEY YOU GUYS!....Go see The Goonies!(see thorne, you're not the only one who can be hokey)
