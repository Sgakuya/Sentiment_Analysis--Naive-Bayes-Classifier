Why is it that Tony can hang out, be buds with, and even politically emulate Bill Clinton and yet he still seems like a pretty good guy to me? This leads me to believe that it wasn t so much Bill s politics that turned me against him, as it was his decided lack of moral character. Both men claim to be of the Christian faith, yet only one of them seems to actually live by its ideals. Tony Blair at least appears to be a genuine family man who respects and loves his wife and children. I also appreciate his idealism, energy and general humanitarian approach - though I am sure, politically speaking, I might not be in agreement with him on every point. Still, his entire persona is so much easier to take than well; I think I already covered that. I am especially grateful for the strong stand he has taken to back the U.S. in this war on terrorism and his willingness to work with president Bush regardless of any political differences they may have.
