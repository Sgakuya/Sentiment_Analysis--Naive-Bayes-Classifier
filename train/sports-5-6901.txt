The best player ever, and it's not even close. He wasn't taller than everyone else (in fact, there was at least one player that played in his era who was three inches taller), he was a better athlete (ran the 40 in 4.4, a vertical that measured close to 50 inches, and set track-and-field records in high school and college), he had more endurance (played every minute of every game for an entire season), was stronger and was more skilled (led the league in assists one year, and beat out Thurmond and Kareem for the all-defensive team two years in a row). And he didn't just dunk on shorter players (you can't score 50 ppg just by dunking). His offensive arsenal included a finger-roll that was second only to Gervin's, and a low-post fallaway that was every bit as good as Malone's. That, combined with his athleticism and--least of all--his size, is what made him unstoppable. That's it, and if you didn't know, now you know.
