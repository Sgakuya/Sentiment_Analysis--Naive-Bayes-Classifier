Sprewell/Houston are the best 1-2 punch in the league. Houston is a radar from 18 feet out. Spree can get it in the hoop. The Knicks show what's great about basketball. Their perimeter game is top-notch. My favorite team. Their history is really great too. The New York Knickerbockers won the first game in the history of the NBA on November 1, 1946 against the Toronto Huskies. Those teams back in the early '70s were awesome. May 8, 1970 will always live on in all New Yorkers' minds aas a great date. Willis hobbled onto the court and hit the first two jumpers of the game. Walt Frazier went on to score 30+ as the Knicks cruised to victory over the Lakers in game 7 113-99. Clyde, Willis, DeBusschere, Bradley, Cazzie Russell, Jackson, Earl, and Lucas. The teams throughout the '90s were enjoyable too, featuring Ewing, Starks, Oakley, Houston, LJ, Mason, etc. The Knicks trips to the finals in '94 losing in seven was heartbreaking along with their loss in 5 against the Spurs in the '99 finals. They represent all of New York. Madison Square Garden just holds such mystique and aura that it is impossible to describe its greatness. There's no place more exciting to be than at the Garden.
