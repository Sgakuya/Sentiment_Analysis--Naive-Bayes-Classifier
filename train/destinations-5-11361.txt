This is my favorite place on earth. A million times I had drove by signs that tell you are close to the Grand Canyon. I never thought anything of it. I never really wanted to go see it. A friend of mine took me there for a birthday gift a couple of years ago. He made me wear a bandana over my eyes until he put me right were he wanted me so I could have the best view. He took the bandana off and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. The most incredible view in the world. It was like someone had put a huge painting in front of you and you wanted to touch it, but you knew if you did, you would fall into the canyon. I think that nature did an incredible job of carving this perfect place. When you go, make sure that you hike to the bottom. Be very prepared. Take a lot of energy bars and a water bottle. There are a couple of places to fill your bottle w/ on the way up too.
