A lengthy story that feels more like reading an actual history than a list of novels. Unfortunately tends to drag at times and many of the characters are pathetically one dimensional. People do not do 'evil' deeds because they see it as true, righteous, good or even from pure greed and ambition. They do it because they're Darkfriends. While the story remains fun, It is dumbed down a bit, with black and white, good vs. evil transparencies, rather than a more mature/adult 'shade of grey'. But don't take this too heavily, since in my critiques i tend to point out merely what is bad, the good does about though. Best of the series are EotW (Volume one) and Lord of Chaos (Volume 6), 7-8 are weaker ones, and 9 is somewhat flawed.
