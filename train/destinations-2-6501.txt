I lived in Texas for 9 years. As I look back, I really wonder why I stayed so long. The state is really below par in just about everything. Housing is cheap, but that is because there is just so much land. It does have a goodly number of tourist attractions in the major cities and out west, but as a whole, the state just pretty much sucks. Polluted, high crime, far out right wing politicians, bad schools, traffic congestion, long hot summers, illegal immigrants all over, yuk. This is what produced our current president, which explains a lot I am afraid. The Hill Country is beautiful, though, as are the chicks in Austin:-)
