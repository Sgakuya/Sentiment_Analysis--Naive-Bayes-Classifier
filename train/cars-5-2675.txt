wow if you guys are gonna mention rice im gonna bring out 4 cylinders.. evo low 13's stock with 250 torque.. compare that to 03 cobra what is 375-390tq? at wheels? wow cobra runs 12.7 i'd say evo runs 13.2 bone stock all with good drivers.. thats half a second off only.. new intake, exhaust, boost controller you will smoke the cobra all the way down!!!!!!!!!! and don't even talk smack about supras cuz they are far more better than any mustang.. the block is very very strong and it can take lots and lots of boost.. try racing a supra.. on the highway you have NO CHANCE and in 1/4 depends on how the car is set up...
