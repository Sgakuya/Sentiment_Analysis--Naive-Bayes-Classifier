The election is over and W has had a good first week. It is so refreshing to see such fine men and women for cabinet positions. I like the way he is working on education and faith-based programs which can receive aid from the government. I watched on C-Span all the church services in which he participated before and after the election. Most of his friends and political cronies knew the words to the hymns (I could tell) and this gives me great hope for our nation that perhaps God has placed godly men and women in postions of power in this country to answer the prayers of so many believers in this country for our nation to return to faith in God, to turn away from its many wicked practices which are harming our population, especially our young people. I truly believe it was the hand of God that brought about this victory for Bush- not for his sake, but for the good of the country. Because it was so close, I truly believe it was a wake-up call for the people of America to stop being so apathetic about speaking out for right and wrong. I am so optimistic about our future spiritually and I know that Bush will restore dignity to the office of the Presidency that was so deeply tarnished by Clinton. W and his entire administration will be in my daily prayers. I will pray for their continued integrity under fire, for their honesty and for their courage and safety. This is also my prayer for all our leaders, local as well as national.
