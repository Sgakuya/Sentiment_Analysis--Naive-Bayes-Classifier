What makes the Vikings fan exceptional is that the Vikings fan continues to support this team despite their history of very poor luck and post season play. The Packers fans adorn themselves with the glory days and rediculous, sanctimonious crap. The Vikings do have a great deal of talent, if only the coaching staff could properly harness it. Conversely, the fudge packers consist of extraordinarily fat, overweight (even by NFL standrads), slow slobs. Favre, albeit dwindling in his skill set, is what makes them tick. If the Vikes can replace Culpepper with someone who can consistently throw to someone with the same color jersey, they will dominate, even with poor coachiing calls.
