I just wonder why it is that our governer seems not to care about the elderly? My mother was un a nursing home and due to sever abuse and neglect she is now clinging to life. She is now on full life support with only a 20% chance to live. I was told by adult provtective services that the chances of these people being brought to justice were nill to none. Why you ask because there is not enough supervision of these plcaes,becauce the government is turning a blind eye due to kick backs from the insurance companies that fund these places!!!! Shame on you Jeb Bush it is sad that animals are treated better in shelters than the elderly are. Some day you will be old Jeb but you will be lucky enough not to suffer the rich never do.
