Rolos...wow. I mean who could ever imagine a candy better than Rolos. Personally, I don't think it is possible to create a better candy than Rolos. The just right chocolate covering (not to hard, not to soft) and the creamy caramel filling. I mean wow!!! I think when I decide to start a family, I am going to name my first born son Rolo Samuel. Because then he writes his name with his middle initial, he will write Rolo S. Stevenson, or when he just writes his first name and last initial, he will write Rolo S. I would name him Rolos but then people might ask why I named my first born son after a candy. I would probably get tired of standing up for myself by claiming Rolos are the best candy ever. In conclusion, I believe Rolos are the best thing on this planed earth and I am going to start a petition for a national Rolos Day. But thats a whole other story. So, until next time, go out and buy Rolos and eat them and experience true happiness.
