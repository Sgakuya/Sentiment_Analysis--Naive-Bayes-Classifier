I don't know what's more revolting, the movie...or the marketing of the movie. C'mon people, a Passion Nail pendant? How crass can you get? WWJD? People are acting if Jesus was the only person ever hung on a cross. He wasn't. Nor was he the only one who claimed to be divine. Speaking of heretics, doesn't anyobdy remember the Spanish Inquisition? Horrors racked up by Christian inquisitions and Crusades repaid Roman persecution tenfold. An eye for an eye and then some. Oh, I see...we have a selective memory. That said, I do have respect for Mel staking his own $$ in making the film. I'll have even more respect for him if he does what Jeeezus would've done with the dough. Finally, I'm sick of hearing about how the media ignores and villifies Christianity. From what I've seen the major networks have become ALL PASSION, ALL THE TIME!! Dozens of reverend's and rabbi's have been getting face time to hock their faiths ever since this movie came out. I'm bored with all these movie reviews/sermons.
