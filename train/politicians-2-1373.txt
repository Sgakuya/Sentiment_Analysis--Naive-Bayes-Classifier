Abichiarra's comment should be required reading for this list, prior to rendering an opinion. Great job. Further, I believe this leader's mis-judgement will have long-term consequences for France, specifically with regard to the (formerly strong and interdependent) US/France alliance, once they become (inevitably) a target for the islamofascists. He can advocate amassing a Euro military force all he wants but too many Euro members have much more urgent problems. And many Americans will not soon forget their blackmailish betrayal, for the shameful motivation of protecting their bribes and kickbacks arrangement with the UN's Oil for Food program.
