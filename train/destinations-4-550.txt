I am perplexed? I went to San Juan, Luquillo, Fajardo, Carolina, Culebra (small island off the east coast),Caguas just last year! Where in the Hell did everyone who is referring to TRASH around the island go in the island?? Third World??? Who is your travel agent???? And you native Puerto Ricans?? Sick! Help me out here? Specifically where on this island did you experience so much trash? Living in NYC, If I dont' smell urine or crap in the streets and subways every single day...it's a miracle! Every place has a ghetto, trash and bad people and crime..but when I go on vacation..I go to get away from all that..so next time you go to PR, or for those of you reading all this crap these people have written, who have never been...stay in Isla Verde, maybe the Water Club if you can afford it. Go to Luquillo for it's native beauty and culture, visit the plazas of the island, Old San Juan...and like anywhere in the world be as nice to people as you'd like them to be to you...Do your research on Hotels..and places to visit of interest. If you want to see how all the island lives, then you will no doubt venture into areas that are less modernized, poor and rundown, in addition to all the touristy areas. Use common sense!
