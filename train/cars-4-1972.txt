Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe: best-looking car on the road, hands-down, especially with the factory 18 alloy wheels. Great engine. If only Infiniti could improve the build quality which suffers from Nissan's cost-cutting: power windows are famous for going crazy, paint scratches so easily it almost seemingly scratches just by looking at it, interior quality needs improvement, stereo is tied into climate controls making it hard to upgrade, ugly amber instumentation (blue would be much better), often has balky 6-speed manual transmission. Infiniti's color choices are odd: for 2005 they dropped the twilight blue and added BEIGE! Who wants a BEIGE sports coupe???? Infiniti's dealers are mostly scumbags too.
