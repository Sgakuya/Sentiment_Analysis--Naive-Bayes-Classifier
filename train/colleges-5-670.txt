The mere word Mississippi will turn off a lot of non-Southerners. But I attended this law school from a very prestigious private college in New England. Ole Miss Law is surprisingly hard to get into, surprisingly rigourous, and has a surprisingly good reputation in the South. It's a very traditional law school: professors' teaching style is often unabashedly Socratic; the school focuses on preparing students to actually go into a courtroom rather than to settle for pushing papers around or becoming glorified researchers; and it has no grade inflation and a strict grading curve. The caliber of the student body is very high, consisting of the best students in the state and several excellent ones from other states (including yours truly). It is located in perhaps the greatest college town in America. And for male students it provides ready access to the most beautiful collection of coeds in the world, bar nowhere.
