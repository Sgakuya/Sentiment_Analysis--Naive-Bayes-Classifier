I LOVE VICTORIA ROWELL. SHE CAPTURED MY HEART WHEN SHE TOOK IN DEVON THE FOSTER CHILD AND THE WAY SHE SOFTLY SPOKE TO HIM, TO ME IT WAS LIKE LISTENING TO AN ANGEL OF WISDOM SHE MADE ME CRY. I KNOW IT IS ONLY THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS AND JUST A TV SHOW BUT STILL THE WAY SHE JUST BROKE IT DOWN TO HIM. SOMETIMES DRU VICTORIACAN BE A BIT RAMBUNCTIOUS ON THE SHOW BUT BESIDE ALL THAT SHE IS A LADY A SWEET LADY. AND I NEVER KNEW SHE WAS A FOSTER CHILD. EVEN WITHOUT PARENTS SHE GREW UP AND BECAME AN AWESOME PERSON. I LIKED HER FROM THE FIRST DAY SHE STARTED PLAYING ON THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS, I AM GLAD SHE CAME BACK AND MY PERFECT COUPLE NEIL AND DRU ALWAYS IN MY HEART. YOU GO GIRL... GOD BLESS YOU ALL YOUR LIFE. THANK YOU ARIZONA JONES
