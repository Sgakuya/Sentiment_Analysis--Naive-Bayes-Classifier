I am a woman who wants to make her own decisions about her future. I don't want to rely on the government. I do want a President who has learned to lead and has a proven track record of success and knows what our country needs. George W. Bush has worked with Democrats and Republicans to serve the public Interest. He has fostered the spirit of cooperation. He has a vision of freedom and individual dignity. He has proposed a government which is citizen-centered, results-oriented and market-based. He is bipartisan and statesmanlike. He is the 46th Governor of the State of Texas. He has earned the reputation as a compassionate conservative. He was born on July 6, 1946. His wife Laura is a former teacher and librarian. They have 18-year-old twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. They are an American family with a dog and two cats. George W. Bush has a sense of humor, he is likeable, he is respected. He has brought a sense of hope to America and I believe he can help us all to more easily reach the New American Dream. His words say it all: We must teach our children to respect people from all walks of life. We must teach our children to respect people whose skin is of a different color. We must teach our children to respect those whose ancestry or religion is different from their own. Finally, we must teach our children that we are a nation, one people, all American. --George W. Bush I believe we should cut taxes to stimulate economic growth. -- George W. Bush
