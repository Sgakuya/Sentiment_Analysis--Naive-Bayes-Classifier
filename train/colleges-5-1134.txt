People who have never been to Harvard as a student have no right to make such opinions about it. Before I went there, I too believed that Harvard people were snotty and rich, but they aren't. I have met some of the kindest, sweetest, most selfless people of my life at Harvard. People do gripe about it, but it's because they don't realize how lucky they all are to be there in the first place. Their perspectives are skewed, and all they can do is complain. I've had my share of miserable moments in just one year, but it's been a great experience so far. It may be expensive, but it's an investment--it's worth every penny. Besides, Harvard offers financial aid, the best of any of the 7 offers I got from other private schools. If you are poor, you can get full financial aid. Over 70% of Harvard students get aid, and they graduate with less debt than a lot of public school students. Larry Summers may be a pompous ass, but he's still a highly intelligent man. You should not base your opinion of Harvard on just one person. All of you who are whining and bitching about Harvard base it on stereotypes. Come see for yourself before you make ignorant comments. And by the way, George Bush graduated from Harvard Business School, not Harvard College. He went to Yale, where most of his intellectual character was formed. And we are not spoiled snot-nosed, rich brats. I come from an average public school, from a middle class family, and I represent many many many Harvard students.
