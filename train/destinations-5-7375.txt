Paris is THE best city in all of Europe. No town combines great food, history, art, and architectural beauty better than Paris. Parisians are not rude as long as you respect their privacy; they generally don't respond to the phony, have-a-nice-day mentality in the USA. I have never found Paris to be expensive. There are plenty of clean, cheap, centrally located B&Bs to choose from (like on Rue Cler). The Metro is easy and cheap to navigate. Stay at a B&B, use the Metro, prepare a picnic lunch each day and only splurge on dinner, and Paris will be no threat to your budget. Also, get a museum pass that gets you into almost every museum in town. It will pay for itself in about 3 museums and you avoid the long lines, especially at the Louvre.
