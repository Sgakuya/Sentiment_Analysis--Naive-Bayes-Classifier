TIWICI is a definitive album that shows the Boy's still have diversity and individuality. Unlike todays fame which has a manufactured almost formulaic quality The Bee Gee's are naturally talented and prolific Brothers who appeal to all ages and sexes all over the world - An unquantifiable achievement. They have had their knockdowns in the past some self inflicted but mostly from 'critics' and 'press' who try to tell us what we should like, they even rise above that. Big Hugs and Thanks to them and their families for marking moments down the years with memorable moving lyrics and experimental emotional sounds.
