If the show featured only Bernie Mac and Cedric the Entertainer I would have given it 5 stars. Steve Harvey has never been entertaining to me, to say the least. DL Hughley is funny on his show (which I think has been cancelled) but then again someone else was probably writing most of the jokes but as a standup all he really does is crack jokes about audience members, sometimes saying some really hurtful things about them. Bernie Mac though, I had no idea this guy was so funny. His impressions is what got me. Think of the joke about the kid that stuttered real bad, that was so funny I almost wet my skirt. Him remembering when he was little and his mean grandma was cool too. He's very good. Cedric was cool. He's also funny on the Steve Harvey show (unfortunately Steve himself is not). Nice documentary.
