Kudos to a man who acted on his beliefs regardless of his party's ideology. I would have given him the same rating if he had been a Democrat who found his party too liberal. Whether you agree with his politics is missing the point. The bottom line is he voted his conscience, for that is how Jeffords seems to live his life, and how can you not respect that? Some people argue that Jeffords did what he did to further his opportunities for becoming governor of Vermont. Since I don't live in Vermont, I can't comment relating to that suggestion. Jeffords may have ticked his fellow Republican Vermonters off, and he will have to live with that. But the sun will still rise in the east, and the winter will still follow the fall. Life will go on, and Jeffords will live his to the fullest.
