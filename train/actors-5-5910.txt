Ah, reading the comments made by the neo-cons sure gives me a good laugh. Allow me to share some with you: :) Perhaps he has never thought about the fact that if the terrorists attack the US they will not differentiate between hollywoodites and fellow Americans. They will kill him, seize his property and then refuse to go see any of his movies AND then, and AND then, they're gonna HUFF AND PUFF AND BLOWWW.... (Quick! Get the duct tape!!) But seriously. First they will kill him, then seize his property, AND THEN not watch any of his movies.....hmmmm..... a good thing the terrorists have their priorities straight..... I lost a whole lot of respect for him when he expressed his ignorant, anti-war sentiments. You want ignorant, read this: All actors are retards. It's the real people who matter. If movies stopped, we'd all live on very nicely, probably better. Nice to know actors aren't real people, but I think I'll leave it to Dr. Freud with that one. Actors, just like everyone else, are diverse people with a diverse number of beliefs. Painting all actors in one broad brush is very ignorant and narrow-minded...I think you will make a good Republican. Surprised to see so many hard working conservatives finding the time in their busy days to write the same (nonsense) over and over again. Thanks for the laugh though! BTW, Sean Penn is an incredible actor. Dead Man Walking and I am Sam. What more can I say?
