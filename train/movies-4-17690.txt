Very good movie about to Chinese grifters who, for the most part, grift mine shafts in Asia. Two men go through the streets looking for guys out of work and get them jobs. Only to do so, the person must say he is a relative. They kill the guy and go to the mine supervisor and say they will go to the press and the police because of the unsafe conditions. They basically blackmail the foreman into paying money to keep the tragedy a secret. The foreman agrees, they depart, and do it again. Only thing is, they find a guy with the same name as a guy they've killed and one of them feels guilty. This makes for a great ending to a very good movie.
