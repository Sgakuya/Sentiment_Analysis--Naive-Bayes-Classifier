I'm basing this rating on New York STATE as NY City seems to cast a shadow and I have a rating on the city as well. New York is a great state. The Adirondacks are by far the most impressive region in the whole Eastern US for Outdoor actvities. It is an amazingly huge wilderness area with tons of lakes, tranquil mountain scenery, outstanding ski areas with inviting resort areas. Long Island offers great beaches on par with the New England coastline. The Hudson River Valley is gorgeous with lots of hills, quaint little towns and history. Niagara Falls is such a wonderous site to see. Between Buffalo and the Hudson is really boring with not much to offer and a number of depressing cities. But this state covers a lot of different territory and offers a wonderful diversity that is hard to match elsewhere.
