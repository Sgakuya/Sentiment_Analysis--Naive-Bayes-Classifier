For some reason, I keep getting Pez dispensers and candy as little stocking-stuffer type gifts from family and friends. I have my whole life, and now I've got a bunch of these dumb sticks with heads on them. I've never expressed interest in them... why do I keep getting them? I think the candy has some sort of organic mind-control agent inside that only affects certain individuals with the right form of receptor DNA. That must be what causes them to think Pez candy is at all tasty, satisfying, or fun to eat. You'd get the same effect by chewing up bits of chalk with a little bit of fruit juice. As a candy, not good at all. As a toy or collector item, pretty stupid. I don't understand why Pez is part of pop culture.
