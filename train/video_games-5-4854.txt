Halo 2 is all that and more it is the game to have.Its the best game ever to come out peroid.The graphics are awsome and the control is as good as ever.The story is great the only bad thing is the single player has to end but thats where xbox live comes in.Halo 2 sold over 2.4 million copys and made over 125 million in the first day.Thats the biggest for any game or movies released.The only people who well put this game down is ps2 owners because they cant play it on their crappy ps2 and pc owners are mad because halo is the biggest FPS of all time.So let them cry while us xbox owners play the biggest game of all time
