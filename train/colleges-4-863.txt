I am currently enrolled at UOP-online for my Bachelor's. I picked UOP because I wanted to earn my degree, but I have to work and take care of a family. I will be graduating in June of 2005 so I have taken many classes at UOP. All of my teachers were excellent with the exception of two. They responded with weekly feedback every week and offered great support and help when needed. All of my teachers have pointed out both my strengths and weaknesses which help me at my current job. I have received good grades at UOP, but I work hard to receive them. I don't know how people can say they hand out A's. It is a lot of work, but it is beneficial and I enjoy the experience. The academic and financial advisors are not the most prompt in getting back to you. I must say that is the major downfall of the University. Like any school, you either like it or you hate it. I attended a four year college and I didn't like it at all and the price was not much cheaper! If you are a dedicated, self-motivated person this is the school for you. If you need hand holding and a babysitter I would try somewhere else.
