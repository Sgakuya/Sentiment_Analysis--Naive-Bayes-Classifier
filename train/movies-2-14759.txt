This movie is quite tedious. It just won't end, eventhough the end can be forseen about an hour ahead of time. The enormous battle scenes aren't quite as enormous as were hoped because they are blocked out by smoke or taken from the wrong angle. Basically, the director wanted the scene's to look huge, but didn't have the money. The story was too predictable, and probably appeals to women more than men, but the blood doesn't help the woman's perspective. The villian's character is far too underdeveloped, and the members of the love triangle are as well. Perhaps some important scenes were left on the cutting room floor.
