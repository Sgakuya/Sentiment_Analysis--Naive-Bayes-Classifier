I was only there for a day, but Louisville, like Kentucky, seems a bit underrated. You might think the place is worse than it is. What I saw was a mid-sized city on a river with a decent downtown that included a nice Hospital building smack dab in the center of town. There was also a nice Baseball stadium downtown as well as the musuem for Louisville Slugger baseball bats, right there with a giant baseball bat at the entrance. The people seemed nice ( to me at least) , and there were some good malls to shop at. Bourbon-flavored chocolate is nice as well as a soda called Ale 8-one ( if you can find it). The University of Louisville has good athletic teams, but some of the most arrogant fans you'll ever come across. They also hate UK with a passion. Not a half bad place I think. Muhammad Ali is from Louisville and the city is proud of it.
