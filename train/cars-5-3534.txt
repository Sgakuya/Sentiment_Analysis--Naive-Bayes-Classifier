I have a '97 Pathfinder and it has given me everything that I could have asked for. Unlike the 4Runner and Explorer, both of which I test drove, the Pathfinder handles and drives like a car. It is a very smooth ride. It is also great in all kinds of weather with the 4 wheel drive performing great in the snow and slush. Additionally, I recently moved to SF (after 2 years of CT winters) and it has handled the hills and perils of city driving without a single problem. The only negative is that it really gobbles up gas, but that is to be expected. I always recommend the Pathfinder whenever someone asks about SUVs.
