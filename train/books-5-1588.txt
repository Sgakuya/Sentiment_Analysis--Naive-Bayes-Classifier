This is the comic strip I have always dreamed about: an intelligent yet laugh-out-loud hilarious story of gay men's lives. I like that is also G-rated, yet the guys in it are plenty sexy. What bowls me over, though, is how important topics are raised, (usually quite humorously), that really apply to everyone, not just gay people. I just wish it was running in more newspapers, (I think it is running in maybe 25 states of the country, from what I've read). Thankfully, it runs here in New England in IN NEWSWEEKLY, but I'd like to see it in every Sunday paper in every town in the USA. It's THAT important, and THAT good.
