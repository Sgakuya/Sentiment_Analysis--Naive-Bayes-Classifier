I agree with Enrique (above). Those comment makers with negative opinions regarding poverty and crime must be living in a parallel universe or have been looking through stereo-type colored glasses. I have been all over Nassau and its island of New Providence. Overall, it has about the least poverty of any country I've seen (USA included). The people have a high standard of living. They take tremendous pride in their educational system, with attractive schools and colleges everywhere. In fact, they take pride in everything they have and do. It shows in their homes, public buildings, proportionately high achievement in all fields, friendliness and generosity. A more honest complaint would be that because most of the populace lives in modern homes and drives modern cars, it looks a little like U.S. suburbia. (In fact, New Providence has one of the highest car to person ratios anywhere) But, even then, the homes have those decorative touches that are uniquely Carribean. Leave your prejudices at home, be friendly, open minded, and interested in the people and culture (especially off the main tourist zones), and you should have a rewarding experience, as did we.
