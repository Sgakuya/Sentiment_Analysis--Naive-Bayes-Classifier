With all due respect to Pudge and Piazza, I still have to say Bench is the greatest cather I've ever seen. Defensively, he is Pudge's equal, with numerous Gold Gloves and the innovator of the one-handed style of catching. He was next to impossible to steal on. Offensively, a fearsome power hitter. I can't think of any other catcher in the last 50 years who led his league in homers -- and he did it TWICE. Led his Reds to 6 post-season, and 2 World Titles. The 1976 Reds is considered one of the greatest teams of all times, although Bench actually had an injury-plagued off-year. But he went nuts in the post-season and won World Series MVP, to complement his two regular season MVPs. In the all-time list of catchers, I'd go: Bench, Berra, Rodriguez, Cochrane, Piazza, Dickey, Carter, Hartnett, Fisk, and maybe Darren Daulton (in his prime)
