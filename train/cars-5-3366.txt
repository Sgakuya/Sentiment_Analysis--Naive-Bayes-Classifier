I have a Lexus and they are absolutely the best SUV for me and my wants. I am an avid Consumer Reports and J.D. Power reader. The RX300 has had outstanding reliability since its release in '99. When I started looking for an SUV, I looked at the Pathfinder, Highlander, and RX300. It rides just like its cousin the Highlander, but handles turns better and doesn't feel as truckish. You pay more because of the awesome features. If things like heated seats a electric controls are not important to you, go for a Highlander. Price wise, once you add all the nice features to a Highlander, it costs about the same as an RX300. I love mine and would recommend them to anyone.
