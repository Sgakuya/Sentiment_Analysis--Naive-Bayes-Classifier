This is the greatest album ever released by any band. These are the best band. The ONLY thing wrong with this album is that it doesnt have Wait And Bleed on it - the best song they have released. But it makes SlipKnots third album better just by being on there. However, anyone using song titles are just corny. It is, however, a sick album. Proper good. Anyone that says they dont understand the words and cant hear because they shout should shut up and stop moaning, maybe they would hear the words. I know every word to most of their songs - without using sites for lyrics. Grow up - and if you really dont like it - then why listen to it?!?
