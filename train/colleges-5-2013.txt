I am currently attending BSU. I really like it because the professors are willing to talk to each student and help with their concerns. It is a smaller campus and not a lot of huge parties go on here. But that is a positive thing because it keeps most people focused on the school work and their graduation time down. It is reasonable priced at about $16,000 per year, but that is living on campus in the dorms. There are plenty of low priced houses to rent closly off-campus. The campus itself it really clean and maintained through all the seasons. It has a very good criminal justice program, it is small enough to get to know other students and professors closly. It offers great internships anywhere you request.
