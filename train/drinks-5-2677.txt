I work for Gevalia and I wish for one minute the customers would put themselves in our shoes. We DO offer great customer service and we DO advise customers of ALL the so-called 'rules'. But sadly, a great majority of the callers see 'FREE' and don't pay any attention after that. Point in case, I enrolled a lady, six weeks later she called back and ironically, I got her again, she wanted to cancel, said we did not tell here about future shipments, etc...well, excuse me ma'am but I am the one who enrolled you in the programme, so don't call me and lie, admit you just wanted the free coffeemaker, I'd rather you do that than tell me I mislead you! In fact, I personally have given people replacements carafes, mugs, coffee, etc. even when a person has a cancelled account....so please Gevalia customers, don't insult our intelligence by saying you weren't aware of this or that or we are ripping you off...you WERE made aware of everything..what did you think that booklet was in your shipment...the TV Guide?!?!
