I generally can't stand frozen pizza-pizza is my fave food and you just can't equal a pizzeria and it's so easy to just pick one up but I do keep the frozen one around for the rainy day and of all the frozen one's I have ever had Tombstone and Essensia are the only ones that were alright and the only one's that I will ever get. Tombstone is pretty solid: good sauce-not that sickeningly sweet and quesionably textured sauce you find on all the other frozen ones with adequate cheese and a not too soft and not to crispy crust and a certain indefinable, unique Tombstone taste that is really alright and for frozen pizza even good.
