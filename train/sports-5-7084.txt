Actually he's not on this scale. For all you Kobe fans, after you see a last second game-winning shot, a dumbfounding reverse layup or an earth-shattering dunk, ask your yourselves: Why does he stick his tongue out like that?.....it's called plagiarism....Michael Jordan was simply the greatest.....George Gervin had more creativity, Dr. J & Dominique torqued the rim a little harder, Jerry West & Bird were a tick more sure from the outside, but NO ONE had more of it in one complete package. His competitiveness isn't some vain I wanna be a Hero thing his was just an unrelenting obsession to win....and that he did.
