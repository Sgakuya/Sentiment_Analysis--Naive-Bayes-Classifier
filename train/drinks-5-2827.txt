Because it is not listed specifically please note that this comment applies to Maxwell House Columbian Supreme. Coffee is a matter of personal taste and for me this is one of the best blends I have ever had. It's a bit difficult to describe a taste and while I want to say it's a stronger coffee that isn't really accurate. A stronger coffee sometimes brings up thoughts of something bitter or possibly more acidic. I guess I would say that it has an additional layer of flavor to it yet it is incredibly smooth. No tummy growling if I drink it on an empty stomach. With a pinch of cinnamon added to the grounds and some (I prefer) half and half, it's a great cup of coffee. If you like the standard Maxwell House, you may wish to consider giving their Columbian Supreme blend a try.
