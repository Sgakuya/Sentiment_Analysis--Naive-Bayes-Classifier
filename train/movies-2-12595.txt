This is one of those could have been good movies. All the ingredients were there, great cast, interesting concept, etc. But this movie ended up lacking, well, pretty much everything. It was boring, hardly entertaining, and really seemed forced, as though every one of their agents had told them they must be in this film or thus be banished from Hollywood forever. I was intrigued by the Uma/John duo reunited, and of course Vince Vaughn, but was sorely disapointed. There was little chemistry, and again, it was pretty much just boring to watch, and I had a very difficult time paying attention (not often a problem for me and movies). The few funny moments were unable to save this film that, while at least if the public didn't care about it, the actors looked like they didn't either.
