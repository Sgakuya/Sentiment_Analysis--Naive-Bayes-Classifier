National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Caddyshack, and Fletch are the three best movies for Chevy Chase. In Vacation (directed by Harold Ramis) an average family from Chicago (the Griswolds) are driving across country to visit Wally World. The film includes all the stereotypical family trip situations, this time to the extreme complete with an ugly station wagon, awkward family reunions, car trouble, and dead relatives and pets. Nothing cerebral here; however, Chase (as dad Clark Griswold), Beverly D'Angelo (as mom Ellen Griswold), Anthony Michael Hall (as son Rusty Griswold), and Randy Quaid (as cousin Eddie) really handle the material well. A last interesting note, John Hughes was the screenwriter for National Lampoon's Vacation.
