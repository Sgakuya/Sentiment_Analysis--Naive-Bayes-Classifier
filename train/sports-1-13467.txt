coward is not a coach he is a motivational speaker. he does well with the jaw and spitting everywhere. however, he doesnt know a damn thing about x and o's. hence, in the championship running in the teeth of a good excellent team like the patriots. i know bellichek love playing cowher in big games. way too ez. he plays the game like a statistician by weighing the odds. he doesnt take chances like aggressive teams that win the big one. he does just enough for u fools to have hope every year. steeler fans are like charlie brown and cowher is lucy, who makes u believe she wont move the ball this time. unfortunately, she convinces your dumb ass the ball will be there to kick but she moves it when u are right there. consequently, u fall right on your ass everytime. WAKE UP PITTSBURGH!!
