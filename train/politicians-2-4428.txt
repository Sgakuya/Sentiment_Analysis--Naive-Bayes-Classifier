A shrewd and calculating opportunist who realized early on that if he adopted the ideology of those who have a history of oppression against his own people (and, yeah, I know Lincoln was a Republican a hundred-plus years ago), if he spouted their slogans and appropriated their vitriol and made it his own, if he paraphrased their shop-worn cliches and tiresome rationalizations, he would stand out uniquely in the lily-white Republican party, exploiting them as they exploited him for propaganda value and promotion of the illusion that they are a party of inclusion, and have a viable political career. Lots of money in it too. If you have no shame or conscience, betraying your race can prove extremely lucrative...just ask Condi and J.C. Watts.
