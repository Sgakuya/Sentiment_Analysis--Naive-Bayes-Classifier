To me, alot of this stuff was just common sense, but it does an excellent job of busting the myth of what a millionaire's life is like. According to research done by Stanley, nearly all self-made millionaires are actually very thrifty people who drive economy cars into the ground, live in modest homes and save, invest and save! The people out driving new BMW's and living in 6 bedroom Tudor style homes with country club memberships are actually the ones with little fiscal sense and often have little money left to invest for the future. They are the ones living paycheck to paycheck to support their extravagant lifestyle while real millionaire quietly amass fortunes while living light and investing wisely. This book is a good read for any armchair sociologist or someone who wants to quit the get-rich-quick schemes and really start making money practically. You have to stop spending if you want to start investing.
