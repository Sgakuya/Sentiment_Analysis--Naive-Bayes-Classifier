Very beautiful state with a great climate. One of the most amazing sights is flying over Washington state and looking down upon the Cascade Mountains, just unbelievable. The San Juan islands are a great places to visit on day trips or over-nighters. The last time I was there my cousin ,who was a pilot in training, took us up in a little cessna and we flew up over the San Juans and landed for the day for a quick walkabout. We also flew up into the edges of the Cascades, whichw as pretty incredible seeing them at eye level as opposed to from the ground or 30,000 feet above in a commercial airliner. Seattle is a fun city, clean, attractive. The only negative I can think of about a place like Seattle is that it's become so much of a boom town that it has become too crowded for my tastes.
