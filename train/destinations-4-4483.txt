I live an hour away from Atlanta, and I always find fun stuff to do when I'm there, even in the suburbs. Nightlife is pretty good, and there are plenty of places to eat. Also, the shopping is the best in the South. On the downside, you need at least a 20-minute drive to get from anywhere to anywhere else, and to make matters worse, the drivers are horrible. Also, while I've met plenty of nice people in Atlanta, I've also met plenty of stuck-up, unapproachable people in Atlanta as well. On top of that, high school- and college-aged kids in Atlanta are generally the most spoiled I've ever seen. Drawbacks aside, though, Atlanta is a fun city.
