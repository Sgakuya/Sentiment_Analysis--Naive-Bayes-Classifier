Unbelievably good. This cognac (all right, fine alambic brandy since it was made in ukiah, CA, USA rather than Cognac France) makes every other cognac I've had literally undrinkable. I am not exaggerating in the slightest. This cognac has made the other cognacs (Hine XO, Hine VSOP champagne, GR fine alambic, and Camus Grand VSOP) in my cabinet worthless to me. Whether this is because GR uses Pinot Noir and Colombard in their formulation, or the ancient still type, the small lots, or the master cognac maker I'm not sure. What matters is the smell and the taste, and nothing touches this liquor. Not even the best Single Malts, handmade bourbons or carefully cellared Anejo Tequilas compares. Truly the King of liquors. GR makes a $400 a bottle cognac called "Anno Dominus" which might be better than this, and a select few made from single barrels. I have a difficult time believing they could possibly be worth the cost next to this, but I'm frightened to even try, given how obsolete this has made the other liquors in my cabinet.
