I remember when I purchased my first BarNone, It was at what we called a round the way store in Washington,D.C., and I can remember thinking to my self OH My God this is what a new experience is all about. It would be the start of a very long relationship. I was so in love with the BarNone that my friends and family started buying them for me on a regular basis and started calling me BarNone and as silly as it may sound to some I use to buy them by the dozen and I would freeze them so that they would never get old. Barnone and I became so close we were like to peas in a pod. It was the only candy bar that I would eat. To eat another candy bar seemed wrong and unloyal. I can remember having this little dance that I would do just at the thought of getting one, it just made me feel so warm and tingly on the in side. It was very devistating when I learned of the discontinuence of the BarNone I felt Like my best friend had been taken a way. It's just that i can remember some of my best childhood memories when I think of the times I Use to enjoy BarNone. Please bring back the good times and allow me to make new ones. Despratly searching for my old friend BarNone.
