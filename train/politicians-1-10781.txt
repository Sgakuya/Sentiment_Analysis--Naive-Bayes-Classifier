 He never did anything to harm this nation. I saw that in one comment. Answer--he did plenty. Probably the worst president (and has been rated so by scholars) his arrogance and foolishness crippled the country. Firstly, we have the Panic of 1857--a panic for the North and not the South, which he did nothing to end, which served to cripple the unity of the country. Secondly, we have the Dred Scott Decision which Buchanan tried illegally to influence form the White House. Thirdly, we have his standby leadership when the Union was crumbling. Although he was in a tough spot, Buchanan could have done SOMETHING. By far a scholarly and intelliegtn man, he was ineffective and weak as a president and chosen unenthusiastically by the Democrats as a candidate in 1857 with nothing on him.
