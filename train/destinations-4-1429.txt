France as a country is beautiful. I think a lot of what gives it a bum rap for Americans is that the Parisians (and the government) spoil things for the country as a whole. On my one visit to France, the first Frenchman I met when I crossed the Channel was an officious gendarme. Wrong way to start the day. However, virtually every other Frenchman I met was courteous and helpful. Food was OK (although overrated and overpriced). The wine - forget it. I had some local red in the countryside that literally turned my teeth and tongue purple for a couple of days, and it tasted horrible. French wines, and food, are not all that good, especially when compared to Italian. I'll say this for the French - they know how to market themselves and their products. Too bad the Romans weren't able to completely inculcate them with Latin culture. One French writer's definition of a status-seeker was a Frenchman speaking with an Italian accent (he was ostracized by his fellow French writers). Anyway, for the most part the people are OK (outside Paris, at any rate), and the countryside itself is beautiful.
