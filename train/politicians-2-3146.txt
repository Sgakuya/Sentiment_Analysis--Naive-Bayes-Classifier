I'm not rating Bill Clinton as a person. There's no rating low enough for that. But let's look at his legacy. What did the man do? He hung his first 100 days on Health Care Reform - and he put Hillary in charge of it. Bill Clinton does not understand the US health care system. Hillary doesn't either. You don't hang your first 100 days on that combo. On international affairs, the man was weak. His biggest success as a President was that the economy stayed strong most of the time. Was that because of him or in spite of him? We'll never know. I'll give him credit for keeping in Greenspan as Chair of the Fed. That allowed us to take a growing economy and maintain a fairly constant policy. Other negatives? Corruption, big government, and the tax everything mentality.
