If you don't give Jefferson five stars for his eloquent advocacy of democracy, give him five stars for doubling the size of the United States when he purchased the Louisiana territory from France. Looking back, handing over something like 10 million dollars for that much land seems like the biggest bargain in history, but at the time it was extremely controversial. Jefferson had the vision and the guts to make it happen against heavy opposition. Unlike many of his colleagues, he fully understood that the future of the U.S. lay to the west. While Jefferson certainly had flaws, he was a true renaissance man with a serious interest in government (of course), philosophy, agriculture, zoology, history, and ethnography. He was especially interested in Native American culture, and when he sent Lewis and Clark to explore the Louisiana Purchase, he gave them strict instructions to make detailed studies of the Indians they met along the way (he also had them send back plant and animal samples that added enormously to the scientific knowledge of the time). Recently-discovered DNA information makes it fairly clear that Jefferson did indeed have an affair with his slave Sally Hemmings, but Jefferson was a widower and many historians argue that he was in love with her. Regardless of where you stand on that issue (and the facts don't support a conclusion either way), Jefferson was responsible for fundamentally shaping the government and borders of the United States, and the vast majority of his influence seems to have been extremely positive. Love him or hate him, he's a fascinating character.
