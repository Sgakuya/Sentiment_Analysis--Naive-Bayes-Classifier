It may come as a surprise to people that only 10% of Mormons actually live in Utah. Therefore, it is the society IN GENERAL that causes me to give this state 4 stars instead of 5. People have been "mean" to me there because I was from California, and they weren't necessarily Mormon. The scenery is gorgeous, and people actually take time to smile at you when you walk down the street, but they can be a little close-minded although I don't think it has anything to do with the promiment religion there. There are plenty of overly-conservative states in the US and it doesn't translate to religion. Plus, I never got down on a people for expressing something they believe as long as it was good and worthwhile. I think all those who rate Utah with negatively based on the LDS religion for being too "close-minded" have a narrow mind themselves.
