Wow, what a gutsy album. I can only imagine the controversy this little guy must have brought the band. Nice tunes, powerful lyrics, and OH MY GOD, the songs actually have a PURPOSE! What more could you ask for in a record? Stipe's vocals are once again astounding...as he puts it, he could sing the yellow pages and make people cry. (After all, he did once sing the liner notes of a gospel CD). My favorite has to be King of Birds ...it's so pretty, so melodic, and at the same time, so moving. Everyone's instruments sounded great, and we shall never forget It's The End of the World As We Know It . That's great it starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes and airplanes, Lenny Bruce is not afraid...take care, everyone!
