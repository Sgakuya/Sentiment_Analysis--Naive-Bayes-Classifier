After we moved 6 miles from our previous address to our new home, our phones no longer worked in our home or our immediate neighborhood. This was a major problem since I used it for my primary work number. Alltel tried to over a month to fix the problem with no success. FYI: we live in one of the most populated counties in Florida... we should have had service. After the local office said that we wouldn't be charged any fees for early termination, we cancelled our service. We were then charged $400 for early termination on our two phones. I spoke with several people in customer service and worked my way up to the corporate office... they would not cancel the charges... We still owe the money and still are receiving collection calls. Alltel has even ignored a second letter from the FCC regarding this matter... (we also got the FCC involved). It is the worst experience with a company we have ever had.
