I am hoping and praying with all of my heart and soul that Sharon will bring peace! I think now Israel needs a real leader, we have to see what Sharon will do. We have to see actions and not just hear words or promises. I think now Sharon will be good for Israel, but I don't think he can be a real leader. Everybody either loves or hates Sharon, but the Palestinians hate him. Sharon has a verry big reputation for doing things that he was not supposed to be doing. But he has different views from Barak, at least he won't give back Jerusalem. He was a great warrior and now we have to see if he will be a good Prime Minister. I think and hope Sharon will be good for Israel
