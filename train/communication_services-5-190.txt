This past summer, I went to central Maine for my brother's graduation, and being as our hometown has 800 people and is 20 miles from the nearest stop light, I wasn't counting on having cell phone service there. And I'll grant that what I got was analog, and only about 2 bars, but you know, I'm thinking the moose don't really generate a high need for cellular service. :-) With their general customer service call in, you get a bit of a wait to get a live person, but if I just go to one of the local branches for help, I get immediate friendly service. For the same monthly bill I got from Cingular for regional coverage, I get 150 more anytime minutes and nearly national coverage. So maybe they aren't perfect, but they're as close as you're going to get with a cell phone service.
