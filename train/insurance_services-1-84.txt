BEWARE - cancellation fees I got one of their policies a year and a half ago, at that time the terms and conditions were read to to me and forgotten not to long after my conversation. Fast forward to today. 9 days ago my policy renewed and today I purchased a new car. After shopping a couple of insurance companies I found that esurance was not the best rate so I cancelled the policy...9 days after renewal. I don't make a habit of jumping from one carrier to the next, but this change saved us $800 a year on our 2 cars and we now have lower deductibles and higher coverage. The unfortunate part of the story is that esurance just charged me a 10% cancellation fee. Yes, I was just charged $107 for canceling 9 days after renewal. When I asked to speak with a manager I was informed that I agreed to the terms (A year and a half ago) so the fee will stand. He compared his policy to that of a cell phone plan that has penalties for canceling early. However, this is insurance and this is the first policy that I have ever had in my 30 years of insurance coverage that has ever charged a cancellation fee. That is by far the most underhanded clause I have ever seen in a policy. I feel like the class bully just stole my lunch money and I am not going to take this laying down. I will never do business with esurance or and company related to esurance again and recommend that you too avoid this company.
