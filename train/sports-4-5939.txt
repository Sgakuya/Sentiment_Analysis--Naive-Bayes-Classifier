Hey ILUVSEANMAY, sorry you lost to Duke! You were like Sorry you lost to Virginia Tech. SIR, SORRY YOU LOST TO SANTA CLARA, LMAO!!!! AND you lost to Duke. Maybe Sean May can have some more cookies while SHELDEN WILLIAMS eats him UP!!!! On a note about JJ Redick. He is my hero, my idol, and my motivation. I've never met him, but his heart is very evident in his play. I just feel kinda bad he had to MAUL Raymond Felton, I bet ya felt bad watchin that, didn't ya bucco?!?!? WeItForDuke, you said it perfect, although I think Redick has more athleticism than he is given credit for. If anybody watched the Georia Tech game, Redick proved AGAIN that he can drive into the lane. Peace P.S. How many percent is Redick ahead of the all-time free throw record by now? Is it 2, or is it up to 3?????
