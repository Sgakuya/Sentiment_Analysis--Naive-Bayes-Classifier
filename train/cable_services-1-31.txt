If I could give a lower rating, I would. I pay $90 a month for basic cable and highspeed internet. For the first month I had internet, it would stop working every hour or so, forcing me to shut down my computer, unplug the modem, and reboot everything. Sometimes it wouldn't even make it 10 minutes before doing it again. I know it wasn't just my computer because everthing was mysteriously fine after about a month. The other major problem is that their online bill-pay service is crap. It keeps rejecting my payments and making my account overdue. Of course, they can't send an email notification, and of course it doesn't show up on the next month's bill. When does it show up, you ask? Two months down the road. And let me tell you, it is a nasy surprise to go online to pay your monthly bill (on time, I might add), and find out that your account is over due. If there was any other cable company in my area or if I could have a satellite at my apartment, I would switch in a heartbeat. Adelphia is way too much of a headache.
