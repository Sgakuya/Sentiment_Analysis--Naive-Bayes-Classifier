I got a 20 Mb Lyra. I guess it works good. I never even saw an iPod when I thought I wanted an MP3 player. But the iPods were so expensive and the Lyra was a bargain in comparison. I'm pretty good with computer file management so I figured it out pretty quickly. The sound quality is fine, though my wife complained that it was a bit tinny. However (correct me if I'm wrong), the whole purpose of MP3 is to sacrifice sound quality for speed of download. I still have dial-up so I usually just download and go to bed. Finding a good music service was a challenge. I settled for one called "Streamwaves.com" which went dormant for a while, then reemerged as "Rhapsody.com" So far, I have been happy with them. The Lyra is great for when I have drudgery tasks like yard work. Just strap it to my skull, and listen to the things I want to hear, which ranges from Frank Sinatra to OutKast.
