I give her some credit, hence the two stars. The industry-tramp is blessed with substantial physical beauty. Lush hair it is almost like an irremovable vocal impediment that prevents her from delivering her lines more convincingly. The woman is almost 30. Like one with either selfish motives or misguided ambitions, she shows no genuine remorse for what she's done to hurt another person, and has conveniently for three years avoided addressing the pain she caused to another actress. This is very bad PR. She also has a history of interfering with a handful of relationships in the industry. Hopefully, maturity and real accomplishments will finally draw attention away from her personal and/or personality problems. As for Mr. Tom Cruise, the Great Self-promoter who may have been pursuing a match to his own self-absorbed ways---well, marriage should have been the end of all that. We know he strayed. Granted, I have always thought Cruise and Kidman made an odd couple from the beginning--I wondered why she picked him. In the late 90's, Nicole overshadowed Tom Cruise to receive a Golden Globe for her performance in To Die For. Now in the wake of Tom Cruise, she has garnered an Oscar for her performance in The Hours, and has a collection of many other amazing projects under her belt. Penelope Cruz can only dream of one day having what Nicole Kidman truly possesses--Talent, Indepedence, and Good Breeding; qualities of a true icon. The irony is definitely there.
