The Charlestown, MA store was highlighted (in a repeat) on Phantom Gourmet so we decided to try it. What a mistake. $17+ for 3 things. My mother ordered a strawberry sundae; she was watching the guy and when he was about to put on whipped cream she asked what about the sauce; was told by another employee that they didn't have strawberry sauce (!!) but said she could put on raspberry sauce if she liked; my mother agreed and we were both shocked to see a store-bought container of sauce! I ordered a hot fudge sundae with vanilla ice cream and marshmallow. They don't have normal vanilla ice cream--just sweet french vanilla so that's what I had with about 1 tablespoon of hot fudge and whipped cream and marshmallow. It was disgusting---way too sweet and could you spare the fudge?! The last one was a bowl of boston cream pie ice cream with a chocolate dipped waffle cone on the side for my bf. Again, much to sweet. For this particular location, parking is a major issue---we had to park in a lot which in very large letters read $2 for every 1/2 hour. As we exited, after 18 minutes, we were told it was $12!!!! The bottom of the sign in much smaller letters read $12 flat fee Saturday & Sunday.
