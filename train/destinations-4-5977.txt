A very nice state. I would consider living here. Western Maryland is gorgeous, especially around Deep Creek Lake with beautiful Apalacian hills and mountains. Baltimore has it's shortcomings but it definately has character, some good neighborhoods, history, good food, and a nice waterfront. Having Washington DC close by adds to the appeal especially in the way of culture. All you people complaining about traffic...... Blah! Blah! Blah! Every metropolitan area in the US is clogged with traffic, Maryland is not uniquely better or worse in that category. The Chesapeake Bay with all the surrounding marshland is beautiful country and Maryland crab is yummy!!! Ocean City is fun and Assateague Island is a great place to capture peace and solitude by the ocean! Lots to do in Maryland !!
