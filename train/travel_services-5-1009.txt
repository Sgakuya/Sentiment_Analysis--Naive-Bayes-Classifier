i have read all the other opinions, and I have found some to be fair and some not fair. If you were to look at their web site you will see that Two Small Men is a franchise and each one is indepently owned. My experience was with the Toronto and the Surrey office. I have moved twice. My first experience was with the surrey office. I had an awful experience, yet they put all the blame on the toronto. I found that really weird. When I decided to give Two small men a second chance(because of a friend who told me good experiences with the company)I saw what a great company it was. I have also noticed that moving with the surrey office, they are vindictive and they surely dont know what customer service is about. The toronto office does. So give credit where it is due. Toronto office, great job..hopefully the surry office doesnt destroy you. For everyone else...if you want to book a move book it with the toronto office and stay away from western canada.
