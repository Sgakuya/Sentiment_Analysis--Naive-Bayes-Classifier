When I see interviews with her, I think she is uncommonly sweet and sincere, but I don't like her work in movies and tV. On Party Of Five, she had some gawkish appeal as Sarah...but I think when someone ordinary like this gets elevated to superstar status it gets annoying. It's weird to hear people talking about her having that something special or even being attractive when I think she is utterly mediocre. She has a manner like an excited teen when she acts, which of course appeals to excited teens...lol. She is lacking in a certain restraint and modesty that makes other young stars so beautiful...there is something about her in TV/movies that makes you feel like she is too full of herself. And I just saw The Audrey Hepburn Story ...I kinda felt sorry for her because you knew she was really sincere and trying her hardest, but she lacked the wisdom and grace to tap into this remarkable woman. It really made me think she was either really naive, conceited or clueless to have taken on this role...to think she had the acting ability to take on such a role or even any shade of Ms Hepburn's inimitable grace. Just when I was starting to think Jennifer was OK in her own way, her gall to even think of making that movie lowered my opinion of her.
