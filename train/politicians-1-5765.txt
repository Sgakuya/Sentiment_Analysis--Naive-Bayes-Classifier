Just look at the resume. Political insider for last 8 years. Member of the Rose law firm with partners in jail or under investigation. Gained financially on failed land deal that tax payers underwrote, and was the architect of a failed national health plan. Finally, a loaner, not a team player, who would like her husband would say anything to get elected. Why would anyone even consider voting for her? So lost my vote when she went on the Today show and said It would be a possible impeachable offence if it could be proven that the President had an improper relationship with a subordinate? She as well as her husband though it could not be proven..how wrong they were.
