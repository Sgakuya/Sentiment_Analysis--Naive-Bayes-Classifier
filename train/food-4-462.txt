If you just HAVE to eat a sweetened cereal, this is the one to reach for. The consistency has never wavered, and they stay fresher longer than most every sucrose-laden brand I've ever tried. One of the nicest qualities of Corn Pops is that they float, so it's easy to know when you're about done with breakfast (flakes hide in the milk like crocodiles along a riverbank, to the point where you have to dredge and stir to find them). Sweet, but won't draw your cheeks in. They're nasty if left for longer than two weeks, but why would you do that (I do it for the sake of reviews)? One of the more popular brands, and shows no signs of letting up.
