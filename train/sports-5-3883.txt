Why Roger Maris is not in the Hall of Fame is a travesty. Okay, he was not an accumulator of stats, but if you are going to argue that Harold Baines or Rafael Palmeiro had more homers and therefore were better home run hitters than Maris, you'd have to be kidding. Maris held the single season home run record for the longest period. While Bonds and McGwire had the benefits of performance enhancing drugs, the only drug Maris took while hitting his 61 were 3 packs of smokes a day. In the '60s, Maris played on seven pennant winners and 3 world champion teams with the Yankees and later the Cardinals. He was also a 2-time MVP (More than Aaron, Ty Cobb, or even Ruth). He was also a sterling defensive player too. All evidence lends credence that the media literally destroyed Maris' health, as evidenced by a career cut short and a life cut short by cancer. If the Hall of Fame can induct Rick Ferrell, Travis Jackson, and Billy Williams into the Hall, surely there is room for a 2-time MVP and setter of the exulted single-season HR record.
