People who visit don't like it because they think California should be 80 degrees and close to a beach. People who live there don't like it because San Francisco's close and they can't understand why they aren't living there. I went there with no expectations and I liked it. The temperature is very hot and dry in the summer but nothing like Phoenix, Vegas or cities in Texas, and there is no humidity like there is in Orlando, Miami, or Atlanta, which to me is worse because you sweat more and feel like you can't breathe. It is cold in the winter for a California city but certainly not even comparable to a northern winter. Public transportation is good and rent is significantly cheaper than the other large cities I mentioned. What I enjoyed about Sac is that it is not a melting pot; most people who re-locate to a California city choose San Francisco, LA or San Diego. You really get a chance to mingle with California locals, and they almost seemed appreciative that I visited their city. I went out to the clubs 2 nights by myself, and both nights I got invited to big after parties in West Sac. The city would get boring if you didn't have a car, but there is enough closeby (Reno, Lake Tahoe, San Francisco) to keep you entertained.
