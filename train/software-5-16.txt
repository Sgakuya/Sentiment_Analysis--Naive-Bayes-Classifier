Best part: it's freeware. Second best: I've never ran Ad-Aware/SpyAssassin after running SpyBot and it found anything. Third best: While it may take awhile to scan, that means it's going through lots and lots of different spyware that perhaps some other companies don't check for. It may also go slowly for people who have a slower computer. If you run your computer 24/7 and do not want to have to wait for the scan, you can go into administrative mode and set a scheduled time to run the scans -- set it for a time you are at work, or are usually asleep, or will not use the computer. You can also have it autoupdate at the time of the scan, and autofix the problems. It's a nifty tool, and it's free!!!
