I was very much a fan of all that T. Harris had written...until Hannibal. This is one of the twenty worst books I have ever suffered through! To think that Harris made his fans wait 12 years for this piece of crap is unforgivable. I don't care what he writes next, because I wouldn't read anything after this travesty! Hannibal is, at best, absurd. The characters you've come to know have been stripped to being one-dimensional. The saddest part is that the one dimension these old favorites have left isn't what made them famous or likeable in the first place. The end of Hannibal is an insult to anyone who squandered their cash on this beast of a rip-off.
