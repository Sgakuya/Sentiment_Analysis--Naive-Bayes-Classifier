Blockbuster just doesn't care. I have been using the Blockbuster on-line service for a couple of months when I found out how poor their customer service is! I watched a movie on my computer late one night and when I pulled the disc out of the drive, I accidentally (I was tired and half asleep) pulled my Pirates game CD out of the other drive and put it in the envelope and sent it to blockbuster. I discovered the error within 24 hours, emailed Blockbuster to let them know that the wrong disc was on it's way to them and to please send it back. The response I got was Please package and return the Blockbuster DVD with another Blockbuster DVD and Please package and return the Blockbuster DVD with another Blockbuster DVD Basicly we don't care about your disc, just give us ours. A week later I Emailed again, this time a bit upset, and the response was a bit more like they cared, and that they would pass along my suggestion of having an automatic system to return incorrectly sent discs. A few days later I called and spoke to a representative that told me they would try and that they had a system in place for returning the CD. Do they or don't they. Well if they do, it doesn't work. It's been two weeks and nothing returned. Odds are they received it, they got every other disc I have sent them. As I stated in my last Email to them... You should have as much care for your customers discs as you expect your customers to have for yours... They don't, I didn't even get a response!!! If you use their service beware, be perfect and don't send them any of your own discs... I'm changing to Netflix, and as I have been comparing, they have a much larger selection
