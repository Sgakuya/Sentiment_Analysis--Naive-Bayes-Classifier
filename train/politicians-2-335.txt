He is among the longest ruling English monarchs, and probably due to the time he ascended to the throne and limitations due to the Magna Carta, he was an utter failure. Henry III(1216-1272) was crowned at the age of nine, during a time in which England was in sheer chaos: Rebellion was widespread, as the French Dauphi Louis occupied most of Southeastern England, (Including London). The North was occupied by rebellious barons, and only the midlands and southwest regions of England were still loyal to the royal throne. His rule was dominated by competing interests between barons, nobility, and the French, all of which, ironically, led to the rise of English Nationalism.
