in the 'USA' entry, there are many Yanks berating others for giving low ratings because of Iraq, Bush etc and not on the US as a holiday destination or place to live. Ignore those stupid comments re France's position on Iraq. As a place to visit it is probably one of the 3 most interesting countries in Europe - stunning scenery, many beautiful historic cities, great food, THE wine (also Normandy beers), culture, a far lower level of Americanisation than Britain, very efficient public transport system, best skiing in Europe is not the world.. On the downside, Parisians are a pretty rude crowd and generally pretend not to understand you unless you're speaking native standard French.
