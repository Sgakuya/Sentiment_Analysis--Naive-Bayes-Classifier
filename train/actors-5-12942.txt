The great rating is relative to her age and experience. Already there are things she does as well as anyone, such as facial expression, projecting mood/emotion, and I think her sense of timing and interaction with others is strong. She hasn't made THAT film yet, though if Stealing Beauty had caught on she would have been discovered through it for the talent she is. Forty-some years ago, while with my dad at baseball spring training, I noticed an unheard of rookie trying to make the team. He was on of probably 100 nobodies because the Pirates were the worst and needed to reach . I said, he seems to have what it takes even though there was no one single thing that made him stand out those few days. Well, I think Liv is a Bill Mazeroski in the making. When he beat the Yankees in the World Series a few years later, then EVERYBODY knew he was a winner. Liv needs to get up to the plate in a postseason atmosphere like Bill did; my hunch is that she will knock one out of the park.
