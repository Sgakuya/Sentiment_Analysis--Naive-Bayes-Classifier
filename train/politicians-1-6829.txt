Despite the fact that every member of his party dissociated themselves from Trent Lott and his bigoted views, Lott is perfectly representative of the Republican party. The louder they proclaim their lack of bigotry, the more they show themselves to be the ideological descendants of the Ku Klux Klan. Republicans are almost entirely rich white americans and poor white hillbillies. There are almost no black or hispanic republicans for a reason (and those cubans 'refugees' in Florida don't count - they're just sore that their businesses which exploited the cuban people were nationalized by Castro's regime, not because they were tortured or anything). Trent Lott is the average republican, whether they admit it or not.
