DO NOT SHOP AT WHITEHALL JEWELERS!!! I had three stacking rings on layaway but after reading all these horrible comments about Whitehall, I decided not to purchase the rings. I went back three different times because the idiots dont know what they are talking about. First I went back to get my refund and the associate said that the manager wasnt there so I couldnt get my refund. The second time I went back when the manager was there but he said that according to the computer, my refund was already given. I checked my credit card statement, but it was not refunded. I went back a third time and the woman that had originally sold me the rings was there and I was finally able to get my refund, but it wasnt easy. First she asked why I changed my mind and I told her that I found similar rings at Nordstrom, who offers the best customer service. Nordstrom would replace the diamonds if they fall out free of charge. Whitehall requires you do go in every 4 months to get the diamonds checked, and even if one falls out, you still have to pay for the labor charge. The Whitehall associate tried to sell me the warranty, which I didnt want to buy. I firmly told her that I just wanted my refund. She was taking so long to process my return and I was wondering what was taking so long. The whole time I was waiting, she was looking through the company brochures to see if the policy she so firmly stated before was actually true. Then she told me that now I actually wouldnt have to pay for the labor charges. That is totally bulls**t. She was just trying to get me to believe her right there so I would buy the rings. I know that if I came back later with any problems, I would have been screwed. Oh, and she failed to tell me that I would have to pay extra for sizing the ring. Who the hell actually charges you for sizing if you are purchasing the ring from them? She even went to the back to ask the jeweler if he would do the sizing for free and she told me that if would be free for me but it would be coming out of her own pocket. I still said no, I just want my refund. She actually had the nerve to say, I went through all that and you still dont want the rings? I was so f**cking pissed off!!! I said, I didnt ask you to go find out, I just want my refund now!!! I will never shop at Whitehall again and I will tell everyone I know not to shop there. By the way, the store I am talking about is the one at Main Place Mall in Santa Ana, CA.
