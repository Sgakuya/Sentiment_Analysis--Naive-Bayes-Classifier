This is my true homeland, and whenever I go home to visit relatives, it feels so good to see all those soybean fields and gorgeous sunsets they have there. Not everyone can enjoy this, but just the feeling of home is a great feeling.EDIT: It's funny how many people put such little stock in farming. If you have miles of fields, I would think that would be a GREAT thing, especially in this time of huge developing throughout the USA. Illinois and all the midwest has a lot of stuff to offer,but it's main reason to exist is to provide food, for us and for livestock, which in turn provides milk, cheese and meat. You might not find it thrilling because there's no man-made recreation for miles. There's woods to explore and streams to fish in and all sorts of places kids can have fun. You don't have to have rollercoasters and whatever else to have fun. You can't go to those places on a daily basis anyway, so what's so wrong with some wide open country land?
