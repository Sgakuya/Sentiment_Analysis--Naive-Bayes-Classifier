I will admit that Sheldon Williams has his good plays and all, but he is ugly... see, i complimented him before i called him ugly. he does have a peanut head and a real big forhead. but he is a good player. but i do believe sean may is better. and have you seen sean may lately? he has lost weight and is in much better shape... and he isn't fat, the boy is 6-9, of course he's gonna be big! but he can still get up and down the court faster than williams and is an amazing post player. while williams is a definate asset to duke, he never will be sean may! Anyone who doubts that Sean May is better than sheldon williams should check out this picture on ESPN.com: http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/photos?photoId=701634&gameId=250650153
