A film that's appealing along the same tracks as TRAINSPOTTING: rapid pace, fascinating cast, and twisted sensibilities. Darkly maudlin from the opening three minutes, this moving target stars John Cusack as a modern-day assassin who's burned out from the grind of the jobs (so much so, he goes into therapy sessions with a less-than-involved Alan Arkin as his frightened physician). Cusack's 10-year high school reunion rolls around, and it's back to Detroit he goes for some punch, rekindling an old flame (the sexy-smart Minnie Driver), and completing his last assignment. A rival killer (the most fun Dan Aykroyd's had in a role for years) and the FBI make for a sticky mess, though, and even after some spectacular carnage (everyone's firearms and explosives training is readily apparent), it all winds up with a happy ending. The late, great Joe Strummer handles the musical chores, and packs in a ton of eclectic tunes. Uneven at times, but the running jokes and uninhibited players make for a quality sleeper that should've been bigger.
