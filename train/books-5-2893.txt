Ambrose is one of the most popular history authors for good reason. He writes about fascinating subjects with a clear, entertaining style that keeps you completely engaged. Citizen Soldiers is no exception. Ambrose's extensive research, including hundreds of oral histories, lets him fill the book with really interesting first-hand stories that help him illustrate larger points. I read both Citizen Soldiers and D-Day, and, while I really liked them both, I think Citizen Soldiers is a better book. D-Day concentrates on stories surrounding the first 24 hours of the Allied invasion of Normandy, while Citizen Soldiers starts right after D-Day and takes you all the way to Germany's surrender. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the fighting in the Norman hedgerows, just inland from the beaches. Before reading Citizen Soldiers I already had a good idea of the high-level progression of the Allied advance from France into Germany, but the individual soldier-level stories in this book really bring the war to life in a compelling, personal way. It really makes you appreciate the sacrifices made for the sake of winning the war as well as the skill and courage it took for the Allies to win it.
