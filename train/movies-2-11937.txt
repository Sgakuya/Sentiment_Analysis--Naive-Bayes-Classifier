American filmmakers seem unable to understand that 'remakes' of thrillers ('Psycho', 1998), melodramas ('Vanilla Sky') and comedies ('Lolita', 1997) are meant to improve upon the original or else not to be attempted. In catering to current tastes or claiming to be more faithful to the original stage or literary source, the result can only lead to a prosaic result; remakes should bring to the screen an understanding of the source material that is more inspired - and certainly fresh and unexplored. 'Ladykillers' is not a disaster and the gospel music is very well incorporated. But the Coen brothers are at their best in original projects; whatever did possess them to come near and adapt what was one of the classic bungled-caper movies of the British Ealing Studios, they certainly could not have dared to claim improving upon the original.
