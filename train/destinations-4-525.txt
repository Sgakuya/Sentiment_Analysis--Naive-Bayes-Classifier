I stayed in Sunset Beach Resort in Spa located on a private gated penisula in Montego Bay (away from the city, but not to far away). Great entertainment at the resort, the resort featured a retro disco, spa and wonderful day trips to Dunns River Falls to name a few, vans that took you shopping or to and from the many clubs in town, a spa at the resort, small casino. Everyday a wedding occurred which was lovely. Free water sports and you never had to wait for equipment. The staff were very friendly, and informative. The only down fall is that the lights went out once, and the water went out twice for 30 mins. (but I hear that is normal for the carribean that is normal). I would recommend this resort for friends not really couples. You will have so much fun here because of all the activities and meeting people/flirting (don't loose your head) that it isn't really romantic but so much FUNNNNN.
