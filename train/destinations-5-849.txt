Currently wished I lived there. At least no one is trying to blow our neighbors to the noth, up. Must have something to do with Canadians NOT trying to exert their influence, politics, and culture all over the world. I visited Canada about a year ago and had a great time. Dirk is right, canadian beer is MUCH more delicious. not like the beer flavored water I get in most american bars. Some of the best actors and comedians came from canada as well as a lot of great bands(except Rush, Rush SUCKS). Also, the weather there is great---you just don't hear about Canadian's suffering in 90 degree heat like we do in the good old USA, where everything is so sunny and bloodt Disneyfied, that I want to shout.
