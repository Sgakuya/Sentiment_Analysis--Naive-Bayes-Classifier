Love This Place- Miami Seaquarium We are locals and my 3 year old son never gets tired of going to Seaquarium. He loves the animals, shows, the playground and feeding the fish in the coi pond. He knows the names of all the sea ions, manatee, dolphins and of course his favorite Lolita the Killer Whale. We go every Halloween to Monster Splash for safe & fun trick or treating and every Easter they have a great egg hunt event! Seaquarium is a great place for a play date, we go often with friends, order a pizza (yummy) and have a great play date picnic! For the adults there is a great swim with the dolphins program! My husband and I enjoyed it so much we used the photo from our experience as our holiday card!
