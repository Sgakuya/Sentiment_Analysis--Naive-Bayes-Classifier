I just want to state that as a woman I am disappointed in the women of the view talk show stating that they would vote for Al Gore just due to his package (cover of rolling stones magazine). What if the men said that about Hillary and her cleavage? Would the women be so calm and joking about that? It can't be a double standard women! Also why would you vote for someone who obviously had to get a erection just do draw the non-political womans vote? The reporter who wrote that is a Gore supporter and he knew what the attention would do. I think I will stick with George W.Bush who atleast can keep his in check. I would also like to point out the Gore keeps stating that Bush is gonna spend the 1 trillion that would come out of the surplus by giving us a tax break. What will actually happen the way I understand it to be explained is that we will actually see no money but next year if Bush is elected we will pay less taxes.For example if we all get a %tax break we will not have to pay so many I am understanding it to be 20-40%less next year. I can see why EVERYBODY would get the break if EVERYBODY paid in to the government. There WILL BE NO MONEY REFUNDED we would just PAY LESS!! So where does Gore get that it will be spent?????
