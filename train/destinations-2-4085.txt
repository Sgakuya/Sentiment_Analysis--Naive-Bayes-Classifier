I hate this God for saken city. Where do i begin? Yes of course the strip is entertaining and looks beautiful at night, and it has beautiful desert and mountain scenery surrounding it, I won't take that away from it. Try finding a good meal on the strip though. All I could find we're the usual chains or overpicriced mediocre chow. Beyond the decor every casino starts to feel the same after a while. Downtown is nothing short of frightening. This is what I envision Baghdad to look like. And it's a joke they have the nerve to even call it downtown as it has no central focus, nothing inviting and no atmosphere outside of that stupid light show they have at night on Fremont street. Then when you look at the residential areas you can drive down one street for 2 miles and it's the same house !!! One carbon copy after another. Nothing but wide unwalkable streets, strip malls, and tract housing, not to mention you need to live in a gated area to even feel safe. Is this the future of new American cities? God I hope not. I think one reason why we have become such a fat a** country is because places like this exist and uncontrolably sprawl out in places like Phoenix, Atlanta, and Salt Lake City. I'll take a real city like Boston, Seattle, or San Fransisco that acutally invite people to get off their a** and walk and have atmosphere to boot.
