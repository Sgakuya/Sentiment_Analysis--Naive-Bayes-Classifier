Wachovia is absolutely horrible!!! I worked in the banking industry for 4 years and have NEVER encountered such horrible banking practices. I consider myself a very responsible person because I never have problems with balancing and maintaining checking accounts. I made a calculation error (yes, ths was my fault) and overdrafted my account $5.09. Yes, I should have been charged the $30 overdraft fee. However, Wachovia does NOT stop debit cards/check cards from working if you have insufficient funds. My husband and I were not aware of the calculation error and continued to use our check cards for lunch, gas, etc. We went over $84.65 in charges. However, Wachovia charged us $30 for each time our debit cards were approved with insufficient funds. We owed $500 in overdraft fees for the $84.65 which could have been prevented if they had only denied those subsequent transactions. Wachovia does not follow common banking practices such as denying check cards when there are insufficient funds in the account to cover the transactions or sending a notice of insufficient funds. I was horrified to learn of their unconscionable banking practices. To make the situation worse... I discovered that they also charged the $30 overdraft fee when my card was finally declined for my $2 lunch purchase. Their explanation -- its just like a dishonored check fee. Well, actually it isn't. A check is a negotiable instrument UNLIKE a debit card transaction. When a person writes a check to someone else there can be several consequences if the check is unpaid. However, when a debit card is used and denied the transaction fails to go through. The person using the debit card may be a little embarrassed but there is no harm done -- that person just doesn't get the merchandise or in my case, lunch. I would much prefer a little embarrassment to $500 in overdraft fees!!!
