I keep telling myself that I will never visit another Best Buy again, but keep going back (for their prices, and numerous locations in my area). They have successfully put several small (and HIGH PRICED) record stores out of business in my town, for better or worse. But the service at Best Buy is LOUSY (unless you are interested in buying a big screen TV, forget about getting someone to help you--the staff would rather joke amongst themselves than help customers). The selection of CDs is God-awful (unless you are really into today's music). Selection of DVDs is a little better. I am starting to go to Barnes & Noble for my CD needs. Yes they are more expensive, but the people in the music section are knowledgeable about GOOD music and the selection is infinitely better.
