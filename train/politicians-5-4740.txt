Listening to Dick Cheney speak is like listening to a representative of one of the greatest religions on earth. He speeks with power and great authority. He inspires confidence and trust. His sense of morality, stickt-to-itiviness, and values come across not only in his speech, but in his general demeanor. He does not come across as one who would lie or mislead the general public in any way. He does not come across as someone who would cheat, steal, or misrepresent us while in or out of office. I get a sense that he is faithfull to his home, wife and family and teaches as a patriarch those things that are of good report. I love to listen to him speak. I feel that he will contribute honor and integrity to the White House. G.W. Bush has my vote.
