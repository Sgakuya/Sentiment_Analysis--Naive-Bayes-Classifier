Baseball's equivalent of the Nazi party. The ultimate dream of squares, bandwagon jumpers, people who live vicariously through the club's predictable and boring success, and unoriginal people. So- called fans that are GENERALLY laughably inept as regards baseball history in comparison to fans in say, St. Louis or Boston. A franchise originally owned by a corrupt cop and politician, before being sold to a so -called colonel who improved this sad ass team through dubious and probably illegal moves. A team that built itself up only with enormous amounts of $ generated by operating in the nation's largest city by far, and raping poorer franchises over the years. Fans of this fascist, cookie-cutter club actually have the gall to believe that their club operates on the same even keel, financially speaking, as other clubs, when even their closest rivals in this regard, like the Red Sox, Dodgers, or Mets, are still light years behind them in terms of payroll. a much vaunted farm system in the 90's doesn't necessarily demonstrate baseball acumen: it also points to the advantage in money that this team has.Currently owned by a pompous, megalomaniac buffoon, surrounded by sycophants and asskissers like Randy Levine. who spied on a team star known for his philanthropy and for making illegal campaign contributions to Nixon. This squad is an abomination to the best of this country's ideals.
