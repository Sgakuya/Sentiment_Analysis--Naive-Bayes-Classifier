It's funny how people from other states always talk about the wierdos in California, or the high crime rate. Some of this is true. The irony of this is that almost every one of these wierdos or criminals seem to be from other states, especialy the mid west, which is touted as the heart of America. I'm sorry but California is the real heart of America. California is to the U.S, What the U.S. is to the rest of the world. And just like people from all over the world come to the U.S. and hate us and talk trash, people from all the other states come here, and hate us and talk trash. Still they keep coming. Now that's irony. California has the most beautful coastline in the world. The mountains have some of the best fishing, especialy the Mighty Kern River. The women are without a doubt the most beautiful in the world. From north to south California has it all. But hey, don't feel the need to come and tarnish our great state with your hate. But if you want come here and enjoy all that California has to offer, then by all means, pay us a visit. One thing is true, we can be a little arrogant, maybe we're not perfect after all.
