Great for Philly. He was the best thing to come to the Celtics since Larry Bird. Took a joke of a team and turned them into competitors - the Celtics had a great run in the playoffs last year and they did that with two moderate stars and a bunch of stiffs. The Celtics have made some ridiculous moves over the past few years. When they get something good they immediately get rid of it. Woah - we have an opportunity to have a succesful team this year - we can't have that! Let's trade Antoine Walker for Paul Pope Owens. Let's get rid of a potential young star like Chauncey Billups who has a great rookie season, and let's start Oprah Wimphrey at guard instead. Lets get 55 year old Robert Parish back on the team and start him at center. Whatever we can do to make the Celtics suck. Jim O'Brien had no choice but to leave.
