I'm assuming we're including Zima XXX in this group and not just the original Zima?? If so, I love the stuff! Zima XXX comes in 3 flavors: hard lemon lime (what I call original flavor, hard orange, and hard black cherry. They're all very good. I almost always try to have a few in my frig. Here in Newark, Delaware (I don't know about anywhere else) I can buy it in big 24 oz cans for $1.00 .. that's right: 24 oz of good beer for a buck. And no tax. I love Delaware. LOL.. Anyway, Zima XXX is definitely a delicious beer (malt beverage w/ 5.9% alc by vol). It goes well with anything, since it tastes pretty much like a soda, and makes you feel good after a few. Try it. You'll like it.
