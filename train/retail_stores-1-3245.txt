We dispise Blockbuster!! Not only are their return policies ridiculous, but their policy on late fees leaves much to be desired. First, you have to have a credit card on file with them. Then, if a day has passed, you haven't returned your movie yet, they start calling you. Then, after you return it, you start getting the little collection notice postcards in the mail. Then, if you take your sweet time to pay the $3.28, they automatically bill it to your credit card. Then, in the meantime, you've sent it in, they deposit your check (knowing that they've already taken it from your credit card). Then, you go in the next time, the employee acts all pumped for you that you have a credit. Well, no sh*t we have a credit you Nazi's!!! By the way, has Blockbuster forgotten who's keeping who in business? When you don't return one of their movies promptly, they act like a bookie who's given you a large loan. *****We ONLY go to Hollywood Video now. We don't mind driving past 3 Blockbuster's to do this, because it's worth it!!! We often return movies late, we're always ready willing to pay the late fees. BUT, at Hollywood, they don't harrass us. They just have us pay it the next time we come in, they don't make a state of the union address about it. Blockbuster has gotten too big for their britches!!****
