You can't debate his greatness and his gaudy post-season record. I'll venture an opinion and say he was one of the top-3 quarterbacks of all time (Elway and Unitas the others), but only one of the top-10 passers ever. Does that make sense? For example, Elway, Dan Marino, Dan Fouts, Randall Cunningham and Joe Namath (in his prime) were great passers who can lay a 60 yard bomb right on the numbers, in stride. Most of Montana's lofty numbers came by virtue of Jerry Rice taking an 8-yard slant and breaking it for a 70-yard score. He benefitted by the skewness in passing statistics as a result of the West Coast Offense. Still, if I wanted one QB to run my two minute drill, it would be Montana -- who was totally clutch. I will also give him credit for nearly taking the Chiefs to the Super Bowl in the twi-light of his career.
