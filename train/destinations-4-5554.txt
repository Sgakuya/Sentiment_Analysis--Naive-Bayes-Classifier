New Hampshire is my favorite upepr New England state. Not quite as desolate as Maine, a bit less sophisticated than Vermont, but a pleasant state overall. It's probably a bit overstated, but I once had a conversation with a New Hampshire resident (who worked across the river in Vermont), and his comments on the differences between Vermonters (too liberal, all Democrats) and New Hampshireites (conservatives, trustworthy, relatively speaking) were amusing to say the least. His advice to me was If you ever shake hands with someone from Vermont, after the handshake check to see that all of your fingers are still there. They'll steal anything they can!). Anyway, when I lived in Connecticut, I often took day trips to NH, just for the scenery and to try new spots to eat (Peter Christian's in New London, and the New London Inn were favorites. Best French toast I ever had was at New London Inn).
