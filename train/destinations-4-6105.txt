Ahhh, The Show-Me-State...the place of my birth and my home. I'm proud to say I'm from Missouri (I know that sounds dumb)... Missouri is an odd state tho. Lots of people have the misconception that it's all flat like Kansas and Iowa, however the state offers a variety of terrain. Up north (above the Missouri River) it is flat and mostly farm land like KS and IA. Central MO starts to get a bit hilly, and southern MO has the Ozark Mtns. Basically, the best places to visit for touristy stuff is St. Louis, Kansas City, and Branson. The Lake of the Ozarks in central MO is worth a visit, and if you like to party then check out Party Cove there. I would compare it to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, only on a boat in a lake. The people of Missouri are generally friendly and nice to outsiders, but in the big cities, you'll find less outgoing/helpful individuals. The highways are rated (last time I heard) 2nd worst in the nation...and it's obvious. I-70 from Kansas City-St. Louis can be treacherous. It's full of potholes. MO DOT is trying to fix it, but I think it's beyond repair... I-29 from Kansas City-Omaha is in fairly decent condition, as is I-35 from KC-Des Moines.
