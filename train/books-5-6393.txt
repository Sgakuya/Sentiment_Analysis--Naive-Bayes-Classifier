Ann has written the most factual and funny book about politics and the truth about the Democratic Party and the traitors amongst us in years!! This book is an act of patriotic courage - she has exposed herself to the wrath and hatred of the media who control peoples images and careers to tell the truth. Especially impressive is the footnotes and the support for every statement she makes. And - Its Funny!! She has a wonderful sense of humor and awareness of comical timing in her delivery. I LOVE IT!!1 Read it in three days - once you start, it hooks you right in. Thank God for people like Ann out there telling the truth and risking retribution from the media for it!! God Bless HER!!
