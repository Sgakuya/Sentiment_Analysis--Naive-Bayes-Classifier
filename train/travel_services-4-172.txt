I've flown Delta more than any other airline (Boston is not a hub for any one airline, but Delta has the most flights of the big three at Logan - AA and USAiways are the others). Their service, while not always stellar, is by no means any worse than the rest of the majors. Most flight attendants I've had are at minimum attentive and many are pleasant. Counter and gate help is usually good (there are exceptions). Was on a flight from FLL to BOS that had mechanical issues, and they put us on a plane due to go to JFK after we'd waited a little over 2 hours, then cycling the JFK people back through. Rather than ruining everyone's day on our flight, they cycled the delays through best they could. Delta is one of, if not the best at having up to date airport technology. Their hubs in Atlanta and Cincinati are excellent (ATL is much better than going through ORD or DFW). It's not my favorite airline, but I'd still fly them over most US carriers.
