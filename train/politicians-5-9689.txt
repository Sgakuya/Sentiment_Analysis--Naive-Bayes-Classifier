Being from England I am astounded by some of the views about Johnson. This guy was one of the most important American Presidents of the 20th Century. An unethical man? name a president who hasn't been! The man who was to blame for Vietnam? How easy it is to forget that the American people supprted escalation at the time. can anyone tell me a president who would have done differently? (don't make me laugh and say Kennedy - Christ! imagine what 'W' would have done!!!!)it would have political suicide to pull out in 63-65 - remember Truman and China? The Welfare State - an expensive waste of money? it is imposible to put into words the benefits this has brought to millions of Americans; Reagan's contribution to people's welfare was a massive arms build up that resulted in the biggest deficits in US history. Did Johnson put too much restraint on US business? recent history has shown these crooks need watching. The man who had something to do with Kennedy's assassination? Highly dubious - anyway, stop crying over Kennedy. JFK was one of the worst: he had few achievements, apart from taking the world to the brink of nuclear war, the assassinations (attempted and carried out)of foreign heads of state, a belated 'commitment' to civil rights, strong mafia links, a sham of a marriage and numerous venereal diseases. Although Johnson did have huge flaws, this guy was the greatest legislator of the 20th century. No-one managed Congress better, no-one has had their heart in the right place as much as Johnson, not even Roosevelt who pandered to the Southern racists and whose reputation was saved by WW2.
