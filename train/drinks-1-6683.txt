Why not just drink seawater? It probably has less salt content. BLECH tooey, tooey! You can't beat just plain old (filtered) water for beating dehydration. UPDATE: LOL! I really hope the person who is voting down all my comments is enjoying his/her/itself! I was willing to believe it might have been a coincidence but voting NOT HELPFUL to a comment as innocuous as this - and BTW also very true water IS much better for your body than this crud as anyone with half a brain knows proved me wrong. I must say, you are not only an ignoramus but also completely without clue one. Let me fill you in on something you funny little clicker demon - negative votes do not move one up or down on any scale of measurement on RIA...only positive votes actually count. But guess what - even if it did work the other way around you will never silence my voice with your childish tactics...so click on until you get a good case of carpal tunnel and enjoy your hand brace! Believe me, I m enjoying it as much as you are! ROTFL!
