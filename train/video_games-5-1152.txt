UNO is the best card game I have ever had the privelage to play. It's an overwhelmingly complex and strategic game of wit and savvy, and it takes years of study to be able to take on the greatest champions of UNO. Master UNO players can expect levels of respect from their lesser, non UNO playing friends and family bordering on awe, and it's a well known fact that UNO masters get all the sexy ladies and wads of cash they could have ever dreamed of. Nothing compares to a night of intense UNO, sitting in a boardroom with various other gentlemen, smoking cigars playing UNO to cries of: jolly good play old chap and UNO, my good fellow! Haw haw haw
