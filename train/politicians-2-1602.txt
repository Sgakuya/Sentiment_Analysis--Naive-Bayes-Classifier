Slobodan Milosovic was a communist apartich who used nationalism to further his aims. No worse than other Balkan leaders who have appeared in recent times. They don't talk much about Croatia's Tudjman, but who was really worse? Both were nationalists. There were other players in the Balkans with their own aims who only agrevated the situation there. Maybe there should be an international investigation into the role of France & Germany with the break up of the Former Yugoslavia. Germany certainly had no qualms about supplying Croatia with modern arms. Iran supplied Muslim groups in Bosnia & Herzigovina with weapons and even Iraq was involved in the whole mess. Slobodan is just one player, maybe the biggest, but not the only one.
