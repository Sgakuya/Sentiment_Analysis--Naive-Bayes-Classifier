Ok once agen Dorian you amaze me ywt again. There is no rap here. Limp Bizkit is rap. Vanilla Ice is rap. Acknowledge that you have no clue wat the hell you are talking about. System of a down is an amazing band. Toxicity their song is amazing. Dorian your an embarassment to music. You have no clue about any type of music. That people like. These people are so amazing and they express themselves. They speak their mind. Obviously you do not know this beacuse your too blind to see because your too busy listening to your CLASSICAL ROCK. Get a life this is the new thing that people like to listen to and is quite frankly amazing.
