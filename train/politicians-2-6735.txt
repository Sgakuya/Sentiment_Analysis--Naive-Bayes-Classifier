I refuse to give the man a one because he does do some community service-style things. But other than that, Al Sharpton has a completely one-track mind! He's Jesse Jackson crossed with the Black Panthers. All the man ever seems fit to do is whine about WHITES, WHITES TREAT BLACKS UNCIVIL, and never actually manages to accomplish anything except put some people behind him who also complain and complain and complain. I hate racial bigotry, of all types. It certainly seems that Sharpton is bigoted toward white people, or caucasoids or whatever. When people carry their cause to this level by doing nothing but whine, whine, whine, I feel nothing toward them but resentment. Take care, everyone!
