One of my idiots, ehem, valets, ran this 2003 Lexus GS300 into a building. I contacted the owner and bought the car outright because we've got a deal going with a body shop, and I figured we could fix it up cheap and sell it. Short story, I can get $21,000 for the car now so we'll make a few grand on the deal. But once the title was transferred to my company's name, the DMV told me I'd need to put 200 miles on it before I could get the smog check. I was due for a trip to Sacramento, so I took the matter into my own hands. The car was a real nice ride, and I kind of felt like a 40 year old family man, lawyer type, for a couple hours. Maybe in 15 years I'll look into one.
