Of course there is no speacial effects in the video actully its as simple as it can be. However despite its simple its not boring at! The mosh pit is a sign that teens want fun. The abanded gym reprsents our problems that adults could never understand. Anarchy cheerleaders is pure teen spirit (how many adults are anarchists)I'm sick and tired seeing videos of women showing there brests and asses just because a stupid rapper can't find a desent way in sell records. The video not only represented the teen spirit but it also represented rock and grunge(in particular) Cause we rockers don't give a f**k about what you think about us! So please enjoy your all that crap you see on Mtv! (Like that snoopdog with his pimp after all we do now that he has been stuck with his wife for years!)What bullshit!
