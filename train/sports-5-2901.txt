The Babe is baseball. For those on this msg. board who say he couldn't run and was either a home run or an out, I invite you to READ about the man instead of forming a stupid, ignorant opinon of him. Players of the day say he had better than average speed. As for his just hitting home runs, LOOK AT THE STATS, STUPID! He hit .342 lifetime. Can you name another player in history who could have made it into the hall as a hitter or pitcher? I don't think so. The man is hands down the greatest baseball player in history! Update: White People like him b/c he's like the last great white hope in a world of sports increasingly dominated by minority athletes.????? Sorry, I don't agree with that statement in the least. Baseball has had and still has great white baseball players as good as or better than any from the minority community. As a matter of fact, I recently watched an ESPN report exploring why blacks aren't making it to the Big Leagues anymore. IMO, the same for football, tennis, swimming, gymnastics, wrestling, etc. In the United States, only professional basketball and boxing are dominated by minorities, and based on how our Olympic team is performing, they have nothing to be proud of ( the main reason I know longer follow the NBA, they're an embarrassment). Axl, you have a lot of sports sense, you know this.
