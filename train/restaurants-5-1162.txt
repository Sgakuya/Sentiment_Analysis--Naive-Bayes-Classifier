Sooooo good going down. So bad coming out... I love the spicy cajun fried chicken and the red beans and rice at Popeye's are delicious. Neither are very good for your heart or waistline, but they are so pleasing to the pallet. Then about 6 hours later, the stomach gets to rumbling. Small little burps of the fine cajun food make you smile and think it was all worth the minor gastro-intestinal murmurs. About a half of an hour later - watch out bottom of the bowl! Here it comes! That scrumptuous cuisine that has been festering in your belly turns into a liquid-fueled rectal rocket. Then you go back for more in a couple of days to do it all over again. I have since had to retire Popeye's from my diet and it is one of those things that I really miss.
