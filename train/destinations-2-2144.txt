ive never been there but in my school there is about 50% koreans 20% chinese and koreans cant speak english (they move to canada, WHY?) i think canada just passed a law that says you cant speak foreign languages in the schools anymore cuz teachers are telling them not to. but they used to speak gibberish to each other all day and ITS SO ANNOYING. they wont be friends with ANYONE that isn't korean - including the chinese - and they walk around with COREA (yes they spell it that way) shirts stamps whatever. they are so ungrateful, why would you move to a country just to tell everyone yours is better??? HUNDYAI SUCKS !!!!! and the storeowners will give you discounts and sold out items if your korean.
