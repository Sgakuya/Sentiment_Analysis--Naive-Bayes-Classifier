There should be no question as to his rating...and as for all you people who gave 1s, did you not see his performance on monday night? Look, this guy is still productive when thrown the ball, did anyone notice how he didnt even have ONE pass thrown to him in the seattle vs st louis game? Gee, I wonder how the seahawks lost that one. Get real guys, far as WRs go there is no comparrison. He is not selfish, nor egomaniacal, he merely loves the game; if you fools choose to hate him for trying to do what he can at his age, then that's your problem, but don't go calling him selfish. You know what happens when your star WR is selfish? Look at the Vikings. They have an incredibly talented team, but they can't seem to win. Jerry never has, and NEVER would cause the discord that Randy does, he just contributes. Apparently you don't realize that when you are the greatest EVER you want the ball because it IS GOOD FOR YOUR TEAM. When you have a playmaker like Rice things happen when he has the ball, it is natural for him to want his team to do well. He has always behaved execptionally on and off the field, and you idiots calling him selfish need to look again.
