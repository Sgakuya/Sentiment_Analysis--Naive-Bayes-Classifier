I give this game four stars because it has a creative, edgy, story line. It also has a very larg playable environment thet changes as the story moves on. There are so many things that you can do in this game that I cant begin to tell you all of them. however i will tell you my favorite. my number one favorite thing to do is to find a airplain or a helocopter and jump out with a parachute and sky dive. I also like to go to mountain bike racing. The best thing about this game is the fact that it is so interactive. for example, when you go to long with uot food you will slow down, become skinny, and lose your apeal to the ladies. It is the same with eating to much or exercising. you can change your clothes and hair too. And last, I'd like to say that the violence isn't a problem, becaouse if your child is playing this game killing hookers for their mony it is your fault. You shouldn't have gotten the game for your kid. Also your child wouldn't find killing people fun unless it was some thing else that currupted them before.(like bad parrenting)
