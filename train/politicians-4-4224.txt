Vote swapping. If you are a progressive voter (whether for Gore or Nader) worried about Nader taking votes away from Gore but still would like to see Nader get his 5% of the votes, here's a creative solution to your dilemma. It's called vote swapping and it's legal. The idea is that a Gore voter in a Bush safe state, such as Texas, gets together with a Nader voter in a swing state, such as Wisconsin. The Gore voter agrees to vote for Nader (it won't hurt Gore a bit) and the Nader voter agrees to vote for Gore (it won't hurt Nader a bit). The end result is that progressives work together to defeat Bush.
