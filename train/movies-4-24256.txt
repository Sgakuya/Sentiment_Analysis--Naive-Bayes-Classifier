more dark madness from darren aronofsky. don't look at the sun for too long, or you'll figure out the universe. that seems to be the moral. or maybe it's a metaphor. maybe it's an opportunity for a series of identical scenes in which a guy slams pills, exactly like the sequence we saw in 'requiem for a dream'. a mathematician discovers the code behind creation. i'm not sure what the use of such information could be, as even cloned mice are defective, but it's got a bunch of rabbis all in a tizzy, since apparently sombody guessed it before him, and concealed it in the bible. lots of good it did them. also, there's a pointless subplot about the stock market: the guy misuses his gift at projecting patterns like dennis quaid's psychic in 'dreamscape.' this movie essentially exploits the cabala (jewish mysticism) the way a lot of movies pointlessly harp on underground or obscure material to seem hip .
