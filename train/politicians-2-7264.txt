There were 5 pages, and 10 names for president, 5 names on one page and 5 names on another page, the instructions said Must vote all five pages The news also said that most all the over voters who over voted were Black voters. If I were a Black voter I would be highly offended. Would I have fun with a ballot like that, I would vote for Mr. Bush, and only Bush, that's because I can think for myself, and then as I would take my ballot to the election worker I would be asking who was the idiot that wrote the instructions. I also need to ask, am I to understand that Black voters are idiots and white voters are not, this is the most racist thing I ever heard!! And why is it that the GOP didn't have this problem? Could it be that most of the Democrats are idiots? Or could it be that this whole story is a tear jerking LIE? Wake up people and read your own lies and see how thinking people are laughing at your stupidity!!!! GET REAL !!!!! Julias N. Wolfson
