POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES: Calvin Coolidge was the perfect President at a time when citizens were intent on leading their own lives and uninterested in large governmental enterprises. His primary goal was reducing the national debt and balancing the budget. He successfully did both of those things with his responsible fiscal policies. The economy boomed during the Coolidge years, leading to the greatest wave of prosperity the United States had ever experienced. NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES: Coolidge, unlike his predacessor, was no friend to African Americans and refused to put forth any Civil Rights laws. He proved to be an ineffective President towards the end of his term. An economic crisis was looming, and Coolidge refused to run for another term, leaving the economic crisis for his successor to handle. FINAL ANALYSIS: Calvin Coolidge was a man of few words who had a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He presided over a booming economy, but right after he left office, the economy went down in shambles and it was arguably because of his actions as President and his narrow-minded views. Not only did he seemingly destroy his own chances at being a great President, but he also destroyed his successor's reputation as well. Calvin Coolidge, a man of few actions and words, turned out to be a man we wished had spoken more often and acted more often in the favor of the people rather than in the favor of big business.
