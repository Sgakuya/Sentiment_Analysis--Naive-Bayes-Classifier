I got my 2004 Sport liberty brand new from the dealer and I purchased an extended warranty up to 75,000 miles or 7 years. My commute is short but it is the family SUV since we tow with it a 17ft In-Board/Out-board fishing boat and we feel quite comfortable and secure. I have only put 14,000 miles on 1.5 year since I purchase it and still like new, we love it. When you buy Jeep you need to remember that they are not a race cars or the must economic gas/miles vehicle, they are powerful big engine built primarily for Off-road. If you want gas/miles buy a Hybrid or electric, if you want speed get a Mustang or BMW, if you want comfort get a Cadillac, but if you want a true American SUV and the best on the market, get JEEP
