Fun, cool, didn't cost much. Park carefully to avoid scraping the front spoiler. I bought a new 1998 Eclipse RS at a Chevy-Olds-Cadillac-Mitsubishi dealership in a smaller city. A couple of years later I brought it in and the owner had dumped Mits because he wasn't making enough profit. The former head Mits mechanic now fixed GMs, but preferred his former job. He told me Mitsubishi cars are more of a pleasure to fix. He gave examples of a couple of parts, which I forget now, being much stronger in Mits than in GMs. I disbelievingly asked about the 3000GT, the equivalent of a Corvette, and he said the 3000GT was higher quality. In summary, he said that GM vehicles have cheap parts that break more easily than Mitsubishi vehicles.
