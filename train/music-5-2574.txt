If they had to finally leave us, this was certainly a great way to bow out. Their voices and intruments were never better as these four who represented (and still do!) the Mount Olympus of Rock and Roll left us with a chasm that has yet to be filled. The final entry in ten and a half hours of brilliant music and billions of memories for billions of lifetimes. Each day brings new legions of Beatles fans, but there will never be another entity remotely like the Beatles. The whirling dervish of song fragments on the second side of this record that ends with Paul's uplifting message remains the equal of any words uttered by any of the world's greatest of philosophers. "...And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love ...you make." A truly remarkable album that stands the test of time.
