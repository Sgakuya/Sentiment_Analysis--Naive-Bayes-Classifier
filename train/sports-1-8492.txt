I never liked Kobe, even before the rape case. He is so fake, he pretends that he is a nice team player, we all know that Kobe thinks its all about him. 62 points, well isn't that special? Kobe how many assist did you have in that game against the Mavericks? I'll tell you how many zero! And Shaq give it up buddy, you've won! Jeez, you're a grown man, this feud has to stop! Making crappy movies and music isn't going to help the situation! Personally, I don't even think that MJ is the greatest player of all time, Bill Russell is. When I saw MJ push Brian Russell off him in the last seconds of the NBA finals I felt pissed! He totally cheated, MJ should have 5 rings not 6.
