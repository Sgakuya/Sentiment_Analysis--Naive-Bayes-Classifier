Forget the wins records. Forget all those ACC titles. Forget all those Final 4's and championships. Forget that IU is the only team in the country with a winning record against Carolina. Forget all the National and conference players of the year. Forget all the coaches that learned from him who have gone on to become champions themselves. Forget all that. Coach Smith is a revolutionary. He literally changed the way the game is played. That offense your team runs - Smith invented it. That clever defense your team plays - Smith invented it. Your coach wants your program to be like a family - again, thanks Coach Smith. Almost every coach in college basketball runs something, whether it's in practice, a game situation, down to off the court motivational tactics, that Smith invented. Hell, Coach Smith is the reason teams think they can still win , down by double digits with a minute left. Simply the best. If you disagree- how's this?: I bet every penny I have that the coach you think is the best thinks Smith is the best. I guarantee it.
