MA is a cranky place. It's probably the most classist and racist place I've been. To love it, you have to be born here, and you have to believe that things that happened here a century ago somehow make the place cool today. You need to believe that yet another law passed by the gov't will make the world a better place. You also need to be an alcoholic and addicted to the most boring sport of all time, Baseball. The bottom line is, the roads are terrible, the housing substandard and overpriced, the gov't is old entrenched and corrupt, the economy largely dependant on gov't handouts and military work, and the people are just plain vulgar. Boston is dying culturally and economically and most folks just don't recognize it. If you're here, ambitious, and you're young, you'll be eyeing the door. On the upside, I'm making more here than I did when I last lived in Denver, and geographically it can be quite striking... but it is a small positive when compared to the people and the housing costs which exceed higher salaries. If you are from somewhere else and you move here, it is a lesson in how a culture can get so broken, so elitist so opposed to progress, and wind up worshipping pedophiles, kennedies, and the red sox along the way. Weird. I can't wait till my fiance is done with school and we can move out. MA is a bad deal.
