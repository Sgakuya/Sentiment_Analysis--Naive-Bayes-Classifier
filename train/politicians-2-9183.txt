Many of the things the people who rated this president highly said are very convincing, and I might also consider him a hero if it were not for his legacy of massacreing First Nations peoples and the Trail of Tears. The reason I do not give him one star is that he was enacting the will of the majority of United States citizens of the time. He is often said to be the first President to be elected from the common people, he held two terms, and if he hadn't done what he did, someone else would have. I personally don't feel I can completely blame the politicians currently in power for every bad thing the U.S. Government does today either, even if I did not vote for them.
