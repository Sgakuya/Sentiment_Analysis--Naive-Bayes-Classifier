This movie moved me more than any other movie that I have ever seen. Was it good? I dont know how to answer that. This film is one of the most graphic movies I have ever seen, but if it is an accurate depiction of how Christ really died than I think Gibson did a good job. It is extremely sad and brutal. The entire movie theatre was quite and many people could hardly watch the violence. Jim Caviezel did a wonderful job in portraying Jesus's bravery, courage, forgiveness, and pain. Being a Christian, this movie is a huge reminder to me that my savior Jesus Christ went through horrible torture and pain just to save us all. Thank you! But anyways, dont go see this movie if you cant handle the torture sequences. I would have definatley enjoyed seeing a movie about Jesus's practices, teachings, and movement rather than his last 12 hours. This film is a reminder to us all that Jesus sacrificed his blood for our souls.
