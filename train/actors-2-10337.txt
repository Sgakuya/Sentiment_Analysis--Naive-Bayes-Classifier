What a shame!!!!!I have to agree she did an outstanding acting performance with the Movie Boys Don't Cry But she has got to be the rudest B rated newcomer actress I have ever met,I saw her at a concert last night I couldn't get over the arrogance she thoroughly showed, as she seemed extremely conceited what a shame that is for ONLY a B rated actress,,she acted as if she was an A rated actress,,,,She was not near as well presented attractive either as one would of thought,she was definitely a topic of conversation among many other concert attendees as well I notice I was not the only one that felt the way I did'''Damn Hilary Be nice! you have the ability to go far in your career, You just need to be more well groomed nicer thats all when in the public eye.....
