Mcrydernut - I am an ALLTEL employee and have been one for quite some time now. If your antenna on your V-60I has been broken, it is generally ruled as physical damage and no warranty will cover it. However, if you are a subscriber of Lock/Line then it would be fixed/replaced. If the base of the antenna is what needs to be repaired then they're correct in saying that ALLTEL cannot fix it. If it requires removal of any outer housing in order to replace then it can only be done by a certified ALLTEL tech. As a personal unbiased opinion I love my ALLTEL service. Where I live in Wisconsin there are only two service providers, one of which is ALLTEL, and the coverage is great. As most are probably aware, Wisconsin is full of rural communities and usually poor places for service. With roaming agreements that ALLTEL has with other companies(IE: Verizon, Sprint)that normally cover major metro areas, highways and interstates that allows ALLTEL to erect towers in rural towns where the population lives. Since ALLTEL has been in my area my entire family and friends have switch to ALLTEL from their previous service provider and they've never been happier.
