I enjoy grape soda, but this one is by far the best. It is the only one that has the taste of real concord grapes - right off the vine. It's also seemingly not as heavy with the suryp - and the aftertaste is just as pleasant as the soda itself. I always have to buy two 12-packs of it because when my friends come over - they always pick it over the other sodas on hand - even if the Minute Maid is warm. If you're a big fan of traditional thick syrup style that's like drinking a grape Jolly Rancher - then you probably won't enjoy this as much as the more mainstream flavor of other sodas. This does for grape soda what the new Orange Slice did for orange flavored carbonated beverages. It's crisper and has a lighter flavor.
