Al Gore will tell the public whatever they want to hear. He does not seem to have any morals when it comes to abortion, nor does he seem to have any plans that will take care of the people of the US (social security, medicare, etc.) Many of the financial problems can be tied to the decreasing number of children. Due to abortions, the generation that is supposed to be paying into funds such as SS is dwindling. Not enough people are paying into these funds (because they are being murdered) and more people are drawing from them. In time the extra money will be gone and the US will continue to go into debt. Gore has sold morals to get into office. He is showing no signs of being a Christian or supporting any Christian beliefs. I pray Gore is not elected into the presidency.
