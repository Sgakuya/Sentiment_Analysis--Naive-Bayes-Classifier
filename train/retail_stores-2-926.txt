A&F has some have some really cool stuff. BUT,, I'm always surprised when a staff member is generally polite to me....because you know what?...it doesn't happen very often ...generally they're snooty, aloof, and impolite you can count on it. I usually leave annoyed because of how obviously shallow and snotty alot of the employees seem to be, it's weird , it's like they purposely hire the same personality and ethnic types... ALWAYS. I can expect to be treated like they could give a poop if I'm there or not. I like being treated like I matter especially when Im paying 60 dollars for a pair of frikkin genes! I want some polite service....I notice there are never any people of any other ethnic background other than white anglo saxon....it's like a Paris Hilton, Nick LeShea wanna be fest. (weirdsville) .I like the clothes..I'd shop there more if it weren't for the neg experience.
