I remember an interview of R.E.M. from around 1988 (may have appeared in the Philly fanzine, The Bob, if I'm not mistaken), where they were criticizing MTV and music videos as a whole. Michael Stipe said something like: the problem is that there's never been a video that makes you like a song more -- at best its a wash, and usually they ruin it for you. I remember thinking that was true at the time (must have been before Billy Idol's Cradle of Love had that girl crawling all over that bed, remember?). But anyway, here's an example of a vidoe that's vastly better than the maudlin, super-crappy song it's based on. I would always fast-forward over this one, when listening to the Automatic album but it's a pretty absorbing and well-done video.
