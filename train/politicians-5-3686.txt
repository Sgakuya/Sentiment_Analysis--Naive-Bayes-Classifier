Each time I see a comment about the President elect's intellectual capacity or lack of it, I visualize the writer to be either himself very simple minded, or so bitter that the party of his choice will no longer be in a position to rape the country, that his natural talent for recrimination comes to the fore. By saying or implying that Mr. Bush Has no intelligence, is not only extremely stupid, but an insult to the people of Texas, who have elected him Governor for two consecutive terms, and also the bulk of the American intelligencia, who voted for him. On the other hand, those who say he is rich and for the roof, clearly are either unfamiliar with Gore's background, or do not really beleive that taking from the rich and give to the poor is anything short of banditry.Robin Hood was a bandit. But the difference was he did not mind admitting it. The point is economic justice calls for the tax to be applied fairl. To steal from anyone, rich or poor, is nothing short of thievery. I say let the democrats be gone and let prosperity, justice and morality reign..
