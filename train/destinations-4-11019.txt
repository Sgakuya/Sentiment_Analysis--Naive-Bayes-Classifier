A nice little amusement park. An excellent alternative for people like me who avoid the large amusement parks with their long lines and sardine packing. Lake Winnie is a nice place to visit for those from out of town who want to spend a weekend in Chattanooga and see the other sites. The park is open to 10-11pm so there is time to see the other sites in the area and still drop in to ride the Cannonball rollercoaster. You can pay one price for all the rides or buy individual tickets. Park has been there since the 1920s and there are a couple rides from then that are still in operation today. My only complaint is that I would like to see another big wooden rollercoaster. Also, feed the bugle-mouth bass that swim in Lake Winnie.
