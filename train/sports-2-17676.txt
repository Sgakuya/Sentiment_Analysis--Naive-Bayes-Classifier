My 11-year old son is a big football fan. A couple of years ago, he had a project where he had to make a map based on mythical land of something that interested the student. My son made a map called "NFL Island." The island was shaped like a football and had landmarks like "McNabb Mountain," "Favre Desert," and "Redskins D.C." My favorite was a small body of water near "Bledsoe City," called "Stinky Lions Lake." It was amazing that my 9-year old boy could sense how bad the Lions were. This was the same Lions team where Coach Marty "Take 2 aspirins and call me in the" Mornhiweg won the toss for OT and KICKED OFF!!! [Bears marched down the field for an easy field go]. Even my son's 4th grade teacher thought that was hilarious. To this day, we call the Lions, "The Lake." Detroit is like the Arizona Cardinals. Every year, they are some pundits sleeper team and they do just that...fall asleep at the line of scrimmage. Here's a team that drafts 3 wide receivers in a row with their #1 pick, and they don't have a QB who can get it to them (Doesn't matter, none of them panned out anyway). If the Ford family built cars like they run this football team, they's still be making Edsels and Pintos. Matt Millen is worse than 99% of the idiots who play fantasy football in assessing talent and chemistry. He needs to be canned ASAP or else Detroit will never see a winning football team again.
