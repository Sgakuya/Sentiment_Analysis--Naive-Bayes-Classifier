I remember one time I was poking around on the web and I found a site called something like the countdown till Natalie Portman is legal! This guy had a webpage and all it was was a birthdate and a clock counting backwards down to the second when she would turn eighteen... and thus be thrust deep into the unknown realm of womanhood. That was kinda sick and if I were Natalie and I saw that I would be creeped out in a big way. It's like there are throngs of men grunting wildly outside her house pawing at the gate, groping wildly for a way in! Reaching, longing, lusting uncontrollably for a chance to plunge in through the darkness and uncover the real Natalie. Well in any case it was kinda creepy... that guy must've been wacked,.. and no it wasn't me.
