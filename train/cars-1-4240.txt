I had a Sienna that developed the engine sludge problem with proper maintenance. No longer own it. Traded it at about 20,000 miles and hope it is not the one you got Billydee. Most concerning to me is that Toyota denied covering your repairs, Billydee. They have an 8-yr unlimited mile policy on repairing sludge. The policy itself is somewhat vague, but a Toyota rep opened a discussion forum at www.edmunds.com on the sludge problem last spring (it has since been archived, but you can stll find it by doing a search for sludge in their Town Hall Forum. It is called something like Toyota's customer resposne to sludge. Anyway, somewhere in the #300's posts, the Toyota rep clearly states that the policy covers purchasers of used vehicles, but the date of the original first purchase (when bought new) is when the 8 yrs is counted from. Your dealership may laugh if you give him somethign you found off the net, but if you get no response, I recommend you call the 1-800 customer support numbers for Toyota corporate. Espeically if you already paid for repairs, go straight to corporate and insiste on a refund of your repair costs and any incidental expenses you incurred (rental car). If you still get no response, I would plaster your experience all over the net if I were you. Other sites you may want to visit are www.Edmunds.com (they have several Toyota and Sienna forums, but be civil because they like to give the boot to people who complain about sludge), thecomplaintstation.com - go to Toyota under the T's . www.carsurvey.org, www.carreview.com, www.cartrackers.com, www.ripoffreport.com, www.planetfeedback.com are a few places where you can get vocal. Good luck.
