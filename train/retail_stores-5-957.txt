I really love Abercrombie And Fitch...yes, they are a bit pricey but all in all I think that the merchandise is worth it. Yes, some things are more expensive, but did any of you actually go up and check the item out? Shorts may be up to $60, but uf they are that high they come with a nice belt, and they are always thick extremely comfortable. The style of clothing is great and all really really soft, shirts for example, feel of an A F shirt, but then go over to WalMart and feel of one of their shirts. Isn't it thin and doesn't it feel somewhat rough on your skin? You get what you pay for, always and forever so Long Live Abercrombie!
