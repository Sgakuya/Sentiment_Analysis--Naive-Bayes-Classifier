I had Cingular for two years,Every time i needed something fixed on my phone, I took it to my local Cingula store. The lady there always put used parts out of another phone to try and fix mine,what kind of S**t is that ? She never would just trade me for a new phone (same model) I was sick of it. Finally after 3 hours on the phone with the dip S**ts at Cingular, I was awarded a new phone. Well, three days later I was tired of not getting any reception. So I called and canceled my Cingular service. The Customer Service lady told me i had to pay off my bill, I told her that was fine and how much was it. She told me $185.28. With in an hour, i went back to the local Cingular place and paid them $185.28. Everything was fine,for 6 months. 6 months later i get a bill in the mail from Cingular for $107.32. I was like Hell Naw. So i got on the horn ASAP and talked with some lady and she told me that that was my FINAL BILL I told her i had already paid the $185.28, she agreed that i did, but still owed them this $107.32. After bit**ing at a manager for two hours, I told them what they could do with there phone service and $107.32. Till this day(05/25/04) I haven't paid them sh*t. They sent me to several collection people, but they just got an ear full everytime they called me. They quit calling after about three months. So as far as I see, Cingular can ram their customer service and everything else right up their A## !!!
