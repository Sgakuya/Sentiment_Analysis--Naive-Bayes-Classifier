Al Gore does not care about the American people as a nation, he only cares about himself. Al Gore and his campaign keep talking about the will of the people, but what they mean to say is the will of the chosen Democratic counties in Florida. They also talk about a fair and accurate count. There is nothing fair and accurate about their re-count. There were votes thrown out because of human error all over the country. What about the will of those people? Why is it that anytime one of the people in Florida vote for Bush they try to throw it out and say it's considered an illegal act? Why is the will of these people not respected? What about the will of the people in the rest of the U.S.? Did Al Gore and his campaign not notice that Bush took most of the states in our country? Al Gore only took a few of the states, but lucky for him, they just happened to be ones with a lot of electorial votes. I don't think the will of the people is being considered at all. I think the majority of the American people are tired of the counting and re-counting. Al Gore is only thinking about himself and his own selfish ambitions. Is that the kind of President we want? I know I don't!!
