Gee I wonder if the reason why Tara Reid was hitting on Tom Brady had something to do with the fact that he won a Super Bowl. Still, Brady deserves credit with pushing aside the overrated Drew Bledsoe and turning a decent team into a pretty damn good one. It looks like they're resembling the team that won the Super Bowl again, although they won't go that far this year. I expect 11-5 or 10-6 and probably the AFC East crown, and they will possibly win their first playoff game and make it to the AFC title game. That's where the ride should end, but this is a tough defensive team that knows how to win and doesn't make to many mistakes.
