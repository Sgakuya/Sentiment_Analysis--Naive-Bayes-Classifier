Although rating actors isn't what one would consider an 'important' subject, I simply like to do it for fun. And let the world know (as if they care) who I think deserves recognition. Jeremy Northam would be one, and I don't mean to brag but I was one of the people, if not the only person, who requested his name on this list. I highly doubt that but who knows? And, to my utmost amazement, it ended up being number one for a little bit. He is a fine actor and is one of the underrated actors out there. The next person on my agenda would be Sean Bean. For those of you who don't know who he is, he played 'Boromir' on Lord of the Rings. Please help in adding his name onto this list. Thank you!
