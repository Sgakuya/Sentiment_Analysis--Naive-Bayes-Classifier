The Sony R series, aside for the 5XX models is pretty impressive. Good looks and good features (although some of them are just gimmicky...good for those guys who buy led-flashing behind-the-head headphones!) One thing i really like about the R series is the simplicity of design, especially on the r900, which looks neater than the 909 IMO. The units I've seen seem pretty durable for sony products, maybe sony is finally getting its ass in gear and has finally started putting some care in assembling it products --as it used to be the case in the 80's. anyway, not the best value for money, but for North American buyers there is not much other competition/choice
