I must rate Franchione in two areas. As a coach, I give him high marks. His attention to detail is superb and he leaves no stones unturned. He excells in recognizing and setting of priorities.At Alabama, he took a program that had been rocked to its core by serious NCAA sanctions and instilled a sense of pride and confidence.....then, in one action, quietly packed the pride and confidence in his suitcase in the middle of night and quietly tiptoed out of town. When the NCAA announced its sanctions in the Albert Means case, Franchione pleaded with the nearly 40 juniors and seniors who could transfer without losing eligibility to stay,to depend on him and to hold the rope , as he expressed it.He asked them not to give up just because the job got tougher. They believed in him and when the other schools came courting, they stayed. When it came time for him to make the same committment, Franchionne left when Texas A$M came courting, batting his eyes at them while calling the sports media liars that he was talking to A$M. Franchione had the world at his feet. The Tide faithful loved him, not only for his success, but for the style of play his teams exhibited, with well-balanced offenses, an advanced strength development program and cunning and effectiveness as a playcaller. In Franchione's first meeting with his A$M players, I'm sure he asked for their committment, just as he will in the living rooms of high school seniors. I know women who are beautiful asthetically, but they have the heart of a pirhana, which more than overrides any beauty the eye may behold. Franchione's players should disdain the image and recognize the inherant danger. In collegiate coaching, trust is everything. In the area of ethics and trust, Franchione is nothing.
