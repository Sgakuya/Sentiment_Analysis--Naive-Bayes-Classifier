Some people call this a comeback album, when in all actuality Deftones never really left. This album was a long time in the comeing and was well worth the wait. This is The Deftones best album to date. With passionate singles like Change (In the house of flies), Knife Party and Korea which have a very distinct and unrelenting seductivness that is unmistakably Deftones, this amazing band creates some of there best songs ever. Songs that make you feel. What I like about this album (and every Deftone's album) is that their songs make you feel and give off a certain emotion with each song. And they do this not only with lead singer Chino Marino's sometimes soft sometimes hard always beautiful vocals, but also the music itself which gives off its very own life and energy. Unlike any other band in the over hyped super marketed world of bands like Creed and Limp Bizkit, this band will not sell out. Deftones could quit possibly be one of the most underrated bands of all time. Spin reviewed this album and it recieved a 4 out of 10! While giving such shallow bands with not much to say like Limp Bizkit an 8 with their Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water album. White Pony is an album that is a power house. Towering over just about every rock C.D. that was released that year and even this year. This album also includes a guest appearence by Tool and A Perfect Circle front man Maynard James Keenan who lends his vocals to the moody single Passenger. A lead man from two other highly underrated bands. In times like these where crap music rules the charts and receives all the air play, it is nice to know that great music like The Deftones are not intimidated or scared away and can release penitrating albums such as this.
