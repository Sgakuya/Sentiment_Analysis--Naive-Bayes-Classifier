Well, it was pretty to look at, but that's about it. Stunning visuals couldn't save this movie from its agonizing storyline and cheesy dialogue. I'll give it that, the style kind of lended itself to it being cheesy; it looked like what those old movies would have been like had the technology been around at the time. Jude Law plays the hero, the stereotypical handsome and witty pilot; Gwyneth Paltrow is Polly Perkins, the stereotypical ditzy blonde female reporter whose ambitions lead her into trouble. Bit of the story: Big machines appear out of nowhere, taking resources . . . but for what? Pretty much the whole movie was a blue-screen deal, a world created by computer graphics. The interactions between Law and Paltrow's characters were the second most interesting parts of the movie, second to the imagery--but that's not saying much for the movie. Another complaint--when I went to the website for the movie (http://www.skycaptain.com), it says the city where the story takes place first is . . . Gotham City. Umm . . . Gotham City? I'm no comic book expert, but I think another hero's already got dibs on that territory. It was a neat expermiment, but it didn't quite follow through. Not worth the admission price.
