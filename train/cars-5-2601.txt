I'm not much of a Ferrari person, sure I respect them but I'm more of a Japanese car guy. But the other day I was driving down the road at night and when I stopped at a light, there was a 360 in front of me. The sound alone is worth waiting a lifetime for, not to mention the shape and brute strength of it. Sure, there was an old bald guy driving it, but when the light turned green, he drove it for all it was worth. I guess he had to wait a lifetime for it too, because you have to accumulate a lot of money before you are worthy of one of those. One of the perks of age I guess. Anyway thats my story for today so you can interpret it however you want but I can tell you this, I have a much healthier respect for Ferraris and the people who drive them.
