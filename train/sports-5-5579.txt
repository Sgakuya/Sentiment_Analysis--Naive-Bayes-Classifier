To me, Rashad is one of the greatest of all time!!! except for Sean May of course... UPDATE: get better Rashad! we're all praying for you, take your time... We Love You! UPDATE: Yes jf215 is right, Rashad is that x factor but we also did win those 4 games w/out him, so yes he's awesome and we all love him, but we dont suck w/out him!! UPDATE: I love the way 'Shad changed this year... he became unselfish and an amazing team player and defender.. Since Roy is purty positive he's goin to the NBA... it makes me sad.. bc i love Rashad and i'll REALLY miss him in that #32 uniform.. but i wish him the BEST of luck
