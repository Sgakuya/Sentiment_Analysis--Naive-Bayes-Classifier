I'm very cynical when it comes to Barbara Stanwyck but it would be interesting to find out just exactly how she ended up in leading parts. As far as I could ever tell, she had zippty do dah in the looks department but more importantly was really only a fair actress to boot. I'm sure she had fans but I've never heard anyone say - wow, wasn't Barbara Stanwyck the greatest - the way they would about say Bette Davis or Katherine Hepburn (both examples of talent outweighing looks BTW). Nope, I think she must have impressed someone behind the scenes much more than she did anyone watching her on the big or small screens (i.e., The Big Valley , The Thorn Birds ). Either that or she cashed in a lot of outstanding favors she was owed.
