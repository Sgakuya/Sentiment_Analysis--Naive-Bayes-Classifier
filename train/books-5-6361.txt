Excellent book though I felt the submission of white birth rates repeatedly quite peculiar. The death of our culture at the hands of the secularists is quite the threat to be dealt with but I find absent a perceived nexus between that and the race of the individuals. Our traditions need to be defined through assimilation. Any race of individual can do that so long as the systemic conditions promote a defined culture. The true threat therefore are the multiculturalist who defend all cultures as moral equivalents. American culture is superior and why America has been successful. Buchanan justifiably addresses the devastating effects abortion is having on our cultural deterioration as well as the premeditated intentions of those who wish to fell this country from within. I personal don't agree with Buchanans isolationist solutions but the problems he addresses are real and threatening.
