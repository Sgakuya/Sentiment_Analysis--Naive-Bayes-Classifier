what an experience... I typically shop at well known supermarkets like Albertsons and Safeway without a problem. I decided to go to the low cost Winco Foods. Yes, they have some low prices which everyone likes but their customer service really sucks. I rather go to Safeway than a zoo to get my groceries. So what if I pay a few bucks more at least they won't make feel like I owe them something. Two employees at WinCo Foods were very rude without cause. These people really have no respect for the customers. Only mistake I made was to ask an amployee to check a price on an item. She pretty much told me to go check it myself. Then when the manager came to see what was going on he told me to leave if I had a problem. I can say that you will not see me at WinCo again. I rather pay a little more but go to a store to shop not to a zoo.
