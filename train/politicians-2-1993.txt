Huckabee is the first Republican I've ever seen that was tax happy. I've lived in Arkansas almost half my life. (Im 44) and Arkansas has always been way behind the power curve. I feel huckabee is just a yes man to the Democrats that live here. Someone likes his intiatives on education, why then does Arkansas continue to lag behind the rest of the nation. Huckabee has done nothing in this state to improve this states sorry economy. I feel this is primarily because our low educated population and the fact that we have more hidden taxes than you can shake a stick at. It makes me truly sad that a beautiful state which has two major interstates major tributary to the Mississippi River central shipping and receiving location mild climate not to mention a major rail road station could be in such sad shape. Major Interstate upgrades are currently being implemented. My question is this? Why if we are not going to have any substancial industy and pull in big business are we waiting these tax dollars for upgrading. Little Rock could be another Chicago. Until people realize that tax incentives are needed to incourage business into this are it will always be a third rate state. With poor uneducated people.
