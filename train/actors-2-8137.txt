Really. Tequilafied, when did she apologize, to whom and what did she say. I have not read or seen an apology from her. She has said she regrets going to North Vietnam, that she regrets the hurt it caused, etc., etc. But, an apology for insulting the memory of those who died? An apology for accusing POW's of killing babies? To their faces? While in captivity? An apology for the pain she caused to the families of soldiers missing or killed? An apology for giving aid and comfort to the enemy of the United States? Ahh, no. No such thing to my knowledge. And, to be fair, if she were to apologize, after all these years of denial and rationalization, it would have to be pretty contrite and specific to do her any good with those who have resented her actions and cavalier, traitorous statements and actions for so long. UPDATE: In fairness, this isn't a political list, and she has turned in some outstanding performances, and is an outstanding classical actress. When you're in the entertainment business, what you do outside that arena can sometimes adversely effect your career and your rating, all-time. She deserved an Oscar for Klute. But to be so arrogant about your talent to think that extra-curricular stuff has no impact on your career, is just dopey. Were it not for her treasonous, wild period, many people would rate her more highly purely as an actress. She used her fame and notoriety to advance her political causes, as idiotic as they were. It hurt her career. Why are they so surprised when 1+1=2?
