wow!!! i cant believe what i`m reading . i`m a store manager for whitehall co in trumbull,CT and i must say i`m very embarassed by these horrible experiances these customers have been put through. i can only speak for myself and my store but i take pride in providing superior customers service and efficient follow up and won`t tolerate anything less from my associates. there is no reason or excuse to treat anyone poorly and i`m formely apoligizing for this behavior. there are times when i`m treated badly by a waitress or didnt like the way my hair or nails came out and that reflects on the whole company and i understand that. the founder of this company hugo marks successfully established this company by gaining customer loyality and integrity .when a business grows naturally there are going to be accociates that we hire along the way that aren`t right for this business ,we try to train and develop these people but sometimes that does more damage than good. it`s a vicious cycle and not much we can do about it but i can tell you, if you came to my store you will be treated like royality no matter how much you are spending because thats the way i would want to be treated if i walked into your store. i`ve been with this company for 6 years and am very grateful for all the oppurtunity whitehall has given me. it`s a great company...beautiful merchandise too...
