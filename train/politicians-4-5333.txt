I am 48 years old, a mother, wife and grandmother. I have MS. I have been told by my federal BC/BS health insurance that they will not pay for a drug which I could benefit from. Their reason is because the drug Provigil is labeled for use for people diagnosed with narcolepsy and not for people with MS. Well, my worse symptom with MS is fatigue. Two neurologist have prescribed Provigil for me, so I can have a some what normal life. The drug is too expensive for us to buy at $500 per month. I had to leave my job of fifteen years because of the fatigue. I would like to know Vice President Gore's opinion on the problem of American's not being able to afford the drugs that may help them conquer a grave illness. A couple of months ago I read the durg companies sent FREE of charge drugs to help the people in Africa with Aids. I feel this was needed and very good of the drug companies. But what about at home here is America, why can't I get the drugs needed to make my life easier. Thank for your time and good luck!! Catherine Doucete
