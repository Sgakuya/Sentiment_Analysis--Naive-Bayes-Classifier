Let's get one thing out of the way... Good Charlotte is not punk. They are power pop. That being said, I will now rate this album. I bought this album at the record store last year because my friends at school really seemed to like them. I listened to this CD a few times before I realized that it wasn't as good as everyone said it was. I'm not one of those hardcore assholes who hates everything, but this CD really gets on my nerves. The GC guys aren't bad lyricists, but they can't right music. All of the songs on this CD sound repetitive and the singer's voice is possibly the most obnoxious thing on this planet. The best song on this album is the opening song because it didn't have him singing. I kept this CD in my case for awhile before I gave it to the girl that sits beside me in science class as an X-Mas present. I'm sure she liked it better than I did.
