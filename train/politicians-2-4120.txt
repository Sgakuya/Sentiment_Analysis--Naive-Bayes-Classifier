How can anyone take this guy seriously? He hasn't done anything especially noteworthy since Unsafe At any Speed, and that was way back in the 1960s, except hand Idiot Bush the Oval Office via his ill-advised 2000 Presidential run. Old and in the way dinosaur who's stayed about a quarter of a century too long at the fair, who offers no fresh ideas, vision, perspective, etc. although he disingenuously presents himself as doing so. Despite all the damage he inflicted on the country in his spoiler antics of 2000, this cowturd has the continued temerity to announce another Presidential attempt in 2004, like as if anyone really cares. This is just a matter of some clown of mediocre ability and notable name recognition letting his oversized ego get in the way, getting his jollies by seeing his name in the newspaper, basking in the glow of our mentally retarded mainstream media, stroking himself at the good fortune of being able to extend his fifteen minutes of suspect fame at our expense. However, as appalling as this empty suit is, what is truly alarming and perilous is the fact that anyone would actually vote for this guy: I saw a poll cited on television this past weekend indicating that Nader enjoys the support of 6% of the voters, which suggests that at least 6 million America adults out there have crap for brains.
