I have lived in Florida for most of my life, mostly in Tallahassee. The young people (especially with a budget to see the world) I knew when I was younger had a mantra: I hate Tallahassee. But when it was time for me to move, I realized that I didn't want to live anywhere else (other than Orlando). It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. I've seen snow there (though the natives were stupid and didn't think they could drive in a few minutes of flurries) Tallahassee's green (!) and fairly laid back. It is big to me, since I count the rural areas outskirting every side. It's small to people who are at least 2nd generation since everyone knows everyone (One of my only irritations there. You can't escape people. And if you want to be anything you have to be known by everyone already. I guess that's my predicament as an artist, anyways.) Now, Orlando is heaven. But don't move there, I am, it's my territory. I don't want all you people there. And the Bradenton area outside Sarasota is hell. It consists mainly of old people (being in retail, I know there is a lot of mean ones here), hispanics (That's cool, just warning you you should know a little Spanish before you come!) and ridiculously rude and unintelligent redneck white people. They talk loud, dirty, and litter decorating seems a hobby. I miss seeing pretty things living here--there are few green places to enjoy. And the driving is bad--I know a few intersections that have fairly bad acccidents often. It took us a year to think about and then a month or two to actually see a beach, but the one we went to was better by far then most beaches in north Florida.
