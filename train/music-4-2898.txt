CTA is easilly the best Chicago album in terms of quality. Terry Kath's guitar prowess is at it's highest caliber, and you will see that the Jazz Rock label is actualy a gross misnomer, and Chicago is really and truly a rock and roll band with horns! Robert Lamm's compositions (merely calling them 'songs' just doesn't do them justice) are stellar. Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is is a still-valid social commentary, augmented by a Lamm piano intro. Questions 67 68 is destined to go down as one of the most overlooked tracks in the band's catalog, and rarely gets the airplay it deserves. Peter Cetera's soaring vocals, and the majestic horn lines turn this into a true gem. Beginnings proves to be a most heartfelt song, possibly the least mushy love song the band recorded in a career full of unusually mushy love songs. I'm A Man allows Kath, Cetera, and Lamm all a chance to sing lead, while Kath's guitar just burns through this Steve Winwood cover. Introduction, Poem 58, Liberation, and South California Purples all allow extended jams, to show the enormous skill of the Kath, Cetera, and Seraphine, with the horns punching in at all the right moments. But there are weak spots. Liberation, clockng in at 14 or so minutes tends to drag, while Beginnings and I'm A Man have needless percussion codas. Free Form Guitar is absolutely useless. Terry's real mettle is shown in the album's other tracks, not this avant-garde garbage. Overall, CTA shows you just want Chicago is capable of more than any other band, and outlines the astronomic talent and potential these seven musicans possess.
