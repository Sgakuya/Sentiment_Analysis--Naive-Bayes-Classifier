Why would anyone with sense want to replace a liar with a thief? Gov. Bush is the best candidate for the job...why is Gore trying to steal his win? Anyone with common sense should know why there should not be a recount of the whole state of Florida..it would give license to the Democrats to steal even more votes than they can with just a few counties. Al Gore has lost. He should do what is right and quit his whining. This loser attitude is not good for the whole of America. It's too bad that Florida (and other states') voters are blindly following someone else's instructions and not reading the ballots . . shame on them for blaming others for their incompetence and lack of thinking for themselves. You don't punch the second hole without looking to ensure that this is the choice you want. I do not believe that a dimple or bulge should count as a vote for anyone . . . a rule was not in place at the time of the election. You cannot make up the rules after the game is played. I do not claim to be either a Democrat or a Republican...I vote each election independently based on my decision as to who is the best person for the job. This year my choice was George W. Bush as I feel that we do not need a continuation of the same ole lying and lack of morals that has been an example for our youngsters for the past eight years. It is time for all Americans to expect more of our leaders. Let's get our moral standards up and the violence down. Let's expect decent movies and entertainment...not vulgarity and trash. Let's treat everyone with love and respect. We were all created special and unique..let each of us be the best representative of our manufacturer as we can be! May George W. Bush and everyone else be blessed and may God bless this country of ours. We are so complacent about our blessings. Let's Thank God for them all.
