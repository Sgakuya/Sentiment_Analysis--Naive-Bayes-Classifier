How on earth can you guys penalize him for playing so long??? That's a PLUS! He had a long career and was good even when that career was in it's twilight. He was also a total 5-tool player. He had speed (300+ stolen bases), defense (gold glove winner), was said to have the best arm in the 70s, and hit for both average and power. He won two batting titles before he ever won a home run title. He did not just hit home runs. In fact, that wasn't even what he was known for until late into his career. Consistency and a long career are what got him the home run record. Even if he'd never borken it, though, he'd be maybe the greatest for simply excelling at every facet of the game. And the pressure and bigotry he put up with in his career made things even worse. Mickey Mantle once said that Aaron was a better fielder than Mays because he would make the catches look easy, rather than flashy. Anyone that disagrees with that doesn't know anything about baseball. And let's not forget, Hank Aaron holds the record for records. He was also a winner. He was terrefic in both of his World Series. Not spectacular, just productive. One of which was a win, the other pushed the mighty Yankees to 7 games. Possibly the greatest baseball player in the history of the game.
