All these comments are BS. it's either you rate it a 1 or a 5. hell, what's up with that? I am a student from Ateneo and I can say that it is one of the best the country has to offer. If you think that Ateneo is a money making institution, then you're right. In fact, almost all schools are. Money talks and if schools aren't money making institutions, then most probably, schools would close down. Diplomas are never easy to get if you work hard for them. If you got an easy diploma, then shame on you because you are a bona fide slacker. That cliche nasa Diyos ang awa, nasa tao ang gawa will always, always hold true. Schools like Ateneo will go far enough.. The students, ah, they will go the distance..
