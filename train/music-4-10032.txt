This cd has a good feel to it. Baby one more time os a preetty good song. I like the DVS rework to it. drive me crazy is a good party jam and the stop remix is great! I also love the song born to make you happy cause the beat is cool and it is a great song overall. I also like the bonus remix for it I got off of morpeous. I really dig the i'll be there song because of the nice flava to it and it is a nice song with a nice meaning. I also thinhk the soda pop song is a nice party song. sometimes Is a nice song and it is nice to listen to on a nice day. I like this cd better then oops I did it again , because she don't recycle the beat over and over. She uses different sounds for all her songs on this one.
