What a breath of fresh air! Down to earth and full of warmth, Dubya's got integrity and great vision. Don't under-estimate this guy. Everything Bush has done recently has been contrary to conventional wisdom and utterly brilliant: 1) a VP choice that doesn't solve any campaign probs (a state, an ethnic group) but instead shows a serious committment to mature governance' 2) bold and optimistic policy proposals (private accounts to save SS, missile defense to replace the outdated AMB treaty, educational choice), and 3) devoting the convention to correcting America's vision of Republicans -- appealing to the most optimistic shared ideals of Republicans and showing how those ideals are universal and how they transcend the parties' little differences. A great man for America at a crucial moment!! Viva Bush!!
