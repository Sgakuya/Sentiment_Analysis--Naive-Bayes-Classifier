A couple summers ago I took off alone for a camping trip to Grand Teton and Yellowstone (in Wyoming) and Glacier National Park (in Montana). The entire trip was amazing, but Glacier was definitely the highlight. This park is tucked in the upper left corner of Montana, right on the border with Canada, and I saw a large part of the state when I drove there from Yellowstone and then headed over to South Dakota. The entire state is beautiful, with huge open plains framed by towering mountains. Glacier is especially scenic. The mountains there have a unique look, with steep vertical faces and a mix of smooth and jagged edges. I saw all kinds of wildlife, including tough-looking white mountain goats, elk, and a large grizzly bear (the last one through binoculars, thankfully). Glacier has great camping sites and all kinds of trails, from easy hikes to serious multi-day journeys. At some point I'd love to learn how to fly fish and make another trip to Glacier. If you have a chance to visit this park in the summer, don't pass it up.
