A very nice state with terrific historical sites, good geographic diversity-coastal areas, the piedmont, the Blue Ridge mountains-and friendly people who possess that wonderful southern graciousness and warmth. Children here seem better mannered than most adults in other places I've lived. There are tons of smoking hot southern women who love to party and have a good time and who are genuinely nice people as well. Outstanding educational system at both the secondary and post-secondary level. Spring and Fall are wonderful, winters generally mild and tolerable, summers though are long, hot and humid. A number of the larger and medium sized cities have made the best places to live lists over the last few years. Good job opportunities, biotech in Richmond and high tech/dot com jobs in Northern Virginia. The northern part isn't without some negative aspects; horrendous traffic jams, and despite a top notch public school system, great parks and recreation, well funded libraries and cultural diversity, it suffers from the typical cookie cutter suburban sprawl that now stretches all the way to the mountains. The social and political climate is often described as being arch-conservative. While Virginia never will be strongly liberal, more accurately it is solidly moderate. One of my 3-4 favorite states.
