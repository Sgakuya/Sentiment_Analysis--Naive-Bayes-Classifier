The actual basic service is OK but I have many complaints. • On some High Definition programming I experience random pixilization and voice out of sync when viewing through Super Definition output opposed to Digital Video Output. • Guide Updates are a pain in the a_ _. Every day when I hit the guide it wants to download the guide and it takes about 3-5 minutes (6100 receiver). • Programming is a rip off. Expressvu is doing there best to make you pick every package even though you may only be interested in 1 or 2 channels in some of them. If you have an old package and you want to make a small change, they make you change your whole subscription to the new packages available at the time (higher priced). IF you want to order some channels separately, you will likely find that they can only be selected as a “Theme”. They have placed specific high rated channels in the full Theme selections. Conclusion: I would be more than happy to try a competitor if they were around. I don’t know if Starchoice is still available but I will certainly look in to it.
