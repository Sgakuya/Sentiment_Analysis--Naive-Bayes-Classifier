When I first bought this bike, there were at least 5 things wrong with it. The drivetrain was messed up, the bottom bracket was too loose, and the fork was a piece of junk. It kept making a clunking noise whenever i went to do a bunnyhop, because it had a faulty cartridge. So since then, I had everything fixed, and it is turning out to be a pretty good bike. The fork runs smooth since it was fixed, plus I put the firm ride kit on it, and it feels so much better. If the factory would have built it right, then it would have been an awesome bike, but they didn't, so I have taken it to the shop 3 times so it runs the way it should. I've only had it for about a month, and its gone from crappy to a real good deal. I would recomend putting new tires on it and a firm ride kit for the fork also, unless you like a very soft fork.
