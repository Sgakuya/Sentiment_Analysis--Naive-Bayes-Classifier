The Windwaker feels more like a Disney animated cartoon at times thanks to the clever use of an artistic technique called toon shading, or more commonly referred to as cel-shading in the videogame industry. It doesn't feel quite as epic as it's predecessor Ocarina of Time and sometimes falls short of expectation's as most of the time you'll spend at sea sailing from one location to another, and it's here where I think the game often feel's like a chore. Having to change direction of the wind using Link's wand each time you wish to change course can get rather tedious, although it makes up for it as you'll encounter plenty of interesting character's along the way, both at land and sea and often with a task for you to fulfill. The tried and tested gameplay elements of Ocarina of Time have made their way over to the sequel with a few improvements aswell, including puzzles that are more varied, interesting and often quite challenging to solve which you'll be doing in between battling some beautifully animated enemies and who are far more intelligent than the one's you will have faced in Ocarina of Time's, although the end level bosses themselves seem easier to defeat. All in all it's a classic Nintendo effort and a worthy successor to Ocarina of Time that deserves to be in anyone's collection.
