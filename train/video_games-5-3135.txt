This is an amazing Final Fantasy. How often does a sequel surpass the original? I think this one does. Final Fantasy X-2 graphics are simply astonishing, in spite of having many fewer FMVs than its predecessor. I think the graphics on FFX-2 may be even better than FFX's graphics. The gameplay is non-linear, which is a welcome change. However, it does have a few infuriating side quests, but that's to be expected. The battle sequences and level ups are nothing new, with the exception of garment grids. Changing garments during battle allows each player to take on a different set of attributes, such as Black Mage, White Mage, etc. The garment grid is a very original idea. However, I do miss the sphere grid of FFX. Final Fantasy X-2's storyline is somewhat non-traditional, which makes it fun and different. The storyline is mostly girl-power orientated, but it can be enjoyed by both genders. In my humble opinion, Final Fantasy X-2 is the second greatest of the series, next to FFVIII. Edit: There's a secret alternate ending
