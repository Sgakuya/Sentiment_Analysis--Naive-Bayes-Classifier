JENNY STENSON says it all- stupidity, bigotry and ignorance-my suggestion to you- get in a time machine and go back to America in 1850-your viewpoints are nearly the same regarding civil and human rights- and remember the the BIBLE teaches us to love and not hate- something your mini brain is unable to understand......I hear the last writer discuss the 'regressive politics' of Massachusetts. I would think the word regressive means thinking that is not progressive, considering the Bay State was one of the first states to abolish slavery, and grant gay rights and marriage to gay couples, and advocate stem cell research- is this regressive? Seems more progressive to me. In this country today, we live in a regressive era in regards to social reforms amd overall thinking- we have many states denying people civil rights if the are gay or lesbian, we have states wanting to abolish 'science' in teaching- and teach 'creationism'. Was not the 'scientific method' began over 500 years the 'Dawn of the Age of Reason?"If you want 'regressive thinking' go to the deep south, or perhaps Utah- those places are regressive-not Massachusetts.
