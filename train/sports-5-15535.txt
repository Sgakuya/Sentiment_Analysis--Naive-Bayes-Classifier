One of the best MLB's there ever was. Not the best, there certainly are better. However, I say this because of what he did for the balimore franchise defensively. People want to give credit to other LB's on the team and that's fine, but what the fans don't see is how in practice, Ray Lewis teaches them all how to perform. Come Sunday, those great plays Suggs, Hartwell, Boulware make are a product of ray lewis teaching and their talents for listening and learning. Heck, most publicly known teaching is what he did for ED Reed....Reed admitted in an interview couple of years ago (not exact words..but he said), that Ray Lewis made him a better player and that he never had a feel for the game like he does now until he started learning from ray lewis....that speaks volumns, do you honestly think as outspoken as ray lewis is that he don't do the same for the rest of the team? When Ray Lewis retires, he will be some teams Linebackers coach just like Mike Singletary does now and he will be a great one at that. Also, injury is limiting Lewis production right now...you can't produce when your on the sideline hurt. That comes from making over 100 tackles every year. Ray Lewis brings the kind of play that you want from a middle linebacker.
