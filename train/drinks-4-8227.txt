I bought this wine on the recommendation of a Gallo in store marketer while I was perusing the shelves and he was setting up a display. He said For an $8 bottle of wine it's really nice and very fruity, a very smooth peachy flavor to it Then he went on about palates and distinguishing tastes etc. and he lost me. He also said he drank two bottles of it the night before, mmmhhh. Feeling stupid about wines already I really had nothing to add, in fact I'd never even heard of a Gewurztraminer before let alone know how to pronounce it. In any case I bought it and walked away with that feeling you get when you ask someone a technical question and they just talk way over your head and you leave feeling very dense. In any case he was right! Although, the thought of peaches in my wine when he first said it sounded awful to me it ended up being pleasant and not too strong. Perfect if you don't want something to overbearing with a meal.
