Although hardly as exiciting as what was going on in the White House at the time the film was released, Murder at 1600 is a solid thriller that keeps the view entertained throughout. The film revolves around the murder of a federal worker in the White House, a murder that Detective Harlan Regis (Snipes) is intent on solving. With help from a Secret Service Agent (Diane Lane), Regis uncovers some interesting facts that make for a compelling and thrilling mystery. The ending was played out very well, as it brings the entire film to a satisfying close. Solid back up performances from Dennis Miller, Alan Alda and Ronny Cox as well as some decent action scenes put Murder at 1600 over the top as an entertaining action/thriller.
