A perfect example of why moderates are the best thing for America. Economic prosperity and peace. Not to mention that The United States was admired and respected under him. You can call him a sexual predator all you want, but I fail to see how two consenting adults engaging in sexual acts qualifies one as a predator. Was it sleazy and wrong to cheat on his wife? You bet, but stop blowing hot air and realize that what he chooses to do with his personal life does not effect his performance as President. Clinton is getting screwed. He was 10X the President that John Kennedy was (AND 10X LESS THE WOMANIZER), yet JFK sits up there on the ranking with about a 3.3 because he was assasinated so young. Bah. I miss you Bill.
