A person that every little boy and grown man can look up to as the perfect role-model. Gehrig had class in spades. The second greatest player of his time only because the greatest was the guy who batted before him. This was a "clean-up" hitter! In a career and a life cut short, Gehrigs accomplishments and legend remain untarnished by the passage of time or the statistical inflation of the modern game. In 1927 when the Babe clouted 60 homeruns and Lou finished second with 47, the third highest total in the league (reached by fellow Yankee Tony Lazzeri)was 18. This is how far above the competition that these two stood. The Babe and Lou. Manny and Big Papi may draw comparisons and hyperbole in today's game, but there will never be a duo like the Babe and Lou. (Spoken by a RedSox fan!) To those of you who would rate this great man with a one or a two, there is something deeply dishonest about your input.
