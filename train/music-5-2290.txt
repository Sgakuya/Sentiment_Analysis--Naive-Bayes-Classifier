A big step above Pillar's debut album, Fireproof. Rap and rock are melded together into a compelling passionate mix, yet basic rock is present too. 'Bring Me Down' is a powerful rock song about not letting yourself be brought down by others. 'Hypnotized', the first track, is a reminder not to let yourself get caught up in the things that don't matter, to not let yourself be blindsided by evil. The Limited Edition of this cd contains two bonus tracks, a remix of Bring Me Down and 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'. Sunday Bloody Sunday is as good as any of Pillar's songs on the record, so buying the Limited Edition [if you can find it] is a very good idea. Plus the black cover of the Limited Edition looks good with your CD collection.
