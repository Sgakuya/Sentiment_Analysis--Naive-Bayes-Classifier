Her is a man who has been left to govern a nation already consumed with one of the highest taxation brackets in the world coupled with monies earmarked for eastern Germany to bring it up to par with the western half, a severe influx of gastarbeitern (guest workers) from other nations living in a country already teeming with social unrest unseen since the 1920s and 1930s, where racial flareups have become more common and neo-Nazi promises of Germany for the Germans (read: white Germans) have become louder and more commonplace. I'd have to say that he and the Social Democrats are doing a helluva job, given the political scandals and other messes left behind by Helmut Kohl, the Christian Democrats, and the corporations who were given their usual tax breaks to further erode Germany's economy and add to a nation's angst and weltanschauung of feeling overburdened and resentful of supporting former citizens of a socialist utopia that was intentionally corrupted by men and women who gave socialism a bad name. The Germans are a good people already saddled with numerous crises who are doing their collective best to rectify their situation(s), with the silent Christian Democrats looking the other way or offering lip service. Keep up the good work, Herr Kanzler Shroder. Sie wurden einen gutes Job tun, und Deutschland wird besser und mehr starker immer Ihn sein.
