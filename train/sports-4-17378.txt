My ranking of this team overall is good. Maybe not right now, but what they accomplished from 1981 to 1998 ranks among the greatest runs in NFL history. The 49ers won 5 Super Bowls - 1981, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1994 with some of the greatest players in history. Joe Montana, Dwight Clark, Jerry Rice, Ken Norton Jr., John Taylor, and of course the incomparable Steve Young. Back in those days they were excellent, the best of the best, THE team to watch. I miss 'em being awesome. I love the Niners. I hope they make a comeback with the new guy Alex Smith. A short memo to all Dallas fans, players and especially Jerry Jones: GO TO HELL, I HATE YOU PEOPLE.
