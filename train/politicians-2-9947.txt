I voted for him in 2000 by default--I simply did not think the other ticket would make for strong leadership. I am beginning to regret this move. There doesn't seem to be any solid evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which was the primary reason he gave us for going to war. Removing Saddam was a secondary reason. I'm not sure I understand the intense need to create democracy in a country this unstable (especially with so many problems in our own country). It does reek of Vietnam. I don't think he's the reason for "global warming." I read all of the other comments carefully and despite what Stangg says, no one is blaming him for global warming. The blame is on the fact that he refused to participate in various summits (including one coming in early 2006) to study the possibility that PERHAPS the reason for these intense hurricanes, and the melting of the ice around the North Pole and South Pole and the lack of transition seasons like spring and fall COULD be related to global warming. I don't think any logical person would blame a U.S. President for this--there are many things and parties to blame. The economy seems to be strong based on the number of people at Best Buy buying expensive plasma TVs and other consumer goods. But jobs are being shipped overseas--my cousin, who has a computer science and engineering degree, recently lost his job at a major corporation because of outsourcing to India. Outsourcing of U.S. jobs, and the "insourcing" of immigrants (both legal and illegal) to take over blue collar and assembly line jobs, is a HUGE problem in the U.S. that must be addressed. Again, this is more important that brining democracy to a country that apparently does not want it. I am beginning to distrust him and the others in his administration. I hope he can turn it around--but I fear it may be too late.
