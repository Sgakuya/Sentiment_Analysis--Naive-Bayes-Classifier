I use AT T normally and all over Arizona I have been able to get connected in some pretty remote places. Thus, I was surprised when I could not get AT T along I-8 between Gila Bend and near Yuma. Nevertheless, I did get a seemingly informative ALLTEL recorded message that told me I wasn't authorized to use the ALLTEL wireless network and a customer representative would soon help me. Well no, you get a busy signal and so you figure you should try again. No luck, I tried over and over. If you were really stuck and needed help this sort of message is worse than no message. You can get to a network, think you might be able to get through, but never can. There should be a way to pay on the spot, or something, so that an emergency message could be routed somewhere. After all, it is harder to give CPR and keep the blood from coming out of the wound while redialing over and over, getting the same stupid trespassing message, and getting busy signals! If ALLTEL says someone is coming online to help, they better do it or tell you you're on your own.
