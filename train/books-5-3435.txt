For those of you who don't like Howard, you have already made up your mind and will not enjoy the book. I won't try to change your minds. On the other hand, if you are a marginal fan, or just want a little insight into why he is the way he is, or even if your a huge fan, then this book is for you. From his early childhood, to his glory days as the cream of the NY DJ's, this book will explain it all to you. It is an outstanding biography of a dumb guy who happened to get lucky and make it big on the radio. Alot of people think that Howard is an uneducated, talentless hack with no redeeming qualities. This book will help explain how he became that way!! But seriously, this book will give all Howard fans a deeper insight into what drives the guy, why he is so loyal to Robin Quivers, and how he changed radio. It is sad that alot of people will judge Stern on what little they know about him from the many short news stories they have seen. If more people would listen and watch him over a long period of time, they wuld see that he trully is a comic genius and makes alot of sense. Quick sound bites is no way to judge someone. This book will give his fans a better understanding of what drives him. I highly recomend this book.
