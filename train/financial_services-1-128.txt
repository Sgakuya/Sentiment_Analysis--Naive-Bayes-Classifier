I have an auto loan through Wells Fargo. I wanted to the dealership to go through Ford Credit (but I already had 2 outstanding - always paid on time-loans with Ford). However, I went ahead with Wells Fargo because I didn't know much about them. If figured, It will be ok. Boy was I wrong. Although they have online bank access, and credit card access, they do not have online capability for their auto loan customers. With Ford Credit I can go online to schedule my payment and my statement comes to me via email. With Wells, I have to call up every month to do a check by phone. Also, once when I was one day late, they called me to see what had happened. I told them they had the check. The rep looked in the system and said, So we do, and thank you for being a loyal customer. Now, they call me all the time (day and night), attempting to get me to get an equity loan with them. I wouldn't have those people near my house for all the tea in China. Once Wells Fargo moves into the 21st Century, they might be okay.
