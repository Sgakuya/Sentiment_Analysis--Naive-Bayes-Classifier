Gary Williams' squad can get back to the Final 4 if they can overcome that early loss to Florida...I love Steve Blake; his court vision is unmatched, with the exception of Jason Williams...Losing Terence Morris will only help them; he was an overrated guy who became enamored with his own hype...Juan Dixon is a do-it-all college player, but he's very thin out there at 6-3, 164. Still, he's a master thief and scorer...Drew Nicholas could start for other ACC teams; he's good in his 6th man role, though; he's a fine perimeter scorer...Byron Mouton is a great all-around player; he plays hard on defense, he can score inside and out...Lonny Baxter is a load; he outplayed Boozer frequently in those Duke games.
