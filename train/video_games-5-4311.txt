Artifact is a 2d real time multiplayer strategy game created by an independant game developer called Samu Games. The game went public in 1999 and is played totally online vs other players. The theme is medieval and the graphics aren't stunning, but the level of teamwork and the bonds of the community I think make the game quite unique. It's not a great game for people short on free time. You are looking at anywhere from 6 hours a day of play to playing all day long on most days, to be a success at the game. The game also takes a bit of time to master, and it's not something people readily figure out on their own. With the help of Trainers and other players, you can become quite competitive in 1-3 months. Learning though is quite fun. There's in general 20(at the lowest point of the day) to 70 players online at a time, with the average game having alliance sizes of 5 players(and some games are more competitive than others, but 20 players per game is a normal amount, with the max number of players the map can support being 75-95). There's many different games running at once, with different settings. It's worth a try, I've been playing it for 3 years.
