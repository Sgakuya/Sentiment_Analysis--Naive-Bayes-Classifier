Mr. Keyes needs no acclaim from me. He is certainly self-sufficient. My opinion of Alan Keyes, based upon the times I've met him personally and the multiple times I've heard him or watched him is that he has the answers that America will be looking for sooner or later. He uses logic to back up his assertions and isn't bleeding sentiment. I believe that in the months and years to come, Mr. Keyes will be listened to more intently because the nation will need no-nonsense answers to critical questions. We couldn't do better than Alan Keyes. I, along with people like me, will continue to pray for Alan Keyes, his campaign, and this nation. I pray that we as a people will have the moral courage to stand up for the oppressed and speak against tyranny.
