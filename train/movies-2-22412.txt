Uhh . . . . well, at least it's better than Episode one. They wisely cut out most of Jar-Jar's presence, and they upped the maturity level a lot. The love story was nauseating, but understandably necessary. The computer graphics were well done. Anakin was so irritating, but I think they wanted him that way. The only part of the movie that was really worth seeing, for me, was Yoda's battle at the end. He was like a little green cricket on speed! It was hilarious, I can watch just that part again and again. But, that's about it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, it may be worth seeing if you can stomach the nauseating love scenes.
