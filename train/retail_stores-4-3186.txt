I agree with the other users in here of Netflix. I have been a member of netflix for two years and 4 months. I have never had any problems with their service when it was only in California. ever since they opened up a Flushing NY center, i've been having serious problems returning DVD's to them. To date i have reported 11 dvd's lost. And they have frozed my account a few times. and i had to contact the Post office and contacted netflix with the case number. I wanted to cancel my account and join walmart.com. they offered the same service. but i decided to keep with netflix. i have heard on the radio on 1010wins, that it was some of netflix's own employees and the post office who stole the dvd's. Some guy had 500 dvd's in his house. but so far everything seems to be fine. they r receiving their dvd's back.
