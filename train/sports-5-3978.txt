The very name of John Wooden stands for excellence and superior achievement. Whether a person is a fan of UCLA or even their state rival USC it is hard to imagine anyone being considered better. I believe Bear Bryant is the greatest coach in college football history but his success could possibly be overshadowed if someone gets lucky. Some other coaches already exist who might make a claim as the greatest in college football. The same is not true for college basketball. With 7 straight national championships IN A ROW and 10 in all Wooden did not just set the bar. He grabbed it, tucked it under his arm and ran away with it FOREVER. In modern times it would be considered almost impossible to go undefeated for a full college basketball season. Although 2 teams are attempting it this year the fact is Wooden did it 4 times. Simply the best.
