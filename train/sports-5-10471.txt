He is SO great.Were it not for nemesis Miami who went to play for NC 3 times they barely beat FSU, and coming up short in the 3 other NC games he played in, Bobby could easily have 5,6 or 7 NC. Then what would the doubters say? Unquestionably, the Bear would have to take a backseat. No coach or combination of coaches has ever been as consistent with 14 straight top 5 finishes. Miami is #2 with 11, then UF with just 4. That shows how tuff it is just to shine in the state, much less the nation. NCAA football is so much more competitive these days then in Bryant's era. If he leaves before Joe Pa, he will have given up his greatest achievement.
