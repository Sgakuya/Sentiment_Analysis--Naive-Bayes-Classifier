The western part of Virginia is gorgeous, with the Blue Ridge Mountains. This state is somewhat conservative, but much closer to moderate than pure conservative. Many people have mentioned that northern VA is a giant traffic jam. Highway 7 is indeed very bad during morning and evening rush hours. It's true that parts of northern VA are so built up that they are just plain ugly. But it is also important to remember that there are still many beautiful, rural parts of NoVa. And for those who would complain that VA isn't progressive, I agree for the most part. But NoVa does have one thing in its favor: it may be crowded, but this part of the state is politically progressive. VA is a great state for history lovers. And architecturally, Staunton is one of the most beautiful small towns I have ever seen.
