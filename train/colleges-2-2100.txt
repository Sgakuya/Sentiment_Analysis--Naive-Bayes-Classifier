I'll second Manager13's quote: Overcrowded campus, nasty dorms,impersonal. I'll add: I doubt it differs much from other big southern universities in that it has a flourishing (racially segregated)party scene where you'll be deluged by yummy-fashion-challenged-easy-to-nail-psuedo-valley girls, bad beer, a wide varety of live music (mostly bad/some very good bands) in mostly cheesy and unhygenic bars/clubs where it seems the Greek-frat types (uniform is cotton dockers/Ralph Lauren shirt/dirty, ratty baseball caps) are the majority. The sprawling campus makes getting to your next class within 15 minutes a challenge. Traffic in the town is worse as city planners obviously didn't think the university would surpass 40,000 students (plans are for 80K+ over next 20 yrs). Not all is distasteful. The gym is first-class. So too are the resources and opportunities for students. UGA is definitely a preeminant research institution with superior graduate programs in a wide variety of studies. Many post-grad programs (especially for those receiving the HOPE grant or even in-state tuition) are why UGA can be considered a bargain. As for the undergraduate liberal arts program I completed: I attended UGA because my tuition/fees were paid completely by a scholarship grant, and I think I got what I paid for. Most classes were large and lacked interaction between students and professors (frequently taught by graduate assistants). Curriculum packed too many topics into too few classes. Often classes were cancelled because the student-teachers couldn't make it to class. The impersonal nature of the teacher/student relationship combined with the cookie-cutter exams was conducive to the widespread cheating I observed. And, most sadly, apathy towards learning seemed to exist in the typical UGA undergraduate student.
