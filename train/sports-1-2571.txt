His job takes no talent- an unlimited payroll and the stigma that goes along with being a yankee (everyone wants to be one) means that he can get whoever he wants whenever he wants and not have to worry about it. There is not a doubt in my mind that Theo Epstein and Billy Bean are a gazillion times better than Brian Cashman will ever be. Billy Beane continues to discover new talent and put a competing team on the feild every year, regardless of the fact that he has virtually no payroll to do it with. Theo put the Sox into the playoffs in his first year and the offense that he put together smashed tons of records. I expect great things from Theo, it is only a matter of time (i'm thinking months, not years) until the sox are treated to their first world series ring since 1918. P.S. Yankees suck, Nomah is still bettah, and reverse da curse!!!
