Anyone at this site defending the Rendevous is a Buick damage control person or a very lucky soul(you should play the lottery.) We have similar problems with our Rendevous listed at this site. My husband kept saying you must have let something on when it would not start. And goodness, the problems triple once the dealership gets a hold of it. Dealerships must be making a mint with Buick trying to keep the lid on this lemon. I will never be able to sale to an individual (I would not pass on my woes like Buick) and Toyota laughed at me when I went to consider making a trade. I guess I will have to pick the best Buick product and made the trade. If you are thinking of buying a Rendevous read what owners have written or best yet RenitbustU.
