These cars can be very nice cars. I have a couple of family members that drive them, and have never heard of them having anything repaired on theirs other than normal services such as regular oil changes, tire rotations and such. One person actually traded their old Bonneville in with over three thousand miles on it for a new one because they wanted the better gas mileage that came with a newer car. The exterior style of the car isn t the sharpest I ve seen, so if you prefer your cars to be eye catchers then I might suggest you choose another car. I'm only giving this a four star however, because the appearance of the cars could use some updating.
