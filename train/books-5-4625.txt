I remember reading this back in High school and I never thought that a literature book recommended by my teachers would be so enjoyable to read. What I liked about this book is that unlike the Blue Lagoon where children were deserted on an Island and it was all innocent and lovey dovey this book painted a more realistic depiction for me. Children without the guidance of an adult on an Island with other children would almost become savages and rebel if they were left to make their own decisions and most of all fend and help each other. There was a lot more irony in this book referring to the beast , simon and piggy . Well written and I would recommend it.
