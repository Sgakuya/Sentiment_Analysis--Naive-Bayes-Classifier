A masterpiece of an album! The first CD in my life I just gotta have - I couldn't live without it - I would do everything to get it! Undoubtly the best CD of the 90ies! Frozen was breathtaking, but Sky Fits Heaven is even better! And still I haven't mentioned the great singles Little Star, To Have But Not To Hold, The Power of Goodbye, Skin, Substitute For Love Nothing Really Matters! If you think Ray of Light is the best single; well, then you either don't have the album or you have bad taste! If I could ask Madonna only one question, it would be: How could you be so stupid include Mer Girl, a catastophe of a song, in this CD - your masterpiece? The use of piano is so professional! And, as another rater said: This album is healing you, no matter what mood you're in! :o)
