Terribly, terribly boring and uninspiring. He brought little substance to the 2000 presidential election, and seemed bent on changing his identity practically every week. Almost as focus group-driven as his former boss, Bill Clinton, he seems to stand for nothing except his own delusions of grandeur. It concerns me that he won as much of the popular vote in 2000 as he did. Having said that, I doubt seriously he'll get the Democratic nomination in 2004. He's a walking, talking (though I'm not sure he's capable of doing both at the same time) epitome of what's wrong with the Democratic Party in the post-Clinton era. Time for fresh ideas and a new face, and Gore offers neither.
