Excellent 1947 movie; I rate it only 4 cuz frankly, it is not a Great as in epic sense. It is pretty standard fare. But as far as a Christmas movie, the 47 cannot be beaten. Some other versions have been made - the last 1 was very good, too, shockingly, but others were lousy - but this 1 for starters had Edmund Gwen. This man is extremely believable as Kris Kringle. He truly is, as Natalie Wood said, so kind and nice and jolly; he's not like *any1* else - he MUST be Santa Claus! He is perfect, w/perfect natural beard and belly - neither overwrought as the standard view of Claus is - and w/perfect attitude and persona. I figure this is just Gwen - watch all his dog movies (man, he must have loved dogs). He's just a kindly, good-natured, cheerful, well-mannered, selfless chap! But I digress. The other actors here were excellently believable as well, and still likable even if we knew they weren't quite rite like Kris.
