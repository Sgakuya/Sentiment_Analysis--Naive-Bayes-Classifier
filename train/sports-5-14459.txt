As was Jim Brown was on the offensive side, Dick Butkus was truly a man among boys when it came to defense. Without question the meanest, most intimidating, and toughest s.o.b. ever to play the game. He is what the game of football is all about. Even when he was reduced by his terrible knee injuries to a hobbling shell of his former self, he was still the most terrifiing presense on the field and continued to strike fear in the hearts of his opponents long after both he and they had retired. To paraphrase former Baltimore Colt center Bill Curry, "If they were to call the game of football anything else, they should call it Dick Butkus."
