In my opinion, Polamalu is the best safety in the game. Statistically, he looks pretty similar to most solid safeties in the NFL (91 Tackles, 3 Sacks, 2 INTs, 6 Pass Deflections, 1 Forced Fumble, 2 Fumble Recoveries). However, there isn't a safety that plays the game faster and has more influence on the field than Polamalu. Known by many simply for his long flowing dreads, Polamalu has a knack for flying to the ball with incredible speed. He blows up sweeps, pitches, or any outside runs by getting to the ball carrier fast. He's decent in coverage too and is defintely improving his play in all facets of the game. Polamalu is young and just getting ready to hit his prime. It's because of the Steelers ability to find and develop young players like him that they've had so much success.
