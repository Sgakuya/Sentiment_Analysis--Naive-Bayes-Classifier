Okay, so we're not perfect. But who is? I mean, I'm really tired of people on the other side of the world stereotyping all Americans as pompous, wasteful capitalists with no concern for anyone else. It's like saying all Germans wear leiderhosen and yodel, or all Australians have the ability to beat up a crocodile. But even with our problems and our problem people, I still have a healthy respect for the USA. Sure, we've always been a bit cocky -- but in a way, that pride is endearing. Think of the soldiers during World War II, the innocence of those Yanks who proudly stood up to what they knew was wrong to protect what was right? We have 50 very unique states and millions of very unique people. We could learn a lot from the other countries, but we need to keep our diversity, our sense of pride, as well.
