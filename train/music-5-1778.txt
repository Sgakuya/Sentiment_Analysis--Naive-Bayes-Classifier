When I was younger, I became interested in Rock music that was primarily fast or heavy i.e. Husker Du or Jane's Addiction. As I became older my tastes began to refine. I did not like the music of my childhood any less, but found that it did not offer enough to keep me comming back. I found that lyrics were an essential portion of a song and emotion could make a song timeless i.e. Bob Dylan and John Lennon. I have found that Wilco has made a similar journey. Jeff Tweedy with Uncle Tupelo was quite a punk rock influenced musician. When Wilco was formed his music began to take on more of a folk feeling and some of his early lyrics are quiet substancial. As the term Alt-Country was invented, to classify this new style, he began to move away and experiment a bit more. The result was Summerteeth a fantastic album of a musicaian maturing. A few years older and wiser Wilco is all grown up now and has produced an album that will carry influence for decades to come. This is a must have album on the scale of Kind of Blue, Revolver, and Dark Side of the Moon.
