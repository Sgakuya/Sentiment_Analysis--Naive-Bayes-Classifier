What is the big deal everybody makes over this movie? I saw it for the first time a few months ago, and was not impressed in the least. I didn't rent it on purpose: I happened to find the DVD lying on the street in my neighborhood, and instead of being the good neighbor and returning it to the store, I watched it. The DVD had a feature where I got to watch it in English and not be subjected to the misery of subtitles. Still, with it being free and with no subtitles, it took me two nights to watch it. When they began flying through the air I thought maybe it was a fluke, because that special effect didn't really go with the rest of the movie. One of the more positive comments I can make is that the acting wasn't the shabby stuff I'm so used to seeing in those, uhhhhh..... martial arts films.
