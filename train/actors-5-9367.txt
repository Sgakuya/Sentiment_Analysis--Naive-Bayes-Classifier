Very talented character actress. Has much class as well. I get tired of women getting put down becuse they are over 25! I am not seeing this standard applied to the men very often. All those doing this need to re-think their (double) standards. Hey: I have a bulliten for you: YOU TOO (if you are lucky) WILL AGE PAST 25! I am not a feminist ...just get tired of seeing these comments on gals. Another news flash: MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL AGES CAN BE TALENTED (OH YES..STILL) AND BE GOOD LOOKIN. IN ADDITION - THEY CAN DO THIS WITHOUT PLASTIC SURGERY. Beautiful people are fun to look at but - let's not diss the ones who are natural and talented. What - we all have to get surgery to get good feedback? Pls....
