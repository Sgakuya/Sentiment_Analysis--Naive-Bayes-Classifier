About to part with my 9-3 at the end of it's four year lease and I'm sorry to see it go. I have been very happy with this car and love it's "Saab eccentricities". Only had a few problems but the car has never left me stranded. A/C display and Saab Info Display (SID) were replaced under warranty. Also had a slow leak in the power steering pump which was also replaced. I've been approached several times by strangers to ask me about the car, how did I like it, etc. Yup, it has torque steer under hard acceleration from a stop, but I hear that's been resolved in the newer models. On the open road, this car flies! Fantastic passing power, agility, etc. Lots of cargo space too. Too bad they don't have a hatch in the new models. I could fit a refrigerator in mine.
