1540 Bethel Road Col, OH Shortly after grand opening we went to this location for dinner. My Mother went into the restaurant first to enquire how long a wait and we needed a table not a booth as I am disabled and don't move around too easy. She was told no wait and no problem about the table. We parked the car and had to walk some distance to the entrance. I was using my walker instead of my wheelchair. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by no less than 4 employees standing at the door and we were told there are no tables at this location only booths. My reaction was not pleasant.I said why were we told differently. Duh they didn't know. I was tempted to go back to the car and get my wheelchair and enter the premises again just to see the look on their faces. I have never been back to this location but I certainly have told any one I know my unpleasant experience. There is a closer location (Main ST @270) to my home and I understand from friends that that location does have a few tables. I have already notified ADA of this problem and now you know too. A reply would be appreciated. tbear863@aol.com
