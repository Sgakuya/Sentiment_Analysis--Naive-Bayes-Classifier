Gene Kelly was a wonderful show biz combination; a dynamic dancer and handsome leading man who also had the ability to make you laugh. He was best known as one of the great song and dance men of his day and did some very memorable work in many films including An American in Paris and Singin in the Rain . I really enjoyed the popular documentary he hosted and narrated, That s Entertainment (1974) which gave a very nice history of all the MGM musicals and the era when Kelly and many others in the film did their best work. The less popular sequel That s Entertainment, Part II (1976) failed to capture the same magic of the first but was still interesting to fans of Kelly and the bygone era of the movie musical. I can t say I m a huge fan of all musicals, but I have always liked Gene Kelly. I can also remember that I was surprised - especially since I was still a teenager at the time That s Entertainment was released - to find myself liking much more of the music and dance routines than I thought I would.
