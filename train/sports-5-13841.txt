Hands down the best complete back in NFL history. He was extremely tough for a fairly small guy. He wasn't the fastest, not the quickest, but he was a combination of every thing. I think Barry Sanders was a better runner, but Walter was the best all-around player. He was a tremendous blocker and a great reciever. Heck, he could even throw a nice ball and kick well too. He had the biggest heart of all time. Ner Die Easy! Whenever I see Emmit's name above his is breaks my heart. You gotta remember that early in his career his line and his whole team was bad, unlike Emitt's all-star line. He was my hero, and always will be. To think such a great, couragous man is dead, breaks my heart.
