Jeb Bush has actually been a decent executive for the state of Florida, one of the most effective in its history. He's managed to streamline the entire administration of the state government, making it far more efficient. On education, he raised funding significantly across the board, but his testing policies are skewed unfairly against poorer immigrant and minority schools. Here in Miami lots of schools with poor students have been denied funds because of poor test scores. These students, many whom don't know English, can't compete with schools that have English speaking kids. Poor schools need help, no incentive can be given to make them perform better, their needs are different. Most of his truly meaningful reforms occured during the first two years he was in office from 1999-2001. He accomplished everything he set out to do in 2 years. He ran for re-election primarily on his accomplishments and won, crime was lowered, Florida had a better business environment, and test scores were up. Now, he's just coasting along, the energy of the 1st term is gone. Reform of the health care system and other important issues have gone to the wayside. Like the rest of the Republican party, Jeb has become solely focused on getting his brother re-elected above all other priorities. Really that was the only reason why he ran for re-election, he wanted to retire after 2003. But he's a been a decent governor, far more intelligent and farsighted than his brother, the President.
