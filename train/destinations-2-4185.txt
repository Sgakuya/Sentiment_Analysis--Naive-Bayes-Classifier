Very boring. The other reviewers got it right - very souless, even for a southern city. Coming down here from the Washington DC area, Charlotte does not have a city feel to it. Feels like a large suburb or big town. I thought Dallas was spread out. Charlotte is even more so. I've known international students who come to study at UNC-Charlotte absolutely hating the place. Singles and extreme liberals would hate it here as well. There is really nothing to do - no historic sites, historic neighborhood, rivers, or place of interest. Very little sense of history or culture. Shopping though is really good. Definitely a place for older people, large families, and people who want to get away from the "city" but want the convenience of close access to work, schools, hospitals, shopping malls, etc. Cost of living is relatively low. This city is just like Raleigh.
