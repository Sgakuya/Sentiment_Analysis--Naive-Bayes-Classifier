UPDATE: Thank you Andrew Olsen, thank you very much for the props. I appreciate it. ... Anyway, I don't hate Bush41, but what he did during the 1988 Election was unforgivable. He injected race into his campaign by citing the case of Willie Horton and won that way. C'mon! That showed Bush 41 was insensitive and vile. OLD STUFF: Unlike his retarded son, at least Bush41 can be reasoned with and he's much smarter than his baby boy. But still, Bush41 was a weak leader. Didn't advance the causes of this nation, domestically. Out of touch with reality. To prove it, he was stunned at seeing an electronic price scanner at a supermarket checkout.
