It is still read over 50 years later in American classrooms everywhere. As stated by another reviewer, it's not JUST a book, it really is an American history icon as well as a social commentary. Winston's life in a future totalitarian state (1984 in London) and love for Julia is makes this, in my opinion, the best work of literature ever published. Eric Blair, whose pseudonym was George Orwell, wrote this as a kind of warning of what the world would be like if everything was thought to be communistic, but turned out to be totalitarian. It is a work of great intellect and ingenuity. Perhaps the most popular and well-written book of the past century, 1984, the 1949 work by George Orwell is a perfect example of how Communism turns out to be like. It gives an in-depth description of the life of Winston Smith, an average man residing in a Communistic or Totalitarian state in which he does not totally agree with the things that are being done, but doesn t know what to do about it. He knows the actions of the government are morally and historically incorrect and is appalled that everyone else either doesn t see it or just doesn t care. It is evident because he sits there and changes historical documents for the government in order to fit what they want. Many people, including me, take it as a warning at the time of what our world would become if we let the horrible ideals of the Communist world spread and win in our Democratic society. Through his condescension of that form of rule, Orwell shows that Big Brother derives Winston s power and inner intelligence.
