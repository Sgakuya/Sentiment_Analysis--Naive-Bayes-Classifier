Admittedly, I thought the game was going to be lame, due to the shift in animation type (from realistic in FFVIII to cartoon-ish in this one back to realistic in FFX), but it didn't take much for me to get addicted. The graphics are incredible and the side games are entertaining (though that card game gives me a headache!). I wouldn't call this a challenging game at all, but it is a beautiful story. If you're overly empathetic like myself, you might want to be careful. I ended up crying a bit when I first saw that sequence with Vivi on the first ship after the boss fight . . . Poor Vivi! (Oh, give me credit, this is the only time I've ever cried at a movie/story/game, cut me some slack . . . .). (PS. IX is the roman numeral for 9, not 7)
