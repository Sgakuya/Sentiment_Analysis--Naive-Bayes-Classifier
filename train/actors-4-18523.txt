Most people think Terry Gilliam is British, but he was actually born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 22, 1940 and didn't move to the United Kingdom until 1967; nevertheless, Gilliam's philosophy and quirkiness (at least from an American perspective) is clearly representative of his adoptive homeland. While I understand why Gilliam's films would not appeal to everyone, most of his work has an organic fell and atmosphere which is illustrated by his work with Monty Python as well as the movies Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985), and 12 Monkeys (1995). Not one of the best directors overall, but Terry Gilliam is certainly one of the best movie directors in his niche.
