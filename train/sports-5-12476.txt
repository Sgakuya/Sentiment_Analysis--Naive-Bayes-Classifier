Wow - what a heartbreaker. Miami played well enough to win, and had almost more compelling story lines than you could count... Dorsey gets hurt on third and eleven in overtime, and backup QB Crudup hits for a critical 8 yard gain... kicker hits a brutally tense 40 yarder to send the game to overtime... kick returner gives Miami a chance to get to overtime, after fumbling a pass the series before that might have cost Miami the game...Dorsey comes back from injury to complete a fourth down and three.... Miami battles back despite losing Mcgahee to injury. What a game - probably the most compelling college football game I have ever seen.
