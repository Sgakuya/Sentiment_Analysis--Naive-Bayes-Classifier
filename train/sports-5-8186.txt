Vince is da man! His team didn't do well in the playoffs but look who his teammates are. Anytime you have Muggsy Bogues running the point and Charles Oakley shooting 3's you are going to have a problem. I have to give much props to Vince for carrying the Raptors into the playoffs. He is going to be the next Michael Jordan and probably even better. I knew he was going to be great when he took a coin off the top of the backboard during warmups and told me to put it in my pocket. If you don't think he is great now...just wait till this year when Mark Jackson throws him about 20 alley opps a game, then you'll know what I'm talking about.
