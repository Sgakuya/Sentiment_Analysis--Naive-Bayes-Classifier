June 1981, a month in video game history that will remain with us forever, as that was the month that the game Donkey Kong was released to the western world by an unknown former Japanese playing cards company with almost 100 years under it's belt, otherwise known as Nintendo Co. Limited. Donkey Kong (meaning Stupid Money) is about a rather large ape that managed to grab hold of the love of a carpenter (originally called Jumpman, but was renamed after the landlord of Nintendo of Amercia's original offices in New York) and take her to a construction site. Our hero, Mario must dodge every barrel, flame, and obstacle to rescue Pauline from the crazed Donkey Kong. Once you grab a hammer, you're unstoppable! Shortly after this game, Donkey Kong and Mario would appear in another game together (Donkey Kong Jr.), then it was Mario and Pauline (Pinball), and finally along the way the small games paid off. In 1985, the world finally got to see the carpenter turned plumber finally got his own full-fledge game known by all as Super Mario Bros.. The rest is history!
