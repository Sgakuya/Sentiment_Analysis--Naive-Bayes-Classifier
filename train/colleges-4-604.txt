Yale is a wondeful law school. However, it tends to attract a rather morose, angst-ridden student body, which can dampen the experience. Combine that with an intense, surpressed undercurrent of insecurity where one is constantly striving to prove one's intelligence vis-a-vis one's classmates (probably b/c everyone is surrounded, for the first time, by people as smart as they are), it makes for a fascinating but emotionally draining 3 years. Although most people wouldn't trade their time at Yale, I know more than one student who has looked at the sunny, happy (seemingly well adjusted) students at a school like Stanford with the slightest bit of envy.
