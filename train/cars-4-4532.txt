I have always liked the Chevy and GMC truck line, they have always been #1 in my book, up until the new models have came out, with the big front ends with the 4 headlights and rounded tail lights in back, I think overall the new Chevy and GMC trucks look pretty good from the side, haven't really changed a whole lot from previous years, but I guess the front and back of the truck with it's new lighting system would probably have to grow on me for me to truly like it.... GM could still be making the best trucks, I just like the way the new Dodge Hemi looks....I think overall Ford, Dodge, Chevy are making some fine machines and they are all great, and it probably doesn't really matter what you get, they are all good. GM as a whole is kinda killing it for me, with it's line of Cars these days, they all look plain and boring to me and the price tags are high.....We will have to wait and see..
