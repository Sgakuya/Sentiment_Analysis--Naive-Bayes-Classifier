Fremont Street is the only part of Las Vegas that still possesses an ounce of soul. After the chrome and mirrors of the new Vegas, the old Las Vegas strip is refreshingly sketchy. There are some tough looking characters walking around, and the occasional pan handler. Stuff is run down and creepy looking. There's a weird light show. But unlike the rest of Vegas, you can walk from place to place. It feels almost like a jersey shore boardwalk, but with a gambling theme. There are cool old neon signs everywhere, and freaky little gift shops. If you're looking for some flavor in Las Vegas, I think that Fremont Street is just about the only option. I had a $4 steak at binions at 4AM to cap off nice stroll down this street. Highly recommended.
