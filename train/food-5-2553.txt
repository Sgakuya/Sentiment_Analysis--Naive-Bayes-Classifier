My personal favorite when it comes to candy bars. Most folks confuse it with the Butterfinger, but one nibble on the 5th Avenue should quickly set the two apart (the Butterfinger has a hard, almost cookie-like base center, while the 5th Avenue has rich, lightly-layered peanut butter overlaps drenched in superior heavyweight milk chocolate). You can also tell the difference by weight, as the 5th Avenue's remarkable density is the stuff of legend. Caution and preparation should be taken when eating one, as they can get finger-messy on a warm day (I always refrigerate mine for about a half-hour before the grand unwrapping). Hershey has forever given short shrift to this classic (I've never seen more than three different commercials for them), which is obviously the reason why they're getting harder and harder to find anywhere. If you see a box of 'em and feel curious, give in and grab a handful of them; you'll never go back to Butterfingers (or much else) ever again.
