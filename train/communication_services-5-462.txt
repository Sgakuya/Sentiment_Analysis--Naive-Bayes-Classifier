I don't like cell phones, but I needed to get one for emergencies, and semi- emergencies. It will also save gas should I forget to pick up the bread on the way home or something. The fiance can call me and tell me I forgot my wallet etc. I looked at the other available pay asa you go plans, and they all S#cked. All the other plans' minutes expire if you don't use them, but Virgin minutes never expire unless you dont pay the 20 bucks every three months. Then you lose your balance 150 days after the last time you pay, or top off as they call it. That works out to about $7.oo a month to have a functioning, yet rarely used phone. You get about 28 minutes a month, but if you dont use them for 6 months, you have all that time saved up. What gets me about plan based cellular is that you sign up for $29.99 plus fees, taxes and whatever they can dream up, and your bill is $42.00 when you pay it. Virgin has no roaming, taxes, fees, except you got to buy a phone. I paid 48.88 and got 10 minutes with the phone. Thats one month with a company that you think your paying $35 bucks with. If your looking for a phone and hate 2 year contracts, dont use ypur phone more than 30 minutes a month (maybe 100 is still a good deal) Virgin will be a good deal, I think. I dont work for Virgin, btw.
