If Friedman's wants to make a comeback, why are they prohibiting Christmas music, decorations, and gift wrapping? This is the time of year when all jewelry stores make their money. They want to have constant reminders around the store that Christmas is coming and "yes!" she does deserve that piece of jewelry! It's hard enough to sell these very low quality items and now we got to tell the customer: "I'm sorry, we don't wrap anymore." once we finally convince them to buy. Our male customers rely on us not only to help them choose a piece of jewelry but also to wrap it. Most of them purchase on Christmas Eve and need to put it under the tree right away. I also wish that Friedman's buyers be all fired! What are they thinking when they send us these diamonds that look like dry ice? We can't even clean them for the customers because the diamonds fall out right in the ultrasonic! And last X-mas' tanzaniere set! How ugly! And the free teddy bears that came with were horrid! I was embarrassed to show them to people! What do customers say about our cocktail rings? They tell me that we should be ashamed of ourselves! Now we have to display a new atrocity: a drusy quartz ring surrounded by blue topaz! It looks like plastic with sparkles glued on it! And forget that "Customer Appreciation" ring---it's a $29.99 rip off! It is an illusion marquise cluster ring with only two diamonds in it! There's a round with a baguette diamond underneath it! Who the heck would want that? And here's the real kicker, they want us to take pre-orders for it! Hah! Most of the time we just tell potential customers "no" which, I know, is a big NO-NO. I'm sorry, we don't have emerald cut diamonds, or heart cut, or pear cut, or even trilliants. They have to go to Kay's or the other 8 jewelry stores within an arm's length away to get that! That's right! We have no omegas, no slides, no charms, no nothing! But if you purchase our jewelry protection plan you will get two ring sizes for free! But, alas, THOSE rings have to go to our home office to get sized and you might get it back 3-4 weeks, sometimes 8. Well, I sure hope we do alright for Christmas even thought they cut our hours so we can hire "cashiers" that we really don't need. Oh, and we take turns being "the greeter"---WoW! Now all that I need is that blue vest Wal-mart employees have (even they have nicer jewelry than us!)! Merry Christmas, everyone!
