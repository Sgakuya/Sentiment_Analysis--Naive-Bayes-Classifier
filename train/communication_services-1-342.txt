Cell One sucks, they are rude, rude and rude. I use to be a csutomer of theris back in 1993 till 2000, then I bought a new phone cash for like $800, they charged teh same phone on my bill then, and would not give me my money back, then got rude and I said I would quit and they thought that I was on contract, I had to go through 3 mamnagers and they could not let go of teh fact that I had to know they are god, even though I was not on contract, I quit and they tried to charge me a contract fee for leaving, and yet I had to prove that I was not on contract. What a nightmare!! I had to prove that I was not on contract. I finally had to sue them in small claims court to get my money back from that $800 phone plus the fess, they finally bent over and took it in teh you know what and paid me. A Few years later I actually tried to sign up with them again, guess what they blaclisted me as a bad credit risk...hahaha, mna will it ever end?
