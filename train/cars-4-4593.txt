When I was looking for a cheap new reliable descent-size commuting vehicle to replace a totalled 90 Saab 9000 in late 98, I went through a two-month obsessive decision process and decided first on a truck (yuk, been driving fine sports cars for 35 years) and found the anemic (4-banger only) 98 Frontier to be the cheapest and most plenitful deal around. So, after much deliberation, I accepted a fully loaded XE K/C 5-speed 4x2 for just over 12 grand. But, it was in the unpopular timber frost color (yuk at first, but now I like it's exclusivity). To my surprise, the Frontier is quite quiet and comfortable for a 16.3-mile commute, and the premium stereo is quite good after replacing the speakers. And it can haul a few cubic yards of smelly, slimy cargo...something I didn't have the nerve to try in Saab hatchbacks. But...yes, it's top-heavy compared to a sports car, and handles similar to an American truck or car from the 1960s, resplendent leaf springs and all, but with only a small fraction of the muscle. I give it plenty time to accelerate, and to deaccelerate. This 4X2 has rear-only ABS and probably takes as long to stop as the 50 Chev 1/2 ton pickup that helped me cut my driving teeth. I would rather take my chances to disable the ABS. Also, crash tests indicate that frontal collisions should be avoided at any cost. After 37,000 miles, no trouble whatsoever. This is the reason that I bought it, and it averages 23.8 mpg (EPA is 22/26), just shy of 25.1 mpg I've enjoyed in three different Saabs. Thus, I rate it highly for reliability, also for flawless, fit and finish. Strangely, I use this vehicle more than I originally anticipated. As my first truck, it exceeds my expectations.
