I love Coulter's sarcastic sense of humor; I think the stuff about liberal Democrats disappearing from the face of the earth are just mostly for purposes of being humorous. No one should take everything TOO seriously! I don't agree with all of the points in her book, but generally speaking I do agree that the media and most elite institutions have a leftward slant. The elite are composed of lefty's because they've been socialized to be that way. It's not a nefarious conspiracy to brainwash all people into believing something. We all are entitled to our own opinions and Dan Rather or anyone else can't change that or take that away from us. Everyone has a viewpoint and common ground is found in the middle. That is what really makes a democratic society work. Yet the time may come when you feel like you need to take a principled stand. I don't agree with Ann on everything, but she's gutsy and I admire her honesty and clarity.
