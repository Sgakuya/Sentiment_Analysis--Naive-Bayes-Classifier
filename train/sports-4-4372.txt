Coach Roy Williams is a tough nut to crack. Williams sure can lead a horse to the trough, but can he make it drink (ie he still has not won a national championship). He has not thus far, but perhaps coming back home to Chapel Hill and the change of scenery will do the trick. Another certainty is that Williams teams are always strong in the fundamentals, which is not always an easy task with today's college players who want the ball with flash and style. The relatively low rating this far (#15 as of this post) is obviously due to Kansas fans venting their anger for Williams' departure; however, while their ire is understandable, it really isn't justified, and certainly shouldn't result in a less than a top 10 ranking on this list, a nice example of people rating with their emotions rather than their heads.
