I first started going to Steak and Shake with my family when I was very young - back in the days when they still had carhops. In all that time, they have remained consistent in flavor and are still a place you can count on for a very tasty meal. And, even though their competition has grown tremendously over the years, I would still always pick their hamburgers over any of the other chains. The menu has expanded quite a bit also, but the older standard selections can still be found and remain popular. The only thing I don't like about them are their commercials with the smarmy Steak and Shake wait staff. But even these boobs will never drive me away from craving my personal favorite combination of a double steak burger with cheese, mustard, pickle and onion and a side of Chili Three Ways! Num!
