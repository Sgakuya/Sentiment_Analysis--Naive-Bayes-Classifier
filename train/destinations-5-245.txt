I've been there twice. For a woman who is most comfortable in her own home to feel perfectly at home literally across the globe - was AMAZING. I was treated with respect, and the cultural difference was most notable at one of the dance clubs I went to. Here in the US, guys assume that every woman there is interested in a one-night-stand. In Sydney, everyone looked me in the eye and expected absolutely nothing. I even had two gentlemen help me get my coat from the coatroom without a ticket - after scouring the expansive floor for about 1/2 hour - and then wish me well on my way with nothing more than a gentle, respectful hug. Here at home, most guys would no doubt have done such a deed only with expectations. My dream is to move to Sydney.
