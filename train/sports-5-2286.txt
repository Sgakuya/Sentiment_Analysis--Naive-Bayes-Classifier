An extremely tough team to beat. The Marlins know how to close the door on their opponents and find a way to win close ballgames. A true sign of a championship team. The Marlins lost a couple players like Lee at first base, pitcher Mark Redman, and Pudge Rodriguez behind home plate, but they could have lost many more to free agency and did not. Florida remains a very young and aggressive team, a tough defensive team in the middle of the infield, the pitching is strong, and they have more overall team speed than any other ball club. The situation with the Marlins is nothing like it was after the '97 season when the strong nucleus of players left and the team fell apart. Florida is a strong possibility to repeat. The Cubs and Astros may give them a bit of a challenge in the playoffs
