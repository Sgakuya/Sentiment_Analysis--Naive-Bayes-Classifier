Top 5 reasons Guinness is the best beer: 5. It has flavor! GREAT flavor! It ain't no piss-water beer. (PS drink it ony in draft form, only at places that serve it a lot. Otherwise, if it's been sitting around in the keg, it takes on a distinctive sour dirt taste - blech!) 4. Works well as a meal replacement. I'm never hungry for dinner when I have a couple pints at happy hour. 3. For some reason, it impresses the men. ( If she drinks this, she'll do ANYTHING! ) 2. The opaque color is deceiving - but it's actually LOW-CALORIE! (Yup. Do your research. Has the same calories as a light beer) 1. Those classic ads in Ireland: Guinness - it's good for you! One more bonus: It's not fizzy like most other beers. Therefore, no burping.
