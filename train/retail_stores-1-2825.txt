So I bought an engagement ring last night. I decided to pop into a Whitehall jewelers in PA b/c they were having a big sale. I found a very nice looking ring and the price seemed right so I bought it. I was told it was a 1ct diamond and the regular price definitely reflected that. I got home from buying it and became suspicious when I took a closer look @ what a real 1 ct should look like. Today I took it to get examined and sure enough it is a .5 ct ring. I Went back and they refused to refund my money but would give me store credit. What a bunch of pricks. This asshole lies to my face and then expects me to put the credit towards a real 1 ct diamond which was more money. I would be a moron to buy anything from a company who lies straight into their customers face. Maybe I am stupid for trusting this ass but I am no expert on diamonds and I guess I left too much faith in this guy.Its a sad world. I will never buy from them!!!!!!!
