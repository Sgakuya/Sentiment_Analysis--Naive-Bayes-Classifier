Gotta give my home state five stars now don't I? I've lived in many states north and south and visted several others. Honestly, there just isn't that much diference in anthing other than culture anywhere in the U.S. And regional culture is dying fast. Poeple in the South are no more ignorant than anywhere else. No, they are not. And we aren't any more prejudiced either. I had to go north to learn just how badly people hated African-Americans. And we're pretty darned smart here too. A good many of the finest Universities in the country (William and Mary, UVA, Duke, Vanderbuilt, Tulane, Emory, UNC, etc.) are in the South. Don't forget that most of our finest authors come from the South. It's the cradle of American literature. No doubt, there are some deliverance people to be found in Georgia, but I've found those just about everywhere I've been. In fact the only states that I absolutely could not live in (for various resons) are NJ, IL, AL, MS, KS, NE, AR, FL and TX.
