Remix is good. not the best of all drinks, but definitely better than Sprite. What you need to realize is that it is from experimenting with new things that we get better. Sure, many people like Sprite, but what if it could be better? You're never going to know without trying new things with it. Think of technology, would we have faster computers without playing around with one to see what works better and what doesnt? No. Televisions, I know i would love to have a television that I could safe space with by hanging it on my wall. Another concept that would not have been realized without a bit of tinkering with something that had already been great.
