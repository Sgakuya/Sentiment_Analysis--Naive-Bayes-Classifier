A nicely done movie from Australia. Baz Luhrman directed one of his first movies with this one. A young man who has been trained for years in dancing to win the big competition in ballroom dancing. The problem is he wants to dance his way not the strict ballroom dancing rules. His partner quits in frustration and he gets a new partner named Fran a shy plain Jane who is willing to dance on his terms. They practice and develope a sweet friendship with each other. Of course there is trouble when Scott's mother who has raised him all his life to be a champion tries to force him to dance with someone else. The ending is great. this is one of those likable movies where I found myself rooting for Scott and Fran to win.
