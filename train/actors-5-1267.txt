Let me get straight to the point. How many actors do you know who can play a gangster (Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, The Godfather - Part 2) , play comedy (Meet the Parents, Analyze This), or a priest (Sleepers), a cop (15 Minutes) , a family man and a protective father(A Bronx Tale), a boxer (Raging Bull), a thief (The Score), a lunatic (Taxi Driver, The Fan), a soldier (The Deer Hunter), a cold blooded murderer (Cape Fear), a terrible film thats a complete caricature of the original cartoon and still have an excellent career thus prooving you no longer need to proove your a good actor (Rocky and Bullwinkle), an officer(Men of Honour) or the devil (Angel Heart). Some actors have played all of those characters, but how many have done it with conviction. Get the point? DeNiro has played EVERY character and each and everytime without fail he ALWAYS delivers. Hes not like Tom Hanks who only knows how to play two types of characters (comedy or drama). My interpretation of an outstanding actor is not just about delivery, but also being able to convince an audience that your characters are believable and you can play them convincingly in a range of mannerisms that doesn't have a repetitive or recognisable style. To me Robert DeNiro is exactly that.
