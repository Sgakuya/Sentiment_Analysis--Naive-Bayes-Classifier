What I like a lot about the 'Alien' genre is the way that it looks at the ruthless humans who will do each other in for a mere profit. Science Fiction movies have such a wonderful way of reflecting our own society and how every human on this planet seeks out other humans as prey of somekind. The story is basically the same outline as the first Alien, except this time there are more than one of these xenomorphs on LV426. The characterization has been repeated, but this time there are more than one complainer besides Parker(played by Yaphet Koto in 'Alien) there are several with Hudson (Bill Paxton) leading the gripes with his What are we gonna do now man! What are we gonna do? Vasquez(Jeanette Goldstein) is perfect, she's the kind of woman that comes off with that cool tough-chick sensuality. Also, if the movie is watched carefully the viewer can see that Vasquez and Drake had a thing, much in comparison to the way that Hicks and Ripley wanted to, yet never get the chance. (If you haven't seen the movie 'Dark Star' see it. It is a comedy written by Dan O'bannon and directed by John Carpenter, it is the first draft of the 'Alien' tale. Most people think this movie is making fun of 'Alien', but it's not. 'Alien' came after.) Micheal Beihn always plays a good military soldier, especially one from the future, it seems to fit somehow. The part of this movie that really shocked everyone is the terrifying design that H.R. Giger's brilliant imagination came up with. Check out his website at www.HRGIGER.com, and if you haven't read the first three novelizations by Alan Dean Foster (a fantastic writer, read Spellsinger too) read them, you will learn more about the nature of these stories if you do. 'Aliens' is a different and educated way to look at the human spirit and how it is going in the wrong direction.
