this is pretty good. A man whose life has not gone so well finds out he is dying, after losing his job he decides he wants to take care of unfinished business. He gets his estranged teenage son and asks to have him for the summer. the dad tears down his shack of a house and wants to build a new one on the property. Along the way he tries to mend the broken relationship with his messed up teenage boy.and tries to resove some unfinished business that happened with his deceased dad and mom and a car accident that changed others lifes. This seems like a movie about healing each others past hurts. It has a sad and a nice ending with what ends up with the newly built house. Kevin Kline was good as the dying dad who tried to fix his own and others messed up lifes.
