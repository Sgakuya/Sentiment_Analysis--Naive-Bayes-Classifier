I just started this book a couple of days ago and I really like it. It is easy to read. The sentences are short but yet say so much. I have read some war books and really like the history aspect of war books. This is no exception. I got really into it right from the start and I can't wait to see how the story pans out. I will finish my thoughts when I finish the book but I had to let everyone know what a great author Kurt Vonnegut is....I am writing this about a week later....and I am almost finished but I wanted to update before I get to the end. I still find this book absolutly fascianting. It is not only a war story but has science fiction entangled in it. The main character is so deep in a fascinating way. It is hard for me to put it down when I have to get off the bus. The story goes back and forth in time but it ends up telling the whole story. It is in a different version of time. That is another theme of the book. Time. It makes you look at things differently. I will finish my comment when I finish the book which will hopefully be tonight....to be continued....
