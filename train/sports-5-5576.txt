You and KG are going to make a hell of a duo. What the hell are you doing mixed up with these college boys? And I see Nick Horvath is your new temmate. Something will have to give on that scenario. Reminds me of when Stack' and Laetner were teammates, and Stack slapped him. Maybe you should slap Horvath? UPDATE: You got that right, 'Dukesucks'. We would not have even come close without him. He made the all NCAA Tourney Team, all Final 4, etc. Made the biggest game saving block in Carolina history vs. Wisconsin in Elite 8. He dominated Illinois in the first half, thus being the sole reason for large lead at halftime. I think his lowest point total of the tourney was 16?, and he averaged about 17. In other words, damn right we would not have won it without him. But, we still beat Dook without him. HA HA! Oh, and NC State, and Maryland.
