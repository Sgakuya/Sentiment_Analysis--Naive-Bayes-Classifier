Too far away for me to visit. Blue sky. Open space for more than 100 Rhode Islands put together. 2/3 plains, 1/3 mountains. Bitterly cold in the winter. Desolate in the center and in the east, except for Billings and Livingston. Very sparsely populated. Missoula and Bozeman are the state's prominent university and college towns. Highly literate population and well-educated in proportion to its small number of people. I refuse to travel 120 miles one way just to get gas or buy a bag of Funyuns. Too many tourists in Glacier National Park in the summer. Montana was the last state to impose a speed limit on its major highways, from what I understand. I'd visit, but I wouldn't live there. It's an OK state.
