I first noticed Coach Jeff Fisher in the 1994 season with the old Houston Oilers after he took over for the fired Jack Pardee. I noticed his charisma and his communicative and attentive abilities right away. I knew the Oilers had found their best coach since the Bum Phillips days. Jeff has continued his excellence through a Super Bowl appearance as the Tennessee Titans in 1999 (Super Bowl 34 against the Rams, ONE YARD SHORT, WHAT A CRYING SHAME) to several other playoff appearances and coaching great players such as Steve McNair (a personal favorite), Eddie George, Frank Wycheck, Bruce Matthews and a good fleet of receivers to go with them. Coach Fisher did a great job keeping the team together through a change of cities - from Houston to Memphis to Nashville. All in all, he's still there as he should be. The Titans' front office needs to get him back the talent that is worthy of Jeff Fisher's coaching abilities, as soon as possible. Steve McNair can't do it all by himself. Head Coach Jeff Fisher is definitely somebody to root for on Any Given Sunday.
