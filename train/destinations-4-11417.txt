It took me a long time to understand the desert. I grew up in Northern California and then went to college in Arizona. It took a long while to get used to the desert. After a couple of years there, and spending a lot of time outdoors, I soon began to see the desert in a new light. One moment of realization came when I was hiking out in the Saguaro National Park. It was spring time and the catuses were blooming, there was a green color to the usually brownish red desert, the sun was setting so it was only like 95 degrees, and it was beautiful. I would much rather be in a forest or a beach than a desert but I did learn to find the beauty during my time in Arizona.
