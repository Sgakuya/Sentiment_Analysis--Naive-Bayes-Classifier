The Tattered Cover in Denver is the ultimate bookstore. Covering four floors, it has the best selection of any independent bookstore I've seen. The clerks are highly knowledgeable, and they are actually available all over the store to help shoppers (surprise!). The atmosphere is great at the Tattered Cover. On the main level, there's a coffee/dessert bar where you can read and relax, and there are couches and chairs all over the store. The customer service is outstanding, too. I've placed a number of special orders, and I've had items shipped, all with excellent results. The Tattered Cover has an impressive list of guest authors. I've seen Barbara Kingsolver, Bailey White, and Ann Rule there, and the events have been interesting and well-organized. Several years ago, the Tattered Cover added the Fourth Story, a really nice restaurant/bar. It's a great place to go for a meal or drinks. If you're visiting the Tattered Cover for the first time, allow yourself at least two or three hours. You could easily lose yourself for an entire day in this fantastic bookstore.
