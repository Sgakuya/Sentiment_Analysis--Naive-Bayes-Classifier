THIS IS AN UPDATE....EVERYONE PLEASE READ. The message posted from pissedatstaffers is also from me and the login sign up acted like it tid not take and it posted the message anyways........... anyways i owe moving staffers an apology my problem was a lack of communications and wrong sources that was mis leading other people. i have done a lot of work for moving staffers and found thru my researching that moving staffers is the company that got screwed by the contracting customers that we served they was giving moving staffers the run around and trying to NOT PAY moving staffers for our labor.. it took moving staffers longer than i expected to pay us for our services but they fought tooth and nail for us and i did not relize what they did to help us out i checked my deposits after i posted that hate pissed message and seen that movingstaffers collected and covered their debts with us. so all i have to say to everyone I OWE A BIG I AM SORRY i was pissed at them for no reason that there was a big mis communication with them on my end so dan cunningham thanks for what you done for us ! AND WILL RECOMMEND ANYONE TO YOU IN THE FUTURE!
