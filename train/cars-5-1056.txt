I just got a really good deal on a 2002 Maxima. I love this car, it has tons of power, it goes as fast as I will ever need to go. The ride on this thing is World class, I never owned a car that rode so smooth and handled so well, the car drives itself. It is the way all Sedans should be, it is a perfect 10 in my book. The lay out of the car, everything is weighed out nice from front to back, I give credit to the engineer's who came up with this car and for the money it can't be beat. The engine is real smooth, and it's a beast if that is possible. Ok I will shut up now, I am just very impressed with this thing.
