I lived for three and a half years in Teda, Tianjin, about two and a half hours by train by Beijing. I really enjoyed visiting the city for shopping and sightseeing. There is a great shopping area across the big street just south of Tiananment Square. Also check out the alley off the west side of the Wangfujing shopping street which is a bit to the east of the Forbidden City (also a must). The Pearl Market near the Temple of Heaven also has good bargains. Don't be afraid to take the subway. It is cheap and convenient. There are downloadable subway maps on the Internet. You buy your tickets from a cashier and then hand them to a ticket taker about ten steps from the cashier's cage. Also many of the Chinese-style hotels are just fine and a lot cheaper than the big name hotels that cater to tourists and rich Chinese.
