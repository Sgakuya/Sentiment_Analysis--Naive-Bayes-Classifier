If you are self motivated, organized and willing to do what it takes to succeed UPO is for you. I am halfway finished with my Master's degree course work. When people find out that I am taking classes at UPO, I receive critical responses. However, I they cannot ignore the vast improvements in my performance at work and at school. I have received two pay raises since I began a year ago. Not because I am taking the courses but because of the way my performance has improved since I began. Once you start your classes, you are not going to be treated like a baby. There is no handholding. You have to view this as an opportunity to succeed ---and you must take hold. If you do not, you will fail. I prefer UPO over traditional universities. However, I would appreciate it if the school had better online library resources. For example, like---- more recently released IT books. Aside from that the professors are ----for the most part--FIRST RATE. I have had 1 incompetent professor out of 8---- However, when I was in undergrad I had many more bad professors.
