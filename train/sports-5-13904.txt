It seems to me that there is no gray area in everyones arguments. So let's settle this once and for all. In terms of pure skill Barry was better than Emmitt. Yes he quit, but that is none of your business. It took Emmitt I think around 4 years after Barry retired to pass him in yards. Yes Emmitt had a better O-Line, a real quarterback and a great coach, but he was still a good running back. I see all these one star ratings on both Emmitt and Barry's sites, and that is just absurd. The one star should be given to the people giving those ratings. Anyone who doesn't have the respect for the game to realize the greatness of both of these men should go to the politics page, you would fit right in. Oh and by the way Jim Brown was the greatest running back of all time, HANDS DOWN!!!
