I did not hate this film. In fact I thought it was one of the few attempts lately at a truely original horror film. I have a few complaints however. Jeeprers Creepers was far too short, just skimming over crucial plot points and explinations that should have been there and could have made the movie far more enjoyable. I usually hate when people whine about films that don't explain why things occur or why people do certain things, but in a film such as this explination is very neccassary. Well made and shot. The acting was very little above par and had real promise of being a cool horror movie. It reminded me alot of Clive Barker short storie which explain very little but are still nifty in their own respect. However, Jeepers Creepers had no real backing for the actions going on. What was all that stuff that ws just mentioned about the 23rd spring of every 23rd year he feeds? Whatever. This film had hope. It just died along the way. Or is somewhere on the editing room floor.
