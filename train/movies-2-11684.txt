Miss Congeniality 2 was 1/2 as good as Miss Congeniality 1. Hence 2 Stars for MC 2. But Miss Congeniality 3 would only be 1/4 as good as Miss Congeniality 1, and not 1/3. Why? Like carbon-14, the law of Movie Half-Life is germane. Each iteration of sequel will only be half as good as the original and so on. Miss Congeniality 2 was just the most cliched and predictable movie around. Very little humor. The only redeeming factors: 1) Sandra Bullock is a treat (DIE!!! Jesse James!!! -- You've stolen my girl!!!) 2) For those people who think William Shatner is so much ham, you'll enjoy the fact that he is gagged for just about the entire movie.
