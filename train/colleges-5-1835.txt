I'm surprised to see some of the negative comments here. Yes, A to each his own. A&M is a leading research university, easily ranking within the top fifty American research institutions. As a state school, its teaching mission extends to the entire State of Texas and beyond--that is, A&M is interested in educating the populace, not just those with 1500+ on their SAT. Its undergraduate population is well known regionally for school spirit and pride. As a school with a technical background (A&M used to stand for Agricultural & Mechanical) its traditional strengths are in engineering and agriculture. However, A&M has enjoyed success in other fields since becoming a general research university. Regardless of your undergraduate field of study, at A&M you can go as far as your dedication, imagination, and raw talent will carry you. Graduate education is a bit more narrow, but it is a priority of the university to grow and distinguish the graduate programs. Finally, there is the Corps of Cadets, a storied military institution that takes 18 year olds and makes them into the leaders of tomorrow. In sum, Texas A&M is an incredible institution. With 45,000 students, it literally offers something for everyone. I immensely enjoyed my undergraduate education there and cannot think of any comparable institution. Whoop!
