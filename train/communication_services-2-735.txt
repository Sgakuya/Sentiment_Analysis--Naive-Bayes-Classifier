These jokers won't stay in business long if they continue with their bad decision making. I was a loyal customer for more than 4 years. I've dealt with dropped calls and annoying beeping that I still had messages when, in fact, I had heard and deleted them all. I never wasted my time, to collect credits on all this lost air time and added expense until Sprint calls me (last week) on my mobile to ask me how they were doing. I let them know, and I was pleased (so I thought) with the outcome. I helped them with their survey, they promised me my next bill would be 50% off. My bill arrived and just like your saying to yourself right now-there was no 50% off. In fact, I believed them so much, I didn't worry about going over in minutes-because--Hey! It's 50% off-right? Wrong. I went down their customer service road and was disappointed to say the least. I have switched providers and encourage everyone else who has experienced the same lies and deception to do the same. Consumers have power when they exercise where they spend their dollars...and where they don't.
