To say Sandy Koufax doesn't rank amongst the top 5 greatest pitchers of all-time is ludicrous (as Bob Costas STUPIDLY opined on Sportscentury). But despite the ignorance of a few so-called sports experts, can anyone even say (with a straight-face) he is not amongst the greats. If longevity is key to a person's greatness, maybe these experts have a point. But Koufax played for most of the first half of the 1960s. Furthermore, Koufax pitched three no-hitters and one perfect game. A strikout artist with a power delivery at the mound, Koufax was a terror for batters. And Koufax was a winner in World Series games. Unfortunately, Arthritis ended Koufax's reign of terror for batters. Yes, maybe he isn't the greatest. But it would be of total ignorance not to put Koufax amongst the top 5 greatest hurlers of all-time. He certainly deserves this.
