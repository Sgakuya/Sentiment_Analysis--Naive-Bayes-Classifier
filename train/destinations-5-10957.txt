Out of all the parks i've been to including Busch Gardens(ive been to the tampa one and williamsburg one),Six flags(magic Mountain),and universal studios(orlando),I'd pick Kings dominion out of them all.One they have shorter lines than these other parks.Who cares if they dont have the fastest coasters in the world like Cedar Point.I hate waiting 2 hours t go on a 2 min. ride. When i usually go to kings dominion,i'm not waiting in line for more than an hour for any ride.they have it all.From classic woodies like rebel yell to extreme steel coasters like flight of fear and the awesome hypersonic xlc and dont forget the breath-taking drop zone. This park is also the second cleanest park i've been to(busch gardens williamsburg).this park definately deserves a 5.
