Come on People! Calling the Beatles Fag Four????? OOoooh, that's low. If you hate them so much why are you rating them? That really gets on my last nerve. Revolver is probably my favorite. It's the album where George really shows his stuff. Taxman is the work of a genius. Some other great ones too, Love You To, I Want to Tell you. What is this world coming to when Beatles Fans are supposedly out of touch with reality? And the term, the Beatles suck? That is the stupidest, most ignorant term I've ever heard in my life. I too would like to see what the people who gave this album less than 5 stars like, and do you think that in 30 years when they don't even exist, that they'll have a hit album on the the number one spot in the charts for over 2 months. There's no way!!! The Beatles were legendary, there's nothing more to say. And people saying the Beatles sucked and calling them the fag four need their ears checked and BADLY have problems . I LOVE GEORGE!
