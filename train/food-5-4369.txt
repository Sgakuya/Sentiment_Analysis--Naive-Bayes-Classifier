They're greasy, way too salty, but I have to confess - I love them! I try not to eat them often due to the above reasons. But every now and then I give in and buy a bag. Actually, they're not only great right out of the bag; they also go extremely well in chili. To take that even a step further into the lethal food category, here's a quick little recipe that I picked up in Texas many years ago for something called Frito Pie . Start by covering the bottom of a bowl (size is up to you) with one layer of Fritos, add a layer of cheese (your choice, but sharp cheddar is very nice) then a layer of hot (as in heat) chili. Repeat, ending with a layer of cheese. Give it a couple of minutes to kind of meld together and then enjoy! I'm sure it is surpassed only by Pastrami as one of the most dangerous things to put in your mouth, but trust me, if you like those flavors this is really worth trying sometime.
