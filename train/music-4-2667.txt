When I first listened to this last summer, I would have told you it was the greatest thing I'd ever heard. Now I know how wrong I was. I'm sick of Whole Lotta Love, What Is and Never Should Be, is pretty good, Thank You is very shallow yet entertaining, Heartbreaker is good. When I buy an album, I find that the songs that don't grab me at first often turn out to be the best on the record. In this case, the only songs that I didn't really like were Lemon Song and Living Loving Maid. And as it turns out, the lemon song is just lousy and does that mean that Living Loving Maid is the only good song on here? (they usually play it as heartbreaker / living loving maid on the radio, so I guess it means that both are good, plus Moby Dick is a good track). This does have some good material, however, and I guess in some ways it's arguably better than some of the stuff I gave five stars. But you're probably better off with Physical Graffiti or Led Zeppelin IV
