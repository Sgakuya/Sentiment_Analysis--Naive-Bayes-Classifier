The gamecube offers the highest number of proprietary titles of any console. Many people point to its E rated games and push it off as a kid's console. Remember, though, just because children play a game does not mean the game is for kids only. Nintendo believes in games that have a broad appeal, not a single game for a single group of people. Take one of their exclusive franchises, Mario, for example. While children enjoy this game, so do many adults. Let us also remember that most sports games are E rated. Nintendo putting out kiddy games is a myth perpetrated by *ahem* Sony, and fanboys who want to make themselves feel better by downplaying another systems strengths. Buy a system for its games. Buy the Gamecube if you like the following titles: Mario, Zelda, Resident Evil, Donkey Kong, Eternal Darkness, Starfox. Otherwise you are pretty much better off getting a PS2.
