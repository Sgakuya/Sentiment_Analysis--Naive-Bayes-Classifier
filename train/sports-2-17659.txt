I thought after the end of last year that the Jets were going to win the AFC East this year and be a real contender. NOT! Pennington gets hurt and old Testaverde doesn't get it done (surprise) and they are now 2-6 at the halfway point. The Washington Redskins absolutely sodomized the Jets and stole their free agents during the off-season and instead of having one decent (Jets if they had kept those guys and Pennington not gotten hurt) team and a crappy one (Spurrier's loose Redskins), we have TWO bad teams with no chance of any post season aspirations. It's not even worth talking about next year, because the Jets need to improve in just about every area. Pennington is a good quarterback, but he needs lots and lots of help.
