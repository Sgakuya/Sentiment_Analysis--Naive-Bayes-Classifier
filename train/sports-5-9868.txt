I believe that my Pacers have the best record in the league, but they haven't been on ABC all year. Let's not talk about how different teams can't make it. Let's talk about how the fans that have bank rolled the NBA for two decades is being forgotten all because the sports media caters to the big city markets in order to raise their advertising revenue. Don't they know that they could have sold higher ad rates if they pick the best match ups? Not Dallas vs. Orlando....I guess its apparent when you realize who owns ABC...CAPITAL cities...now it makes sense. Thanks for nothing ABC...bring back NBC or CBS...at least they broadcasted a good rivalry every once in a while.
