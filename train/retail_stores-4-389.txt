Jcrew is a solid store. For the girls it has great sweaters. I have sweaters from years ago that are still in great shape. They have great suits and work dress clothes if you need to dress up for work. They have good casual wear with jeans and cotton basics like tee shirts, long sleeved shirts and tanks. For men, they have great jeans, cords, sweaters and dress shirts. They also have some great shoes. I am a big fan of their underwear and bras. They are just basic and comfortable. You can find some great things on sale too usually between seasons. If you are lucky enough to have an outlet store near you, those are also great spots for deals. The catalog offers a lot more than the actual stores but the stores make it easy providing catalogs and phones in the store if you want to make an order.
