I would really give this a 4.5. Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier were both good in their roles. Rod Steigers character is a sherriff in a small southern town. One of his policemen come across a man who has been murdered.{the dead man is also a V.I.P. in the town. on the same night a bigoted policeman arrests a black man he spots in the train terminal.played by Sidney Poitier, Virgil Tibbs turns out to be a detective on the east coast. Mr tibbs had done nothing wrong to be arrested, when he gets to the station he proves he is a police detective, he ends up having to help the town solve the murder case. Of Course Mr Tibbs is the one who has the know how to solve this crime.the bigoted sherriff has to accept Mr Tibbs help in solving this crime. this is an all around good movie that deals with racial prejudice, crime solving. Has great acting in it too.
