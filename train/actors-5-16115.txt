Maurice Benard is simply the most talented actor in Daytime television! I don't think there is any other actor in Daytime who is capable of portraying a character as complex as GH's Sonny Corinthos. Last year's Emmy win was long overdue for Maurice. He gives his best in every performance as Sonny, but Sonny is not the only role in which he excels. He is a wonderful husband to wife Paula and a wonderful father to his two daughters, Cailey and Cassidy. He also genuinely appreciates and loves his fans. Even more admirable than the above-mentioned things is his courage in going public about his personal struggle with bipolar disorder. Though told that going public would surely hurt his career, he gives his personal time to share his story in order to encourage others to be diagnosed and get treatment. Maurice Benard is a true role model in all aspects of life and I'm proud to proclaim myself one of his fans! To those of you who only gave Maurice one star, I can only say that you must watch the commercials and go to the bathroom while the GH scenes are on. That would explain why you have the rating backwards, too!
