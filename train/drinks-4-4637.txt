Secret factor 7X is not chocolate as sugested by EricTKO. I am highly allergic to Chocolate(cocoa) and Coke is one of the few soft drinks I can have. Neither is 7X the herbal-flavour mixture (containing orange, venilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, more than seven herabal oils and asprin). 7X comes in bags as a white crystaline powder. It has been admited it is an addictive drug (not cocaine taken out in 1938) and only a few people in each country know what it is. Italian sources have isolated a compound that when concentrated gives mice psychodellic brainwaves but its to small an amount to find what the compound was and to small an amount to do you harm. It has half the suger of Pepsi (which has Pepsin 211) and it tastes great. I don't like them having reduced the cafeine cont. of Coke. The original use to get rid of my headaches. Cafeine, Cabination, Acidity and Suger varies between countries depending on local taste. It is much more carbinated in Australia (who claim it's to flat) and less in Italy (who claim there is to much).
