WOW.... Kevin Spacey, I classify him as being one of the most brilliant (and I seldomly use that word) actors I have ever seen on the big screen. In his films, he keeps people so enthused and involved in the movie it's just fantastic, if anyone criticises this mans remarkable acting ability, then.. you have no idea about Drama. I admire him for his accomplishments, success and perfection in this competitive industry. His portrayal of different personas in a variety of films, encapsulates the audience and I definitely have to say The Usual Suspects was by far the best movie I have ever watched, I was so engrossed, that the ending literally made me quiver. 5/5 BABY!
