Hey y'all! I think AF makes the cutest clothes! Sure, maybe to some people i can see how theyd seem pricey, but not ONE thing ive bought from there has fallen apart. A comparison between the quality of an AE graphic tee and an AF tee shows that my AE shirts tend to fall apart faster. AF makes totally adorable clothes, and i dont think people should complain about customer service. The clothes and service are no worse than that of any department store. It's only because often the people who wear AF are part of a clique or whatever, people feel like they have to put AF down. More than half my clothes are from AF, and i love everything they have there, except their jeans arent well fitting for me! I love to shop there for everything else though!
