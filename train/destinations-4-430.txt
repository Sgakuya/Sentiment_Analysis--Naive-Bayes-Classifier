From what I hear, Nunavut is a province that was created in 1999 from part of the Northern Territories of Canada. It is actually a very pristine, though very highly unaccessable part of the country. It is primarily a reserve to allow Eskimos to continue their native lifestyles, which have been altered since whites attempted to civilize them. When they did this in the 1960's, the result was that the Eskimos lost their ancient livelihoods. The Eskimos became destitute and relied heavily on alcohol, a story all too familiar with Native Americans throughout the Americas. Fortunately, the Eskimos have been allowed to return to their native lifestyles and have even been given Nunavut as a province of their own.
