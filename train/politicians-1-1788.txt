He's stepping on toes and going against politics as usual. He wants to run the State as a business instead. Well, yeah, but more like stomping on toes at random. And his business was successfully sued for sexual harassment, and is now in bankruptcy. He vetoed his first budget, and the overwhelmingly Republican Legislature came within 3 votes (as I recall) of overturning his veto. He vowed not to back down, but after a decent interval signed a nearly identical budget. Sen. Dick Green (R) has denounced him in terms one just doesn't hear used between NH Republicans (e.g. anarchist, for starters), and is considering running against him in the primary just to get him out of there. He has a fair poll rating, but virtually anyone remotely involved in NH politics hates him. He just froze hiring on all non-emergency state positions and proceeded to give himself a waiver to hire a former news anchor as an image consultant for $60,000 a year. And as for his personal morals -- let's just say if he ran as a social conservative he'd have some pretty rough going right now.
