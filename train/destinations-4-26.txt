Nairobi is the hub of East Africa. If you have never been to Africa you would never imagine an African city like this. You can get anything in the world you want here. However, poor city planning and corruption have taken their toll on the city. On one hand it is modern with big buildings, fancy homes, and rich citizens, yet at the same time it is dirt poor with sprawling slums and street children begging for money. There are lots of things to do around town both during the day and at night, but you do have to be careful not to get into bad situations. As a Peace Corps volunteer I have been all over the city and never had a bad incident. Safety concerns are not a reason to avoid Nairobi, but you should be careful, do your research, and be aware of your surroundings while in town.
