Offensive, dumb, and hilarious. I was in stitches the whole time, especially during the opening scene where the terrorists (speaking in Arabic which is just like Derka derka derka! Muhammed jihad!) attack Paris with WMD's, to be stopped in their tracks by the bazooka-toting Team America. No one is above ridicule in this movie, and I liked how both ends of the political spectrum were attacked. It spoofed how right-wingers tend to go a little gung-ho in hunting terrorists, how left-wingers tend to blame America and side with whatever country America's fighting, and how we all think America's at the center of the world and every other country is just a one-dimensional caricature. It can get pretty silly at times (the puppet sex scene is more goofy than erotic), but that's the point. Just put your views behind you, and laugh your ass off.
