I'm giving her a 2 just because I've liked some of her movies(Pretty Woman, Steel Magnolias, Stepmom) But her last couple of movies I haven't been to fond of(Americas Sweethearts was one of the Summers dumbest movies). Plus she only won her Oscar because she IS Julia Roberts, not because her performance was the best of the year(her performance WAS good but not as good as Ellen Burstyn). And I'm sort of getting sick of the media calling her America's Sweetheart or Americas Pretty Woman Why do they have to be so freakin' corny? Oh yea and...its obvious Julia cares about her work more than her loved ones, I mean she didn't wanna marry Benjamin Bratt because she didn't wanna give up her career right now cuz shes on top of her game? She always said she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him, but now she cant because she gave him up for her career, like Marilyn Monroe said A career is wonderful, but you can't curl up with it on a cold night. Julia needs to think about that.
