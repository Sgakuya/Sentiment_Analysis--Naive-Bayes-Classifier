Oh Britney... You've done it again (pardon the pun). Only this time even worse. Britney never had much talent, but her songs always sounded cool. This album still sounds cool and everything, it's just completely empty and devoid of meaning. And plus, whereas her previous albums tried to hide their sexual nature, her latest just comes right out and practically screams SEX!!! I'm a Slave 4 U is just as bad as it sounds. She moans and groans and says provocative things in the background. And this was the first single they released off the album. This one song, however, isn't exactly a representation of the whole album, which is why I think they released it first: This song is completely and utterly different than anything she's done before (regardless of how bad it is), yet the rest of the album is typical, bland, bubble-gum Britney fair. I would recommend you buy this only if you are a total Britney nut, if you are looking for a good porno movie soundtrack, or if you like this type of music. P.S. Parents beware. You might not want your twelve year old boy or girl to have this one.
