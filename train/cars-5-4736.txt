i bought my 98 4cyl in Jan. of 99 and it is the best car/truck i've ever owned...i make a lot of deliveries in it and it has over 230,000 miles on it and still running...besides normal wear and tear like brakes and batteries the timing belt and clutch are the only things i've had to replace...the clutch went out when it had around 215,000 miles...the auto repair shop where i buy my tires are always surpise it's still running when i go there...i've heard that fords usually isn't known to get high miles and keeps breaking down but i've been very happy with mine...this is my first ford and i don't know if i just got luck with this one
