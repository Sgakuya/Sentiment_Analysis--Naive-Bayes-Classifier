Al Leiter is a great pitcher. The obvious reason he is top-notch is due to the fact he can last through as many innings as you want him to. Strikeouts occur often to the batters who face him. HIs ERA only once I know of has been over 4.00, in 1999 when it was 4.36 or something in that range which still is not bad, considering that the average ERA per team is about 4.60, so thats great. If there would be something at all negative to say about him, it would be that sometimes his control gets away from him a little bit. That is easily overlooked when he pitches in a winning ball game. He is the sole reason the Mets got to the World Series in 2000. Also, nothing against other players in the league, but I honestly think his personality is great, he always looks confident and never seems to be unhappy with himself. The Mets will go to the 2001 World Series if he pitches like he did in 2000.
