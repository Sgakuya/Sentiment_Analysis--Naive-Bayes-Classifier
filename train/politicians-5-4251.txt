Ralph Nader knows the issues that affect the American people directly. He's not trying to boast America's sense of a World Power. He's focusing on what people need. For example, more public transportation, which means, less traffic, less people using cars, less smog producing vehicles on the road, less time spent waiting in bumper to bumper traffic, sucking carbon dioxide poisoned air. He's all about reducing money on things like military weaponry (when we're not at war with anyone!) and investing in things like education, low-cost housing for the homeless. He's not kissing his wife in front of the camera to prove what a family guy he is. He's not putting people (mosty minorities, and even mentally handicapped offenders) on death row to prove what a man he is, and that he's serious about reducing crime. Nader is going to make some serious waves that this country needs. He wants people to take their power back by restoring the idea of democracy rather than this two-party, one head Gush/Bore campaign. www.votenader.com
