Remains the Emperor of candy bars, based entirely upon the patented combination of peanuts, slow-boiled caramel, and nougat (whipped corn syrup, soy, and ground almonds) surrounded by the medium-weight milk chocolate that M the six-packs are good, but only if you know the turnover rate and truck schedule; avoid the "fun size" bags, as many of them end up smashed by passing kiddie fingers); pinch the middle sides and note the "give" (if it moves, you've got a good one; too much exertion, toss it back). One of the best American products, sublimely marketed and, therefore, almost instantly identifiable (recent brown-wrappered variants, like the almond and peanut butter, can fool you if you're not mindful). Cookies and cake are all well and good, but none satisfy more completely than that first bite of a Snickers.
