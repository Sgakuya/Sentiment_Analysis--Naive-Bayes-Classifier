She earns my admiration for not hating the man who took her to the cleaners: husband, Marty Melcher. She trusted him, and lost millions! Not an isolated case among bigtime actresses. Her big band singing brightened many an otherwise dreary recording. She has at least two records in the GRAMMY HALL OF FAME! A popular contemporary said that Secret Love was one of the most perfect recordings, ever! In the fifties, BILLBOARD used to have a disc jockey poll, and Doris would consistently rank at the top. Miss Day never had a star's ego. But she did have to protect herself from male aggression regarding at least one other superstar. This took a lot of courage. Her persona is well showcased in her autobiography.
