I've been quite a few times to this city. It truly is an enchanting city. For first time visitors, the city's beauty will seem almost unreal. The downside to the city are its inhabitants, which are unfriendly at best and terribly rude and arrogant at worst. It's also no longer a cheap tourist destination. Prices have either escalated terribly, or else tourists are being ripped off. Considering Czech wages, its a wonder how Czechs still manage to make ends meet. Ah yes, and the local food .... it sucks big time. You'll be better off eating pizza or chinese than local cuisine. Otherwise, it's a worthwhile city to visit at least once.
