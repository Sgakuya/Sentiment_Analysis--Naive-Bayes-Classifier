Depends on where you go. some are bad, some are good, just like people. you cant blame a corporation for the kind of people that are in each store. you cant blame the store employees for what it is the corporation makes them do. I mean, think about it...who goes to college to get a job at a discount store? you arent likely to find a whole lot of people in one (kmart or walmart) that are going to care if you find what you were looking for. Kmart is trying, that i can say. they have come a long way & they have a ways to go. I personally dont see any differance between a K and W store. they are both full of teenage kids who dont care.
