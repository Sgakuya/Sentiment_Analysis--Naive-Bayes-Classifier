Helen Hunt is just one of those actresses who I can't help but love. She has such a unique presence on screen, and she puts a 100% effort into her roles, and she always delivers a first class performance no matter what she is doing: comedy, drama, or romance. She fully deserved the 1997 Oscar for Best Actress for her amazing performance in As Good As It Gets . She had such chemistry with Jack Nicholson, and there never was a dull moment. As Good as It Gets was probably one her best performances. She also had an equal chemistry with Mel Gibson in What Women Want . And what an emotional performance in Pay it Forward . Her character was so round and dynamic, and she played it perfectly. She was also good in Twister and Cast Away . Helen Hunt is one hell of a talented actress with so much depth and range, and hopefully her career will experience success and longevity.
