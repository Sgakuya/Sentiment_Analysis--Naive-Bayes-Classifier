Saddam isnt that bad. More Propaganda for the weak mind. Before we came along he was doing a great job with his country as a matter of fact he got an award from the UN for having a great schhol system...3 years in a row. He bombed a kurd uprising when they were TRYING TO KILL HIM. Oh man what a BAD GUY huh? You know protecting yourself from a bunch of basterds with guns that want to kill him? Not to mention people (who were never threatened to be killed by him like some dumb people think) actually voted for him and HELPED HIM OUT IN THE WAR!!! And its not like hitler or any toher bad guy who wouldnt let his people leave. They could leave anytime they wanted. And he has religious freedom. Name some more instances of Saddam killing besides the Kurds and his son in law and the other people trying to kill him when he came into power. People can leave anytime they want to hes not forcing people into staying.
