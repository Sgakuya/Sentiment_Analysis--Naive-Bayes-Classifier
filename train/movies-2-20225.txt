Stinker alert. A messy, confusing, muddled piece of crapola. I honestly didn't know what the hell was going and by the end, I felt like I was punk'd. Best I can tell, it was a movie about some goofy cult of occult, which for no apparent reason, is required to slit the throats of 7 children every 40 years. The movie resorts to high speed montages of disturbing scenes that would make an epileptic go into seizures. That endeared the movie with my wife (who fell asleep after 45 minutes and chewed my ass for even renting it). The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is that I did watch it to the end, it did have a 1 or 2 pretty scary scenes, and it was nice to see Anna Pacquin all growed up.
