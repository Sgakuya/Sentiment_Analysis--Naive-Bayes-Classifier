To enjoy Germany, you need to understand the Germans a little. Just like all Americans are not loud cowboys, all Germans are not beer chuggin-fat-dirndl-wearin nazis. Germans respect intelligence and a good argument. This is tough if you don t speak their language. Unlike France, trying to speak a little German will get you a long way and most young people speak a bit of English. Carry a phrase book and try and don t worry about the fact that Germans generally don t smile. Enjoy the train system and the rich cultural heritage and if you get bored, remember that Germany is in the middle of Europe and that every other European country is only hours away. Hop on a fast German train for another country. (That s what the Germans do)
