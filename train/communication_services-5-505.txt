I have had no other service but Alltel service and I do understand a lot of the complaints about the customer service departments...at least when you call in. Sometimes they are busy and sometimes not, but that is the nature of any customer service department. Overall, my service has been fantastic and I get coverage in most areas I travel! There are some areas where service hasn't been so great, but these are usually rural areas or places where I figure no cellular company would bother to put a cell site. Oh, and for Stewart Cee, no matter who you have service with, you will always be able to dial 911 or * 911 from a cellphone in an emergency. I am shocked that you were never advised of this by AT T.
