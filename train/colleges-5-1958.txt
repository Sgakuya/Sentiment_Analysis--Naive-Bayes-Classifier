Without a doubt, one of the most underrated universities in the country! As far as public universities go, just below Berkeley, Michigan, and Virginia, occupying a stratum with North Carolina, UCLA, UCSD, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illionis, Texas, etc. Attended back in the late 90's and absolutely loved it! Extremely well-regarded research university with excellent professors. The Department of Applied Mathematics (where I spent most of my time) is top-notch. Folks I graduated with are at places like MIT, Northwestern, NYU, etc. I, myself, work for one of the most prestigious institutions in the country. Someday, people will realize that CU is much more than a party school...
