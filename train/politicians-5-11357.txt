Don't you hate it when people judge you without ever knowing who you really are? My philosophy: If you're going to hate me, then hate me for who I am...not for who you think I am. What do you know of Mrs. Clinton, other than her ideology? Did you know she was a republican growing up in a republican middle class household? Did you know she was accepted into a top women's college, then became one of the first women to go to Yale Law School? Did you know early in her career she was considered one of the top young lawyers in the country, woman no less, and that they said she gave up a career of so much promise because of her love for her husband, and so she became the politician's wife? Do you know what she's done for children all her life? Maybe you should, and you might just find an individual who's done some good in the world. She might seem icy and she might seem combative, but how could you not be when you have so many people hating you just because of your last name, or what they saw on tv, or what they heard on the radio? I believe all people are good natured, but most are also ignorant. I know where my faults lie and where I'm biased, but atleast I know and I can admit it. Some of you just have to ask yourselves...what have I done with my life? Have you been perfect all your life, without hurting another soul or causing someone to hate you? I doubt it, so maybe we don't have room to judge others like we don't deserve judging ourselves. PS>>>>>She was asked by NY dems to run for the NY seat when the state Democratic party couldn't find a good candidate....like the Republicans in Illinois asked Alan Keyes to come in from Maryland last year because of their lack of a candidate for senate.
