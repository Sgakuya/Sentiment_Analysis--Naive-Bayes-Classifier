It's hard to say exactly why this book hit me so hard. Real life tragedies occur all over the world every day - some reach the news and some don't. So what makes the story of Chris McCandless so devastating? Is it that he was so idealistic? Was it that he would have survived if not for a couple of bad breaks? Or is it that Chris died acting out an urge that all of us have had in some way or another? Whatever it is, Author Jon Krakauer does a heart-wrenchingly precise job of piecing together Chris' psyche, and demonstrating what an impact that the boy had on the people that he met during his travels. This book floored me, and the image of Chris' last days in Bus 142 is going to stay with me for a long time. I feel for his friends and family, and admire him very much.
