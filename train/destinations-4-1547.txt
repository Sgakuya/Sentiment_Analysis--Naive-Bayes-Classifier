Japan would be a cool country to visit. The culture sounds very interesting to learn more about and the history is very long and interesting. The Japanese, at least from those I know, are very nice people. They are very ambitious and you can tell by the way their country is organized. The Japanese do play by the rules of free and fair trade. They have taken advantage of the weak American auto market, but if a foreign company has a product they could sell, then by all means it should be sold wherever there is a market for it. The good part about Japanese technology is that they have forced American car and technology companies to up their standards. In the 1970's, before American car companies had any significant Japanese competition, American cars were inefficient boats that polluted the air with toxins. I am for American industry, but free and fair competition is the way to keep high standards in various domestic industries.
