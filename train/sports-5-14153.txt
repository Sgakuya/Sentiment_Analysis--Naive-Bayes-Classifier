WHEW, I'M AFRAID THAT YOU REALLY CANNOT APPRECIATE THE GREATNESS OF THIS GUY UNLESS YOU SEE HIM IN ACTION. I RECOMMEND GOING INTO NFL.COM, CLICK ON NFL FILMS, SEARCH FOR HIM IN THE SEARCH MENU AND WATCH IN AWE. 104 YARDS PER GAME, 5.2 YARDS PER CARRY,MORE THAN ONE TOUCHDOWN A GAME,AND THE MOST IMPRESSIVE STAT.. O GAMES MISSED IN NINE YEARS. WHAT REALLY SEPARATES HIM FROM OTHER ALL TIME GREATS THOUGH IS HIS MENTAL POWER, SURE HE WAS A PHYSICAL POWERHOUSE (THE MOST POWERFUL PLAYER EVER IN HIS POSITION) AND HAS SPRINTER SPEED AND UNCANNY BALANCE, BUT IT WAS HIS PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH TOWARDS THE GAME THAT REALLY IMPRESSED ME. ALWAYS GETS UP FAST EVERY TIME HE WAS HIT, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE WS HIT (AND IN THOSE DAYS, DEFENSES WERE GEARED IN STOPPING THE RUN, AND EVERY DEFENSE WAS GEARED TO STOP JIM). NEVER WENT OUT OF BOUNDS ON PURPOSE AND ALWAYS INTIMIDATED AND IMPRESSED EVEN THE GREATEST DEFENDERS. SURE, OTHER BACKS HAVE ALREADY SURPASSED MOST OF HIS RECORDS, BUT BROWN PLAYED 4 SEASONS WITH ONLY 12 GAMES EACH, ANOTHER 5 SEASONS WITH 14 GAMES EACH AS OPPOSED TO THE 17-GAME SEASON THAT THEY HAD AFTER HE LEFT. AND THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS HIM UP....
