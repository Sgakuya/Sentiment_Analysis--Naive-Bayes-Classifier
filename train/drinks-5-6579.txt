There used to be huge billboards on the side of the road when I was younger: Moxie Makes Mainers Mighty. Born and raised in New England, I never realized what a distinct and wonderful taste Moxie was until I left for the Army and missed Moxie, Sam Adams, italian sandwiches from Amatos and coffee from the Old Port. Moxie isn't for everyone- and if you're from Massachusetts or anywhere farther south, please let me recommend arsenic, Drano, or gasoline as possible alternatives- but if you're from Maine, New Hampshire or Vermont, Moxie is the only soda that anyone who considers themself to be a true New Englander should drink.
