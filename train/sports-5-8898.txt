Peja has come into his own as an NBA player. Injuries caused him not to be in top form for the playoffs, and that was a large factor in his now-infamous airball in game 7 of West finals. But he was a major factor in Sacramento's run to the best record in the NBA. An excellent shooter with range, Stojakovic boasts one of the quickest releases in the league. A master at shooting of the dribble or using screens to get his shot, he is fairly athletic and won't mind putting it on the floor, especially if he can get separation and shoot a pull-up. He is a servicable rebounder as well, in particular at the offensive end. He has worked on defense and made himself a fair stopper. The only question with him is his health, and if that airball will mess with his head.
