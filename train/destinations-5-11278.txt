I have just returned from EuroDisney where I had the time of my life, yes it rained yes there were queues but the atmosphere, rides and attractions made it all worth it! the longest I waited was 45 minutes and that was for the Aerosmith ride, which by the way is very fast!!! I would definitely reccomend however, staying in a hotel away from the park as they appear to be over priced. We stayed in Moulin de Paris and is only cost us 124 euros for 3 nights including continental breakfast, this hotel is 2.5 km from the park and is two bus stops from Disney. The Studio Park although smaller than disney is just as good, perhaps slightly more adult orientated. I did spend a lot on souveneirs but that was my choice! Go, i wasn't disappointed. katie!
