I'm 41 years old, and used Copenhagen fine cut for several years in my teens. In 1998, I decided to quit smoking and take up dipping again after nearly 20 years of abstinence. I tried the Copenhagen Long Cut, and loved it. When Copenhagen Black was introduced I decided to try it, and instantly became a fan. The only problem with Copenhagen is it's price. At nearly $5.00/tin, I tried Timberwolf and Grizzly straight. I found both to have a pleasant flavor (though not the kick that Copenhagen has). Recently, an online retailer had Kayak long cut straight on sale for $1.75 for a 5 tin roll, so I gave it a shot. I have to be honest, I am completely satisfied with Kayak. Long lasting hearty flavor, and a decent kick. I just ordered 45 cans for $15.75 (unbelievable). As long as I can continue to get Kayak at this price, I'll be dipping it!!!
