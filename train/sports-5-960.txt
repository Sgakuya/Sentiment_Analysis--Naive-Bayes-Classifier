Mussina was always an excellent pitcher with the Orioles. It really is a shame that The Moose didn't receive the credit that he deserved in the 2001 season with the Yankees. He had a better ERA than Clemens, but less win because he had a dearth of run support. He was the second most consistent pitcher behind Clemens this year and one of my personal favorites in a long time. Mussina pitched opening day at the Stadium for the Yankees against the Royals. He gave the Yankees the 1-0 win in I believe 7 or 8 innings and the only run scored was a Paul O'Neill first inning home run. One of the most exciting games of the year was when he was pitching in a scoreless game against Boston in Fenway in late August. The Yankees had finally struck in the 8th to take a 1-0 lead. He retired the first 26 batters of the game and got an 0-2 count to the final batter in his way of a perfect game. Carl Everett fisted it off for a bloop hit and he lost the perfect game. But the amazing thing was that he kept it going for so long in a scoreless game and ended up pitching a complete game shutout. An awesome pitcher that I'm also glad to have on my favorite team.
