Diana was just brought in by the royal family to procreate with the enormously horse-faced and inbreed Charles. She did her duty and then was disposed of. There is historical precedent for this kind of thing of course. It was said that Catherine, The Great, was brought into the Russian royal family for the same reasons, but she was wise enough to realize it, and, according to some historians, killed her husband and took the throne from him. I wonder if in today's world Diana could have gotten away with such a thing? Pretty farfetched, wouldn't you say? Back to the topic, Prince Charles is getting married on Saturday to his lifelong love to the consternation of many Britishers. Everything is working against the wedding from even taking place: the Pope's death which postponed it to this Saturday, security breaches like that guy who drove to the castle with a box with the BOMB on it, along with everthing else! What next? We'll have to wait and see. And, as for those souvenirs with the loving couple's faces on them: YEECH! NO THANKS!:P
