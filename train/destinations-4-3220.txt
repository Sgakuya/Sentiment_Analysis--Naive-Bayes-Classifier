 I have been to San Diego and I think it is an overall nice city but do stay in the tourist areas and don't wander too far south or too far east in the downtown area. There are a lot of slums and high crime in certain areas of the city. There are a lot of homeless people and unsavory charactors downtown. Also don't stay in ANY hotel unless it has a well known name. SD has a lot of SRO hotels that are home to drug addicts and crazy people. What I like most about San Diego is that in the summer it does not get 95- 100 degrees with 1000% humidity like it does where I live, there is plenty of sunshine year round, lots of friendly people, lots of things to see and do. However do not live here unless you are RICH. 400 k and 500 K buys very little house there and the rents on apartments keep going up and up.
