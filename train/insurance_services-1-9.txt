I called to get a quote from Geico and the quote was fabulous. So, I instantly bought this insurance and decided to let my current policy lapse. Well a few days letter I received a letter in the mail advising Geico could not insure me. Unfortunately by this time, I had let my insurance policy lapse and had to scramble and pay extra fees to get it restarted. At the time of the policy I has asked Geico if this would be my quote and if they had ran all of the necessary paperwork, well apparently they don't run any of the necessary documents at time of purchase. (Example: credit report, dmv record, and another type of underwriting Geico does). So needless to say, my policy changed and I was no longer insurable. In the meantime, they took my money and wouldn't issue a refund for over 3 weeks, even after they cancelled my policy. My experience was horrible and thankfully my current insurance company worked with me so that I didn't lose my insurance all together. If you are looking for a better quote, visit SouthCoast, as they do all of the underwriting when you sign the policy and at that point it cannot be changed.
