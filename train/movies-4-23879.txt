For a piece of crap movie I enjoyed the hell out of it. i don't know if it is because I am an enourmous fan of the games or that the cinematography and sets were very lush and true to the games themselves... but Resident Evil rocked my socks off. Sure it was rather obvious and the scare jump tactics were those old used up hand on the shoulder and it turns out to be your buddy type scares, but hell, I didn't mind. My biggest complaint was the lack of gore! COME ON!!! This is a movie based on one of the goriest video/horror games ever created! The least they could have done is shown a member of the Umbrella task force getting torn to pieces by Zombies, ALA DAWN of the DEAD style. All you see is a guy that looks like he got his knees broken in a mosh pit. Overall, Resident Evil is a full filling fun, mindless time at the movies. The atmosphere of the movie is great and it feels like you are inside a video game. Let's just say it kicks Tomb Raider square in the ass. not highly, but still RECOMMENDED!!!
