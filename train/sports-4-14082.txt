Montana is considered by most fans as the best ever simply cause his of 4 rings. That is all they look at. Sure this guy was great and deserves all the credit he gets but come on, look at the supporting cast he had. He probably played with the best supporting cast ever. People can make a case for the Cowboys of the early 90's but the late 49er's team was simply loaded everywhere you looked. Yes you can't take away from his clutch performances in the Super Bowl but do you really think if you stuck Dan Marino in Montana's place, he wouldn't have excelled also and just win ring after ring? Sure one of the greatest, but i think people judge way too much on rings and ignore all the circumstances.
