Personally, I think the MBA tag is just an added feature in a resume. Nasa tao pa rin yan . There are people who are extra smart to earn huge fortune without an MBA. So, whether AIM ka pa or UP or LA SALLE or the underrated ATENEO MBA, IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE PERSON. To cite a few graduates of the ATENEO MBA : Ex-Pres. Fidel V. Ramos, Ex-Cabinet Secretary Raffy Alunan, Ms. Nieves Confesor of the AIM Dean's Office, Ms. Conchita Manabat of Deloitt, Ben Tiu-Chair of I-Bank, Wellington Ty of the Ayala Group, Willie Uy of Phinma Group, Jake Fleta - President of Jardin de Paradiso, Alex Villamar-President of PhilWeb Corporation, Gerry Valenciano - AVP of ICCP Ventures, etc. So, NASA TAO PA RIN ANG SUCCESS MO MGA PARE KO! AIM is a talk school, UP is good in planning, La Salle is the orig MBA Case method school and Ateneo is for the working class.
