I've owned American made cars and have regreted every one of them. They fall apart at every turn. Then I bought a Nissan - and still talk about what a good car that was. After living in Europe for 3 1/2 years, I returned needing a wagon and bought a Jetta 1.8T. Love at drive with the German engineering. Test drove Audi, Lexus, Volvo for this car purchase and for incredible engineering, styling, and re-sale - my 325i with the sport and winter package is top of the heap. If you're concerned with gas mileage - this is not the car for you. If you can afford it, this is where you'll want to end up. Wow! By the way, our other car is an '06 530i. It's an entirely different car.
