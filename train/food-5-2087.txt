I delight in the simplicity of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. The purity of form and flavor fills my heart and my tummy with an undeniable feeling of immeasurable bliss! From the moment I eye the bright orange wrapper from across the market I can imagine the slow melting of the chocolate in my mouth. Slowly as the chocolate slips away to uncover the essence of the sublime confection, the peanut butter center, I am taken back to childhood, to Halloweens, to Reese's Peanut Butter Easter Eggs, to Christmas past. The hint of grit, the sharpness of the edges of the ridges around the top. Ahhh, and there are two,sublime.
