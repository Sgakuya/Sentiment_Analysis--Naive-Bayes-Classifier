Lopez has done an excellent job in lifting up the Spanish economy in the past few years. I believe that the United States must go beyond the traditional Franco-German Axis in Europe and begin to communicate with the new emerging powers in Southern and Eastern Europe. The future of the continent lies in these regions and there is an enormous potential for growth. These nations also are willing to go along with American interests like missile defense and the such. They realize that missile defense will benefit the European continent and protect them from accidential missile firings and rogue nation's missiles coming at them. Lopez's dynamic leadership in Spain is refreshing considering the humdrum liberal leadership in France in Jospin and Schroder in Germany. Lopez's Spain is growing way faster than either France or Germany, that is why we should look towards Spain for new investment options.
