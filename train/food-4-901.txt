Growing up, this cereal was called Sugar Smacks. (It cracks me up the way the names of things change with the times, like how Kentucky Fried Chicken is now KFC.) Back to the topic... Smacks is a pretty tasty cereal. It has a very strong honey flavor and a nice, light texture. It's probably better to view Smacks as a snack or a dessert because it is extremely sweet and it doesn't have any staying power whatsoever. If the weather is at all humid, don't be surprised if the cereal forms a giant block in the cereal box. Not to worry- simply squeeze the package a time or two and you'll be in business. Just be sure to brush your teeth afterwards.
