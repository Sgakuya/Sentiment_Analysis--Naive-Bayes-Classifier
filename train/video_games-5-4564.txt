I got this game free when I resubscribed to PCZone and it is probably the most addictive game I have ever played. An odd scenario where you run a dungeon - training creatures from hell and using wizards, trolls, imps, dragons, spiders, vampires, hell hounds and numerous other weird and wonderful things to build an army strong enough to take on the Lord of the Land. The ambience immerses you in a land of power but as a strategy game you have to balance this power with brains. I say this is the most addictive game I have ever played because there is so much going on and each scenario is different everytime you play - strange things happen at different times of year, like if there is a full moon you get to play a bonus level. This game just has to be played to be believed simply because it is very hard to describe but needless to say both my wife and I have spent endless nights trying to reinforce our dungeon walls, lay gas traps, build rooms, pay wages and launching sneaky attacks on unsuspecting heroes.
