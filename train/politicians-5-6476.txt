Gotta give props to a strong woman who is intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind. I respect her beliefs and attitudes tremendously and she keeps the Re-smug-licans (and some Democrats) on their toes by holding them accountable for their actions and beliefs. It kills me whenever I hear white people claim, There is no racism in America. Blacks whine and complain too much. Gee, I wonder why? Could it be because they and other people of color have the deck(s) stacked against them from the second they are born? No, how silly of me to claim such a thing! Maybe the reason whites are tired of hearing it is because it's true! Their collective conscience is being pricked, and perhaps they may have done something in the past that was racist,or maybe they have learned how to be racist from family and friends, or maybe they had a negative experience with people of color and now they paint all people of color as the same! And these whites don't like to be reminded because it's too uncomfortable for them. Maxine Waters is a terrific woman, and as a white man who admires strong females and people of color and is wholly empathetic and understanding of them and the struggles they lead (I have an adopted sister of color), I say ROCK ON MAXINE WATERS!
