God, I love these hamburgers. Unfortunately, you can't get them here on the West Coast (except the frozen ones in the grocery - NOT THE SAME). I can't say they satisfy any nutritional needs; yes, they're greasy all right; and the fries and other stuff are nothing to write home about; but I grew up on these hamburgers and I do not miss a chance to visit White Castle when I'm in a White Castle town. Fresh off the grill - and you really need the onions to make it taste right - fast food heaven. And you do need three or four to make it a meal (more if you've got extreme munchies). And they're open 24 hours - a big plus if you get that craving after a long evening. It's a distinctive taste, maybe an acquired taste, but I acquired it a long time ago and I GOT A BIG OL' JONES FOR WHITE CASTLES.
