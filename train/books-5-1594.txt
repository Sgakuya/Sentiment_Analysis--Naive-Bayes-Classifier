Breathed's BLOOM COUNTY went where Trudeau's DOONESBURY couldn't, which was anywhere it wanted to. Freewheeling (with a sly leftist slant) and, at times, fanciful, the strip started out as a chronicle of Milo and his grandparent's boarding house, but it quickly took off into something far broader (yet easier to identify with as time went on). Anything was fair game in Berke's mind, and he explored every nook and niche the times had to offer. His line style was a direct homage to Trudeau's, but it eventually got cleaner and more detailed as the storylines demanded greater depth. A landmark in comic strip history, as the form went directly into the toilet after it ceased daily publication. Binkley, Steve, Opus, Bobbi, Cutter John, Bill, Portnoy, Rosebud, Oliver, and all the rest.....you are sadly missed.
