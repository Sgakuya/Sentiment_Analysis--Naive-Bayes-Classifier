I rank this as the best mid size SUV. The 4Runner is a legendary name in off roading, and I'm sure this one won't disappoint in that regard. Both V6 and V8 engines produce lots of power, and the V8 delivers more torque with minimal gas mileage penalties. The interior of the new 4Runner is great, much roomier than past 4Runners. The Limited is almost Lexus like with it's fancy leather interior, navigation system, etc. The other models feel the same, except with cloth seats. My personal favorite is the Sport Edition model, with it's hood scoop and alloy wheels, it looks very slick. But they all look great. If you want a real class act of an SUV, the 4Runner is hard to beat!
