The original release of Sonic Adventure was in 1999, as a pilot title for Sega's great Dreamcast console. This 2003 release saw many improvements over the already-great original. The original Sonic Adventure brought a new innovation to the Sonic universe and allowed you to play through intertwining, elaborate storylines of six characters. This story was moved on through brilliantly-directed cutscenes with some of the greatest voice acting ever to grace a video game. The graphics are blazing--continuing the blast processing legacy of the original Sonic titles that blessed the Sega Genesis console. They are also vibrant and smooth--and home to elaborate stages with multiple paths. Along with the excellent voice acting, the music is excellent--especially the Twinkle Park stage music and Eggman's theme. The sound effects are also lifted from the classic Sonic games. Controls are great and manipulate your character flawlessly. The GameCube release sees a new mission mode, which is a great add-on that uses the stages to further extent. Finally, there's also Ten Classic Sega Game Gear releases on this version from the Sonic series. Many of these games are great and proudly follow the Sonic tradition.
