Wow! i can't believe some of the ignorance here! how can you say that Frank Beamer is overrated and not a great coach. Those saying that he's not good because of his first 5-8 years coaching need to realize something... before FB showed up Virginia Tech royally sucked! they were lucky to finish a season with two wins. I really dont think that a new coach coming in after that is gonna go undefeated in his first year. No one wanted to play for Tech 10 years ago. Recruiting was terrible and one coach isnt going to automatically change that. For him to have built this school into the major threat it is today is a HUGE achievement for Frank. Another thing... just because some of his players (Marcus Vick cough cough) have made mistakes in the past year does not affect his coaching ability by any means. To add... the Team United bracelets he inniciated this year were wonderful. He really made is bunch of kids into a team when they were beginning to fall apart. Thats what makes him a great coach, and an all around great man!
