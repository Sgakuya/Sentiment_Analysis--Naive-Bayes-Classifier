I've been a loyal cusotmer of Banana Republic up until I had to cancel my Ban. Rep. credit card. The company had me send my payments to the wrong address and blamed me for two payments (60 days late) when I thought the account had been paid. When I spoke to customer service I wasn't helped and the company reported it ti the credit agencies. I've been trying to clear for months now, but all i get is these generic computer automated letters that state they have reported accurate info. This is a sign of the Banana Republic's deteriorating customer service and quality. I will never buy and much less apply for their credit card co. which is run by Monogram Credit Card Bank of Georgia.
