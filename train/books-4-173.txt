Luck Man is a great book. The only reason I bought it in the first place was through my admiration for Michael J. Fox's acting - my favourite film is Back to the Future and I love The Secret of My Success and The Hard Way. Obviously I knew of his Parkinson's Disease but this book opened my eyes to it even more. As I live in Scotland, the press coverage was not as intense as in America surrounding the mysteries of his illness and therefore I was quite ignorant of the facts for some time. In this book Fox is very open and honest about his life, career, family and problems. So honest, in fact, that he almost came across as quite arrogant about the details of his success in television and film, but this is countered by stories of times of failure and rejection in the industry. The result is a heart-warming, saddening, yet funny and remarkable account of a talented young actor's life.
