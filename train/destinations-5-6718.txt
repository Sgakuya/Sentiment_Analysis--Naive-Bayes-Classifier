Amazing how people still rant about Mormons. Suppose someone commented about Jews in New York. That would be considered insensitive and mean spirited. Because Mormons are mostly white Europeans, they are considered fair game. Say what you will, I lived is SLC for 15 years (Im Catholic) and have never lived in a more beautiful, vibrant and serine setting. I guess to have culture, first you must be diverse (code word for anything non-white), have crime ridden pockets of filth, support sodomy, be anti-Christian and hate America. Its amazing to see how open minded tolerant people view others who dont subscribe to their lifestyles. Bottom line If you are a family person, looking for a good place to rear your children, this is the place! And thank you lion, you make the point for me. You're a clear example of what tolerance means in liberal-speak. You only have tolerance for those whose opinions are in lock-step with yours. What an ass.
