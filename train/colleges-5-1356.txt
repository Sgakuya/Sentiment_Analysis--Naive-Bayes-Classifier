I see no reason what so ever to disagree with anything Claude has said about this very highly regarded university. Personally I have not had the good fortune of attending or even visiting the campus. But, you don t have to be a Johns Hopkins alumnus, professor, staff or student (or even have half a brain for that matter) to know this is a world-class university with a reputation that precedes itself. So, what's your big beef Noriega ? You say you turned down Harvard to for Cornell with no regrets - yet you only seem capable of using some less than brilliant one liners to put down some other very excellent universities. That doesn t seem to be saying much for Cornell. It might appear to some readers that you aren't getting much from your own college experience. Here s a little tip everything is NOT a sporting event. It s okay to see the good in something other than your own school. Or maybe I misunderstood and you re just angry that the janitorial pay is lower than average there?
