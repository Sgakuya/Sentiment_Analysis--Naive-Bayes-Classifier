Larry Bird was the best basketball player during the best era of basketball. He was the game's greatest clutch player, position-rebounder, intuitive passer, and spur-of-the-moment inventor. Number 33 made countless shots from absurd angles often while off balance and with either hand. While not being blessed with superior athletic skills, Bird's work-ethic and will to win made him and, by extension, his teammates far better players than nature had ever intended that they become. His rivalry with Magic Johnson featured two sides of a coin with Bird's side reflecting a blue collar work-ethic that featured substance over style. Both he and Magic were highly successful and, with each feeding off of and countering the other's energy, the league soared to heights never before reached nor later exceeded. His jaw dropping performances and miraculous play are the stuff of legend. Larry Legend. The best who ever played the game.
