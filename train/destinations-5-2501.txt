. . . well, this isn't a beach for swimming. Not that you CAN'T swim; the water's great. But what you go here for is the shark teeth. I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bona-fide 'Discovery-Channel' kind of nerd. And, being a three-hour drive to the beach that has one of the biggest fossilized shark tooth deposits in the world, I wanted to check it out. It's kind of a bummer that the rest of the beaches along this little stretch of the shore, in an effort to restore the beaches' eroding sands, buried the fossil-rich original sands under fresh, new sand. But Caspersen Beach was left largely untouched, and shark teeth hunters can scoop up the sands in search of tiny little black teeth of ancient sharks. With ample parking, bathroom facilities and a shower, it's a fairly comfortable beach. And incredibly clean, too: out of the several hours I've spent there, the only bits of trash I found were two cigarette butts and two trading cards. It's the first beach that I've actually felt comfortable taking my shoes off at and running around (I haven't been to many, but the ones that I HAVE been to, well, *yuck*.) Most people out there had sifters to dig into the sand; one man had a scuba mask on, crawling along in the shallow water; but, you'll be just as sucessful in finding teeth by just scooping it up in your hands. It's not just shark teeth; there's a WEALTH of shells of all sorts. And, if looking at little curiousities isn't your thing, you can sunbathe, go fishing, or take a swim in the Gulf waters (getting a tan and swimming in clear-blue waters in mid-October is something I'll gladly get used to!). I made it out with a plastic bagful of shells and 40 shark teeth and fragments (most were actually pretty nice, albeit small, specimens). And a pretty decent tan.
