Absolutely one of the most beautiful places that I have ever visited. We drove from Colorado Springs to Denver (which was nice), to Boulder (which I fell in love with), to Estes Park (where we stayed for the night and shopped for the rest of the day). Estes Park was very quaint. We went out to eat dinner and when we came back to the hotel room there were elk right up on the lawn in front of our rooms that had come down from the mountain (not something you see everyday). The Rocky Mountain National Park was stunning. On the other side of the park, at Grand Lakes, we stopped at the historic Grand Lakes Lodge, which reminded me of summer camp. It was a pretty neat place...apparently very hard to get reservations for. Drove back to Colorado Springs thru a bunch of little towns, which included Winter Park and Idaho Springs. It was quite a lovely trip. The best part of the trip was a stay at the Gold Lake Lodge near Ward. Definately worth the money. Absolutely breathtaking scenary. The lake and the surroundings were just stunning. The food was fabulous. I highly recommend it. I am seriously considering moving to Colorado Springs within the next year. The weather was just wonderful (I think it might take a little getting used to the altitude!).
