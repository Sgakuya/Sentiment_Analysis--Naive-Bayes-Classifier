Let's look at the facts: Joe Montana never put up numbers anywhere near Favre. But he has more rings because of the unbeatable system and HOF roster. John Elway had a higher INT per game average and a lower TD per game average. He had less yards and less wins. He won in his final two years, but hmmm, does anyone remember that guy named Terrell Davis? What, a 2000 yard season the same year they won the SuperBowl? Must be a coincidence. Oh, let's not forget Unitas. Actually, maybe we shall, considering he had almost as many INTs as TDs and only threw 3000 yards three times. Favre has done that.. hmm, I believe its 15 times now? And he's topped 4000 four times? Marino? Yeah, he was good, but you would be contradicting yourself by saying that Montana ranks above Favre, but so does Marino. Um, he didn't win a single SB, I believe. And, hmm... I'm not sure, but I think he had some awesome offenses in his 18 or how ever many year tenure.
