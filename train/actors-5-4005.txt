What can I say that hasn't already been said about an actor of such magnitude as Mr.Fiennes.. Like many others, I too 'discovered' him.. for the first time in The English Patient.. the story itself was relevant to me (him playing a Hungarian count), but I could not get him out of my mind for a year after I first seen him act! I'm not one to stalk actors, so my next encounter was shere coincidence (Sunshine). By the end of the movie I was burning to get to know this man's background.. But even then I wasn't so intent, until the day I missed his performance in NY (!) (long story). But what is it about him that leaves such deep impressions in some, yet completely escapes others? When I see my friends lacking in response to Fiennes, it scares me! The eyes alone speak volumes. Do they not see the depth of expression, does it not move them like no other limp Hollywood actor can? I'm tempted to say, the world is now divided between those who acknowledge Fiennes and those who don't.. But I regress.. I guess the best thing about the deal was discovering him as opposed to having him shoved in our faces by Hollywood. As well, and very importantly, he is getting a wider audience worldwide. I've seen an excellent site in German. I've never met Ralph, and I don't think I want to, I have too much respect for his person.. Let him be, let him act. Hollywood is for pseudo-talented money grabbers. it could never do justice to him anyway.
