I'd like to clear up some things that you kids with no clue have written. 1. Wilt's teams DID win, they won all the time ! The Celtics had a dynasty with multiple hall of fame players so they won the most titles, that is a separate issue. His team's yearly ranking by W-L record: 2/8 Warriors 3/8 Warriors 3/8 Warriors 7/9 Warriors 3/9 Warriors 9/9, 5/9 (trade midseason) 1/9 76ers 1/9 76ers(record # of wins) 1/9 76ers 2/14 Lakers 5/14 Lakers(hurt, 12 games only) 4/17 Lakers 1/17 Lakers(tied record wins) 2/17 Lakers those season records, 2 championships, 2 all-time records for wins, what the hell do you want ? 2. he frequently dominated Russell and was never dominated in return. 55 rebounds in one game came AGAINST Russell. 3. athleticism - he was a freak of nature, early in his career he was among the fastest players in the NBA, he was always the strongest. Watch old NBA films of him leading the break, throwing behind the back passes at 7'1", amazing. He could no doubt be a star today.
