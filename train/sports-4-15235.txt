Get real. The guy has very good numbers so far but one blown knee and it is all for naught. His two years so far have been good but he isn't the best running back let alone the best overall player. He finished 2nd last year in yards. Six 1,000 yard rushers had a better per rush average. He was 3rd in rushing yards per game. 5th in rushing touch downs. All of this and he was second in rush attempts. I agree that is very good but not a certainty for best running back. It is highly unlikely he can maintain his current pace with a team like the Chargers. People seem to be WAY out of touch with reality. Within an hour of my original rating and comment I received 5 unhelpfuls. LMAO! I am the ONLY person so far to provide any logical reason to back up my claim. First of all the buttons are HELPFUL/UNHELPFUL not I AGREE/ I DISAGREE. Secondly, the fact he has a big heart or is kind is completely irrelevent to his status as best player in the NFL. And to say he is the greatest running back in the NFL when his BEST season of two left him OUT OF FIRST PLACE IN EVERY CATEGORY is assinine. Deal with the facts people. You can like him and even love him all you want but he is not the best running back and certainly not the best overall player. The only way this receives an unhelpful is if you simply DISAGREE with the facts. Maybe I shouldn't get helpfuls, LOL, but I certainly shouldn't get boatloads of unhelpfuls when I am the only one to present any of his numbers.
