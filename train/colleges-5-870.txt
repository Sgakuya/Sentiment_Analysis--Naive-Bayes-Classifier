I would like to say that University of Phoenix is one of the best online programs out there. I work at a hospital, and it is hard to get to a traditional classroom. I soon found that almost half of my wing got their bachelors from this school. The counselors are wonderful, the faculty overall was good, and very flexible. What I do not understand is all the negative feedback. I would bet that most of the negative people did not make it through a class or two. The bottom line is that school is hard, and if you are not willing to do the work, it will be very frustrating. Own up to your own inabilities, but do not blame the biggest Univ. in the country for not being good at what they do. If they are so expensive, and not good, why are they the largest school in the U.S. Word would get out in the past 15 years they have been doing it. I would like to encourage those that are serious about their education to look at University of Phoenix!!!
