Jefferson was one of the best Presidents this country has ever known. #4 on the list...#4!? He should be at #1 without competition! Jefferson fought for everyone to have free speech (not just the government and those who agreed with the government, as some of us today would have), free religion (not just warring Catholics and Protestants) and freedome of the press (not just the conservative media). Conservatives make it sound as though all the Founding Fathers thought alike and acted alike. WRONG! Jefferson even wrote his own interpretation of the Bible, fought for the searation of church and state while (Pa)Tricky Henry fought against it. He opposed slavery and treated what slaves he had like human beings. I don't care what he did with Sally Hemings. He was a great American legacy. Take care, everyone!
