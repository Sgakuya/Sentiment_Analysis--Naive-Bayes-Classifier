I just visited San Diego for the second time last week. It is a wonderful city and a welcome change of pace after enduring a summer in the hot desert. The beaches are amazing and not all that cold once you stand in the water a little while. The scenery is lush and green and best of all the weather is lovely, even in October (about 75 degrees). I'm considering moving there! The only drawback is the cost of living and the low pay. A friend of mine lives in a 2-bedroom shack which he shares with two others. His portion of the rent is $500 a month (about half his salary after taxes) but he is a stone's throw from the beach. As for the roadways, there are fairly crazy drivers but the traffic wasn't too bad ( I expected much worse). However, it is easy to get lost without a map since the roads don't lead you where you'd logically expect them to go. Overall the place grew on me, even though the narrow streets felt a bit cramped....the city has virtually no parking available and is getting more crowded by the minute.
