First of all, Quebec is not a country, it is a province. Prior to the 1960's, the majority of economic and political power in Quebec was in the hands of anglophones. That all changed and now it is the francophones who control everything. The thing is, the french nationalists still think of themselves as the wretched of the earth, even though all signs in Quebec have to either be completely in french or have the french portion dominant, and the political rights of the english minority are never taken into account. Montreal is pretty cool, but I would avoid most of the province because of the sheer hostility you encounter if they find out that you're not french. Highest taxes in the country as well.
