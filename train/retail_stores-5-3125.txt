I have been working at Hollywood Video for about 4 months now and it's a great part time job. The selection is bigger, friendlier, and movie trades. We just started the movie trade in system and our customers love it. I've never really been to a Hollywood video until I started working there. I used to always put up with blockbuster's stick no wonder people like hollywood video better blockbuster's full of themselves. Don't get me started on online renting. The problem with online rentals is if you get a scratched dvd you have to send it back and wait for a new in about 2-3 business days. Instead of that stick you could bring back the scratched copy to hollywood video and we will give an even exchange or a different movie for the hassle. Plus, Hollywood video helps customers out with Additional Rental fee's (late fee's) unlike blockbuster they tell you to piss up a road. Seriously Hollywood Video is just way better.
