Newt Gingrich is a man who inspires strong partisan opinions....I think in time he will be appreciated as one of the most if not the most significant Congressional leader of modern times...he was articulate, had a clear vision, and was consistent...his agenda of cuting taxes reducing the role of government , saving medicare and medicade...and a mixture of social conservatism and populism has now become the mainstream....both Clinton and the gop have adopted his agenda...he may not be liked...and he may have had the worst press coverage ever..distorting him.....but i think he will be one of those figures in history that you just cant ignore...liberals will hate and conservatices will love him...but he made american move in his direction of lower taxes reduced government and more conservative social values...the fallen angel of the conserative movement perhaps
