I love how people make blanket statements, worst ever or profiteer. Where is your reasoning and justifiaction? You morons forget that after 9/11, all the major intelligence agencies around the world agreed that Saddam has WMDs, and even by his own account we were led to believe he had stockpiles. I gaurantee if Gore was president he would have cowered and done NOTHING like the wuss he is. UPDATE: I can't stop laughing at some of the 1 star comments some people have made. The war is for oil? Ha, ha, ha, ha....have we seen one drop of oil from Iraq since the war started? And tax breaks for the rich? Well, I'm certaintly not rich and I got a tax break and money back! FYI, the top 20% income earners pay 80% of the taxes in this country. You liberals don't think for yourself, only what you hear from Ted Kennedy and Barbara Boxer.
