Easy top five all time. I am a Carolina fan, but I also acknowledge that Coach K does an incredible job. That is the difference between the schools, as well evidenced in the previous entry. Nastyness versus class: I choose the latter and pass on speculating whether the fans are emulating some characteristic of their coaches' personality. I don't know him or his style. Ahh... the late game turnovers is what I really meant to write about. Defense creates pressure and confusion. It is not do X and Y happens. A game of hard defense has returns late when the other team makes errors. Deal with it, don't belittle it. Is 2 of 11 a poor average? Damn, who else has eleven final fours and a better one? Wooden. Who else? Oh, then shut the hell up about that.
