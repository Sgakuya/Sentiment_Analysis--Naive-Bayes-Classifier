I believe that Gail Norton is an excellent choice on the part of President Bush for Secretary of the Interior. The government has no right to take away other peoples privately owned land for the sake of the spotted owl. Bush ran on a platform for landowners rights and he must deliver to those who voted for him. Drilling for oil in the Artic National Wildlife Reserve should be instated immediately. This will help alleviate us from being excessively dependent on foreign petroleum. The environment will not be damaged by this, most oil drilling today is very ecofriendly and will fall under tough federal standards. It is up to the people of Alaska if whether they want people drilling for oil; it is not up to bureaucrats in Washington or congressmen from New York or Massachusetts to decide this. Recent polls suggest there is 80% support in Alaska for drilling in the Arctic. Besides, the caribou like having the warm oil pipes to give them heat during the winter. You see, everyone, including the caribou gains from this prospect.
