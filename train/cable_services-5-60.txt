Awesome High Speed cable Internet running at a steady 2.8 Mbs!! I also have Comcast cable TV with HDTV and it is great. My only complaint is that they said that I had one of each movie channel (StarzHD, ShowHD, MaxHD, etc) with the HDTV package, but after a few months they sent me a letter saying I was done with my sample preview of the HD movie channels, so now all I have is the local channels, INHD1&2, and ESPNHD, plus of course, my HBO HD since I have the HBO premium package...oh well. Other than that, Comcast has been great to me for over three years! Service calls are always timely and effective. Honestly, I am sad to have to switch to Adelphia when I move... :(
