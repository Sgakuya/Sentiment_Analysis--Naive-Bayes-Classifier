The worst Bank in Florida. Basically I agree with everyone else that ranked it the worst bank. They are not very professional, I honestly think they arescam artists. They don't reverse charges even it was their fault. For example, I deposited a check for my rent for $300 dollars, but they only credited 200 to my account. When I called customer service, they said it was an entering mistake and it would take a ew days to fix. MEANWHILE my landlord had sent the check in which bounced because I only had the $200 which was supposed to be $300. I was charged $30 insufficient funds. When I told the bank they charged me for their own mistake, they would not reverse the fee which is completely LUDACRIS! Anyways, after 2 1/2 years of a whole bunch of problems like this, I finally closed the account. Steer Clear of this bank!
