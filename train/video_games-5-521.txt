This game has become an American pastime. I remember being little waiting for when I was old enough to play. Not only is it a great game, but also a great teaching tool. You can teach children to count back change with the game, because in this game everyone is careful with their money. You can also teach strategy. It's better to acquire properties of the same color than all over. Also, it's a great game for the summer vacation, because instead of being bored kids can play the game for over a week. It also is still attractive to adults- we all want to make money and it's nice to watch other people pay up. Now they've got so many different versions you can choose your favorite.
