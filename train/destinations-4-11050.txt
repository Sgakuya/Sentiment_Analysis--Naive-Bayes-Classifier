Just about 25 minutes or so north of New York City Playland has the look of a park that's been there forever, and maybe it has. I must've spent three consecutive birthdays there as a child and even though I always got the sense that it was slightly seedy I always had a blast. One of my favorite rides was the one where you stand agains the wall in this cylinder and as it spins the floor drops down about 10 feet and your stuck to the wall by the centrifugal force. I'd probably yack if I tried that now but at age 8 I couldn't get enough of it. Playland is also where I contracted my fear of roller coasters. As soon as I was tall enough my father took me on the Dragon Coaster and made me sit up in the front car with him. Why did he do this? He says he just wanted to see my face coming over the first drop, and believe me it was a look of sheer terror. I didn't step onto another roller coaster until my senior class trip, 10 years. All in all I'd say Playland is your typical slightly run down but still kicking amusement park and worth the stop.
