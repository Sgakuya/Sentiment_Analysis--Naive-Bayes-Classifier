Much as these sob stories appear to be sincere, they are only half true. Take Krisie for instance, by reading the disclosures, I found that the first 5 over drafts are charged $28, the next 5 $30 and after that, $32. So by the time she made this poor little 6 cent error, she had already written over 10 bad checks!!! In addition, when a deposit is made, contrary to those who make deposits and expect them to be effective right then, depositing a check is NOT the same as cash. Checks are a note to PAY an amount, and have to clear so like most banks, the deposits are not good until one or two days later -- per federal regulation and fully disclosed in the brochures. My experience has been exactly the opposite. Should I have to wait more than 5 minutes in line, THEY offer the $5 guarantee. on the 2 occasions in over 15 years I found a mistake in my statement (well below the industry error rate ) they went well out of their way to correct the problem THAT day. Great bank!!
