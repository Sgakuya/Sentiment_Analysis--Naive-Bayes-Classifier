Most of the comments posted h by both conservatives and liberals sadden me. People lack any significant evidence and put blame in ridiculous places. Bush isn't smart enough? I'll admit he's not a genius but he has what it takes and his heart is in the right place. Imagine if your every word was recorded, every time you made a blunder somebody scribbled it down, only the best of public speakers wouldn't make many mistakes. As far as being a good president, Bush has little to do with the economy and especially nothing to do with why it is bad. Go to college, please. As far as anyone who has a problem with the ballots in florida STILL, if you can't punch a hole you deserve to be punched. Why not do some research and figure out how many of the deceased voted. Impeach Bush? wow. I figure even most liberals should give Bush 2 or 3 stars just on how he and his administration responded to attacks. Seriously people, why not be intelligent with comments instead of basing your entire opinion of a person because of his political party.
