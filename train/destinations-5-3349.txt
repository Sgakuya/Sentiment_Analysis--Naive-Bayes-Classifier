i would like to say that i live and d.c and i love it it is a great place. how could people sit up here and down d.c like this i have been to new york and it looks good because of the lots but on my way there i have seen dirty hoods that made dc projects look like manison. i would never degard d.c becuase it is my home town yes there is crime and so what there is crime ever think about most crimes such as muder happens esle where and the only reason dc is put on full blaze is because what society says about us i bet in md name there is a dead body in the the woods but how would they know. md don't have some much hyde around them like dc do until u have live in dc and really seen dc you can say nuthing about dc and trust the people that live in the state makes the state the way it is thank you
