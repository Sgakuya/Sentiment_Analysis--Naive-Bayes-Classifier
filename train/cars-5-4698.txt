The engine, the ride, the warranty, the actual quality that has gone into building this truck is unseen. The brain washed knuckle dragging truck buying masses will eventually grow tired of replacing transmissions and going through their vehicles like old socks. Noise Equals Power is a domestic corner stone, but truth be known, a 245hp 315torque double over head cam sequential multi port engine is the half ton truck call of the future. Come on you Ford tuff, like a rock GM heads (I won't mention Dodge, shock treatment isn't legal anymore) come over from the dark side I have seen the future and it has four pistons on each brake caliper.
