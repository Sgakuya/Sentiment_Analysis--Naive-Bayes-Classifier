i think nicole kidman is great.... but i find her love scenes and in all of her films revolting...i mean cant there be just one film where she is not naked??? she has a great bod but i think that that factor has carried her through her career i am only 15 and i understand why she does nude scenes but there ARE little kids watching her movies, and i dont insist that she is actually a very shy person there is no way that u can be extremely shy and be an A-list Actress??? she is very versitle but i will have to agree with some other people that some of her charactors and films are dull! i love her to pieces but she needs to get it together!
