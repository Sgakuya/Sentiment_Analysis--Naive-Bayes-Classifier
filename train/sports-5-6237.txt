The premier college program not just since 1990, but of all-time. With all due respect to Duke, Indiana, N.C., UCLA, and Kansas, they all take a back seat to the basketball tradition at UK! GO BIG BLUE! Update: Hey Duke.U.S.C why in the world would Kentucky be jealous of anyone? First, most Kentucky fans, at least the ones I know or hear, respect the world out of Duke. It's a great basketball school that now has a great tradition. It still has a ways to go before that tradition is on par with Kentucky's, but it is great. As far as North Carolina goes, that program is overrated. Always has been. When they get as many wins as Kentucky, or as many championships, then I might be jealous. Until then, they're just another Kentucky wannabe. Always have been, always will be.
