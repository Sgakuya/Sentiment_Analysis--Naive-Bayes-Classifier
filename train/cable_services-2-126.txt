We've had DirecTV at my house since the mid 1990's. Until local channels became available, we subscribed to both local Cable TV and DirecTV. After local channels became available on satellite, we switched completely over. It isn't my choice whether or not we have Digital Cable or satellite; but my father wants satellite. This is my breakdown of service. PICTURE QUALITY: The picture quality is actually very good. It is as good as Digital Cable. Colors and pictures are crisp and clear. (except when it rains) RELIABILITY: This is why I rate DirecTV so low. Nearly every time it rains, the picture will cut out. It will stay out for however long it is raining. There are no trees blocking my satellite dish. I hate to imagine how unreliable my service would be with trees around. Cable goes out, too, but not nearly as often as satellite. COST: Cost seems to be more than if we had a Digital Cable/Broadband Internet connection. Instead, we have DirecTV and DSL service separately. In my opinion, it isn't worth it. CHANNEL SELECTION: Another reason we switched to DirecTV initially. At the time of the switch, Digital Cable was just becoming available in our area. Now, though, Digital Cable offers every single channel we get with DirecTV plus some. Also, it is expensive to buy the DirecTV receivers. We have TiVo receivers throughout. Our local cable company also offers DVR service. If it was my decision to make, our family would have Cable Telivision.
