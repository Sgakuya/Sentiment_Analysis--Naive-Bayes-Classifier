Some of you don't understand the song and okay that's understandable but lisson to the words Load up on guns and bring your friends It's fun to lose and to pretend She's over bored and self assured Oh no, I know a dirty word Some of you can't read between the lines. No I will not say they were the greatest band of all time and no I will not put Cobain on a pedestal for being a drugie, but come on the song is ingenious within it's self and he didn't even know it.
