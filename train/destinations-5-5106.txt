I have been to Brattleboro many times, and visited Wilmington as well. I loved the low key peace and green mountains. Hardly no traffic problems or crime. Real Main streets with white churches and Java shops with ethnic eateries- a short distance from the country! The people are slightly reserved- but friendly and down to earth and not into pretention or materialism. Winters can be tough- better off with a hybrid 4 wheel drive here. I drove in January from central Connecticut where there was hardly no snow- to southern Vermont (about 120 miles or so) and there was nearly 2 feet of snow! Climatic differences in New England vary greatly from the south to the north. Over all a wonderful state with a 'real' quality of life that is pleasing to the soul and spirit.
