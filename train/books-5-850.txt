Oh my. What a great read! A lot of fun. My ten year old son is devouring this series, and now LOVES to read. He recently said that all day long at school he's counting down until his 15 minute reading break, so he can find out what happens next. This, from a kid with 152 cable channels, who never has to wait for his favorite shows to come on, because they're on SOMEWHERE pretty much all the time. Makes my heart warm!!! I read the book, in one sitting each. Couldn't put them down. Can't wait for number four. Worth the money, worth the hype. Makes reading COOL again. Thanks, Ms. Rowling for an incredible series.
