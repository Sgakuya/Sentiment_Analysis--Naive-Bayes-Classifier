Perhaps the king of all cigarettes, these smokes (no matter if they are Davidoff Classic, Mint, or Virginia cut) are smooth, delicious, and classy. The boxes are elegantly designed (elegant in a non-feminine way) and practically shout that whomever owns one is a connoisseur. Next, open the box. Inside one finds a paper wrapper with Davidoff etched on, with a gold foil backing. Remove it, and a beautiful presentation of filters is unveiled. The cigarette itself is a tasteful 100mm all white cylinder. The brand is etched into the base of the cigarette in silver foil. Two colored stripes on the all-white filter denote what type of cigarette one is smoking. The smoke itself is smooth, with a hearty taste. The filters allow for a generous drag with minimal effort, and clearly the cotton wadding is healthier than the fiberglass other brands utilize. If one can find them, Davidoffs are king. Since they stopped importing to America a few years ago, they've been very difficult to come by. If they are stocked by the local retailer, HORDE THEM. Prices are currently around $10-12/pack, a far cry from the $8 I paid for them in the late nineties. (Although I've heard that cartons can be purchased for $14 at certain duty-free stores.)
