Although this is another 'cheesehead' tourist comment saying 'awww ain't that so cute!' I have to admit that the beaches of the Algarve are truly beautiful. Admittedly it's predictably getting splatted with cheap and nasty concrete high rises in places. The people really ARE beautiful (anyone who disagrees needs their eyes testing) and give the impression of being charming, yet aloof, and sophisticated yet nonchalant. As far as I could understand, it's quite a closed and conservative society and probably still is living under the shadow of Salazar. If I could get a well paid job and could speak Portugese reasonably well, I'ld DEFINATLEY live there.
