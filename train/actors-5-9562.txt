Catherine Zeta-Jones has got it all - exquisite beauty, seasoned talent and personal happiness!! Since none of us knows her personally, I don't think parroting the sour press statements about her is fair - she always seems warm and genuine to me, as far as one who knows nothing personal about her can see! Her talents are obvious - CHICAGO was AMAZING - and SHE made it so!!! And Entrapment and Zorro were equally wonderful! That Oscar was absolutely deserved - unquestioningly! As far as her personal choices go - they are hers and hers alone to live with; perhaps she wouldn't approve of yours, either!Give the woman credit for her amazing beauty and talent, and leave her personal life to her!
