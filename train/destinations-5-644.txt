I spent about a month in Quepos in October / November 2005. Simply adored it. I stayed in Quepos but bussed (20 cents each way) to Manuel Antonio often in the days. I began with a decent room at Mary's Guest Home for $10.00 a night, moved down the street to a nicer place for $12.00 a night with a refrigerator in my room (both had private toilet and cold water shower), and ended up for a few weeks at Hotel Sanchez for $15.00 a night with color TV with full cable, private bath and refrigerator. There were several internet places in the town and many very inexpensive restaurants -- supurb fresh fish meals, full meals, for $5.00. Awesome. Bob Corbett corbetre@webster.edu
