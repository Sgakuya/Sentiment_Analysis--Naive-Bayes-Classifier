Kevin Spacey's subtlety prevented him from becoming an overnight, one-movie success, as in Leo DiCaprio=Titanic or Russell Crowe=Gladiator. Even after such films as Se7en and The Usual Suspects , his name meant less to audiences than the characters he played, which, as a serious actor, was probably exactly the way he wanted it. It took American Beauty to propel him into the limelight, and even then he refused to portray his Lester Burnham in the kind of stereotypical fashion that would allow viewers to classify him, and thus make of him a typical middle-aged sexpot or middle-aged schlub. No, Lester was much more complex than that, although he WAS sexy, and he WAS a schlub. Kevin Spacey is refreshing because there are so few actors in this age of glitz who would really just rather be actors. He hones his considerable talent with each film he makes, and for that I am thankful.
