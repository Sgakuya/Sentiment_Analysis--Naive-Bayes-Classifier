 The MBA for the real world - you study whilst you work, applying the theories to your organisation or workplace. You can study when you want and in whatever order you choose. My modules were Strategy, Creativity Innovation Change, Financial Strategy and International Enterprise. The OUBS provides superb materials, superb tutors and excellent networking opportunities via tutorials and residential schools. The OUBS online FirstClass conferencing/collaboration system is also extremely useful and means that you never feel isolated whilst undertaking distance learning. It is a tough MBA but the rewards and sense of achievement are second to none! Malcolm Ashton, MBA(Open), MCMI
