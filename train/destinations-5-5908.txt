I'm from Los Angeles, California. My wife and I were in New Jersey in April of this year to see my son graduate from the Coast Guard in Cape May. We stayed at the Montreal Inn and had a great time. I don't understand the negative criticism. The people of New Jersey treated us really nice. I would go back in a heartbeat. I've heard about the New Jersey turnpike all my life and it was neat driving thru the Garden State, in the middle of a pretty good (bad) storm. We also stayed in Philly and New York, but New Jersey was the highlight of our trip. That was due to the nicest people we met. I try not to listen to negative remarks, because people always say lousy things about California and I love it here.
