Terry Francona, well, he was lucky he inherited such a good red sox ball club, i meen they have David Ortiz who is coming off a break out season Manny Ramirez who has always been good Curt schilling probably the best free agency move in the last decade and Pedro martinez, quite frankly thats all you need. They have the 2003 batting champ bill mueller Jason Varitek now the official captain kevin millar how is no all star but will get the job done, i meen the whole starting 9 is unbelievable then they have a very strong bench in youklis, personaly i tihnk i could have managed this team to the worldseries and im only 16. Francona is lucky he has such a gutsy ball club and will play every game untill the end. As long as Francona keeps the sox winning, i'll keep him here.
