Dan Quayle is an intelligent and decent man who has the unfortunate quirk of stage fright. Most of his miscues were trivial when held up to the paragon of sheer stupidity and venal dissembling: Albrecht Gore. Gore is a man so astonishing stupid that he flunked out both law school and theology school at Vanderbilt (Also known as the University that the Family Gore built.) He was the ultimate legacy who had only to show up not stoned out of his mind to pass. The inequity of downplaying the intellect of Quayle is doubly tragic when the nitwits who majored in English and Journalism scream themselves hoarse with praise for the vile pathological liars: White Trash Momma's Boy (Clinton) and Gore. Many of the incisive opinions and observations by Dan Quayle have been tested by time and proven true whereas Gore is fundamentally false and absurd. Clinton and Gore have no such legacy and never will.
