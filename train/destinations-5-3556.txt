Crime is almost non-existent(though the neighborhoods look kind of rough as you move away from downtown) haha!! yeah right. LOL Charleston was recently voted the 12th most DANGEROUS cities in America. New Orleans was 13. Downtown Charleston, NORTH of Calhoun Street, is the roughest place in America. Im a chef and I travel all over the country. And Charleston and New Orleans are both beatiful cities that I love (just like Savannah), with their own indigenous style of cooking, but at the same time they are also both definitely the toughest places in the country. That IVE ever been to. Everything south of Broad is pretty much OK. But the other half is a danger zone. Stop lyin to these people.
