I never found her such a intriguing actress and felt that she always was that COLD COLD stereotype that didn't seem to know emotion. After watching Moulin Rouge, I totally changed my mind about her. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and she doesn't need that loser Tom to help keep her reputation. And people out there, give her some respect, she went through a LIVING hell trying to make Moulin Rouge after breaking her back twice in a row, tearing her ligaments in her kneecaps, and tripping down the stairs in high heels. I give her lots of respect for the good dancer, good actress and the fabulous singer that she is. She is so underrated and misunderstood that it's sad that people don't see what she is going through. It's always that Tom that gets everything.
