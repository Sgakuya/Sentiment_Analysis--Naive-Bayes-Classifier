Most over rated President of all time. What did he really do? He dominated the South in weapons, supplies and everything and still almost lost the Civil Law. And NO. He did NOT free the slaves. The Emancipation Proclomation stated that SOUTHERN SLAVES be free. Well guess what? We were in war with them so obviously laws that he imposed on them had NO EFFECT. So really no slaves got freed with this document and he didn't even care one way or the other if they even were free. Only Reason I gave him 2 stars because at least he knew he had to keep the North and South together. But people only rate him high because he was president during a tough time.
