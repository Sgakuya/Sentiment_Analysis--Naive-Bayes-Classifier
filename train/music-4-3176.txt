Released in 1977, Rumours brought Fleetwood Mac fame and fortune; however, the band had been around for some time as a blues-rock band. (One notable song from that era was Oh Well.) The band's sound changed dramatically with the exodus of some members and the addition of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks for the 1975 predecessor to Rumours (named Fleetwood Mac). I preferred Fleetwood Mac over Rumours, but the two really go hand in hand in anyone's collection. As usual, my personal preference is for the Buckingham songs (ie Second Hand News, Never Going Back Again, and Go Your Own Way) though the more popular songs were by Nicks and McVie (ie Dreams and Don't Stop). This release also contains The Chain, You Make Loving Fun, and Gold Dust Woman. While the lesser tracks tend to pale in comparison to the monster tracks, the Rumours is strong throughout.
