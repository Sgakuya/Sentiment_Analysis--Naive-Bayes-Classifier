It is fun. The Emperor's Palace (man, is that what it was called?) is in the middle of the city is a very nice place to visit. Beware of the dress code! The tourist/foreigner ghetto is Khao San Road. . .plenty of cheap hotels/restraunts/bars. . .good place to pick up tourist information or transportation to the beaches and resorts. Thailand does have beautiful beaches. . .I will never waste my time at an American beach again. Thailand is very cheap once you get there, but be careful about getting pickpocketed or ripped off. Thais are generally very friendly people. A great place to spend 10 days to 2 weeks if you are near the beach. Also- Thai food is some of the best in Asia.
