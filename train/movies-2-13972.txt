i touched on this before, but i just dont like this film. it has nothing to do w/the principal stars/writers of the film (although i do have an aversion to Ben Affleck; Damon is decent when he wants to be). my problems stem from this film running over two hours on every single cliched plot point ever created: 1) the un-noticed genius 2)the tortured orphan no one loves 3)the benevolent father figure who has undergone his own torturous past 4)the love interest who first the main character gets but then rejects b/c his pain is too deep 5)the good ole pals from the neighborhood meant to keep our hero grounded and real 6) the best friend who realizes the hero is special before even he does. ugh. it feels to me like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck sat with a how to make films book by their side while writing this movie. but i do understand how it got made. Kevin Smith, witty hollywood genius a the time produced the film, and Damon and Affleck were two actors, despite their protestions, on the cusp of stardom (one should remember that Damon had already done The Rainmaker, School Ties, and The meg ryan military flick by 1997, as well as already filming Saving Private Ryan and that Affleck had cast a name for himself amongst the indie set, staring in various Kevin Smith vehicles not to mention the cult hit Dazed and Confused). that said, a little too much praise and hollywood hype was lavished on this film at the time of its release.
