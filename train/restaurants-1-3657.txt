The worst, I ordered a pizza while moving recently, and it finally showed up, WRONG type of pizza! I sent it back with the delivery person, said I would NOT pay for that pizza and for them to send the correct one, hours went buy, no pizza, finally called the restaurant, and the guy told me that since I got the wrong pizza, it was up to ME to call them back and place another order, and wait in line again for them to deliver it after they delivered all their other orders!!! Like, they won't admit to their mistakes and correct them for their customers! I not only did not, I have kept the other pizza delivery restaurants busy since then, and will refuse to ever order Dominos again! When the customer is always wrong, then it is time to head to another place, after all, they are not the only pizza delivery company in town, too bad their staff is too dumb to realize that!
