You really can't rate one twin above the other, because they both have their qualities and bad points. I'm amazed Ashley is actually higher then Mary-Kate, because personally, I like Mary-Kate's acting ability a bit more then Ashleys. Their both great,but, I think Mary-Kate brings more of a real life attitude to her roles. I know they usually give Mary-Kate the sporty roles and Ashley the girly ones, and that's always how it's been. Ashley plays her roles well, but I find her too cheery at times, and way too happy to be a real person. She delivers her roles clearly and with a lot of emotion though, and does a great job at it.
