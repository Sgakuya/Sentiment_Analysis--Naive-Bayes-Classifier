I thought that Training Day was a pretty good movie. The acting was espescially supurb by all parties involved, espescially by Denzel Washington. In most of his movies, he has always played the protagonist... the good guy, the one that you want to root for. However, in relation to his other roles, his role as Detective Alonzo Harris in Training Day is the exact polar opposite. His performance in this movie truly was riveting, as was that of Ethan Hawke. As far as the script goes- I thought that most of the plot was solid and the dialogue was great. The film carries with it a true sense of reality. The directors actually shot some of the scenes in real gangster-type neighborhoods in L.A., and many real-life thugs appear in the film. The ending was not what I expected after such a great movie, but even this fact could not refute Washington's Oscar performance and Hawke's great performance. All in all, a highly reccomended film.
