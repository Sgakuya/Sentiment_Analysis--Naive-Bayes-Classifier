Years ago when I first got my cell phone, I was less than thrilled with the phone and the service. That company was one of the ones that Verizon bought out to form it s large company. When I traded my old Motorola in for a new phone (not Motorola) under the Verizon contract, I was thrilled! I now have two cell phone and both are with Verizon wireless. For me, there is no beating them. I have great rates, and the service reaches just about everywhere. I was even in the mountains of Kentucky visiting a friend of mine. She lives in Kentucky, has a cell phone with another company. As we traveled my son started watching the cell phone and noticed that about half the time her company s signal was out, and both our cell phones were getting a strong signal. To me, that means a lot. I want to be able to use my phone when I need my phone, not when I m sitting in a certain spot. Love Verizon s services!!
