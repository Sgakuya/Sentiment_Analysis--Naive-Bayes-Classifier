HOLLYWOOD69, Sure customers are rude. I work in a hotel, and see the crankiest, dumbest, rudest beings on earth. But nothing they do can replace the fact that they are the customers and they make it possible for me to have a job. THERE IS NEVER ANY EXCUSE TO BE RUDE TO A CUSTOMER, no matter how big an IDIOT they are being. I have delt with hundreds of irate, upset and rude people, and I can always find a way to be polite and calm, if not nice, to them. You have to develope a bit of thick skin when dealing with the public. Just as long as you know what you are doing, and you know you are in the right, you can handle most situations. If you cannot, that is not your fault, but your managers fault for not training you properly. If you are typical of the kind of people employed at HOLLYWOOD, I will glady take my business elsewhere! (Boy, you know, tht even sounds stupid when I say it. Every time someone says this to me, I have to fight the urge to say GO AHEAD, YOU BLITHERING IDIOT! I AINT GONNA MISS YOU. THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE READY TO TAKE YOUR PLACE, YOU IDIOT!!!)
