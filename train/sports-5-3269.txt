Being a Yankee is both a blessing and a curse. They went to the World Series nearly every year but they were the strongest collection of players in either league. When you batted clean-up for the Yankees, you were the best clean-up hitter in the game. 56 game hitting streak? Who would've ever thought Ruth's record of 60 HR in a season would ever be topped, or 714 HR in his incredible career, or Gehrig's consecutive games played by the Iron Man of baseball. All those records have fallen. Nobody has broken the 56 game hitting streak (he went on to hit in 14 more after going 0 for 4) because it is the single most un-touchable record in sports. Supplant Joe D. with Al Oliver in the Hall of Fame? Sorry. All those World Championships, the streak and the intense rivalry with Ted Williams, adds up to a Hall of Fame career.
