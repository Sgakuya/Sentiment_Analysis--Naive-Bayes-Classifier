I'm a huge J.J. Redick fan. I think the kids shot is as pure as anyone one who has played the game and he has alot of heart. In saying this, I know the game well enough to know he isn't the best player in the country and will be lucky to go in the 1st round of the draft next year. He lacks the quickness and strength to get seperation at the next level and will find it hard to get open looks. He is improved defensively but is no where near good enough to guard NBA shooting guards. His handles are at best decent and he'll find he want be able to get as open off screens as he does in the college game. So anybody who truly knows basketball knows the truth including redick himself but you duke fanatics keep talking the non-sense.
