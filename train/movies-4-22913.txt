Excellent, creepy, bizarre 1971 film about futuristic violence and a gang of roving thugs in London by the great Kubrick, another member of the exclusive club of movies that are better than the book. It explores violence, but also raises interesting questions about crime, and the response to crime. The book itself isn't very good IMO, and like genghis the hun said, you'll need the glossary in the back of it, and reading it is bound to be an agitating experience. McDowell was great in it, and it's too bad that he never became a big star because he has acting chops, and sadly has been reduced to appearing in Sci-Fi channel original motion pictures and the like.
