What a dizzy murder-mystery comedy! More or less the precursor to 1985's CLUE, this parody has six of the world's literary detectives being invited to "dinner and a murder" at the run-down mansion of wigged-out host Lionel Twain (played by an obviously-overwrought Truman Capote). The sleuths are represented by actors with tour-de-force credentials (David Niven, James Coco, Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, and Elsa Lanchester), but it's Peter Falk's Sam Diamond that rings truest. The showstopper has to be Sir Alec Guinness as Twain's sightless butler Jamesir Bensonmum (some of the funniest sequences occur when he's being addressed). Imprisoned in musty style by Twain's diabolical gadgetry, they all must work together to solve the oddest of cases they've ever tackled. Can't spoil the superb ending, so you'll just have to get the DVD and see for yourselves. This is Neil Simon material at its Golden Globe-nominated best.
