I can not say that I have experienced the issues outlined by rootcrontab. Connectivity has not been an issue. University of Pheonix Online has provided a reliable classroom environment. The material is challenging and learning environment is unique. I am pleased with my overall experience with UOP. ------------------------------ To SEANOS: I am entering my final class for my Master of Science in Computer Information Systems with UOP. The experience has been a positive one. The environment is certainly different from an actual classroom in that most, if not all, communication is conducted online. Many will argue that you miss out on the social interaction. I say that by the time you reach college, your social skills should already be developed and the focus should be on training you can actually use. In this day and age computer skills and the ability to communicate using the technology available is a necessity in the corporate world. UOP provides a solid education and forces students to develop a sound understanding of computer technologies. I am a firm believer in UOP and online learning. Dont be fooled by what others may claim. Online learning is not a cakewalk. It takes hardwork and focus to stay on course but the results are extremely rewarding.
