Thank you to everyone who knows so little about college football. Joe Pa is an institution at Penn State and in college football. Who can name a coach that has greater success at the Div. IA level for so long. In 39 yrs as head coach he has had 5 losing seasons. Albeit 4 were in the last five years. That was because of recruiting. Shortly after Eddie Robinson retired, also a Great Coach, the media started the rumors that Joe was getting old and probably would be retiring soon. High school kids being naive believed this and no matter what any recruiter or coach from Penn State said was going to make a difference. As far as the coaches above him, Bob Stoops, a good coach and will do well; Kirk Ferentz, also a good coach; Larry Coker, came into a winning progam and continued, ergo a good coach; Bobby Bowden, a good coach but overrated. The number of wins misleading because of his time at Samford. Also, what is the graduation rate of his players. Is that not something we should also be looking at? Are these young men not at a university? Is it not the universities job to educate first and have winning athletics somewhere after? Who knows the graduation rate of the football players at any SEC or ACC School? How many SEC or ACC players are, have been or will be convicted felons? Under Joe Pa for 39 years the graduation rate of his players has been 85%. Well above the national average of 57%. Joe is the Greatest Coach, Educator, Mentor and Role Model that Div. IA football has ever or will ever see.
