I rate the harley sportster as good, not great. Why? I love sporsters, and have owned 3. But...I think Harley should put more into the sporster line than they have. Why is there no big inch factory model? An 88 inch, or 95+ inch model? Why no fuel injection? Why isnt the sportster harleys "hot rod"? The sportster engine certainly has potential. The brakes are getting better. The rubber mounted engine is an improvement, for sure, (althought removing the trap door on the tranny was a mistake). And that seat...too hard. So, although I love the sporty, i cannot give it the top rating until the motor company puts more into it. I am sure there are a lot of guys like me that would willing to pay more for a true hotrod sporty.
