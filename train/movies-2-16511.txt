This was a sick movie with a wannabe in the crowd girl attempting drug use, sex, stealing, and fighting with parents but what really made me want to throw up was when she cut herself X(. The reason I watched it was because I was in my first year of high school and I thought this grade girl was going to experience peer pressure. Also because the Vancouver Sun rated it 3.5 stars. She didn't seem pressured at all it was just like she wanted to do everything. The ending was horrible and unexplained. At the end basically the skanky so called popular older girl who she wanted to be friends with just used her so she didn't have to live with her discusting aunt. When the family desided not to, skanky girl then tells her aunt how horrible the are and then transfers to another school when really she left her life screwed up. She also had to restart grade eight.I guess the movie left a moral of some sort. Well I dunno. See the movie for yourself and make your own judgement. It never hurts to rent out a movie.
