Okay I really think Adam Sandler is a funny but he definetly has more potential. Little nicky was a movie that I just couldn't really handle. Its something you would find in a 5 year olds mind. Don't get me wrong I'm not putting down Adams imagination but he should've never made it into a movie. The only reason I saw it was because my friends brother is in it. I can admit though that i laughed a couple of times but overall it was sad try at a comedy. I can only imagine how much it took to make the movie so I hope Adam Sandler can make another classic billy madison or happy gilmore some time soon. Until then I suggest that people do not see little nicky unless your in the mood for a bad movie. Oh and schmeddley who the hell are you? This site is for people who have seen movies and then rate them, how can you rate something you have'nt seen, shut the hell up!
