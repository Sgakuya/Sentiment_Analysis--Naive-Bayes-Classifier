It s easy to forget how good Nightmare on Elm Street was when it first came out. If I remember correctly, the horror movie genre was pretty stagnant at the time (1984), and Nightmare kicked some life back into things with a semi-original premise: a supernatural killer who stalks people in their dreams. When I first saw this movie I was about 14, I think, and it scared the hell out of me. But the sequels weren t nearly as good as the original. How many sequels did they make, something like 20? When you start seeing titles like Nightmare on Elm Street 17: Freddy vs. Godzilla, you know it s time to call it quits.
