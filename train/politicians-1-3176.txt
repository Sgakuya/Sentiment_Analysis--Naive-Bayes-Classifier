This gentlemen obviously had a lot of problems, and as a result was on a short leash during most of the second half of his administration with both the Congress and the people, at least the Republicans, which is OK. He is the one who made the choices that produced the attitude that most people, in turn, have chosen to take regarding him. I find that in talking about Bill Clinton I have a tendancy to get pretty agitated. I am reminded of the eminent psychiatrist Carl Jung who, along with Freud more or less, made the observation that whenever we find ourselves reacting strongly to someone it is because that person is reflecting something of ourselves back at us. There is something of Bill Clinton in me, for sure. For sure it is a part of myself that I would like to see locked up and away from the rest of my existance where that part could do further harm to me.
