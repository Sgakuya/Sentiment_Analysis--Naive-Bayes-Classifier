The only five-star president. He set the standards for all who came after him. His cabinet was a who's who of the Founding Fathers and the American Revolution; subsequent presidents could only dream of having the same breadth of brain power at their disposal. He was a marvelous consensus-builder, who calmly solicited input from his advisors and then cooly made decisions that, more often than not, tended to please all sides of the debate. And he eschewed the party system, knowing the discord it would cause. If only we lesser mortals could have resisted the temptation. Washington was a true statesman, a war hero, and the father of the greatest republic in history. Even among the legends of his age, he is a giant.
