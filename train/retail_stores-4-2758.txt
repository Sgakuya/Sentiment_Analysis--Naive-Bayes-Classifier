Good but not great. They aren't the least expensive but they aren't the most expensive either. I would think that any company which buys in bulk could offer more substantial savings. It is almost as if the items are priced a bit more than what you would expect to pay from a mass retailer but not high enough to make it worth your time to get back in the car and drive to a competitor. The checkout lines can be as long as some supermarkets and although their staff is courteous and knowledgeable, there aren't enough of them throughout the store to make finding an item a quick and painless experience. On the plus side, most of the time they have what you are looking for and they offer cutting of wood, pipes, and other items which is a great convenience for those who are not fully equipped at home.
