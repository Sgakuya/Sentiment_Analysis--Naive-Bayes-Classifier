Hillary had her nose slapped when she found out that the term President Clinton didn't include her. After the great Health Care Debacle, in which she tried to give to us the benefit of her superior wisdom, she vented in other venues, but she didn't try to be a policy maker, at least not in the public sense. Then Sen Moynihan gave her a chance by retiring. The Clintons promptly bought a house in NY ( See, we really do live here... ), which, now that the Senate race is won, is back on the market ( Fooled ya..! ). Now she gets to play policy maker, which is what she wanted all along. And she still wants to give us the benefit of her superior wisdom. She will tire of being one of a hundred, and will serve no more than two terms. Bank on her keeping an eye on the Presidency. Personally, I hope that she does run. It will give Democrats a chance to redeem themselves by throwing her out of the primaries quickly. They can't all be as stupid as NY. I write that last line even as Slick Willie is finishing his second term...
