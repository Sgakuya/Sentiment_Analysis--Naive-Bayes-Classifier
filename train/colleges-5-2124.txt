As a graduate of Kenyon (BA, English Literature, 1992), my opinion is undoubtedly somewhat biased, but I must agree with 6uldv8, poorly aliased though (s)he may be. Liberal arts are the core of the Kenyon experience, and a first-rate English Lit. program was what drew me to the admittedly isolated campus. I attended classes and seminars throughout my academic career there that held my attention, provoked analytical thought, and offered truly enriching experiences, both in and out of my major field of study. The Psychology dept. was first-rate; I especially enjoyed the style and antics of Dr. Art Leccese (sp.? - it's been almost 10 yrs.). Music was another favorite, mostly because of Professor Tunes Taylor, RIP. I can only hope the faculty continues to maintain its high standards for evaluating students' work, thought process development, and intellectual evolution. With regards to athletic facilities - feh, who needs 'em. I lettered in varsity soccer two years, varsity baseball three, in high school. When I arrived at Kenyon in the Fall of '88, I didn't miss organized sports one bit, especially given our student body's proclivity to party insanely hard. No regrets, no hesitation in recommending the school for those who wish to devote a good deal of energy to personal academic development, and I'm looking forward to a 10 year reunion next summer.
