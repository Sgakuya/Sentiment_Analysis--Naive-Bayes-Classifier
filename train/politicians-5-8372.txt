Fired the airtraffic controllers (they tried to stop airflow for selfish reasons), slowed down the growth of the government, lowered taxes, wasn't afraid to send in troops, but didn't unless it was needed. The national debt skyrocketed because of the arms race with the soviets that put them out of business. What is better a large debt or a defunkt Soviet Union???? Do you feel the debt? Is someone after you for the debt, you idiots?! The national debt means nothing compared to what Reagan did. IF WE CUT ALL OF THE SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS AND THE LENDING OF MONEY TO FOREIGN NATIONS WE'D HAVE LESS OF A DEBT!!!! But you liberals wouldn't like cut social programs would you? The debt started with FDR.... live with that one. Reagan was the greatest president in the past 100 years second to FDR and that is argueable. Look past your allegiences to the Leviathan of the Democratic party and see Reagan for what he was.
