While it can be seen as an obvious (and lackluster) attempt to recapture the thrilling aura of Fatal Attraction, I thoroughly enjoyed Disclosure. Like Fatal Attraction, Disclosure features some thrilling and rough sex scenes that add to the thrilling aura of the film. Douglas and Moore are solid as usual, and are backed up by a decent supporting cast including Dylan Baker, Dennis Miller and Donald Sutherland. Disclosure features a happily married husband (Douglas) who soon finds his rough ex-fling (Moore) to be his boss. Following a late-night ecounter, Moore's character literally forces herself on Douglas. What follows is a thrilling ride throughout. Overall, Disclosure is a solid film that explores the possibility of a female in power being every bit as ruthless and conniving as a man.
