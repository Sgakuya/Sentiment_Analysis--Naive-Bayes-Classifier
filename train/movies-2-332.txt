Maybe it was the fact that I watched it at 2 am, after 2 other heavy films that I found it so tremendously, horrifyingly boring. Or maybe it was the fact that epic sagas have no place in my video collection. Or maybe it was the fact that it was truly bad. I love Joaquin Phoenix and I really tried to like this movie but it was impossible! The solid story about Russell's character was nowhere recognizable in the other plots being played out. That it got twelve Oscar nods I find unbelievable. Some scenes were good but not nearly enough. I don't think anything would make me want to see this movie again. I'd just fall asleep like last time.
