I like most of these parks, but I can easoly say that this is the best one that I have ever been to. The rides are so great - there is one roller coaster that I forget the name of, but it is like the biggest climb in the entire world. I think that they add one new colossal ride every year in an attempt to outdo the previouos year's main attraction. There were rides there that I had never even heard of or seen in my life. Now the lines were long, but well worth the wait. I was there over Memorial Day weekend, so there was a lot of people, but I am sure the entire summer is like that. Camped out at Put-In Bay (which is kind of close to there) that weekend with a bunch of friends - this is another good thing to do in that area.
