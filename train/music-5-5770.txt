Very great. I am a very big geek when it comes to music. Metallica demonstrated their true music theory skills in this album. For instance, the first song, blackened, it changes time from 7/4 to 6/4 to 2/4 to 4/4 and i think it even has 5/4 in one spot but i'm not shure. Metallica has one of their greatest songs on this album, One. My favorite song with my second favorite solo. My favorite solo is also on this CD. I shortest straw, Kirk engages in an all out kick ass solo. Lastley, my favorite instrumental, to live is to die. Many people get confused when they see that Cliff Burton helped to write this song because he died in the middle of the puppets tour. Cliff actually had part of the song written down on paper. They happened to find that paper after the bus accident and they wrote the rest of the sond as sort of a tribute to Cliff. This is one of Metallicas most orchestrated songs in their whole collection. This is the best (in my opinion) Metallica CD. I play guitar and my opinion is somewhat biased, but im shure there are true music lovers out there who will agree with me. By the waay,AutoJC, Metallica is not a band of dolts and being a stron Conservative republican, i still think that Metallica did a good job of expressin themselves, even though i might not agree with some of the lyrics Metallica puts out.
