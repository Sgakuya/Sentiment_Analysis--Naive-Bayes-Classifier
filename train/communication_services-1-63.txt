If anyone has a brain...please do NOT use Qwest. I signed up for their service and promplty left my apartment. I was charged for 2 and a half months of service when I didn't even make a single phone call. I never received a single bill, and one day got a call from the colelction agency telling me I owed them $90+. After yelling at a representative and yelling at a supervisor they cut my bill in half. I paid it, just because I do not need a ding on my credit rating at the moment. If you like getting rammed in the ass by huge bills, then by all means choose Qwest. If you enjoy tasting the sweet taste of no money in your wallet, then by all means choose Qwest. And if you LOVE punching yourself in the nuts for choosing Qwest...then please punch your sack and choose Qwest. Cause jeez...I could not think of a worse company. Maybe Enron...Maybe...
