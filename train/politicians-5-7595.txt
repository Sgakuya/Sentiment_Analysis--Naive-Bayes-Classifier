Lincoln gets my vote as the only Prez who had the balls to tell the South where to stick it. And followed it up b sticking it to 'em. Greatest speeches, all written himself - c'mon - you gotta give it up for that alone. How many boring and badly-written oratories are we subject to now? Plus, I'm sure he knew he was probably gonna get killed - he lived practically next door to the Confederates. He was courageous, formidably strong, overcame his family woes, and overcame the army's screwups. Remember, too, that he led the world into post-Napoleon, pre-modern war. America was the last, other than S. Africa, to see the lite with abolishing slavery, but we did it with a bang, and it could ONLY have gone down the way it did w/ a man like Lincoln in charge. Supreme, unadulterated leader and possessor of the bigest can of whoop-ass America ever produced. Anyone who could hire Sherman? 5 stars!
