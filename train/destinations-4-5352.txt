I reside in eastern Washington and I think some people here have been unduly hard on us. Eastern Washington is definitely more conservative than the left side of the state. That said I don't think we are as reactionary or redneck as some people would have you believe. I happen to be a conservative Republican and I vote that way but not everyone on this side of the state thinks like that. The so called "conservatives" in Spokane just passed a slew of tax increases for a bunch of nonsense programs, many passing overwhelmingly. I'm not sure where Eastern Washington got its reputation. It is probably because in relation to the liberal Seattle megalopolis, Eastern Washington is "relatively" conservative.
