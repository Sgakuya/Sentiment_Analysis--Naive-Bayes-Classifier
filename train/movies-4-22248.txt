This movie was definitely revolutionary for its time. It had a very interesting plot mixed in with good action scenes. The main reason this movie is not a five star in this category is because of all the 80's references throghout the movie. Sure, that is how the timeline of the story goes. However, they were unavoidable. You know how people can look at a movie and say, That was made in that time period. That can definitely be said about The Terminator. Also, T2 does have its 90's refernces as well. Yet, they are not as frequent and blatant as the first one. Other than that, Terminator is a good movie to watch.
