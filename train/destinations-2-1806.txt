300 Million People and only two or three decent cities: NYC, San Francisco, and L.A. Only reason these cities are somewhat enjoyable is because about 1/3 of the people that occupy these places are foreigners. Need a say more ? This place is so over-rated, it is ridiculous. There are more bums, ignorant morons, crackheads, fast-food enthusiasts, racist rednecks and fat slobs in this country than anywhere I have ever been. Funny though, they actually think that because people watch a movie with Penelope Cruz or listen to Michael Jackson that there is some kind of connection with their fat slob-self. They are living in disneyland.
