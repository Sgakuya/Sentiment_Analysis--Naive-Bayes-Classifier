Now let me tell you that I have read a lot of Fantasy. Believe me when I say most of it is garbage, but occasionally a certain series stands out above the rest. Wheel of Time is that series. Within this book you will find a story that follows one major plot across 9 books as of this date, hundreds of subplots (some that move the main plot and some that simply define a character or change the state of the world, amazingly strong themes and issues that often isn't seen in pulp-fiction fantasy, a realistic descriptive world with vast cultures, and many different groups and factions working towards their own goals. A lot of people think a major flaw of this series is that the villians are black and have no shades of gray. I partially agree with that and partially disagree. It depends which villain we are talking about. Ishmael I would say is your pure black. Lanfear is not really evil she does what she does because she is in love and extremely ambitious. Most the people serving the Dark One (the all evil main enemy) are not evil. Most of them are serving for something that are simply aspects of human nature: ambition to become more powerful and fear of failure. Most of them do not see themselves as evil. So the statements of pure black evil characters is false. Unfortunately for the common populace, this is a book that you are going to have to think and read almost word for word otherwise there is a good chance you are going to get lost. Things are not completely handed down to you in this book. A lot of it you really will have to use your brain.
