at times on my top ten worst movies of all-time list. it keeps moving further down the more films Ben Affleck makes, but that is another matter. Gump is a piece of unimaginative tripe, right propaganda dump on the nation right in the middle of Clinton's presidency. quintessentially American in it's message. and what is Gump's message: it's okay to be an idiot in America, it is in fact endearing; people who rebel against America, hippies, minorities with political intent, are nothing but violent and abusive animals. if you are a loose, troubled woman like Jenny, you will ultimately pay for your sins by getting a horrible disease and dying you. if your Forest, an absolutely clueless moron, you need only wait and said loose woman will one day give it up to you. this man was also present for every important event in the later 1/2 of the 20th century. why not have Gump shuffling in the background as the vietcong pulled the trigger in that classic video. or better, let's have Gump jump in front of the bullet meant for Reagan. or he could've run really fast and tried to save John Lennon, since apparently the two were on Dick Cavett together. that said, i dont have a problem w/ficitious characters being placed in historical situations, but one as blantant and full of agenda as Forest Gump, i have a problem with.
