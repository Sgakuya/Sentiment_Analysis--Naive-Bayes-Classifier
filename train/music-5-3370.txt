Magnum opus! Serious Mood Music. Kicks off with the craziness of Speak To Me, where he talks of insanity -- which is really the theme of the album, isn't it? Then we hit the seamless transition into the frightening On the Run. I must say when I turned of the lights at 11PM and listened to this, I kept looking over my shoulder; a constant stream of chills ran down my spine. Great Gig in the Sky runs through my head everytime I watch sunset. Personally, I don't like Money -- it's not a bad song, but it just doesn't fit with the rest of the album -- I mean, it's wedged between a song about eternity (Great Gig In the Sky) and war (Us And Them) without any seamless lyrical or instrumental transition that we find everywhere else in the album. But the rest is great -- I had to choose between Led Zeppelin IV and Dark Side of the Moon, and I'm glad I chose this.
