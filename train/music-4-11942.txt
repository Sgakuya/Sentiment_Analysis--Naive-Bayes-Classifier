I have went through and read all of the comments, there were some very valid ones. I totally agree, Beyonce gives off some major me, me, me, what about me vibes. She needs to step back and look at herself and her behavior. Because it is so clear that her father isn't tring to. He is just as bad as she is, if not worse. I would like to hear from the other girls, I really am getting tired of just hearing Beyonce. She has a nice voice, but she over powers everyone else. I have taken voice and I am a first saprano; I have sang with choirs and a womens ensamble. I know how important it is to have blend and harmony. They are saddly lacking these qualities. Beyonce is the only one you hear. It's like the Sepremes all over agian. I hope she gets herself together and relizes it's not all about her. I know I am not the only one who is getting tired of her. I hope she knows that the one's supporting her are ready for her to be the bigger person, and let the other ladies shine as well. She's constently talking about God. She better stop before lighting strikes, God don't like ugly. What happened with her girlhood friends that were in the group as well? I think she should be ashamed of herself for that, just remeber what goes around comes around. She better hope the girl's new group they are getting together (angel), doesn't come back to haunt her and her ratings in the music biz. Oh, and to tlcnspace. Good job, so funny. TLC is better. And their never ending loyalties to eachother makes DC look even sadder. I hope to hear more from Michelle and Kelly, before they get tired of Beyonce's crap and leave.
