Hitch-hiking around Luxemburg when younger,one clear,crisp Autumn, i was struck by the extremely pleasant rolling hills and the colours of the woods.A surprisingly pretty little country, i thought.I came across Vianden,a small town in a lovely setting by a river,overlooked by a castle.Stayed at Echternach,another very attractive,(typically)clean town by the German border.Luxemburg city stands by a gorge,an impressive,unusual setting.A prosperous country,with its own identity;certainly not an anonymous extension of its better-known neighbours,and definitely worth a visit in its own right.A well kept secret.,so discovery seems more personal.
