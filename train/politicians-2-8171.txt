To start off addressing the popular love affair with John F. Kennedy, he is primarily loved and given so many passes (like Clinton) because he was the first president of his generation. Objectively, he was a largely failure. The Bay of Pigs was an embarrassment (whether the administration encouraged or planned the action or not). Kennedy brought us closer to nuclear confrontation (ie the Cuban Missile Crisis) than at any other time in history, and this could have been avoided if the missiles in Turkey would have been negotiated away in secret. He took us deeper into Vietnam (though whether this was a poor decision in foresight is debatable). Even his moon challenge was designed to militarize space, which was later eschewed via treaty. Finally, JFK claimed that there was a missile gap with the Soviets to get elected when he knew differently knowing the Nixon could not reveal the truth without disclosing the existence and effectiveness of the U2 missions. On the plus side, he did invigorate the younger generations to take an interest in politics, he lowered the draconian tax burden, and he established the Peace Corps (though a domestic version should have been established as well). The bottom line is that John F. Kennedy had some rather substantial failures, he did not even serve a complete term (though due to no fault of his own), his primary challenge should have been avoided, and his achievements seem to be tainted or incomplete. I would speculate that JFK would not recognize the Democratic Party today, though he would most likely remain a moderate Democrat.
