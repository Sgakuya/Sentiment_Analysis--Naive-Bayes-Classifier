I am a 1st generation Cuban-American whose parents left Cuba to escape tyranny. Castro is a totalitarian dictator. He does what is in the best interest of himself and his petty feud with the US. I believe that we should trade with Cuba and drop this embargo. The quickest way for him to get out of power is if the people realize that Castro has left them worst off than they were before. Communism breaks down peoples spirits. All of this talk about Cuba having better health care than Sweden is baloney. Cubans are not free to decide what they want to do with their lives, they cannot worship freely fully as of yet, and they still have their lives controlled 24/7 by big brother Castro and his cronies, whom by the way live nice lives while his people are malnutritoned. Freedom will go a long way in Cuba because we are the entrepreneurial people in the world. Bastista was a dictator, Castro has been a RUTHLESS dictator. Democracy needs to be given a chance in Cuba.
