His character has been parodied so much that the parody has become better known than the original character. But the things that the mimics pick up on are not even the things that were funniest about him. Those who take the time to watch the original films will see much more than the stereotype that has become popular. He played a man reacting to pomposity and the injustices of life with humor. His subtle, sarcastic comments he mumbled below his breath were hilarious. He also understood the importance of having an element of tenderness in the presumably callous character that he played. It's A Gift (1934) and Man On The Flying Trapeze (1935) are two of my favorite movies of all time.
