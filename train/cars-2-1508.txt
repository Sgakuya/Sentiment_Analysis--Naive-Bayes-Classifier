Buyer Beware!! After purchasing this car, I have had it in the shop a half dozen times for dashboard rattles, grating brakes, and other bugs. I fear that the sporty style conceals a cheaply made economy car. If you are intent on purchasing this vehicle, I suggest that you take special pains to examine the vehicle before purchase. That glitzy dashboard hasn't proved very substantial; unless I'm riding over perfectly smooth roads, the rattle is very apparent. Test the brakes by pressing them down all the way--as you would do backing on an incline. My dealer claims they are functional, but they regularly produce a horrible grating, the likes of which I have never experienced in a new vehicle. What will be next?
