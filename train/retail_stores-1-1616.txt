This store was great but lately what the heck happened to them? They are so overpriced. I went to their electronic department looking for a new TV and couldn't believe how expesive they were. I shop around and know reasonable prices and got the TV I wanted for 200.00 less at Circuit City. I looked for a new cd player for my truck there and found one that they said was the newest state of the art for 350.00, I went to Crutchfield and got one that even had mp3 player on it with xm radio connections for 100.00 less and they were the same brand. plus free instructions and hardware.I saw the state of the art radio on sale for 175.00. There tires are overpriced too. Just shop around and you can always beat their prices. I used to be a die hard Sears fan too. I have noticed that most of their employees have no clue about the merchandise they are selling but always are ready to give you a sears credit card.
