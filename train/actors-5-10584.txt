Drew Berymore is a outstanding actor. she has preticipated in so many films such as riding in cars with boys, never been kissed and others, she can be a comidian, she can really convince you that she is really in that situation. I do recomend you seeing some of her movies. take my word for it. she is one respectibal, intellagentsupurb actress and she in unmisktakeably meant for her line of work. I love all of Drew Barymores movies and I will always think, even if she preticipated ever, (in the past or the futre) in a sucky movie, to me she would still be the best actor for the job. I totally recomend you see some of drew barrymores movies and wqatch how well she acts and I'm sure you will agree she is a marvoulouse actress.--:-) Tootles SexyMeow
