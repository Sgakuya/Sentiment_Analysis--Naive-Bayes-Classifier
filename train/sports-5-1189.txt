He gets 5 stars from me based solely on his performance in last night's historic Game 5 against Oakland. When Williamson walked the first two batters to open the ninth with the Red Sox clinging to a one run lead, everything indicated that the Red Sox were going to have their hearts broken again. The Curse of the Bambino was looming. 49,000 people were on their feet and screaming. I was one of those 49,000, and I can tell you at that moment, the Oakland Colliseum was as loud as I have ever heard a pro baseball venue. You could see in the body language of the Red Sox fielders that the team was all but beaten. So 6 foot 7 Derek Lowe strides in, a pitcher who had already started and relieved a game in the series, and tried to do what no one has been able to do for the Red Sox since the early part of last century - close out a playoff series. With the crowd going absolutely bananas, Ramon Hernandez was able to get a perfect bunt down, moving the runners to second and third with one out. Than Derek Lowe, with 90 years of history and 40,000 rabid fans against him (the 9,000 or so were for him), proceeded to strike out the next two hitters looking. For one series, this lanky pitcher with a plus 4 ERA turned into an absolute stud. Should the Red Sox go on to win the series, this man will go down in Red Sox lore with Bucky Dent, Billy Bucks, Yaz, etc. Unbelievable game, unbelievable performance by Lowe.
