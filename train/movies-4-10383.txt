 Working Girl is a movie I love to hate. It's so awful in so many ways that I actually enjoy watching it. Melanie Griffith, no doubt one of the worst actresses of all time, is in top form in this movie. Her little-girl voice, terrible acting, and silly expressions just drive me nuts. The other actors and actresses who revolve around Melanie Griffith's character are just as bad, including Harrison Ford (her business partner and love interest), Sigourney Weaver (her ice-queen boss), and Joan Cusack (her big-haired, loudmouthed friend). Throw in a ridiculous plot (a secretary becomes a top executive in a few weeks), and you've got the picture. If you haven't seen Working Girl, rent it just for the fun of ridiculing it.
