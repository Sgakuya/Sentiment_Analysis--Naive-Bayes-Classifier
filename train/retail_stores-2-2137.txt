Give us a break...yeah company is trying to be profitable name one that isn't?! Secondly, be nice to the employees, yeah you have the occasional idiot that should have never been hired but there are mostly good employees that will go out of your way to help the customers that come in without a clue what they want or need and expect the employee to know off hand. It's called RESEARCH!! Figure out what the hell you want BEFORE youcaome in with a lame explanation or don't get pissed off when the employee doesn't have a clue as to what the hell you are looking for. It's not that the employees are stupid but that the consumer is too lazy to research or read the little booklet that comes with every product called an OWNER'S MANUAL!!!!!!!!!!!!
