What's excellent: The pizza, the architecture Wrigley Field, Lincoln park. What's good: The people, the cleanliness of the city. What's bad: Too concrete. If I were to live there, definetely Lincoln Park would be it. Hip young crowd, DePaul's there, and you're right next to the beach and a great social scene. I would get into trouble in the long term though I can tell. People Drink. I'm not talking San Francisco style, a glass of wine and a mojito and you're in bed at 1am. This place is hard core, beer slamming, vodka downing type of place, hammered at 3 and then off to the after hours bar that serves till 5.
