I don't get it... why do so many people say that all J.J. can do is shoot threes and free throws. you-cantrunwithus, what do you mean he can't play defense? Have you watched him lately? He can shoot a three (miss it rarely) come back, steal the ball from you and take a lay up. How can anyone say that is one sided? I've seen some incredible defense out of that kid! I think that everyone who isn't a Duke fan is just blind, because they hate the fact that Duke is so good. Yes, UNC has the better all around team this year... but where have you been the past ten years? And look at what Coach K has done with this team this year. A team that wasn't expected to do much at all... it just infuriates me that so many people are just plain Duke haters. I've been a fan for over 20 years now... it really gets old hearing what people say about them.
