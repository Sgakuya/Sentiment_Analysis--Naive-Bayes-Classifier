Sorry to start off sounding completely ditzy with this one - but George Clooney is one absolutely gorgeous male specimen! I ve thought this ever since he showed up years ago in the final episodes of Facts of Life . In interviews he does come across just ever so slightly impressed with himself but his good-natured sense of humor easily overcomes it. I think the thing that is most attractive about him is that impish Irish gleam in his eyes - as though he is always ready to crack a joke or do something silly and off center. As an actor, he will never be an Olivier or a Brando, but I really kind of doubt he s aiming for that kind of comparison anyway. He is, however, a very decent actor who has really grown over the years and is successfully finding his way from the small tube to the big screen. Not something every actor can boast on his resume.
