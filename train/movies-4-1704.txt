I definitely enjoyed this film, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype (some called it the best movie of the year). The fight scenes were incredible and well worth the ticket price by itself. The cinematography was also quite good as some scenes took on an almost epic feel to them. Yet, the story just didn't do it for me. The acting seemed strong, but that was hard to truly guage since the movie was in Chinese and my Mandurain is not as good as it used to be. Overall, I would recommend this picture, but not as whole-heartedly as others might - like Benjamin, for example (by the way, is anyone else a little freaked out by this guy Benjamin. Check out some of his comments on the site and you'll know what I mean).
