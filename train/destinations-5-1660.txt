A country of a mere few million (smaller than most North American cities) has such a cultural presence that it is has been responsible for and/or influenced the likes of Bob Marley, Lee Scratch Perry, Peter Tosh, Colin Powell, Marcus Garvey, Lee-Chin (300th richest person in the world and the Richest black man in the world who resides in Canada) and thousands others. What we call hip-hop or rap would not exist if not for Jamaica. About 70% of hip hop pioneers had Jamaican backgrounds as did those who were behind Miami Bass, dub reggae and jungle music. There would not be The Clash, The Police and other so-called American/UK staple points. The bass sound is a Jamaican obsession. Plus all the universal slang expressions that originated in Jamiaca. Also, jerk chicken, patties, and all the other amazing food from this small island. There is not a place in the world where people will not know of Jamaica and Jamaican style - Love it or Hate it. If North America would just give up on their hypocritical non-sensible 'war on drugs' and just 'legalize it' already and stop exporting their deadly cancer-sticks, Jamaica would be deservingly rich too. Nuff said.
