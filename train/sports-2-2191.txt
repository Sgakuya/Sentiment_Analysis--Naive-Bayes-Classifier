Stick a fork in them - they're done. What makes this Phillies season so disappointing is the expectations that preceded it. New stadium. Big time closer. Big bats from 1-8 in the line up. A talented young corp of starting pitchers anchored by a veteran. Folks that know baseball were actually mentioning things like 'division champs' and 'world series contenders.' But alas, the Philly curse strikes again. Plenty of injuries provided convenient excuses for a team that just can't seem to step up, and seems more than willing to meekly fade away. I see big changes coming - Bowa and Wade should probably go after this fiasco of a season.
