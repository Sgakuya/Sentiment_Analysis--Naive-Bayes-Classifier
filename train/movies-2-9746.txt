I might have mentioned St. Fred's Day before. That is the patron saint of perverse curmudgeons. One time in honor of the holy saint we went to this chick flick. Now you have to prime for a St. Fred's outing. That means you must go to Murphy's Strip Bar and Armenian Grill and get a load on. Well oiled we went to the local roxy and did our usual thing of laughing in the wrong spots, groaning,etc. After the show was over, and we were reeling from this dreck, as we senior citizens were walking out, a 225 pound Amazon, wearing a muu muu went for us. Irv Garcelon tripped her with his cane and we all made good our escape!
