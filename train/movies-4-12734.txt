Seeing this movie made me want to move to Canada even more than I already do. And I don't know who placed this in the comedy category, but when I left the theater, I was not thinking haha, how funny . Sure, there are parts that make you laugh (like the cartoon about the history of the gun), but there are a lot of parts that you'd have to have a cold heart to laugh at. It's basically a documentary about guns in the U.S. and Moore makes some bold statements and does some gutsy things. Definitely makes you think about things (like how much fear is produced in the U.S. by the media...Bush's SOTU speech tonight reaffirmed this). However, you should take what this movie is saying with a grain of salt. I was interested in some of the facts presented in the movie and researched them after seeing it, and found that a lot of them were somewhat biased and tend to leave a few things out if they don't support the idea behind the film.
