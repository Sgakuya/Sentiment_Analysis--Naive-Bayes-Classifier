I originally intended to read a biography of just FDR, but this book got good reviews and looked interesting, so I decided to put up with a lot of tangents about Eleanor. As it turns out, she's a pretty fascinating character in her own right. If you're looking for a book that details FDR's presidency or his management of the war abroad, this book will disappoint you. The focus of No Ordinary Time is on FDR and Eleanor and how they managed the homefront during WW2. This includes the production of war supplies (a vastly complicated and wildly successful undertaking that turned the U.S. into the arsenal of democracy), the relationship between Eleanor and FDR, and FDR's management of U.S. morale, but it does NOT include much about the actual prosecution of the war. The real strength of this book is its portrayal of the complex relationship between two extraordinary people at a pivotal time in history. Before reading this book I didn't know that Eleanor had been so outspoken and (at the time) progressive on so many different issues. Some of the most amusing parts of the book talk about Winston Churchill's reaction to Eleanor's meddling in her husband's business. Churchill thought in most situations women should be seen and not heard, and Eleanor was rarely that.
