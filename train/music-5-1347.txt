This is, no doubt an important album both with it's content and to the band itself. This would be the last album R.E.M. make on IRS Records and what a way to go out! They convey their political stance so subtly but yet so in your face it's almost hard to believe. You can look at examples like 'Exhuming MacCarthy' and 'Welcome To The Occupation' and easily find reference to many political problems of the time and before. With that said, they still manage to show that they are not complete anarchic music machines but show a few glimmers of emotion with 'The One I Love' and (what should have been) the epic 'King Of Birds'. A Great Job all round!
