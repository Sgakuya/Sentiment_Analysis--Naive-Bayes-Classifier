Great school. I got a great job in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Management soon after college (1998) and I believe going to NC state had something to do with it. My career is still going strong and I must say that my job is a little more stable than other industries. Although my degree was in Agricultural Business Management and not in engineering, I still took a lot of science and math classes which has helped me tremendously in my job. Pharmaceutical manufacturing requires a lot of technical writing and thinking. This school does not "lag" behind in any fashion compared to the other schools in the area. I have several friends that I have graduated with that are lead mechanical/electrical/chemical engineers within their companies, medical doctors, accountants, F-18 Pilots in the Military etc. who are all working for good companies in NC and surrounding states. I believe NC state is one of the best schools in North Carolina and you should find a great job after graduation. But don't expect to be spoon-fed while attending NC State and don't expect it during your job search either. Because by the time you graduate - you should already know how to be independent, confident and a survivor. You should know how to write a good resume, interview very well and get the job you want.
