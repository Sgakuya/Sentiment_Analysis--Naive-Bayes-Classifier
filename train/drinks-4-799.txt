One of the best beers made by Magic Hat. Fat Angel is a nice mellow beer without the bitter aftertaste of some ales and none of the sweet fruity flavors that Magic Hat puts into some of their other ales. If you're ever in Burlington you should really check out the brewery as well, it's right downtown on a side street and you can go in just about any hour and take a tour. They also have 1 gallon Growlers that you can fill up and take home (with a deposit) which are not only cost saving but lend a nice mountain man backwoods, hillybilly sort of feel to the place as you walk out of there swinging a couple of gallon beer jugs.
