Clinton was pretty conservative for a late twentieth century Democrat, but overall a decent president. Compared to Reagan and Dubya, tied in my mind for the honor of worst president since Fillmore, Clinton was quite a prize. He had the political courage to raise taxes when they needed to be raised. His foreign policy was cautious, and generally did not increase the number of enemies America has in the world. Though he cannot claim credit for the entire boom of the nineties, he deserves at least partial credit for the last six years of it. On the down side, he was as ineffective as any other president in the Middle East, and his environmental record was spotty at best. Working with an astonishingly hostile and obstructive Congress certainly limited his ability to achieve his goals; for that reason, we shall probably never really know what those goals were.
