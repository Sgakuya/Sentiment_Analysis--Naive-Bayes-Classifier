Coach Sendek is a fantastic coach and motivator; he has a wonderful/caring relationship with the Pack fans. Many turn out for his live radio show. UNC, Duke, MD and Wake fans - and fans of other teams - show their respect on a regular basis (some even call in on Coach Sendek's talk show) and are grateful with what he has done for the Pack program. Coach Sendek does not jump into situations head first. Like his rebuilding process, everything takes time. His only liability is he can't slow his players down, they want to run and gun; they want to dunk too much. If he could only control this in his team, I look for some major program, like Duke when Coach K retires, to come in and take him away from Raleigh; pay Coach Sendek what he deserves.
