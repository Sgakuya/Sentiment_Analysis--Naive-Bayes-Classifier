I only saw Ryan pitch once, in 1979 at Fenway Park, when he was with the agents. I sat deep in the bleachers, and as he warmed up, you could hear the cpitcher's glove go POP when each pitch hit home. I had never heard such a thing before or since! Ryan lasted two-thirds of an inning and gave up 6 runs, I think 5 of them earned. (There were two dingers.) Twelve years later I was living in San Francisco Bay Area, and Ryan was pitching that night for the 'Stros. My pal, an old Army buddy, was supposed to get the tickets and pick me up. I waited in vain, and then later that night, he called and said I just heard on the radio Ryan pitched his fifth no-hitter. The sting of missing that was amerliorated somewhat by his sixth no-hitter, to say nothing about his seventh. Nolan Ryan was a pitcher equaled only by Sandy Koufax and Bob Feller in that going to see him pitch was a highly anticipated event as you might be witnessing history. That surely ranks him as one of the greatest ever.
