I really enjoy a Subway now and then. I also agree with several here that they can be a healthy alternative to the greasy fare found in most other fast food places. After all, this is one place you can truly build your own meal - so, what you choose is up to you, your taste and your will power. And, I'm sure there are exceptions, but since most Subway stores do a pretty good business, the ingredients always seem pretty fresh and the same quality as the deli meats found in most grocery stores. So, when you consider the large variety of meats, breads, toppings, and condiments and the fact that you are the one actually putting this thing together, then, if you are unsatisfied with the way it turns out, maybe you just need to choose a different combination.
