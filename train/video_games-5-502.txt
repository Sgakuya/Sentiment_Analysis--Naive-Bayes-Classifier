Probably the Most POPULAR board game in American history. A lot of you are complaining about the length of the game. When I was ten a girl friend and I used to bend the rules a little so that it was impossible to lose. I added additional money from the game of LIFE, which I never cared much for, and we played the same game for weeks just to see how rich we could get. In the end we were both millionares, neither one lost and we still had a lot of fun. Today I still play on gameboy by myself. It's great not to have to throw dice, calculate money or move the tokens around a board but nothing quite replaces the greed one has when playing with others. EASY MONEY was also a favorite.
