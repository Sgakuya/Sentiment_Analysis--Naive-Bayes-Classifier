Hawke has such an amazing skill as an actor that he is phenominal in nearly every role that he assumes. He choses his roles carefully, and puts an effort of 110% into those roles. He had such chemistry with Denzel Washington in Training Day . His performance in Hamlet was also wonderful. I couldn't think of anyone better for the role of Pip in Great Expectations - what a phenominal performance in that film. He was also impressive in White Fang and its sequel, Dead Poet's Society and Alive . The Director of Training Day said something interesting about Ethan: You can tell by looking into his eyes- there's a sort of darkness there that tells you that he has had a dark occurance at some point. Those eyes only helped his performances in Training Day , Hamlet and Great Expectations . Hawke is a wonderful actor.
