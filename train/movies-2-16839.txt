Maybe I'm being too harsh by giving this movie two stars, but I found myself irritated by its cheesy attempts to be deep. My expectations were pretty low (having heard nothing but negative reviews), and I paid nothing (since I saw it on HBO), but I still found myself annoyed that I'd wasted two hours on what basically amounts to a weaker, golf-themed version of A River Runs Through It, also directed by Robert Redford. The character of Bagger Vance - a mysterious black caddy who appears just in time to help Matt Damon's character find his golf game and compete in a big tournament - was upsettingly shallow, lacking any identity apart from his efforts to rejuvenate the life of a fallen white guy by connecting his golf game with a renewed sense of spirituality. A movie this predictable has to offer something in the way of memorable characters, amazing acting performances, great dialogue... something. And Bagger Vance just can't pull it off.
