As an Englishman and reading this site, I find it frightening as to how many American posters are STILL in support of Bush. The rest of the world can only shake their heads. I visit the States a lot and have only met kind, intelligent people so to see all the five stars for an idiot of a president just does not make sense. Update to eodrangeguy: I will continue to bash Bush until this dangerous and ill-informed man is removed from office- not for your sake but for the world's sake. (This is a website for all nationalities, by the way, so for me - you are the foreigner.) Government paranoia seems to be working in the public's collective mind, yet fortunately not all Americans are stupid enough to vote him in a second term. And of course we are concerned about the Muslims in our country...but bombing Iraq ain't gonna help.
