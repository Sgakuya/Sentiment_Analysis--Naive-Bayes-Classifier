TN is musically diverse. People who like Country music will visit Nashville (or the Sevierville/Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg area) and those who like Bluegrass will attend the Fiddler's Jamboree in Smithville on the 4th of July Weekend. If you prefer Rock, you can catch perfomances in Nashville at the AmSouth Amphitheatre (www.amsouthamphitheatre.com) and there is the annual Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester (in 2005 there were groups like Dave Matthews, Black Crowes, Joss Stone and the Allman Brothers). If you into harder music, maybe you'd check out Johncity's "Tennessee Metal and Hardcore Festival" or if you like Jazz you'd go to The Watertown Jazz Festival. As for outdoor events, Tennessee is filled with parks and natural areas. You can visit the Smoky Mountains, go white-water rafting down the Ocoee river, see the triple falls at the Burgess Falls natural area. Tennessee has tons of Hiking Trails, Camping opportunities, Fishing, Boating, Swimming, Horseback Riding, Biking, Golf and more; Check out http://www.state.tn.us/environment/parks/findapark.php for parks all over the state. Have you been to the pyramid in Memphis? or the Parthenon in Nashville (it's a replica of Athena's temple, but its a museum in Nashville). How about the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga? You can tour the Jack Daniel's factory in Lynchburg. If you like haunted places, there's Adams TN's John Bell Farm with the local "Bell Witch", Bellwood Mansion in Dover, The Parran House in Bolivar with a ghost in a rocking chair that can be seen on the front porch; for more, see http://theshadowlands.net/places/tennessee.htm As far as restaurants, it sounds like many of people haven't checked out citysearch ( http://knoxville.citysearch.com/, http://nashville.citysearch.com/, http://chattanooga.citysearch.com/, etc.). One of my favorite Greek restaurants is in Chattanooga, it's called the Acropolis, and they have superb lamb kabobs!
