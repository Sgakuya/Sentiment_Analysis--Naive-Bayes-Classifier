Although I may be a little biased, being a huge Pitt fan, let me share why I think that Tony was one of the best college RB's of all times. He was FAST. He was quick to the hole sure, but what seperated him from the others I've seen is how fast he was to the outside. In 1976, I went to 3 or 4 of the home games at Pitt Stadium and in those days, college football had the hash marks wide on the fields, not towards the center like the pros. When the play went out of bounds on the right, the next play was set on the right hash. The other teams KNEW Tony was coming on a sweep to the left and put two, sometimes three guys out waiting for him. With his quickness and speed he usually turned the corner for big gains. I think he had over 200 That's why Tony had such great numbers, won the Heisman Trophy and why Pitt went undefeated and won the National Championship in 1976. Tony was the greatest college RB ever. Of course, I say college player, because when the Steelers didn't get him in the draft and he went to the hated Cowboys, I lost a little interest.
