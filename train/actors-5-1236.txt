Perhaps the greatest living actor today, Robert Deniro will always be known for his gritty performances. From his memorable portrayal as young Vito Corleone in 'The Godfather' to his humorous portrayal as a mobster in 'Analyze This', Deniro has the range of few others in Hollywood. But perhaps his greatest role was in Martin Scorsese's disturbing masterpiece, 'Raging Bull' as Deniro's Jake Lamotta was too real for many viewers. His celebrated transformation from killer boxer to bloated nightclub owner/personal wreck can only be reinforced as he became the despicable Lamotta through a staggering weight gain of sixty pounds. A method actor? Yes, but he is more than that. Deniro is an acting god and legend who can potentially win the Oscar for best actor year in and year out with any role.
