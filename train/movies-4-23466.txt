This was a pretty good movie it was suspensful at some scenes. I was hoping for the movie to have more suspense in it and the aliens were not even scary looking but other than that it was good. It starts out with weird things happening like the signs appearing in the cropfield and than more kept happening until the aliens are invaded the houses and killing people so they can take over the land. Mel Gibsons characters family needs to go upstairs after hiding out in the basement all night. They think all the aliens are gone now so they take their chances and go upstairs but there is a surprise waiting for them. I liked this movie it gave me something to do. The thing is that signs is like the war of the worlds.
