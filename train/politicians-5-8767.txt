yes kipprabbit, look no further than the documents given to bush that he ignored. quite frankly i don't care about clinton's personal life, as long as hes got the country under control, and i think we were in far better shape during his presidency than our current status Oh and jaws, yea clinton really blew something up for the sole purpose of drawing attention away from himself. You sound like the conservative michael moore **Update- oh yea thats liberals for ya, no morals, let us bow down to you conservatives bc you never cheat on eachother or gay bash or discriminate in general or participate in corrupt business practices. Shine on conservatives for you are the only thing that keeps our world from going morally bankrupt
