I have never been able to wear an underwire even though I have larger than normal breasts. The underwire would never fit my breasts properly and would poke me in the underarm. At the age of 41 I went to VS and was properly fitted. I had been buying 42D and the saleswoman said I needed a 38DD. I thought she was looney but when I tried it on I was amazed!! I haven't wore anything else since. I admit that spending $102 on three bras that day was a bit much but I was happy. They also sold me on the Gentle Affection laundry soap. That stuff smells FANTASTIC!!! As soon as I got home I went to Ebay and found VS bras for much less and have purchased sseveral. The racerback bras don't fit the same as the others and none of the Ebay ones fit as well as the first one I tried on in the store. I don't know about the rest of their products but I will never wear anything but a VS bra again. THANK YOU, VICTORIA'S SECRET!!!
