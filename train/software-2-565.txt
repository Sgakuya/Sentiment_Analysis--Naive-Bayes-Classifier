MS Publisher is attractive to people who don't want to design their own stuff. For those who are not content to be represented by off-the shelf, generic designs and want to design their own materials, the going is rather slow and tedious. Still one can develop useful and nicely laid out designs, but only if you plan to print them from your own printer and/or to mass print by means of a copy machine. God help you if you want to give your design to an offset printer to be published. I live in Houston, a pretty large city by most anyone's standards. Two hours with the yellow pages and a phone locate only one printer willing to print from my Publisher 2000 file. And it turned out he had to first import the publisher file into Correll Draw before he could print to the photographic film that is used as the offset master. As a result, a lot of formatting was lost and proof as hard as I could, I still missed 3 minor errors. Very unsatisfying.
