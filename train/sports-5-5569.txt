He is the most dazzling ball handler in America. Also, he played virtually every second last year, and now he has a backup, so now Carolina's large leads won't be blown when he gets fatigued. I truly believe that in 15 or so years, people will look upon Felton as a legend, much like middle aged citizens of North Carolina presently look at Phil Ford. That is a bold statement, ..............but I can't articulate it, I can only say, JESUS, did you see what Felton just did! I can't articulate it.............he is just soooooo good. I mean that in an objective way.................if you look up 'amazing point guard' in the dictionary, you will see a picture of Felton. And that STILL doesn't do him justice.
