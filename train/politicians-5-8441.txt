Given the ultra-liberal/socialist political environment of Hollywood, it is really interesting that the only American actor to ever become President ran as a conservative Republican. What is even more ironic is that he was also the governor of California and the US President credited with the implosion of the Soviet Union. Reagan was a political inspiration for me as a kid growing up in the 80's. He was the master of diffusing a loaded question in debate - he lived up to his reputation as the Teflon president. His charisma has yet to be matched in the Republican party. I recommend watching the 1980 and 1984 presidential debates against Carter and Mondale to get a taste of Reagan and see how he dominated the camera. Then watch the 1996 town meeting debates between Clinton and Dole. Dole tries desperately to imitate Reagan.(makes you cringe)
