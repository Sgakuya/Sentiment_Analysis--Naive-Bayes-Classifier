Like most Presidents, he had his good and bad points. He tried to stack the Supreme Court in his favor, a move which blew up in his face, and a lot of the alphabet programs he started bordered on socialism, and maybe even crossed the line. Still, he did lead America thru most of the Secind World War, but left his VP out of most of the planning, so when HST took over, he was woefully unprepared. Lckly, the war was heading towards a conclusion, so the lack of preparedness really didn't effect the efoort much. It seems that either you like the guy or hate him, and this is especially true among the older generations who remember him best.
