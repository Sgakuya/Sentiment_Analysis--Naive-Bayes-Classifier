I don't think most people realize the huge number of functions and uses this program has. This is not just a dinky little program to use for slide shows. It is a powerful, professional level piece of software that has the ability to utilize sound, animation, has many transitional effects and can handle the insertion of animated graphics. I have used this to create many presentations used in educational TV productions in the past. Part of my current job now is the management of a cable access channel on which I continually run public service announcements, which I create and run ala PowerPoint. And the result is a much more interesting and less expensive presentation than the character generated PSA's we once ran. I couldn't do without it and consider it to be well worth the money!
