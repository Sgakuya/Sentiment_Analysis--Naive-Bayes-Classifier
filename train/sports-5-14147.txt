A bad guy. . .treats women like the Marquis de Sade. . .and don't start with his comminuty service - you can't get credit for helping gang members while hitting women, it doesn't cancel out. Back to football- Brown racked up numbers in 9 seasons (with less games) that are still mind-boggling. He left the game in the prime of his career. He racked up all those yards while defenses were simply stacked against him. . .Jim Brown was one of the great forces in the history of football. Best quote from a retired NFL player who described 'how to tackle Brown' - Grab him. Hold on. Wait for help. That's enough for me.
