I highly recommend this drink. I joined this survey to help advise others how this drink has been helpful to my family. My wife and I enjoy the fact a XS Energy Drink and XS Energy Bar for lunch can make such a difference in our long workday. I have several health conditions this drink has helped me with, as I cannot drink sugar. The many questions I sent to them at info@xsenergydrinks.com were helpful. I cannot express how thankful I am that my children love the drink. I think it has helped them to improve their attention in school and performance in sports without a doubt. We have added the XS Protein Shake and once again found it to be the best product of it kind. I hope this will be of some help to someone looking for a product that enhance his or her familys life.
