I cannot rate this movie drastically my take on the movie was that it did a great job in introducing The Xmen to the big screen I don't think they meant to try an out do a John Woo film(fighting choreography) if you know allot about the xmen you would this was not a very easy film to make I think the producers took an already cult following and gave it an rebirth into a more human aspect of life doing this I realize was not easy some things could have been allot better but how would you go about creating a new you out of you that already exist. synopsis good film it did marvel some justice in introducing a new band of superheroes to the big screen cause we know marvel wasn't treated so well with movies in the past and marvel do so much deserve the same respect that DC comics recieve if not more thumbs up to the casting of Wolverine, Professor X, Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, SaberTooth, Toad and Mystique.
