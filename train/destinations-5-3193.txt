I lived in San Diego for 25 years and just loved it. The only problem is the cost of living and the low wages. I never would have left, but I just couldn't afford it anymore. Moved to Tampa and let me tell you, there is no comparision(but they are doing a lot of building and improvements here so I still have hope) San Diego is a very clean city compared to other cities,the beaches are great,the weather is to die for, love the Gaslamp distict(downtown) and there is so much to do in that city, you don't know where to start. I miss it!!! Planning a trip back soon and taking my Tampa girls. It gets 5 stars in my book.
