I have lived here in New York for 5 years. NY is a great city. Yeah, people can't shut up about race. But experience will teach you that in NY, most these complaints about blacks is because many blacks actually have (admirably) attained a lot of power and influence and therefore, a lot of attention (Still, no excuse though. Racism in New York is just plain embarrassing). There are also some hard-working hot-shots here. This is a masculine-orientated city with lots of tough people (or at least people who act that way). My problem is not with the NY toughness either because again, experience will teach you that many people here are the 'tough and fair' types. My problem is with the scores and scores of people who walk around down here like their supermodels, with their noses in the air, when they look more like Roseanne Barr in a Deisel T-shirt. Arrogance can run a little high here. Which leads me to my point: New York may have some the world's top notch dudes but let me just warn any guys coming here. There is a little secret that most the newly-arrived guys have had to learn the real hard way: The money and the good job are absolutely here but many NY women, really just don't add up to the big-city hype. Do not be fooled by those superficial walks around SOHO where all the tourists and visiting models hang. NY is worth a thousand visits and even living for 1-2 years but don't stay too long unless you are really 'making it'.
