The only serious problem I've ever had with my '93 Civic EX had nothing to do with the quality of the car itself. The previous owner clearly had no idea how to drive a manual, which ultimately led to my replacement of all transmission and clutch components. And even then, these things are ridiculously easy to work on, assuming you've got a full set of metric wrenches and other tools - which I do. Outside of that, these cars will last forever if you care enough to not tear them up. And the fact that I don't get to spend as much quality time at the filling station as I once did doesn't really bother me, considering my meager student budget. And it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to make these things into competent little track monsters. In fact, I'm definitely considering repeat business and buying a '00 Civic Si when I'm ready to let this one go. Unless it's been completely trashed, you can't go wrong with the Civic. Otherwise, these cars will take good care of you.
