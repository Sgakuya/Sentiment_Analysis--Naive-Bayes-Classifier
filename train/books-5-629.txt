 Where the Sidewalk Ends, a collection of hilarious, wildly creative poetry by Shel Silverstein, should be on every child's bookshelf. Silverstein was one of the first children's poets to break all of the rules, and that's one of the reasons why children have been drawn to his work for over 25 years. For example, nosepicking and underwear, topics children generally discuss only in whispers, are joked about freely by Silverstein. He also had a wonderful sense of the absurd, as seen in Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout Would Not Take the Garbage Out and Sick, in which a child develops an impressive array of unusual illnesses before realizing it's Saturday, not a school day). I used to teach second grade, and Shel Silverstein was one of my students' favorite authors. Our school librarian once told me that she had to replace Shel Silverstein's books more than those of any other author because they got so much wear and tear. If you had the misfortune of missing Shel Silverstein's work when you were growing up, get a copy of Where the Sidewalk Ends and read it to a child. I guarantee you'll enjoy it, too!
