This absolute racism that has come to the fore in recent months is disgraceful. It really is. Chirac is a corrupt, egotistical, selfserving fool no doubt. But the language recently has not been anti-chirac it has been anti french. Very anti french. Racist.Racist. Disgusting. Any way George W Bush is also an egotistical, selfserving functionally illiterate fool. France did sell weapons to Iraq - but so did the US - FACT. Chirac had the guts to stand up against a nation which is getting too big for its boots. French Fries - Freedom Fries Ha ha ha. This is obviously the act of a desperate politician trying to score points with foolish people. He should be trying to focus on the damn economy.
