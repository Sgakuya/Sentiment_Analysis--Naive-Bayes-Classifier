Russell Crowe is a phenomenal actor, as is made apparent from several of his films, old and new. As someone who has been watching his films since 1992 I think he just keeps getting better and better. Might I also mention he is an excellent songwriter and in my opinion in a really great band with supremely gifted musicians. I have seen them live a few times in the past couple of years and as a live performer, he shows his talent in a different area. Sure as a musician, he is not the best but he is definitely not the worst either. I think he is underrated because he is a wet dream to thousands, if not millions of women...and quite a few men as well. Which tends to turn a lot of people in to fairly harsh critics. In all I'd say he is definitely worth a 5+
