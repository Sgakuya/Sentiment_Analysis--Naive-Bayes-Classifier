Just got back from about a week in Boca Raton. I'm not rating Boca as a beach destination as such (I only saw the beach there from the terrace of a beachfront restaurant), but rather as a Florida destination that happens to have a beach. Boca Raton (I often wonder why it was names Rat's Mouth) is a beautiful city - nicely laid out, a very nice shopping mall, beautiful (and expensive) houses, plenty of restuarants, nice roads. Prices are a bit steep (but reflect the overall upscale atmosphere of the area - lots and lots of BMWs, Mercedes, Lexus - you get the picture), and I found a disproportionate number of people in the service sector to be brusque and often rude. Drivers there (and in Florida in general) tend to be erratic, change lanes withut signaling, and tailgate too often. Overall, it's a nice area to spend a couple of days in, but I think I'd get tired of the drivers, the monotonous flatness of the area, and the uppitiness of the people.
