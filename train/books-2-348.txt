Not the difference-maker that it appeared to be at first, and on reflection, a bit thin beyond the idea of core competencies. Even there, the book neglects to explore this issue at the day-t0-day, real life level--the level where the decision to bring advertising inhouse, for example, requires far more analysis than merely asking the question, Is this among our core competencies. If the book did not appear so serious in tone and so well-thought out in execution--and that is an appearance to a large degree--its initial raves might instead have been closer to the tone of this review--pretty good, but of only some value in a limited area of business focus.
