I have never read the book that was written long before the movie was even considered, but I hope it's better than this. First of all, having not read the book, I was confused what the plot was of the movie. It looked to me as if it was just a bunch of people with long teeth running around and spilling bags of fake blood. Secondly, the movie seemed a showcase of rock music and not so much a showcase of the real plot of the story, as the author meant it to be. Third, the acting was only mediocre. Stuart Townsend definitely did not keep me awake with his pathetic glares and grimaces. Aaliyah seemed to be having a bit of a problem with the teeth being in her mouth, because her voice (albeit mysterious) sounded a bit lispy. Oh, and the eyeshadow they put on those poor, unsuspecting actors to make them look more. . .how should I say it--dead?--matches a color that I have in my make-up case. A nice, sparkly dark brown.
