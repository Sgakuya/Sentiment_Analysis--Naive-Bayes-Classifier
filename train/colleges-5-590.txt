The professors are extremely knowledgable not only because of their own formal education, but becuase they each have very unique and extensive experience in multiple fields of engineering. What also impresses me is the comradery (spelling?) between students - even those who have never met before are amicable and approachable. Our staff is also top notch - the ladies in our engineering office are invaluable. Finally, I must say that our facilities are very spectacular considering the relatively small enrollment. We have all new computer labs with brand new Dell desktops, all interconnected via multiple networks. We also have many materials/fabrication/testing labs with various types of specialized equipment that I can't even hope to describe in this short review. Our engineering school at KU is to notch. Email me if you ever have questions about it.
