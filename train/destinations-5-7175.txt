As many other reviewers have noted, Venice is a one-of-a-kind city. It can be smelly, especially during the summer. The Venetians are sort of rude and snooty, and prey on tourists. Prices in the tourist trap areas are outrageous (try the back streets or alleys for decent prices and good food). Don't bothger going during the winter; Venice is the coldest place I have ever been on a February night - hard to believe this is Sunny Italy on a night like that. All of that said, Venice remains unique and is one of the wonders of the world. Go on a warm day during the summer and just take in the sights and marvel at what merchants with money were able to do with it.
