I have a 2002 EXT LT-- its strengths are a very quiet ride, decent acceleration, easy suspension, and all of the interior amenities that my wife and I appreciate. Cargo space is sufficient, off-roading is easy, whether in sand, ice, or jagged rock (except the running boards get hung up sometimes).... Weaknesses include steering that's a bit too loose and a problem with the temperature gauge. I like the seat ergonomics just fine but some people don't think they're comfortable enough. I've read about other problems Trailblazers may have, especially with the electrical system, but I haven't seen that yet, after almost 80 K miles. I'll keep my fingers crossed, but for the meantime, I'd recommend this vehicle as a quality SUV. It's certainly better than the experiences I've had with other brands (except Jeep).
