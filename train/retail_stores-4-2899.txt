After reading all the negative comments on Whitehall,,I had to put my two cents worth in. My husband bought my engagement set from them and I just couldn't be happier. I have had the set for over 3 years now without any trouble at all. I take it in for the regular cleaning and it still looks like it did the day he put it on my hand. I have a white gold set, which I know has rhodium coating to keep it shining. I couldn't tell a change in it, but when I take it in to clean they always check to see if it needs a touch up to bring it back to its original state. So far I've only had this done once. As a matter of fact, we just purchased another ring from them in white gold, which is being sent off for sizing as I type this. I think the employees there are wonderful and friendly and not pushy at all. I love it. The store is in Raleigh, NC, so I imagine every store may be different. But this one is wonderful, I will alway shop with them. We have other rings and a watch and bracelet from them--I love Whitehall!!!!
