Truman is one of the most interesting modern presidents. Here's this regular guy from Missouri who claws his way into Congress and gains a little notoriety by exposing waste in military spending. Then a strange combination of events propel him, in many ways by chance, into the Vice Presidency under a quickly fading FDR. Truman hardly communicates with FDR in the months after his term begins, and then all of a sudden FDR dies and Truman finds himself guiding the most powerful country in the world during the most critical time of the 20th century (with little or no high-level knowledge of how the war has been managed up to that point). Here's this guy who was selling hats at a little store in Kansas City in the 20s, and now he's sitting across the table from Churchill and Stalin discussing the fate of the post-war world. He may not have been the most intelligent, dynamic leader the U.S. has ever seen, but look at some of the events he presided over: ending the war with Japan, the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the Korean War, sacking MacArthur... Whether you think these events are positive or negative, you have to admire Harry for stepping up and blazing a path.
