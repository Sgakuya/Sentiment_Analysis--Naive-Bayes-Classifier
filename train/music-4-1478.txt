INXS put out some strong albums in the early to late '80s and into the '90s that blended new wave, punk, dance, and good old rock-n-roll, and Kick was their most successful album. Lead singer Michael Hutchence now resides in the Rock n roll hall of shame because of his untimely, perverse death--had this guy OD-ed or committed suicide by some other means, he would be glorified. He was a dynamic frontman, and the whole band was tight. Check out those odd videos during their prime for proof. Kick includes their biggest hits--Need You Tonight, New Sensation, Devil Inside, Never Tear Us Apart, Mystify, the title track.....sure they had other albums, but most were good (Listen Like Thieves, The Swing) to uneven (X). This one does kick --- from start to finish, but I would rank their overlooked, experimental, Beatle-esque 1992 album Welcome To Wherever You Are as their truly best record.
