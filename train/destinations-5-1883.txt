Why are we so far down on the list? We should be #1. Maybe you people haven't figured out how this star rating system works. The U.S. is the most diverse culturally, socially, racially, politically, economically, spiritually, criminally, artistically and environmentally. We are the best place to visit. We've got everything under the sun. We set the standard and every other country follows. In other words everyone else looks to us to learn how to be cool. We are the educators of the world. We are the most blessed nation in the world and rightfully so - we deserve to be. We also have the most diverse land climates in the world. We have Alaska, Hawaii, The Grand Canyon and everything in between. Our artistic talents and products are second to none. Our politics are the best in the world. In fact they are so great that they've spread to other nations. Japan, Afghanistan and Iraq to name a few. We are the only country in the world good enough to create Rate It All. If you look up tourist destination in the dictionary you'll read United States! Oh, and we are the LEAST egotistical nation in the world thanks to people like myself.
