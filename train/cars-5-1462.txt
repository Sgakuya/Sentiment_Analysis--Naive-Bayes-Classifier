I bought the RL because I love comfort and reliability, and I intended to buy a car I could keep for 10 years. I have owned the RL for 3 years now, and I have not been disappointed. I use it mainly for city driving, usually on freeways. I am careful to do the regular scheduled maintenance. In three years, I have had no problems whatsoever. I bought the car at a good price at year-end, and it happened to have the navigation system, which I didn't think I needed. But now I wouldn't trade it for the world. It has bailed me out many times when I've had no idea which way to turn. I enjoy driving a car that will not leave me stranded, and heavy enough that I feel safe should I be involved in an accident. I wouldn't have paid the price, but inasmuch as I don't intend to buy another car for 10 years, it is worth it to buy quality--a car I will still be enjoying when it is older than most of the cars on the highway. I previously owned an Acura Legend, and it was still going strong when I passed it on to my daughter, after ten years and well over 100,000 trouble-free miles. Would I buy the car again? Yes, in a heartbeat!
