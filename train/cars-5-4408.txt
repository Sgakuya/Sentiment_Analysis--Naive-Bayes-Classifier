We purchased a 95 USED Windstar in 96 and drove it until 97,000 miles and loved it! We also had head gasket problems and replaced them. HOWEVER we also were informed via letter from FORD that we qualified for either re-imbursement for repairs OR we could opt for a $4,000 certificate towards the purchase of a NEW FORD vehicle. Well we opted to take the coupon, and we shopped via the net at local dealerships first and ended up buying a BRAND NEW 2000 WINDSTAR for LESS than it cost us for a USED 95 -5 years ago! Go figure! They gave us $4,000 for our used van, $4,000 for the COUPON and another $1,500 dealer allowance so in all we got $9,500 OFF a BRAND NEW Windstar and we LOVE it! We will definitely stick with this and as far as the head gasket problem it definitely was an engineering problem that the company has stood behind in our case!
