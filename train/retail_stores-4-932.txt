If you know what you like and you're willing to pay the price at A&F, go for it. Just don't overdo it and become a billboard. Yes their clothes are ripped and put through a vintage wash, but they are still very high quality and will last longer than your average Target bargain. The employees are also good looking, but usually less than helpful. A&F certainly has the marketing thing down, I have to hand it to them. The store creates a kind of sexual atmosphere between the cologne and giant models that dominate the walls. This is pleasing to teenagers, obviously, so don't knock the people who shop there or the marketing team involved with this money making empire. It's all about the money people, and just be thankful the clothing is of good quality, because it could be crap and people would still buy it! Their jeans have some cool washes and fits, and I own a few... but I payed way less for them on Ebay!
