Whose badder than Al Pacino.Nobody.Of the top actors he has been in many more great movies than most. The whole movie is often good not just him but that must mean that real inspiration is so often there.He sparks other actors who work with him to illumination.The man's got skills.He's so good sometimes he's almost as entertaining as some good music!Examples of that would be The Godfather Saga , Scent of a Woman , Carlito's Way and Scarface .These are in a class of their own:classic films. Dog Day and The Devil's Advocate are 'smokin'(as Jim Carrey would say it) but just a notch under paradise.People talk about what a stinker the third section of the Trilogy is(for their own reasons the opinionated hate Sofia C.).For a number of reasons I don't concur; for one thing it took courage on F.F. Coppola's part to take such a scathing rip at the church. The assassinations were certainly not bland and once again Al was brilliant cover to cover.Check out if you please the scene where he simulates a diabetic attack-complete with delirious ramblings. the guy is too good...physically,emotionally he is true. And that's what we ask of somebody doing his job.
