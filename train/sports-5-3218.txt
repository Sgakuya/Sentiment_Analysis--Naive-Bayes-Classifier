Though he is Major League baseball's most prolific home run hitter, he seldom gets props as a great power hitter. He was more of a line drive hitter, with some of his line drives going from Atlanta to Macon. True, he wasn't in the Ruth/Killebrew/Frank Howard mold of slugger, but Aaron was in that rare niche of a true 5-tool player (hits for average, hits for power, runs well, fields well, throws well). He flirted with Triple Crowns in 1957 and 1963. Though he never hit 50 homers in a season, he had the disadvantage of playing in a terrible hitters park (Milwaukee's County Stadium) during the early part of his career and the seasons were 8 games shorter during the prime of his career. He was remarkable consistent for so many years and was one of the greatest post-season hitters in history. Maybe Bonds is a bit better, but Aaron belongs with the Titans of the game.
