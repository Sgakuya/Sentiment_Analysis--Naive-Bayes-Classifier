Robert Downey Jr. has always impressed me as an actor. He has a unique presence as an actor- he's simply phenominal. I first caught wind of him when I saw the independent film Tuff Turf (1984), in which he played a supporting role. However, my favorite role of Rob's was in Chances Are . I'm a guy, but I really, really enjoyed that movie, and it probably would not have been so good had Robert Downey Jr. not been in it. I was totally shocked when he turned out to be the crooked cop in U.S. Marshalls - it was a total 180 degree turn for him, and I thought that he played that role VERY, VERY well. He has a unique intensity and dedication to all of his roles and he is a great actor whose once promising career is being thrown away. Get your life together man!!!!
