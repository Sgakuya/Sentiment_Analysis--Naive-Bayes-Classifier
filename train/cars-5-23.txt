have had mine since feb 04 (still 4 months before the honda even showed up at dealerships) have added full ct kit (junk threw it away, worst $600.00 I ever spent) A dr D slip on (best $285.00 I ever spent, so impressed I bought one for my son's raptor)pro flow k&n filter kit (very nice product) & did cam mod (very easy & free). I ride the dunes in mose lake, wa & have yet to beaten by anything other than a 420 banshee & a couple of other yfz's (have raced built predetor's, trx 450r's, ds650's, anything that would line up) . I took 3rd in a 18 mile cross country race my first time ever racing quads (this is my first 4 wheeler). I found it quite interesting that out of 44 quads on the starting line, yfz's took 1st -5th &7th-11th, there were only 12 in the race. trx 450r's (there were 13 that started) finished 6th & well I don't know, I didn't stay long enough to see them finish. Well any way the only problem I have had is my son likes to leave my key on & drain my battery, (after riding a friends trx I would rather pull start my yamaha than kick a honda!!!!!!!!!!!)
