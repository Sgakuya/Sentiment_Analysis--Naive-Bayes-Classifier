I have all of Leann's albums and I have to say that I like this one the best. I believe that she has grown as an artist and it shows, as she has gotten away from the country that she was, IMO, forced to sing by her supposed stage-father father. The whole album contains a little bit of pop, a little bit of rock, and even a little bit of hip-hop. One song in particular (Tic Toc, my #1 favorite on this CD) shows that Leann Blue Rimes is all grown up, as the song is basically about her newfound sex life with husband Dean, complete with moaning sounds. This is a must hear! Finally, this is one current CD that I would highly recommend. You will not be disappointed.
