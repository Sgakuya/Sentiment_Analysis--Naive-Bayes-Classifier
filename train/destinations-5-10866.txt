Cedar Point is my second personal favorite (Kings Island is my favorite).Ceder Point is alot like Kings Island. It is very beautiful and extremely easy to navigate and get around in. And,just like Kings Island, Cedar Point no longer has to have the biggest and tallest roller coaster in the world to be the one of the best amusement parks in America in my book. It might not have the tallest roller coaster but it has alot more of them and they are all extremly fun and fast and that's all I really care about. I'd rather have numerous 300 ft.tall roller coasters to ride and ride and ride and ride than to have a 301 ft.tall roller coaster to wait and wait and wait and wait to ride ! And,because there are collectively,so many more roller coasters and many more rides for everyone to use and choose from,I don't have to stand and wait anywhere from 3 to 5 hours in the hot Florida sun,just to get on and ride one time like I do at that one down in Orlando ! And,oh by the way you might try actually rating things by really actually going there and personally experiencing them in the flesh and not by rating them from unobjective,slanted and biased personal assumptions,opinions and predjudices made from the comforts of your home in some state over 300 miles away ! And,you know what ? Most people don't have and use 3 different Rate-it-all accounts,names and votes ! And,you would most definitely think that those who do would have enough forsight to cloak,disguise and hide these numerous accounts and submissions under different geographically and gender referenced names,so as not to draw attention to the fact that they are cheating the system,to promote and inflate another amusement park's overall value and point rating status at the expense of degrading and devaluing the overall point rating and status of another park.
