Politicians are as phony as professional wrestlers anyway, so I say let's at least have politicians with some entertainment value. Forget all those slimy looking Dashels or babbling George Bushs', we need fake politicians who are fun to watch and at least good looking. And if they could toss an Arafat or body slam a fat Sharon, then all the better. Our two party system is a corrupt joke that has monopolized power for too long. But because the American people hate the harsh truth and would rather watch TV then pay attention to issues, they deserve a Jessie to make things fun and irrelevant. I think Jessie is a welcomed addition to American politics. Let's open the door to big strong good looking fake politicians and trash all those puny little ugly ones that have been forced upon us by a corrupt system. It won't solve any problems. but it will liven things up and make for good window dressing.
