Whoa, how is this not in the Top 5 of all-time classic rock albums? There is something wrong with these ratings. You do not have to be a metal fan to love this record. I remember doing the Power Hour to this record during the summer following high school graduation. There are no bad songs out of the 12 or 13 offerred up by the band here. Rocket Queen', 'Paradise city' and Mr. Brownstone' are some of the best while the rest of the tracks follow as close seconds. The album reaks of raw energy and a unique hunger by a band that is rarely found on a circular piece of vinyl or plastic. So sad to see these guys burn out and get old, but it happens to the best of us I suppose. Axl did not need to lose his marbels though.
