John Travolta has an amazing talent that is rare in Hollywood today. Throughout his career, he has shown that he can bounce back. John Travolta really impressed me in Face Off and Broken Arrow , in which he played the villian. I really didn't expect that he would do well in playing the villian, but he performed perfectly. He's pretty good at playing the hero in movies as well, such as he did in Domestic Distrubance . However, his best films in recent years in my opinion have been dramas: A Civil Action , The General's Daughter , Primary Colors and Michael . They were all great performances which showed John Travolta's depth and range as an actor. His earlier works are classics- he was wonderful in Grease , which served as a preminition of just how colorful Travolta's career would be. And his career certainly has been colorful. However, what was he thinking with Battlefield Earth ?
