My fiance bought my engagement ring from Whitehall Jewelers in December. A couple of months ago, I was browing engagement rings at a mall and one of the stores (not Whitehall) checked my ring and told me the diamonds in my band were loose. I immediately went to Whitehall to have my ring cleaned and checked to see if they would be honest or not. They, of course, said everything was fine and no stones were loose. I was very upset that they had lied to me, and decided I was going to get a second opinion at a reputable jewelry store outside the mall before I did anything. Last night, I got a second opinion. Not only are ALL the diamonds in my band loose (you can hear them if you shake the diamond by your ear) but my center stone is crooked!! I am SO upset. I do not trust these people farther than I can throw them. I really just want our money back and would like to get a ring from somewhere I can trust, but I am sure I will have no luck with that since it has been 6 months since we purchased it. They are dishonest and I would recommend not buying any expensive jewelry from there. They are also extremely overpriced from some of the more reputable jewelers in my area. They wanted me to pay $1500 for a .25 carat platinum wedding band. For a .56 carat platinum wedding band from a much more respected jeweler, I will be paying $700-800.
