its so funny reading these comments. there all so different. some people say that its clean some say its dirty. some say the people are nice some nay. i think that shows how diverse this city is. i live here and i know this is the best city in the world. yes it is really dirty and there is alot of crime and your car will probably get stolen if you come here. so dont come here this city has enough people already. just kidding you can come here but your car will still probably get stolen. but you can choose from more pho restaurants than if you were in vietnam, and the girls are hotter than in your home town. and yup we are smug, but we cant help it , you would be smug to if you lived here. there are beutiful beaches caressing a huge bay linned with twinkiling lights of the city and mountainside houses. in the summer you can swim in the ocean and rivers. it never rains, and you can eat on the patios of some of the best restaurants in the world. in the winter it rains, but not as much as people think im not sure where that stigma came from but its not true. regardless you dont have to shovel rain! theres the worlds best skiing and boarding in your backyard, and in the spring you can go to the beach and skiing in the same day.(no bull shit cause ive done it. skimboarding in the morning snowboarding at night).
