Sorry but I have to disagree with these comments. Back in '99, I bought a '99 GMC Suburban brand new. Did all the service religously. At 40,000 miles (4,000 miles after the warranty ran out) the transmission failed. GMC refused to provide any kind of assistance in the repair. Cost me $2,000. My local transmission guy tells me he works on 1500 series GMC/Chevys all the time cuz the trannies are pieces of crap. He knows it, GMC/Chevy knows it but for some reason they won't put a durable tranny in the thing. Anyway, 3 months later the valves and lifters crap out. So...a quart of slick 50 later, I'm at the Ford dealer buying an F-250 Superduty.
