Our stay in Montego Bay was worse than Negril where we stayed at an all-inclusive. We stayed at the Buccaneer Hotel (mistake) which turned out to be a knotch below a Motel 6. Water pressure was almost non-existent. The motel is next to Sangster airport, so the jets taking off made the hotel vibrate. There is a bar bumped up against the hotel facing the ocean side and the music is very loud every day of the week until well after midnight. Light sleepers may not be able to stand the thump, thump of the music. Trying to walk from the hotel to Jimmy Buffets about a mile away was a total pain in the ass as the locals were aggressive in trying to sell you something. Telling them NO once wasn't enough. It took 3 or 4 NO's before you ran into the next one and then you had to start all over again. It can be intimidating for people not willing to put up a defense. Montego Bay is not the place to go when a person is spending hundreds, if not a few thousand dollars on their trip. Dwayne, Hollywood, FL
