If this is the rummy that I am thinking of' it is the only game I know outside of Hearts and Poker. Each player is dealt 7 cards. On their turn a player can either draw from the deck or the discard pile to form either three or four of a kind, or a suited run; players may also play off of other players' points. 2-9 are worth 5 points, 10-king are worth 10 points, and aces are worth 15 points. At the end of a turn a player must discard one of their cards. When a player is out of cards, meaning that they have made their last play and discarded their last card (as opposed to floating, which means that the player is out of cards and is not able to discard), the other players must subtract the points in their hands from their earned points. First player to 500 wins.
