Yes, I'm a student at UW, and spent close to two years there- my first visit was a good one because of aesthetics (parks, the four lakes, etc.) but in the long run, it doen't appeal to me as this city is not diverse enough and it is still a small town. I have seen the neighborhoods and they look too plain. The downtown area is starting to welcome more homeless on the streets. Of course, it does get cold in the winter, but the thing is, the temperatures can get dangerously below freezing. Furthermore, the major shopping centers are far and outside of downtown, but they do have a reliable bus service to take you anywhere. The city is too much like a college town and many people are ethnocentric. This town is not good enough for me, and I will not give up transferring.
