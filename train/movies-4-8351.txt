Directed by Penny Marshall, Big (1988) is one of the better films based on the theme of someone being in the wrong body. For the uninitiated, 13 year old Josh Baskin (David Moscow/Tom Hanks) wants to be big (ie a grown-up) so he makes a wish at a fortune-telling machine. The next morning, Baskin finds that he is 35 years old, yet mentally still an adolescent. His friend Billy Kopeche (Jared Rushton) helps him get settled in New York City until they can track down the machine and reverse the wish. Meanwhile, Baskin gets a job with a toy company run by Mac MacMillan (Robert Loggia). With his unique insight on toys, Baskin is a quick climber in the business which draws the attentions of Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins) and the ire of rival Paul Davenport (John Heard). In the end, Baskin must choose to stick with his new life or go back. What made this film so effective is that Big concentrates on only one juxtaposition while movies like Freaky Friday look at two. Moreover, Tom Hanks was perfectly cast as he can effortlessly portray a 13 year old in a mature man's body without much suspension of belief. In fact, I believe he studied how young boys acted in preparation for this part. The film also examined how confusing adult dialogue and situations must be to young adolescents. The bottom line is that Big is a smart, witty comedy that does not have to resort to slapstick or other tricks.
