Graduated from here. Awesome school, Big Ten level academics and athletics! Top 20 in private research grants, top 50 in overall research grants, top 10 in corporate research rants, hardly any program is below average! My own program was top 5 but I won't look past Wall Street's #13 ranking of our MBA program, top Sec/Elem Ed schools, top nuclear physics, oh I could go on! This is a great Big Ten school with much history and tradition and unbelievable opportunity. I've spent 4 years here and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone! I don't know what the heck Wiggum was talking about, but maybe he should do something better with his life than post 1222 comments and 6000+ ratings! Get over that inferiority complex there buddy, and I'd imagine you'd get a little demented after that much opinion sharing!
