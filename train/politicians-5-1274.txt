Popular with his people and among the greatest leaders of modern history. Its also about time that the majority of AMERICANS critising Cattro realise that the world does not relove around your country. America is only concerned with its own interests and uncocerned with the plight of innocent people, be it in Iraq, Afghanistan etc. If the Americans were so concerned with evil dictators, why are they responsible for putting most of them in power. Remember Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Nicaraguia etc. They only thing they are liberating the people of Iraq from is their oil. P.S. if you are so concerned with 'non-elected tyrants' why is Bush in ofice?
