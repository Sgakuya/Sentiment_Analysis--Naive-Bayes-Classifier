A BEAUTIFUL MIND is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Based on a true story of a mathematics genius stricken with schizophenia, this movie tells us the truth about the realities of life, physical and mental health. There is no direct correlation between mental retardation and mental illness. Some of the most brilliant minds in the world have some form of mental illness, and need psycho therapy, medication, and a socially supportive environment to function properly. There are parallels to the movie THE ELEPHANT MAN in this Russell Crowe film, as his character is at times unmercifully demonized by fellow students at the school where he fellowships. Crowe has an excellent supporting cast which includes, Judd Hirsch, Ed Harris, Adam Goldberg, and Christopher Plummer as the psychiatrist who works so hard to help Crowe conquer his demons. This movie has some twists and turns, and some surprises so pay attention. What you see happening at first is not what really is happening
