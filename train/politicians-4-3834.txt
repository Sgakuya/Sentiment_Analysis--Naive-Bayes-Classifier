I must say I support and will vote for Bush this election. The canidate I want to see in office is Alan Keyes, but America is not ready for him. Bush is by no means perfect, but he is more moral than . He stands for what he believes and doesn't sway with the public. Bush does not act when in public like , he is himself, and many people have pointed that out as flaw. I trust Bush much more than , whom I don't trust at all. Bush states his plans and acts upon them. , on the other hand has stated ideas, no plans, and has had eight years to act upon them, which he hasn't. I pray Bush will be elected in to office. We need a Christian who stands for their beliefs to turn this country around.
