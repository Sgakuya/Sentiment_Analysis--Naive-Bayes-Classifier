I really do not beleive in bad mouthing anyone because it just brings down both parties. I feel that the cd shows that they put in lots of work and truly tried to do their best. I do also beleive that they are good singers and are talented ( the group wouldn't be here if they weren't) but I do have one problem with the foundation of this group....Beyoncee. Obviously she has a good voice and even though her vocal range is not amazing I am sure with time it will be aquired. Unfortunatly she is definatly hogging the spot light. There are two other members 9use to be four but i won't even go into that whole drama) in the group who deserve equal leads( they work hard to, or at least try to). The blending of everyone's talents is what makes a terrific group not just focusing on one good voice. I think that shows some serious insecurities on Beyoncee's part. So in conclusion I feel that the album was very good but Beyoncee ( and I suspect her father as well) should get their act together before they ruin it for everyone involved!!!
