Salt Lake is pretty enough - set against the beautiful backdrop of the Rockies. Several friends of mine and I were visiting for a tournament, and we were donwtown and asked where we might get a drink. Look, I know sometimes people say that residents of a city are friendly or unfriendly. But this was unbelievable. We got a look like we had just asked for prostitutes. Worse, someone else *behind* them gave us the same look. I think religion is a good thing, and I have nothing personally against Mormons. But I think it's a little dangerous when a religion runs a city - and Salt Lake's a great example of that. Very insular, and a little scary. I have heard that the city is getting more cosmpolitan, so perhaps I should visit again. But I think that if I'm going to go see a city by the Rockies, I'd prefer Denver.
