Originally back in 1998 during the premiere album release the public had just heard 'Frozen' --a cold, yet hot, stoic, yet beautiful, track with grace and personality. This album had consimated a step into territory Madonna had yet to venture--electonica, which from the get-go Madonna had despised due to its cheapened trend of being a fad. According to her the initial intention was to change all that. Shortly thereafter I was able to musically absorb 'Ray of Light' --a very bright song with a sense of CONTAGIOUS energy, it being a rare combination of being fun AND whimsically dramatic. Wow.* It can be too easy for us to overrate something we all love due to opinion, yet from a musical standpoint-no matter who you are--'Power of Goodbye' for instance carries subtle, easy listening, narrowly diverse tones and utilizes them effectively creating a unique blend of numerous tones that harmonize eachother like birds singing to the glory of a spring morning in unison. To this day on occasion my ear passes through this intrinsic album--(defined as a quality of mystery and interest)-- that still remains as fresh today than it did 5 years prior. Good Job, Madonna--so why torture us with 'American Life'? lol* : )
