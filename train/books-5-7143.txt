Originally published in 1977, The Chronicles Of Thomas Covenant The Unbeliever (the first trilogy) consist of Lord Foul's Bane, The Illearth War, and The Power That Preserves. This first trilogy is exceptional, but the second trilogy is much weaker. This could be because Covenant is much more likeable in the second trilogy but also much more immaterial to the story. As others have noted, these books are for more mature readers than many other fantasy literature as Covenant is an anti-hero. For the uninitiated, Covenant (who suffers from leprosy) is drawn into a parallel world filled with people who draw power and energy from stone and wood, those who tend magical horses, lost seafaring Giants, restless trees and their shepherding forestals, sleepless and deathless super warriors (the Bloodguard), and benevolent Lords who lead them all and fight to preserve all that is good but are slightly obsessed with the failures of their ancestors. Opposing the powers of good are lorewise ur-viles, brutish cavewrights, and Lord Foul himself who is evil and hatred incarnate trapped in this parallel world. Covenant's appearance starts a chain of events resulting in clashes between the powers of good and evil outside and within Covenant himself. Donaldson succeeds in creating an imaginative world and good character development with an excellent use of color (ie blue, green and white) to visualize the clash of powers.
