Johnny Depp is one of our only great actors.I pity the people who dont see the very crazy and ecsentric person he is. he is wonderful and different.He would be the kind of person who could show you a good time (i know i have met him)the people who have never met him are also the ones i pity.He is a wonderful person and is very very nice! Not the kind of rude stuckup actor but a nice handsom polite man.I am also angry at the people who have poorly juded him and have never met him.Do not rate him be4 seeing some of his great films.sure he has had some flops but most of his moves are great and different and i thank him for picking some of the crazy roles and not just the easy ones love, ashley
