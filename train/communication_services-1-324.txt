This is obscure, Bell Mobility has been screwing me out of cash ever since I had the misfortune of falling into their two year, opps we charged you for THAT tomfoolery. First, I paid one invoice with visa, they proceeded to charge that same invoice on the card twice and refused to reverse it until I provided written documentation from visa saying, yeah it was YOU guys who messed up. Then they went ahead and used that number for my next bill, um THAT wasn't authorized. So, I get another bill early on that's pretty big so I'm like, guess I better change my plan. I changed it, Yes Sir, $45 for 300 anytime minutes, free evenings and weekends. Fine, but my next two bills come back just as big, so I call them. Er, um , No I'm sorry Sir that plan doesn't have free evenings and weekends. So, here I am, $100 down on Visa and rolling the dice for what plan I am actually on. Positive feedback, I've already made mine, went to Future Shop and noticed Bell doesn't carry my brand of phone anymore. But it s insured, or they have to upgrade it, so opps it slipped out of my fingers, playing the tune of their misfortune down 10 flights of stairs. Rating, no star at all, caveat emptor!!
