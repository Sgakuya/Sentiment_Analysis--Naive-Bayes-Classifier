I used to think she was a pretty cool actress, but her personal life lately seems to be all over the place. That's changed my perception of Angie because she's feeding off from it. Who cares if you're a homewrecker when you're latest film is at number one, right? That's the way she's carrying herself. Even when she's denying her romance with Brad Pitt she comes across as arrogant. Like who does she think she's fooling? I think that all of the tats that she's got on her take away from her as an actress. Angelina seems to have forgotten that she's a working actress and not a goth-ish porn star. I don't care who's she's f---ed but when that's one of the only interesting things about her as an actress then I don't think she's much of an actress. It just seems like she's a Hollywood kid who's using her acting as a way to work through her mental issues. She's used her personal life to add to her freak next door image. Frankly I think she's trying too hard. When you are really that weird you star in movies equally as weird and don't care how much they sell. But when you are starring in Hollywood feature films that are expected to sell then that makes you a poser. Yeah I know that she's out doing charity work and adopting babies in the third world. Good for her. But honestly I think she needs to fix her life before she goes fixing others. Charity begins at home. She can't stand her own father. How can a homewrecking, promiscuous and creepy woman delude herself into thinking she's going to save the world? Is Maddox going to carry a vial a blood as a way to show his devotion to that special somebody? Will little Zahara grow up to be just like mommy? I don't mean to be sound harsh, but I get tired of seeing that rich and famous people get away with doing things that non famous people would otherwise get chastised for. How would you react to a neighbor who was just like Angelina Jolie?
