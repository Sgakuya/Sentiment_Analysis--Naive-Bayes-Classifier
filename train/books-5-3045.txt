Up until I read this book, my favourite book was Brave New World because it was so thought provoking. I had not seen the film when I read this book and had read only about 5 King novels. When I read this book, my whole perception of what a good book was changed and I realised that a simple story such as this can instil life changing feelings. I have never had much of an opinion about inmates but I can now see from this book that they are humans like me. I can truly say that this was the best book I have ever read. Although I enjoyed the film, it was impossible for the first person aspect of the book to be portrayed although I still think they did a good job. I would certainly recommend to anyone who has seen and enjoyed the film that they should read the book as it will add so much more to it. And by the way, I want my own Mr Jingles! How cool would that be?
