Uno's is the best chain pizza there is, bar none. If you like deep dish, this is the place to go. I went to college in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and we used to get take-out from the Uno's there at least once a week. Then I moved to Chicago, and - even with all the other deep-dish options in that city - Uno's was still my favorite. Now that I live in San Francisco I'm really happy there's an Uno's right down the street from my apartment. They make a great personal-size pizza that's just big enough to really fill you up without being so big that your stomach is in pain (after you've discovered it's so good that you're forced to eat the whole thing).
