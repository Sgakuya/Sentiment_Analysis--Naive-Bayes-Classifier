The best thing about Nashville is its people. Outside of LA, I have never seen more great-looking people. The difference between LA's and Nashville's hotties is that in Nashville, people are genuinely nice. As far as beautiful areas, I suggest a drive through the West End and Belle Meade, Vanderbilt and Hillsboro and also Green Hills. Nashville is beautiful. I'd love to live there, but it is too far from the Northeast and the ocean. By the way, the BellSouth building is nicknamed Gotham and can be seen through a telescope all the way from the SEARS TOWER IN CHICAGO on a clear night!!! Wow....pretty cool, huh?
