I've only had my 2001 Elantra for 2 weeks, so this is a bit premature, but so far-I LOVE IT!I KNOW they've gotten a bad rap in the past, but it seems that each year they do more and more to fix whatever, and it looks as if they've gotten it right this time. Believe me, we did our homework! It comes with STANDARD FRONT AND SIDE AIR-BAGS,POWER DOOR LOCKS, POWER REMOTE SIDE MIRRORS WITH DEFROSTERS,POWER WINDOWS WITH AN 'EXPRESS DOWN' FEATURE THAT LOWERS THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW WITH ONE TOUCH,AIR CONDITIONING(no CFG'S),OUTSIDE AIR FLOW THATS FILTERED,POWER DOORLOCKS,60/40 SPLIT FOLDING REAR SEAT,AM/FM STEREO CASETTE w/4 SPEAKERS,A 2-level CENTER STORAGE CONSOLE,2.0-LITER,140HP,16VALVE DOHC ENGINE,OVERHEAD MAPLIGHTS,A LITTLE OVERHEAD COMPARTMENT FOR SUNGLASSES,3 POINT REAR SEATBELTS W/EMERGENCY LOCKING RETRACTOR AND AUTOMATIC LOCKING RETRACTOR,CHILD REAR DOOR LOCKS AND CHILD SEAT ANCHORS, AND A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER GREAT SAFETY FEATURES AND JUST PLAIN GOOD STUFF THAT ARE USUALLY RESERVED FOR THE RICH. It's got a GREAT ride (my previous car was a 91 Ford Crown Vic-which was a luxury car), and the ride is just as good, although the seats in the Crown Vic were, well, luxurious. But the ride this car has is INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE AND SMOOTH AND QUIET. We got a few x-tras, such as the keyless remote entry, which is great because its discreet-it doesen't make that loud 'blip'noise to let everyone around know that you have a car that you feel is or has something in it thats worth stealing.(I've seen some old junkers with keyless remotes,and all they do is call attention to the kick-ass stereo system inside, otherwise, who'd want it? The newer ones also call attention to themselves just cuz they're new- why brag about it?)My keyless remote is silent-the lights flash for a millisecond and you know its locked. Before we bought this car, we were renting cars on a consistant basis(the Ford was vandalized) We were able to drive just about every new model small sedan out there and between what we drove and all the recommendations we received on this Elantra, well,we did our homework and we are VERY pleased. Its a GREAT driving car, and for $14,000, it is AMAZING to have a car like this one. I'll be back in 6 months to let you all know how its working out. Till then my advice is--for THAT kind of money, and ALL of those features(ESPECIALLY SAFETY-I didn't even list everything),you cannot do better anywhere! (The de-frosters work GREAT when there is ice on the windows and mirrors as well.) I just can't say enough (yes I could) but I'd have written a mini-novel by then--this after only TWO WEEKS! (I know. I know...)
