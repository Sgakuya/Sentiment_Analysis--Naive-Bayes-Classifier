If you already have most of Clapton's best CDs, including his work with Blind Faith, Cream, and Derek the Dominos, then you can skip his box set. But if you're just getting into Clapton and you don't have CDs like Slowhand, Layla Other Assorted Love Songs, Blind Faith, 461 Ocean Boulevard, etc., then this box set is a must. Clapton, in my opinion, is the best blues/rock guitarist in history. Jimi Hendrix was wilder and had limitless talent, but he just didn't produce a body of work that compares with Clapton's. And this box set takes you through almost everything - his early days with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, his days as 1/3 of Cream, his experience building the world's first supergroup (Blind Faith) with Steve Winwood, his brilliant emotional work with Derek and the Dominos, and finally his emergence as a superstar solo artist. And, as an added bonus, this box set was released before Clapton started his annoying Tears in Heaven adult contemporary phase, so you don't have that crap tainting his older music.
