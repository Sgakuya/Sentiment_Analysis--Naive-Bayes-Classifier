oh cry me a river downwithamerica, seriously, you can really dish it out but your not owning up to any of your own homes problems. Sure America has its problems and methinks you do too, thinking millions should be killed in a nuclear holocaust, and for what? To learn a lesson?! What the...?! You say that would teach Americans a lesson, but the average American really has no control over their countrys congress in case you havnt noticed. The only thing that would do is cause the country to go off its rocker and bomb the crap out of Iran until its nothing but a smoldering crater, and Im not saying this happily, but that my friends is what would happen.
