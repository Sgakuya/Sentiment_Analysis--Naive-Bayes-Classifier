I recommend this album to those that have an emptiness no matter what it is. Like its predecessor, (Dark Side of the Moon, 1973) this album has aged with common as well as complex themes sandwiched with an 'elegant' ode to former frontman Syd Barrett. In this fine piece there is some sarcastic but poignant satire given to us by the dominant songwriting prowess of Roger Waters. If one would look at this 5-track piece and peer into its history and longevity in the collective consciousness of rock fans, one would know that it was difficult to surpass its record-shattering album before it. I'm but a person to look away from because of this rave however this is an album to cause delight wheither or not you come to grips with the main theme of absence expressed here. Just listen to it, the academy didn't give this a number one because of the members!!!
