OK this is what I wrote in March 2000 -- The Bears are going to be a playoff team in 2001 and a real contender in 2002. Young talent, good coach -- they're going to surprise the rest of the Central. -- let's update this by admitting that my playoff prediction for last year (when they finished last in the Central) was a bit off, but now I am going to be VINDICATED! The 6-1 Bears aren't invincible or anything like the Super Bowl Shufflin' Bears of 1985, but they have a confident strut all their own. After two incredible comebacks (14 points down in the 4th quarter, leading to OT victories on returned INTs), you have to say they're for real. Urlacher is the best young linebacker in the game, and you might say the same about Anthony Thomas at RB. Whether Jim Miller or Shane Matthews has what it takes to keep this team together is yet-to-be-determined, but I'm betting that the Bears will have a Super Bowl victory by 2004 at the latest! Now let's all join in a song: We are the Bears Shufflin' Crew / Shufflin' on down, doin it for you...
