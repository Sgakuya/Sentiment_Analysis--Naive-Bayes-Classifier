A really enjoyable film overall. Leondardo Di Caprio was perfect in the lead role, because he's eternally youthful looking and therefore he could pass for the 16 year old kid he was supposed to be and still make it plausible that he could fool all these people into thinking he was 28. Although the film was very funny, it was also really poignant as well. It's really the story of a young man whose family is very scewed up, and they don't provide him with what he needs. It's kind of sad actually, and the relationship that develops between DiCaprio and Tom Hanks (who plays the cop trying to catch him) is really quite touching
