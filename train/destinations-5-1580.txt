I believe Norway to be the most beautiful country in the world. Nature lovers will love the many snow-caped mountains, lush forests, beautiful lakes and fjords. Oslo has something for everyone. My favorite attraction is a beautiful park in the heart of the city. It has many wonderful botanical arrangements and it is full of Gustav Vigeland's statues. The city of Bergen is a very beautiful and clean city. Bergen is a wonderful place to go to explore Norway's history. North of the arctic circle, one can view the midnight sun in the summer, and the northern lights in the winter. Full of beautiful mountains, forests, waterfalls and fjords, Norway is truly Nature's Triumph.
