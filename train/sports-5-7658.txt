One way to rate a player is how dominant he was. Seriously, how many players in the history of the NBA were more or at least as equally dominant as Shaquille O'Neal? I can only think of four: The NBA's first superstar, George Mikan; scoring machine Wilt Chamberlain; the owner of the most dangerous shot in NBA history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar; and Michael Jordan. Now that's pretty good company. Not saying Shaq is one of the top five players in NBA history since dominance is only one factor that makes up greatness (one of two or three key factors, mind you). But anyone who suggests that Shaq isn't one of the top dozen players in NBA history should not be taken seriously. Pat them on the back and nod with a tolerant smile but don't take the Shaq detractors anymore seriously than you would an angry child throwing a tantrum. Shaq destroyed the competition. To suggest he was (is still to a lesser degree) dominant is an understandment. In his prime, he was the fifth fundamental force of the universe; a force of nature and a brother of tornadoes and hurricanes, of earthquakes and volcanoes. He was THE FORCE.
