Fascinating urban metropolis of 17 million people; my favorite city in the world. Good underground music scene, world class restaurants to fit every budget, culturally enriched, exciting sports, great parks, modern and efficient subway system, etc. Like any other place, this city does have it's problems (crime, traffic, pollution, poverty) and thus, can be fairly intimidating for the first time traveler. Therefore, a basic knowledge of at least some Portuguese is reccomended and will greatly enhance your experience here. As a brief stopover, without necessary travel information/prior research, one's first impression may not be the best, especially if one is use to the typical, popular, conventionally- beautiful tourist mecca ( Alcapulco, Rio De Janeiro, etc). So yes, it must be said - Sao Paulo is no beach resort; it is for the urban traveler exclusively! However, if one does some research or knows people from here who are able to show them around this interesting city - in all it's fabulous splendor, I highly reccomend a visit here.
