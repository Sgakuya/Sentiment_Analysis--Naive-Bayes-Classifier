Tough as nails on the court. Can carry a team all by himself (Which he has to considering the fact that he refuses to give anyone else the ball.) It may take Iverson 30 shots and 15 freethrows to score 30 points but, he is a proven scorer. What he does best is just force the other team to have to deal with him. They usually come up short. I don't care at all for his brash attitude or his horrible influence on kids, but on the court he gives 110%. Practice may not be neccessary for A.I. to be great, but he is the unquestioned team leader and (to quote from 'Remember the Titans') "Attitude reflect(s)leadership, Captain." I hope that he grows up some day. He really has a lot to offer, and his team will be a lot better as a result of it.
