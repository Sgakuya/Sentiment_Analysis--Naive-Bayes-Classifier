Delta's commuter airline Com Air left tens of thousands of travellers stranded over Christmas 2005. It was about 20% due to weather and 80% due to complete and utter incompetence. First they ran out of de-icing fluid, then their crew-scheduling computer crashed and they were forced to cancel most of their flights for multiple days due to the lack of any sort of backup system/plan. Worse, their customer service is completely incapable of handling these situations. You have to wait on hold for over an hour just to speak to someone from India. The employees they haven't outsourced are increasingly rude and indifferent.
