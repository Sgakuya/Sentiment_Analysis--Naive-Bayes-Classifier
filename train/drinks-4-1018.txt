Saranac Pale Ale is actually a pretty good beer. If I sound surprised it's because when I was in school I started to see Saranac appearing in the stores around campus and actually at one of the local bars, on tap. At first I gotta say (and I don't remember which style it was), I wasn't that psyched about it but since then I've had it frequently and have definitely enjoyed it. Light in color and flavor this is also a beer you can drink several of and not feel like you need to make a switch just to get the taste out of your mouth. A very good beer served cold and on a hot summer day. Not a room temperature beer no matter what the season.
