My experience at JIU is a great one because I feel that they really care about me and what I am going through with the courses. I feel that the people are friendly and enjoy talking to you when you have something to say. The Teachers are nice and very helpful and take the time to really answer you questions that may come up during the course of the classes. They seem to realize that everyone has other things to do outside of the "class room". The classes are the right ones that each student needs to take for the right degree that each student is interested in. All the advisors are very helpful in picking each class that each student needs to take for each degree. I realize that all the students and staff are all of different ages but understand this and try to help to make the transition from high school to the university. Then there are those who transition from the community college to the university. Having this understanding has helped me to transition into the university style of writing. I thank everyone for his or her help in getting me into the university and making my experience a positive one. There are to many people to mention personally but they all know who they are. I hope that each new person who comes to JIU has the same experience that I have had. This is one university that I hope to be able to return to for a Master degree to further.
