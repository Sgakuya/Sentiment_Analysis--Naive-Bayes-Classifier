Definately has all of the skills but hasn't been too clutch as of late. He seems to have a real good attitude and hopefully will learn to mature with the league that has recently been making a positive move into the past. For too many years, the NBA has looked like the slam dunk contast or a night with the Harlem Globtrotters, but the influx of superior foreign talent (who seem to have a better grasp of the fundementals of the game) is helping the league to regain it's past glories. Unfortunately, guys like Lebron are part of the problem. Even talent needs time to mature and college is the place where that used to happen. This guy is awfully skilled, though, and could end up being a good ambassador of the game.
