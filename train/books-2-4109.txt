This book was fine when it dealt with the Dresden firebombings, but lost it when it got into the ridiculous time travel nonsense. Face it, sci-fi is for kids and those of limited intelligence/imagination. Vonnegut, another one of those overrated pop novelists who had enhanced cachet during the days of the counterculture, has written better books than this one, yet when one reads his tomes these days, they come across as pretty dated. If you want to read something really good that deals with arbitrary temporal displacement (which is supposedly the crux of this book), pick up Cortazar's Hopscotch, which makes Slaughterhouse Five come off like Archie and Veronica in comparison.
