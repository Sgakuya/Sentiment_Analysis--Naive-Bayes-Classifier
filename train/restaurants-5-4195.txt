I work for Chili's and I've been with them for 7 years, therefore I tend to defend them very viciously! For one, Chili's is one of the few restaurants I will eat in because I KNOW how sanitary everything is! Someone said something about doing full hands in, full hands out, which is absolutely correct. However, you're supposed to use the hand wash sinks (located IN the dish area) to wash hands thorougly before you touch dishes; I guess that person didn't pay attention during training! I know the cooks are extemely sanitary and very competant. Sometimes the food may be cooked too much or not enough for each person, but can you imagine cooking for hundreds of people, with their different preferences? Try to make everyone happy! That won't ever happen! There are also several reviews here which mention items that Chili's does NOT make, and has NEVER made! I suggest that people get their information straight before leaving a negative rating in a public forum. Chili's is a wonderful place to dine, work, and relax.
