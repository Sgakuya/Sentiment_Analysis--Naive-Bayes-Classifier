I Love Rashad McCants! I hope to meet him someday! His tattoo means a lot to me so I made this one up for him! Born to be a Tar Heel, Dying to meet Rashad McCants! IF i ever get to go to one of his games I'm going to make a sign saying that and hold it up and hope he sees it! I love him so much I hope i get to meet him! If I only got one dream in my life I would give everything up just to meet him! Here is something funny, my friends and I make up who we are related to so I said Rashad McCants is my dad and I was going to go live with him when he is done with college! It's just a funny joke but i wish it was true! So i hope i get to meet him someday!
