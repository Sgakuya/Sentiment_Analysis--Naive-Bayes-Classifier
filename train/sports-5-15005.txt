bernie kosar was the best browns QB in heam history ,period . raise no questions or objections! he passed for over 20,000 yrds in just 8 FULL seasons as starter. he played nine seasons with the team but he missed a bulk of games in 1988 with an elbow injury and in 1992 with a broken ankle. bernie was a winner ,in his first five seasons he lead the browns to 4 div. titles and 3 afc championship games. not too many quaterbacks can claim that! he hold the record for most passes thrown without an interception (308) and was considiered one of the smartest quarterbacks of his era. he could read defenses with the best of them. he also had better than average arm strength . he has thrown PLENTY of 60+ yarders in his career.and bernie always played well enough in the big game . he left those games either in the lead or with a chance to win. in the 1987 afc champ game he put his team ahead only to watch the def. give the game to john elway (THE DRIVE)! in the 1988 afc champ game he got the ball with 2:00 left on the clock and drove the browns 94 yrds down the field only to watch ernest byner fumble the ball and the goal line (the fumble). bernie NEVER cost his team in the playoffs like the MOBILE quarterbacks of today like mcnabb ,vick or culpepper. he controlled the ball and made smart decisions which is why his career completion percentage is almost 60%. so the next time people say bernie wasnt that good tell them to REALLY look at the stats.
