K i know michael is the greatest and all, he brought adifferent perspetive to the gamecombined with natural talent, a passion towin,and the ability to rise asaplayer.There is only one thing i dont understandmj did. why did he have to go offending vince about him not being a great player, and then later tried to take vince away from toronto.Mj personally leave him alone on that, vince respects you, its time you respect him,he could have said alot of b.s on his part to you for sayin what you said. I hope your not defending your title as being the best thing in sports history, because seriously its going to stay that way!!!!!!There is no the next michael jordon cause there is only one true jordon and i was lucky enough to see him play. retiring what you love is a part of life, deal with it properly.But other then that love yah man.
