Typical Rate It All comment: I'm from a liberal city (see: fun, exciting, open-minded, diverse, intelligent) and we are so open minded and accepting of everyone culture and religion. I visited SLC and omigod! That is the most conservative(boring) place I've been to. Of course it's the only place in fly-over country I've visited-and I only went for my work. Everyone is so white, close-minded and boring, and worst of all EVERYONE is Moron, oh I mean Mormon, ha ha ha! It's the law there that all men have to have ten wives and they have to marry at least one sister or cousin. It's also against the law to drink alcohol in Utah and Mormons believe it's a sin to have fun. Did I mention that this town is conservative, and WHITE, how can a place be open-minded and fun with so many white Mormons?! As I walked around downtown (yeah right, try comparing SLC downtown to NYC or Chicago) everyone stared at me because they knew I wasn't Mormon and conservative. I asked one guy where I could find a bar, and with in seconds a SWAT team had surrounded me. Most of the people were friendly, but that's just because they were totally faking it so I could become one of their wives. Did I mention how close-minded, provincial, conservative and Mormon this place is?! Anyways, I couldn't wait to get away from those conservative, close-minded, white Mormons and back to my liberal, accepting-of-everyone friends.
