I really, really want to think that Cong. Gutierrez is really good and progressive and everything... but I just can't. It's totally impossible to find out what he stands for. Mostly it's because I've written him SO MANY letters (good ones, too) and I've never, ever gotten a response from any of them. It seems to me like they get the day's mail and just toss it into a trash bin. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but when the Illinois senators repond to my letters despite the fact that they represent the entire state and not just the near West side of Chicago, it makes me wonder. Also, sure Luis votes for pieces of progressive legislation, but it doesn't seem to me like he's out there sponsoring progressive legislation. It seems to me that the only things he sponsors have to do with immigration and re-naming post offices after various lefty historical figures. Immigration is important, but is it the most important issue for this district? Definately not. When we have a proto-fascist regime in the White House trampling the Constitution and seeking to wage war on any country it feels like, then I think we can put immigration on the back-burner for a while. Don't you think so, Luis?
