Great academic opportunities here, if you look for them! Great opportunities to get money to start a business or get a job in research or industry. If you want a social scene, Lincoln has great restaurants, the Lied Center, which has hosted (to name a few) Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, Gaelic Storm, Riverdance, etc. Rococo Theatre has Lewis Black, other comedians regularly. The Ross is an excellent theatre for independent films. Great restaurants in Lincoln include Continental, Indian, Mexican cuisine. Great people! (If you like sports, I don't need to even brag). Lincoln is an expanding, prosperous, and historically important community that is the birthplace and school of Loren Eiseley, one of the great writers of the 20th century (called the modern Thoreau by Rad Bradbury). Also, NU is the school of Warren Buffett, Johnny Carson, and other famous figures.
