Another example of the continuing slide of the presidency in the twentieth century, Clinton claimed he was a moderate determined to assist all Americans. Eight years later we see him for the true liberal that we always was, and pretended not to be. The attempt to nationalize health care, and the implementation of the social security number as a national identity card are two examples of his liberal policies. (Older Social Security cards have a statement that says, Not to be used for identification Newer cards do not have such a statement). If it were not for the Republican congress, he may have furthered the liberal agenda. It is unfathomable that the American electorate would actually support someone who violated his oath of office (His approval ratings increased after the Monica Lewinsky affair, even after he admitted lying to Congress). He has the distinction of being only the second president ever to have articles of impeachment brought up and voted upon. Clinton is a big disappointment that hopefully will be forgotten soon.
