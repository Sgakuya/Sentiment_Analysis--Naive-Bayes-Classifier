Resident Evil 1 or RE-make as it is also known' is such a beauty of a game that any fan of the genre or any game fan should play. Shinji Mikami, the father of the RE numerical series, produced his ultimate vision of the first chapter exclusively for GameCube. He wanted to bring the fear factor back to the saga and since he was the director of RE-make it sure worked! If you think the remake for GC is just the same game with pretty graphics, well you be wrong my friend. RE-make has a lot of exclusive content (the new Crimsom Zombies, for one thing) and details concerning the history of the numerical series (The whole Trevor tragedy storyline). Besides, the voice acting and the intro FMV is waaaay beyond the corny-cheesy stuff you saw in the original PSX versions. The plot is still campy, though. This game is a must buy and if you're going to play Resident Evil Zero, I recommend you play RE-make first 'cos plotwise it is a lot better to do just that. The game has nice extras like the usual but NEW costumes for the main characters plus a gallery of pre-production art and a special letter to the gamer from Shinji Mikami himself!!!! Buy it!
