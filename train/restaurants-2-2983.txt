I, too, work for Friendly's in New England. I joined not too long ago to become a restaurant manager and was put through their very poor training course. They say they want their managers to succeed and provide the best service and so forth, but the program is structured so that succeeding is hard. As a restaurant company, they are very confused. Like another poster said, they try to copy abunch of other chains. They have so much stuff on their menu and so many different types of dishes that not only does it overwhelm guests, but the kitchen, the service staff and the local management as well. In addition, they keep adding new test items and promotions to the menus and this makes it even worse. I disagree with the writer who says they are expensive. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than maybe a Denny's, but generally, their prices are very much in line with any other chain. As a company they need to either go back to being an ice cream parlor with some food, maybe something really distinctive and unique, or lose the ice cream end of things and stop trying to be all things to all people. That never works for anyone.
