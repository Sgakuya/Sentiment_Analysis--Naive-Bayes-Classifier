I thought things were going to be better this year. I paid about $350 for my family to all have season passes. That's no small change. After plopping down my $350 I was a little upset to find that I had to pay for floats to ride the water slides and go into the wave pool. Last year there were plenty of free floats and you only had to pay for floats if you wanted one all to yourself. The fact that they're required to enjoy certain parts of the park should mean that they're provided with the price of admission. I also decided to take a little break on the beach at the wave pool. I sat down in one of the white chairs that they have on the beach. A Visionland employee came over and told me that you have to rent the chair. RENT THE CHAIRS?! I paid all of this money to gain access to the park and now I'm expected to pay to sit down. I understand that its a business and they want to make money but honestly I think this is the wrong way to go about it. They may make more money for the moment but people will feel ripped off an not go back. I honestly wish I could just get my money back for my season passes. If you don't mind sitting on the ground or waiting in long lines to get the few remaining free floats in order to wait in another line to ride the water slides then you might like it. If you agree that the price of admission should entitle you to enjoy the water park then you might want to skip this place and go to White Water where they know how to treat their customers.
