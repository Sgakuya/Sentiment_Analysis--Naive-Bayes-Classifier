The Old Town of Krakow is one of the few original medieval cities left in Europe. With parts dating back to the 13th century, Krakow is rightly preserved high on UNESCOs List of World Heritage sites. Its heart is the Market Square, the largest open air plaza in central Europe, which around the year is filled with pavement cafes and restaurants, street musicians playing rock, jazz, classical, folk, klezmer - every kind of music imaginable, plus flower sellers, street theatre, free opera and classical concerts, stalls selling handicrafts, and seasonal gifts. There's always something going on here. Add to this Wawel Castle, the seat of Polish Kings and Queens for hundreds of years, Kazimierz - the oldest Jewish quarter in Poland, the Jagiellonian University founded in 1364, then the countless museums, bars, clubs and international restaurants in its winding cobbled streets, and you're looking at a city that needs weeks to truly explore. It's the cultural capital of Poland and a treasure in every sense of the word. One of the greatest cities in the world, I reckon.
