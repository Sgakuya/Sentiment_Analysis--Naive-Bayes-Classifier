Will Smith is a very down to earth person. He's real people and fun to watch on televison. I loved him in Independence Day! He's a great example of what it takes to be young strong black male. He's a great father and husband. I'm so proud of how he and Jada keeps his ex-wife apart of their life. He did not make a family and leave his son behind because no matter what that was his first born son. When I saw him in Independence Day, I said he should run for President! If he does run for President I will vote for him. There's a lot more to Will Smith; just sit back and watch it because it's coming. God Bless you Will Family
