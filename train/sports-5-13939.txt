Take it from a man that saw Jim Brown, and Walter Payton play. Both were among the greatest players in NFL history. However I will tell you this. Barry is in a class by himself. People often wonder how Barry would have done behind a decent line, and a competent QB. Look no further than his junior season at Oklahoma St. It confuses me that in a day of sharpies, cell phones, and fake mooning celebrations, a man of class would be verbally attacked and labeled a quitter etc. As they say in life, The more humble an individual is before man, the more he will get rode over roughshod. One of the greatest accomplishments of my life has been the ability to tell my children and grandchildren that I saw Barry Sanders run. Ohh.. and to all those Lions fans still bitter. I envy all of those that were able to witness him in person.
