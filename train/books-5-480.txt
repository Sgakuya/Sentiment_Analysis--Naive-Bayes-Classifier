A.A Milne's undying classic continues to amaze me. Complete Tales of Winnie the Pooh is probably the most humourus, sweet and intriguing bookcollection out there. I have yet to see more welldeveloped characters. The not-quite-so-brave Piglet, wise Owl, dominering Rabbit, pessimistic Eyore, loving Kanga, excited Ru, energetic Tigger, responsible Christopher Robin and of course the not-too-clever Pooh. And just the fact that there's book upon book by scientist/astrologers etc. trying to make out the symbolic meanings of the tales and the characters makes you realize that these stories have captured the hearts of almost everyone. And with darn good reason too.
