He was a great leader, and will always be. I think no other leader could have sacrificed as the way he did...Imagine a Desert turns into a green land...I think he was a miracle. Not just he cared about his people, yet he also cared and helped other countries if they faced difficulties. In my opinion, he is the best leader I’ve known since i was born. According to people who said he's a rich savage....Hey may be rich, yet he's not a savage, he used the money he got from oil to raise his country from darkness to brightness. And to the people who say he's an Islamic madness. Well he might be religious, yet he's not mad, because he didn’t cause any harm to any foreign country, nor he disgraced any religion.
