Texas has a lot of variety. Beaches, deserts, and the lusher green spots. I spent a summer in Austin once and found that to be a very nice college town. Though the weather was very hot in summer I had been there early the previous spring and it was extremely nice. The nearby campus has no doubt inspired the many businesses, entertainment and dozens of great restaurants in the area. I was college age at the time so it was pretty appealing stuff. I also have visited nearby San Antonio and enjoyed the great zoo, river walk, Mexican market and touring the historic Alamo (the real one, not the car rental place). Dallas is a weird city kind of has a futuristic metropolis feel about it. But the site of the Kennedy assassination and School Book Depository Museum are very awesome and interesting points especially if you re old enough to remember that time in history. There is way more to Texas than I ve seen, but what I have seen was great!
