I used to love this as a kid-we all did-and it was the first game i went out to buy a few years ago when my niece came to stay.I hadn't realised it was an American invention till reading the RIA comments;here in Britain i was always used to the London version,with Mayfair and Park Lane the most valuable properties.Now we've got the Welsh one.It has the perfect balance between luck and skill-the luck element makes it much more interesting and enjoyable.I can still remember one time cursing and cursing as my cousin kept landing on Chance and Community Chest(i presume this is the same in the States?) etc,missing all the hotels i'd bought up to dominate the board,while i did the circuits landing without fail on his pitiful holdings or on the obnoxious squares-to fritter everything away.Dastardly misfortune!Yes,it passes the test;just thinking about it has brought a smile to my face.It can just occasionally go on too long,but it does make for hours of great pleasure for the family (and good fun for a couple too).
