Nebraska is really a pretty decent place to live. I live in Lincoln and I don't know of any boarded up buildings here. I doubt there's that many in Omaha either. There used to be a lot of hippies that raised their familys here. (I'm the product of one of them.) Our two major urban centers can boast of several gay bars and there's low crime because we all get along pretty well. There's a large number of Korean and Mexican immigrants that seem to fair pretty well. It's true that there's not a lot to do here. It is quite flat. The obsession with college football makes me want to puke but all in all, it ain't too bad. (It's better than L.A. where I lived for a year. Gag!) -J.M.W.
