Margaret Thatcher may have made some mistakes, ie., the Poll tax, but she restored some respect to the UK and what it means to be British. Her warnings about further integration with the EU should be taken seriously. On another note, the British Isles certainly seems to produce some strong women. Historically one can think of Elizabeth Ist, Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots, Queen Margaret, Queen Elinor and many others, not to mention Queen Victoria, Elizabeth the late Queen Mother and the current monarch Elizabeth II. Not women to trifle with!! Sounds like an idea for a book! Dominate English Women, sounds like a good title.
