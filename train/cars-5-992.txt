The Camry is a great car. Far better than it's competitor, the Honda Accord, in almost every way. The Camry is styled much better, has higher build quality, better reliability, and has a better feel of durabilty around it than a Honda does. The Camry also has a smoother ride, which translates into a luxurious feeling you simply cannot get in an Accord, no matter what trim level. The Camry also has the availability of many options to each of it's trim levels, unlike with the Honda where you have to go up to the next level to get a specific item (for example, sunroof and ABS are offered on EX only, whereas those items are standard or optional on all Camry trim levels). The sales charts prove this, as the Camry continues in first place, and the Accord is sliding far down. Enough said.
