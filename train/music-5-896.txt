This has to be one of the most underrated CDs out there because of all of the teen pop stars clouding the music scene right now. As soon as I bought this CD, I knew it was going to be good. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed at all. The first track called Down reminds me of Wicked Garden, but is so different from wicked garden that it catches your attention. Of course there's the usual kick-ass, hard-hitting rock songs that STP are well-known for, but it's the diverse songs that really show their maturity. Two such songs are Sour Girl and Atlanta. Simply put, the Stone Temple Pilots kick ass and take names!!
