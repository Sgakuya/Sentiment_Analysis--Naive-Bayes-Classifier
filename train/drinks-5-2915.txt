I was very pleased to find the www.xsenergydrink.com website. The product distributed by www.HerbalSubstitute.com and is a much better tasting product than the choices in the super markets. Considering I would drive some distance for this type of product. I finally understand the conveniences of ordering online. I found drinking a can at lunch gives me the continued level of energy till the evening. NO sudden jittery, shaky, uncontrollable peaks. Better yet no sudden crashes. I have found that after my work day and is time to workout I'm less tired. We experimented allowing our High School and Junior High kids adding the Cran-Grape Energy Drink with a good breakfast. I highly recommend it. After School Sports is over they still have enough boost for homework. My favorite Flavor is the Cherry Blast at lunch or the Citrus Blast for breakfast. I gave a couple of cans during the Summer to my neighbor to try, whose is a Cardiologist. He continually has scolded me in the past when he caught me drinking another popular Red brand of energy drink. He has commented often he loves the drink XS Energy Drinks and recently asked for a couple of cans because he forgot to reorder. Then I knew it was really working he is very critical about diet. I hope this helps anyone that was considering to try this new product. We decided to order the XS Energy Bars to see what nutritional benefits we can find there.
