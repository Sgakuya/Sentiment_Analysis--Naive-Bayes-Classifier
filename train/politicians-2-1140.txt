update (10/10): yesterday's compromise is fascinating, Merkel will be chancellor but Schroeder's party, Social Democrats, will control most ministries--including Foreign Ministry which under Joschka Fischer (Green) was remarkably balanced in regards to Israel/Palestinians. It appears pro-US Angela Merkel has won today's election, though not by enough to get the coalition she'd prefer and so may still have to partner with Schroeder's Social Democrats. With Schroeder's departure goes his foreign minister, which has implications for the Israeli-Palestinian situation. Also Shroeder was not as reticent as Merkel about Turkey's entrance to the EU.
