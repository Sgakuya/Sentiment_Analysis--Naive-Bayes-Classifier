It seems that every 10 years or so,Hollywood puts up on the screen an actress barely out of her teens whose presence and stunning beauty hypnotize an entire generation (or two) of men.In the 1980's that actress was Phoebe Cates..in the 1990's it was Jennifer Connelly.She has the kind of persoathat makes one forget sometimes about plot and theme.This is not always a bad thing because some of the films Ms Connelly has appeared in are quite forgettable..except for her...still the personality bubbles below the extraordinairy packaging and the smart money says that one day she will end up in a vehicle that will showcase her beauty and,one suspects,considerable acting abilities.We wait patiently
