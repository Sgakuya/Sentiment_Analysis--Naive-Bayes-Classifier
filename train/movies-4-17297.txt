Life is Beautiful is a good movie. I think that Roberto Benigni is great(see Down By Law if you want to see him at his best), and the film took some chances that I thought were really commendable. I loved that the film developed its characters through the building of this little family. The film dares to look at the Holocaust from the perspective of a father trying to shelter his child in the best way he can while immersed in the worst of nightmares. The tone of the film is set in his masquerade and I don't believe that it is meant to make light of the horror of the Holocaust but to show the characters absolute love for his son in trying shelter him from fear. I think that this film really opened up the mainstream consciousness to foreign cinema and deserves praise for that alone.
