Chinese restaurants was always one of those cuisines that never translated well as a chain restaurant. In the early 1990s, there was a chain called China Sea that did not last very long. P. F. Chang's is the first to do it successfully. Being a Philadelphian, I have experienced so many outstanding Chinese restaurants in the Chinatown section. Chang's is excellent, but not quite 5 stars. It is fairly pricey compared to the New #1 Chinese Food down the block. Some of the dishes (like their won ton soup) are a little too bistroized and may not have that authentic Chinatown taste. Overall, Chang's is good if you want a fancy, interesting meal, but I'll take Chinatown if I want a real good Chinese meal.
