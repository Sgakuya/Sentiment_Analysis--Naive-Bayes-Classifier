I think it is a shame that many supposed-baseball fans have forgotten about Mel Ott. One of the most feared sluggers the game has ever known, the Gretna, Louisiana native was a six-time National League home run champion (finishing with 511 lifetime homers), as well as a career .300 hitter (.304 average to be exact). A marvelous fielder, Ott was the marvel of the Polo Grounds during the heyday of professional baseball. On top of that, he was a true gentleman and was reknown for his kindness to others who were less fortunate. It was truly sad that he died so young and so violently. But Ott is deservedly one of the greats of the game, and fans ought to realize what they are missing in not knowing this true legend of the diamond.
