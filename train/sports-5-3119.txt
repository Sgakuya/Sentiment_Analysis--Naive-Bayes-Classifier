Perhaps just a tad overrated, not just in baseball, but in all sports. Firstly, his .302 average is very good, but doesn't exactly stick out among other HOFers. Secondly, numbers seem to matter the least in baseball out of all the 4 major North American sports since one guy can only do so much for his team. You're bound to find a lot of great players bogged down in otherwise poor franchises throughout his career, whereas in other sports you find otherwise average teams being in the playoffs time and again thanks to one or two guys and the supporting cast. John Elway and Michael Jordan are prime examples, although it can be argued that each of them meant more to his particular sport than Mays was for baseball, since he had a lot more competition. But that's not to take anything away from the Say Hey Kid, he was incredibly special in his own right. He played the bulk of his career during the Civil Rights Movement, when African American players were just beginning to trickle into the North American sports scene. He was at the very least respected in New York when he started playing with the Giants, but when the franchise moved to the Bay Area in the late 1950s he faced a much tougher audience. Fortunately he won over San Franciso and was one of the first professional sports stars in the state of California. Also, due to military service toward the beginning of his career, he missed an opportunity to surpass the Babe in the HR category. His career BA might have increased a few percentage points and his already gaudy totals seem almost surreal. Definitely one of the top 10 baseball players of all time, probably in the top 5.
