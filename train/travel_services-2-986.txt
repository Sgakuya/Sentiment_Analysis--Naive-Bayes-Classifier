I had used two small men with big hearts three years ago and was pretty satisfied at that time. I now know that it is the luck of the draw and the move is only as good as the men you get. So I decided to use them when I moved from Central Toronto to a few miles away on June 24, 2004. They arrived a few minutes late - no big deal. I had not two but three, and trust me one I could have done without -he was rude, cocky and argumentative with moving MY stuff. This one guy had absolutely no regard for my possessions and piled boxes up 5 high to move on a trolley. When I asked him not to, he became very rude. I kept my cool since I didn't want them to do any intentional damage to my stuff - since we all know we are at these guy's mercy. At the end before the truck was fully unloaded they insisted on being paid and had me sign the form which asked about satisfaction level. Of course I could not say they were terrible since they still had my stuff hostage. Also they were somewhat lazy as they did not want to move things after they had set them down on the asphalt. So I have to say never again would I use them. I called the office in North York to complain and no one will call me back and I don't even have an address for them. I too would have happily paid $150.00 dollars more for a better move. Don't use these guys especially the North York outfit
