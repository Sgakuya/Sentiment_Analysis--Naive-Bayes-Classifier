Great for a laugh, especially when it's 6:00 in the morning and I'm getting ready to leave for school while attempting to open my eyes and get the knots out of my hair and desperately need something to wake me up. The ones picking on teenybopper boy bands are the funniest, like the recent one in which Jason was investigating the Bible to see if *NSTINK being given roles as Jedi knights in the next Star Wars was a sign of the Apocalypse. I love the way that the cartoonist, Bill Amend, uses Paige to poke fun at preppy teenagers, another species of which I am not in the fan club. Not as great as Doonesbury (what is?) but still pretty funny and people from all sides of the spectrum can enjoy it.
