 the horsepower/liter ratio is low - shut up moron. HP/liter ratio won't matter when my 2000GT is blowing the doors off your high hp/liter ratio Integra Type-R. Now to the Mustang- I'm getting used to you people overating pieces of crap like the Celica and underating cars with decent performance like the Mustang. This car is exceptionally well built, comfortable, and reliable. Not to mention comes standard with a 190hp 3.8L V6 and can be optioned out to a 260hp 4.6L V8. Excellent performance for $22,000 with 5.9 second 0-60 and 14.0 second 1/4miles. This car deserves a five in my book...its been running strong for almost 40 years.
