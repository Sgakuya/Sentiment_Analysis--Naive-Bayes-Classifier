This is to MoreMaturethanHaters comment. Actually, it doesn't take a lot of talent to rise to fame as Hilary Duff has done. For this girl, all it took was big boobs, blond hair, a pretty face, lots of money and people to write music for her. But, when your fans are shrieking, whining ten-year-olds, that's all you need isn't it? Hilary Duff hasn't got any talent. You really don't need any in America. Avril Lavigne has talent, originality, and a clear voice. Only ignorant people who haven't even heard Avril Lavigne's songs could say Hilary Duff is better. Sure, Hilary Duff is pretty. She had her own disney channel show. Whoop-dee-doo. Her movies are all about the same thing, and her acting skills are pathetic. ZERO talent here.
