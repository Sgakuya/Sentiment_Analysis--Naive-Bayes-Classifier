What an absolutely amazing feeling to first see the Grand Canyon. You feel like you are the smallest thing on earth. When you enter the park, you have to drive for awhile (at least the end that I went through) before you see it. Then when you see it, you become breathless. There are not words to describe what it looks like and pictures don't do it justice. You have to see it with your own eyes to see how massive it is. Along with the feeling of just seeing it, there are tons of trails to hike on, and different camping trips you can take down into the canyon. I only did a day hike but I really recommend going camping. I wish I had had the chance to do more when I was there. I hope to someday go back. It is a sight like no other.
