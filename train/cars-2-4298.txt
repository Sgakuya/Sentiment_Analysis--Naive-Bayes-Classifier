Hello! I want to organize a class action lawsuit about the tranny problems with the Chysler Minivans! my parents have had alot fo problems with them. they have a '96 caravan and a 98 voyager and the caravan had this problem several times! and we just bought a 98 voyager off a dealer (I forget how many miles but I dont think that much) and the tranny gave up. These trannys are defective and Chrylser went downhill since Iococa left!!! their service is bad!!! they dont car about anyone!!! I hope that you join me!!!! thanks and please reply to the owners at dorothykowalsky@msn.com thanks alot!!!! Yours Sincerely, Liz Kowalsky Parents Not so proud owners of two chrysler minivans
