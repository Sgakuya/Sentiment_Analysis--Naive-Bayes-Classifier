a 2.5. for the most part this is pretty dumb and so predictable. Jamie Lee Curtis makes it worth watching at least. A couple the Kranks who have always been big time Christmas people decide to skip Chirstmas this year because their grown daughter has left the home and is in another country. the husband in particular to skip Christmas and take a cruise instead. his reluctant wife goes along. The Neighbors when finding out the Kranks are skipping Christmas have a mega fit and do everything to get them to change their minds. this is kind of dumb since what is it to them if a neighbor skips Christmas and do not put up decorations.? i know our neighbors would care less if we skipped Christmas. WEll the daughter calls at the last minute and decides she in coming home after all with her new fiance. now of course they have to scramble to get a Christmas and their traditional Christmas party put together for their daughter. the neighbors pitch in and help blahblah blah! the nicest part of the movie is when mr. Krank gives the cruise to some nieghbors who are not having a merry Christmas because the wife just found out her cancer came back.otherwise not all that great of a movie.
