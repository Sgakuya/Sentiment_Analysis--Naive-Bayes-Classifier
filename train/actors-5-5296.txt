The first time I saw Robert Downey, Jr in a movie was when my brother brought a film called TUFF TURF home from the video store. It was a real B-Rated number starring James Spader, and Robert Downey, Jr starred as his new best friend in the new city he moved to. He did an excellent job as a supporting actor in that flick, and then I had the opportunity to see him in LESS THAN ZERO, which of course was an excellent movie made from the book by Bret Easton Ellis. His superb performance in LESS THAN ZERO cannot be denied, and the same goes for most of the other movies he has been in since. I am just amazed everytime I see him do something different on the big screen...EXCELLENT !
