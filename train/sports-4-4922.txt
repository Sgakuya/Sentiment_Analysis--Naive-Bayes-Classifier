Amaker is the best young coach in the nation. He learned at one of the best programs in the nation, coaching for many years under Coach K at Duke and waiting several years for the right head coaching opportunity. He also started for four years as the Duke point guard. Plus, he is young enough that many of his players remember him as a player and can relate to him. Unfortunately (at least for us Seton Hall fans), his name is mentioned every time a big-name coaching position opens up. That's the price of great success. As a Seton Hall fan, I hope that he stays with the Pirates for the long haul. Even if he doesn't, his presence has returned the team to national prominance.
