Im Currently a 3 year Vet when it comes to Chawing, im from Newfoundland, Canada and i must say Life is Gorgous....My favorite food is Skoal and favorite drink is Black Horse, and i play Hockey For the Sticky Mons of Mt. Pearl.....To me Skoal makes life worth living for and gives me something to look forward to when going to work knowing i will be filling my Lip shortly....Chaw to me has many names including Chew, Lips, Dips, gags, Bombs and my favorite Dingmans.....Im not a Jimmy pincher and enjoy half a tin when its time to Toss one, anyways, Dingmans are great and make life more of a laugh espically tossin some with the boys whether it be in the dressing room, a party, watchin tv, or on msn....Keep your tin Close and your Lip Full, All the Best
