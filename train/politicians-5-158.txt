I have always held Elizabeth I in the highest regard for her sheer brilliance as a leader. Under Elizabeth, England took a much more active role in exploration of the Americas, eventually leading to the establishment of colonies in North America. Furthermore, her reversal of Mary's policies on religion and enactment of more balanced policies towards both Catholics and Protestants was essential in preserving the domestic tranquility of England. Elizabeth's greatest genius, however, was her policies toward rival nations France and Spain, both of which were attempting to create powerful empires in the New World that could eventually pose a threat to English security. Careful to avoid war, Elizabeth forged alliances with the weaker of the two nations, and engaged in a form of double diplomacy that can only be concieved as diplomatic genius. She led ably in times of war, crushing the Spanish Armada. Overall, Elizabeth was truly one of the most effective and certainly the most brilliant English monarch in history. Her promotion of exploration and the arts set England on the course toward a world empire and had a great long-term effect on the political atmosphere of the world.
