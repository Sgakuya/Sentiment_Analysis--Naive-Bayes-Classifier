One of the few things this state has going for itself is the coast, forests and the Bay Area. Everything else sucks. I was born in Los Angeles and I was lucky my mother had enough sense to move us from there before I grew up because the pollution, filth and crime is not worth it. Where would I be these days? Making minimum wage at a dead end job hoping to get my big break someday? Everytime I've gone to LA for a visit we almost wind up getting jacked. We're not flashy people and we were still targets. The place is paradise lost. The smog is widespread throughout the state except parts of the Bay Area and maybe San Diego. The air stinks sometimes in Sacramento and I can't go out to exercise because the air will do me in. The roads are always crowded. I'm glad we're moving out of here soon. The people here are so apathetic about the effect they have on the environment with all of their driving, vehicles, cell phones, not recycling and the overall quality of life in the state. People only seem to live for today and for themselves.
