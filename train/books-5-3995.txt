This 1946 novel features brilliantsymbolism. The seven commandments is a classic scenario in the book. It is another one of my favorites from Orwell. I truly recommend it. It is written on a bit more juvenile terms than 1984. Even when you have the thought of utopia to start, it slowly deteriorates. It is a more brief portrayal of a totalitarian state with extreme symbolism. is the . After successfully completing a rebellion against human rule, the pig and volunteered leader of the farm is Napoleon. He establishes 7 commandments by which the animals must live by. As the book goes along, Napoleon starts stripping the rights of all the rest of the animals on the farm without any apparent reason because it is his thought that he is superior in intelligence to everyone else. It is this arrogance and superciliousness that, in his mind, gives Napoleon the authority to take away everyone s freedoms. He even breaks his own rules and changes them to suit what he feels is appropriate at the given time, extremely similar to the changing of history in 1984. This is making a direct connection to what happens in Communist societies. By the time the book is brought to its cessation, Napoleon is the supreme and unmovable dictator over the entire farm and leave next to no rights for the rest of the farm and having the 7 Commandments horribly altered as well as becoming exact replicas of the people he had overthrown in the beginning, much like what happened in the real communist world. Also, in relation to 1984, a few animals become aware of the ruler s underhanded actions. As far as the quote goes, Napoleon fails to recognize the individual power within each of the animals and runs an empire of corruption and dishonesty.
