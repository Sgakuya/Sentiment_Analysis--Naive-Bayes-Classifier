'have you try mozilla firefox?' That has always been the question. I say now that you've tried it, why not try Maxthon Browser this time? I'll bet it will be a feeling of someone coming back home after a very long absence, albeit to a much changed, a renovated home. No incompatibilities here. Interface is very user friendly, such as deactivating/activating security features as with the tabbed browsing no add-ons required. RSS feeds live up to its name, 'simple', no crashes here. There are a lot more other features available on this browser which does not dominate the user but quite ready to provide assistance. This is a product that respects your preference. I strongly suggest you try this browser, of course those blinded by the hypes of other browser need not waste their time.
