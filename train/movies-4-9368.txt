I actually liked this movie it was better than I thought it would be. It is about this girl named Elle whose boyfriend broke up with her becuase she was not as smart as the law school type so to go win him back she applies to Harvard Law Schhol but whne she gets there it is not as easy as she thought it would be but she still tries and she sees what her ex boyfriends new girlfriend looks like and she is stuck up ans snotty in the start. But in the end Elle was one of the students picked to have to help out with a big murder case. Overall this movie is predictable but good. Reese Witherspoon does a good job playing her fluff of a character Elle.
