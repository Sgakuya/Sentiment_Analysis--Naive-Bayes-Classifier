I wasn't going to write this review, but thats what this site is about, YOUR opinion. When I look at the rate it all section for Actors (current) I can honestly say that the Actors in people's top 20 are Actors I would put in my top twenty. When I look at the actresses (current) section, it's a completely different story as some of these women I wouldn't even put into my top twenty yet alone five. Jessica Alba is one of them. One reviewer Esssie said ..She's pretty, but certainly not Oscar material and that's TOO true. Could you see her doing street theatre in Poland or giving an outstanding performance in a film? I just don't see any potential. Most Actresses in this section are rated for their looks rather than their talent and ability and shes one of them. Are you trying to tell me Jessica Alba can hold a candle to Hollywood greats such as Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett, Dame Judi, Angela Bassett, Laura Linney, Ellen Burstyn or even Lauren Bacall??? I honestly don't think so.
