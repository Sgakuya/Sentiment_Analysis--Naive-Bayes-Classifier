Im sure if you are looking at this review you are aware of the reputation that the moving industry has. Bekins did not fail to add to the stereotype. A nice elderly gentleman showed up at our house. He could not have been nicer. Little did we know at the time that we were dealing with a snake. I explained to this nice elderly gentleman that we needed our stuff delivered from Rochester, New York to Reno Nevada. It was about Nov. 8 when he first came over to quote us. He explained that our stuff would be picked up before Thanksgiving and delivered by about Dec 9th. I than preceded to tell him that we were leaving on vacation for the holidays (with my two young children) and that there were items that I needed for my vacation packed away with my things. He reiterated over three times that it was not a problem and he even wrote on our contract that Dec 17th would be the very last possible day for delivery. Well by now you can probably guess what happened. Without even a call from Bekins December 9th came and went. So, I started calling. The nice elderly gentleman told me they didnt have any trucks. Hmm, I thought they were a moving company. Bekins did not deliver out things before our vacation resulting in significant stress and expenses for our family. We submitted a claim, which was denied and after nearly 50 phone calls they are not returning our phone calls. We are now pursuing Bekins through the Better Business Bureau (where they do not have a good reputation.) We will also continue to make others aware of our experience on the internet and finally if noting else succeeds we are planning to go to small claims court. As for my recommendations Move yourself. It cant be any worse then dealing with incompetent overpriced movers. Hire some young hard working kids to load your things and drive them in a rented truck. Your headaches will certainly be less. Or, DONT MOVE its safer.
