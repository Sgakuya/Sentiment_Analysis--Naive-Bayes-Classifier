I am looking into interviewing him for our city's newspaper, what will actaully come about from that request, who knows. I myself do not go to many movies nor do I rent them very often. If I do, it has to be a film that I think will be amazing or in Russell Crowe's case, have amazing actors in it. At any rate with all the movies being made nowadays, that isn't too often. Russell Crowe is so intense and very serious about his profession. He puts all of himself into a role to be the best portrayl of that particular character. He doesn't care what people think and does what he wants. He cares nothing of what the media says of him and values his privacy, but when on screen, he is amazing. He can go from being ready to kill someone to being filled with such sadness without saying a word, without uttering a phrase, but having it all be in his face and gestures. What talent and versatility! He is truly an actor that knows his profession. From being on this sight I see I am not the only one who holds this electrifying actor in such high regards!
