I don't like the Yanks but I have a respect for them and can admit that they are the best franchise in the history of baseball. Anyone who doesn't believe it can count how many World Series they've won. Like him or not, Steinbrenner is a genius who demands nothing less than perfection. I don't know about giving up Soriano - a 26 year old who stole hit 300, stole 35 bases, and hit 35 homers - but I've questioned Steinbrenner's decisions before and he's always wound up winning. I've been to several Yankee games and although congestion around the stadium and parking is a problem, the stadium is clean and the games have been a blast. But trust me don't cheer for the Sox, I got hit with a water bottle last time.
