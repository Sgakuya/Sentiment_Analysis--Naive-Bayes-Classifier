After Sixth Sense and now Unbreakable, I'm beginning to believe the hype I read about the director as this generation's Hitchcock (unfortunately, I can't remember his name, M. Knight Somethingerother...). The pacing of this one is methodical and artistic, likely to make action fans squirm in their seats waiting for something to happen. But if you like movies that prompt you to think about each scene, you'll love Unbreakable. It loses one star because I felt the ending (with a twist that doesn't quite match that of Sixth Sense) was wrapped up too abruptly, so that it felt like a bit of a cop-out. Willis and Jackson are great in this film, and the script/directing are just excellent.
