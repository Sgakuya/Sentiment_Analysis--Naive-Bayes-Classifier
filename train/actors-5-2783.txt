Some actors get the job done; they're believeable in their roles, they say their lines convincingly, elicit sympathy at the right moments and guide you through an emotional experience without going beneath the surface. Kevin Spacey brings an inner life to his characters that can only be described as magical. Lester Burnham's journey from angst to renewal to absolution has to be one the most brilliant, resonant performances by any American actor. His love scene with Mena Suvari at the end of the picture is one of the most tender and moving moments ever captured on film. I had always admired Spacey since I first saw him in Glengarry Glen Ross, always assumed his presence in a production guaranteed its quality. Then when I saw American Beauty I realized what I really wanted to do was climb into the screen - push Carolyn Burnham's bitch-ass in front a fast-moving truck and spend the rest of the movie helping Lester say hi to his Monster. Y'know - just rip off those grey jogging pants and CENSORED CENSORED CENSORED CENSORED. I can't help it.. He just does that to you. *SIGH*
