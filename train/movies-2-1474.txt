It appears that the quality of Quinton Tarrention's movies are on a decline (especially with Kill Bill). This movie was on extreme overkill with an attempt to be extremely retro and original. He was definitely trying too hard on those aspects when making this film. Some may say that he really isn't tryng too hard. it's just how the movie appears. PULP FICTION was original and retro!! This goes way far beyond that film, and into just plain insanity, stupidity, and boredom. The atmospheric colors in the beginning scene at Vivica A. Fox's house is proof enough. There was so much unneeded and unexciting dialogue and scene footage all throughout the film (ex. Swordmaker's resturant scene (not funny), and the dojo/kereoke bar scene where the camera would continuously go up and down the staris and repeat for 5 minutes. This was to be a four hour movie? There was no need for a volume two. If the 2nd movie is anything like the first, then you can edit an hour out of each movie, slap them together, and you would have maybe a much better movie....maybe. I predict that Vol. 2 will be less successful than Vol. 1 (to say the least). For God sake, save your money. One more outing like this from Quinton and he'll be going back to Blockbuster or whatever video store he use to work at.
