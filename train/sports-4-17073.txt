Tampa is looking like a solid team once again. I noticed the offensive line, which was once considered the achilles heel of this team, is playing very well. Williams and Alstott are running the ball, and they have some pretty good receivers. Chris Simms looks more confident and the defense, as always, is playing well. I have to admit I'm extremely surprised at how well they are playing. I think they will win the division as their schedule has been and will continue to be on the soft side. I don't think they can get past teams like the NY Giants, the Seahawks, or Vikings because they don't have the experience at QB.
