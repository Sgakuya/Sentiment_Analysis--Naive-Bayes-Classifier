I WAS GOING TO RATE EXPRESS A 4, BUT I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A 5. ...BEFORE YESTERDAY, WHENEVER I WENT INTO THE STORE, I COULD NEVER, NEVER FIND ANYTHING NICE. I TRIED ON EVERYTHING, AND NOTHING FIT NICELY...UNLESS IT WAS $40 FOR A SHIRT! YESTERDAY, I BOUGHT THREE SHIRTS THERE, AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT! I GOT THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHIRTS, AND I AM CRAZY ABOUT THEM ALL AND I CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR 'EM!! WHEN ABERCROMBIE FITCH CHARGES $40 FOR A SHIRT, EXPRESS MAY DO THE SAME......BUT THEIR CLOTHES ARE NICER AND MADE OUT OF BETTER MATERIAL, SO IT IS WAY WORTH IT! EXPRESS SENDS ME COUPONS ALL THE TIME, FOR LIKE 15-25% PERCENT OFF, WHICH IS GREAT! THE STORES ARE FANCY AND VERY, VERY WELL LIGHTED, WHICH GIVES IT THE BIG CITY LOOK(LOL, I MEAN IF U R NOT IN THE CITY). THEY HAVE A STORE IN EVERY ONE OF THE MALLS BY ME...AND I HOPE THAT'S JUST NOT ME. THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOMEONE TO ASSIST YOU, AND THEY ARE USUALLY ALWAYS VERY CORTIOUS. BUT EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T, THAT'S NOT EXPRESSES FAULT(UNLESS SHE ALWAYS IS RUDE). I MEAN, IT'S NOT EXPRESS' FAULT IF SHE JUST GOT IN A FIGHT WITH HER BOYFRIEND OR IF SHE IS HUNGRY, IS IT? OVERALL, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GIVING EXPRESS A SHOT. EVEN IF U COULDN'T FIND SOMETHING THE LAST 5 TIMES(LIKE ME). !! GREAT SALES AND LOVELY JEANS !!
