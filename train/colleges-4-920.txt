I am enrolled at CTU Online in thier Masters of Science/Management program. I am about 75% through the program. I attended a 2 year and a 4 year brick-and-mortar college to get my Associates and Bachelor's degree. My experience so far has been positive. I have only had 1 instructor that was out of his league. He had only recently entered the IT field and had had his PhD less than 2 years. He had no practical knowledge of the subject - only textbook knowledge. After a few conversations with my accademic advisor, the professor was referred to the dean for counseling. All student's work was submitted to another professor for grading. The coursework is mostly research papers. The textbooks help with the foundation and basics of the class, and the research papers help you to expand on that knowledge. The online class time is bennificial to those not already familiar with the subject matter. However, those of us that have been in the business environment for a few years can skip the live chat and skim over the transcripts to see if any interesting discussions were held. Overall, I feel that this program is a good choice for those of us that do not have the time to attend a traditional college and that have put in a few years of work in the business sector. However, I would not reccomend this to those fresh out of high school, or those who have never held a job. As far as the high tuition, all online colleges are expensive. CTU's tuition and fees are in-line with other online colleges that I researched. The same degree at a brick-and-mortar college would have cost me about $5K less, but I would have had to go longer and drive an hour one way to attend class. Overall I give CTU a B-.
