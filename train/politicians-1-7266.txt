To look past Jesse Jackson's race-baiting is to look square into the face of a garden variety demogogue. Hitler had the Jews, Stalin had the counter-revolutionaries, and Jackson has white people. He needs to perpetuate racial hatred--it's what he does and who he is. It puts him on the map. What's really sad are the countless black Americans who look up to him. While he's enriching himself on handouts from the liberal white establishment and sending his kids to St. Alban's prep, the very people he professes to help continue to wallow in poverty. If the good reverend (who was kicked out of Chicago Seminary for cheating) really believes in God, he'd best start praying for redemption sooner rather than later.
