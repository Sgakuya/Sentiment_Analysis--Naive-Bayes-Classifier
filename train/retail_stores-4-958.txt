am i the only 1 in the world who isnt against the clothing label abercrombie fitch?? i mean really, i kno the clothes are expensive, and some are a little 2 torn ^ 4 my taste, but there isnt newhere else u can find truly vintage clothes...n they shudnt discriminate against ppl 4 jobs in their stores, but other than that i think its a ligitimate clothing store that may b a little out of hand wen it comes 2 their quarterly catalog. and i am not saying this bcuz i am an overprivilaged spoiled kid or bcuz i want 2 keep my parents constantly in debt but bcuz i think that ppl r being a little 2 hard on the label. yes, if they lowered their pricces a little, werent as sex portraying, and didnt discriminate against job seekers, they wud b praised a little more, but if thats how they want 2 do things thats their choice...and being 14, i prbly wont have as much say in the debate, but every little bit counts, n all u ppl who dont like it can kiss my @$$...
