It is hard to believe the ignorance of some of you people. Do you not understand about the surplus that is batted back between Bush and Gore? There is none past what is here now, this year.The surplus is projected and will probably not happen. There would be no surplus with Gore because he will have it spent before there is a chance for any to accumulate and he will have to raise taxes to even approach what he predicts. With Bush, there will be no surplus because of the tax cut he plans.The cut in taxes will put spending in line with the automatic 10% increase in the annual budget. Al Gore started the 'surplus' BS and so George W. had to respond in kind. Bush's private investment for part of the Soc. Sec tax will generate a higher revenue for the younger taxpayers. What is available now will insure seniors now a guaranteed income, with ant luck, until their deaths. Without that private investment option, Social Security will be over in 30-40 years unless the SS and Income taxes are increased to 80% of everyone's wages. Bummer! Go Bush!
