I've lived in HOTLANTA for 30 years. Came here to go to law school from Virginia Beach, VA. I've practiced law for 27 years, made a ton of money, got laid so much that I was too busy to get married, went to 5 World Series, 3 Super Bowls, The Masters(August- 2 1/2 hr. drive), 2 Final Fours and the GRAND POOBAH.... The '96 Olympics !!! In other words, Atlanta is the greatest place in the world to live and have more fun than the law allows..... HOWEVER..... I've never figured out for the life of me why people want to visit here or vacation here ??? It's no NYC or LA and is completely void of any identiy other than the occassional things I've mentioned. There are no real landmarks to speak about... unless you consider MLK Jr.'s gravesite, Stone Mountain, CNN Center or Margret Mitchell's home places to visit!.... I never have nor do many Atlantans! The traffic is only bad for the people who don't know the back streets(aka - short cuts).
