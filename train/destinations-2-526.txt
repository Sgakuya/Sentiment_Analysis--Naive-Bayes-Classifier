Constant hassles from street vendors made our time in Montego Bay almost unbearable. The only relief you get from people trying to sell you stuff is on private beaches (guards keep them off) and in your hotel room. We stayed at Doctor's Cove, and in the less than quarter mile stretch between the hotel and the private beach area we were approached 19 times going and 17 times returning by vendors. I realize these people make their living vending to tourists, but with the current drop in visitors (hotels are averaging less than 25% occupancy) their attempts to make a living ruin your trip. Beaches weren't too bad, water was warm, but the constant nagging unwanted approaches more than outweigh the positives.
