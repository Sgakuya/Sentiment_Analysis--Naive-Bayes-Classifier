Washington DC is a magnificent city with something for everyone. It is very stimulating on so many levels. The monuments here like the new World War II memorial, Vietnam War memorial, and Lincoln memorials are very moving and definately stir up emotions. The parkland in this city is abundant, so much green space everywhere. Dupont Circle is a fun, trendy and youthful neighborhood with great archetecture and a lot of diverse places to eat. The public transit/metro system is immacualte, clean and very efficient. I'd reecomend coming here in the spring or fall as I was here in summer which can get unbearably hot and muggy and really slow you down. There is so much to do here that my last visit only scratched the surface and I'm planning another trip to come back so I can see the Smithsonian museums, Georgetown and other sights which I've heard mostly good feedback on.
