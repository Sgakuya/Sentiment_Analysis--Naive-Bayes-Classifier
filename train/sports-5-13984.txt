Hello to evrey one who took the time see what the comments of other pepole are about barry the unintimidated, i'm the best, but thats for you to say, I'll never stain my pride Sanders. I'm sorry for the run on but you know in your heart it's true. O.K. let's talk. In 1988 the N.F.L. is given A gift that It still doesn't embrace the the amount jaw dropping, work horse plays that are in there archives. I promise that I;m done with the gratuitous praise. Now for who ever is still reading , is there any doubt that emmitt the all-time leading rusher Smith should be the new pariah of the grid iron ground attack When every one knows that Emmitts line made him who he is. Barry is a humble person who did for a city that is unthinkable, regaurd of not wining championships. The memories that the people have of the worlds most defying player without a doubt stand tall next to Emmitts 3 titles. I'm sorry but I'm pressed for time but when ever you think of a true player remember, the way that Barry played and to anyone who disagrees, ask emmitt in 2000 if he thought he would be the one holding the record or would it be in the hands of someone greater.... To end this I have to say GO BEARS and DETROIT don't ever take your gift for granted.
