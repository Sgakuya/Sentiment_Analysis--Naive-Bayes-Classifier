Some people will tell you that this coach has choked in the big tournament. They'll point to the loss to Richmond several tears ago, or this year's loss to Vermont. Hey, Vermont's top shooting guard was unconscious with his long range 3 balls. It was a solid Vermont club abd they played over their head and got a big victory. That's what makes college sports so great. Even in his championship year, Boeheim's toughest game was the first one- they eeked out a win against a gutsy Manhattan team, got on a roll, and went on to win it all. Even Boeheim praised that Manhattan team. He's a class act and a consistent winner. This guy has fielded 20(+) win clubs even when the talent wasn't there. You never read about that. The truth is, he's a resourceful coach with more tools in his toolkit that just the 2-3 zone. These obvious talents have made him an elite coach and a consistent winner.
