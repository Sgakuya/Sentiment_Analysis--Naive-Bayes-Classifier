June, 1996--I invest $50,000 in Oppenheimer Funds (the Strategic Income Fund Class A). Net asset value: approx $4.74 a share. June 1996-June 1998--The net asset value rises steadily to $4.84. On June 30, 1998 the funds are worth $52,141.70. August 1998--The stock market begins the month at 8883.29 and ends the month at 8051.68. The net asset value drops thirty cents, to $4.55. On August 31 my funds are worth $49,107.06. February, 1999--The stock market has gone back up, but the funds don't follow: at month's end a share is worth $4.48. I give up following this investment. It's too depressing. October 11, 2000--An account statement tells me that on September 26 the share price was $4.19.
