so i was back in the russian far east last year. i can safely say that no land in the united states can compare with the scenery in the khabarovsky krai (a russian province bordering china and the pacific ocean) huge mountains and all types of forest, decidous, coniferous, even a few tropical hardwoods growing in the extreme south near china, siberian tigers, wolves, dholes and both brown and asian black bears are still relatively common in the vast forests that stretch on as far as the eye can see. other than india, i cant think of another country that has so much natural beauty, and unlike india, alot of russia's great lands in the east are virtually untouched, hardly anyone lives in siberia or the far eastern/pacific provinces. i look forward to comming back again soon.
