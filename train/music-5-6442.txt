Out of all four Rammstein CD's, this has got to be my favorite. It is a masterpiece, a true masterpiece. From start to finish, each song is brilliant and powerful, definitely Rammstein's best to date. Mutter contains more melody and smoother guitar work, not to mention and better use of sampling and keyboarding. My favorite song off this album is Sonne , which combines driving, pounding guitar riffs with dark vocals and then slips into an emotional, slow-but-powerful chorus with some beautiful samples of female vocals in the background and a marvelous melody from Till. Ich Will is so catchy that you can't get it out of your head for days. Beautiful Mutter , the title track, is one of the two softer songs on the album, and it sets the theme of the album. Feuer Frei! is a fast-paced, throbbing song with brutal guitar riffs and a brutal chorus. Spieluhr is an almost mechanical sounding song that tells a rather interesting story with its lyrics. Mein Herz Brennt is the powerful opening track that is a fine example of Rammstein's imaginative lyrics, powerufl guitar work and intricate keyboarding...you gotta love that chorus in that song. Anyways, if you don't have this album, go out and buy it right away...it is 11 tracks of down-right amazing music and it is worth every penny of your money...you won't be disappointed.
