Reagan was, along with Calvin Coolidge, one of the 2 greatest Presidents of the 20th Century. A man who was a great judge of talent and whose own intelligence was vastly underrated. He almost single-handedly ended a half-century of near-political dominance in the U.S. by the Democratic Party. People underestimated Reagan his whole life, and he always proved them wrong. His tax cuts paid for themselves and he kept domestic spending in check to a greater extent than any U.S. President since Calvin Coolidge. The only reason why the budget deficit increased on his watch was because of the increase in defense spending, but I would definitely say that winning the Cold War was well worth it. His only 2 mistakes were allowing farm subsidies to escalate on his watch and not pushing for sanctions against apartheid South Africa. Other than that, he was terrific!
