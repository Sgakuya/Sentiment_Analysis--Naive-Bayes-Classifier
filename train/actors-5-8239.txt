I consider myself a huge Joan Crawford fan--This woman put the S in Star. i dont know, i just love everything about her. her look, her clothes, her films (from the early talkies to the monsterous camp classics), her tough attitude, her ability to rise above her humble beginings....She came from the kind of poverty & abusive background that many stars today no nothing about! So she wasnt the greatest mother--its not her parenting skills that are on screen folks, & i'm not excusing the abuse, which i beleive was true, but i'm sure she wasnt the only Hollywood movie star who was abusive or neglectful to her kids either. SO i think its unfair that this is the only label people know her for considering her body of work as an actress & star.
