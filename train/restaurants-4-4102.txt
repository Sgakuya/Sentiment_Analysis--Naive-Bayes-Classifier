(based on 4-5 visits in Gainesville, FL location) It's right by my apartment, and sometimes I just need a decent steak. This is a reliable place to get one. ATMOSPHERE: 3/5. The first thing you'll notice is the layer of peanut shells on the floor. All over the place. I really mean it. But, oddly enough, it really doesn't bother me. My mom would freak. My dad would love the place. They've got these pails (some of 'em rusty) filled to the brim with peanuts. People just crack 'em open and flick the shells on the floor with gusto. Me? I can't bring myself to do it; I put the shells on the little plate on the table. Otherwise, the wood-panel walls are cozy, but nothing special. If country music or football bothers you too much, you probably won't like it too much. I'm fine with it, though. SERVICE: 4/5. Nothing special, consistant, never rude. It's very laid-back. FOOD QUALITY: 4/5. Pretty decent steak, especially for a chain. It's NEVER overcooked. And the ribs are the second best I've had (a far second, but worthy nonetheless). The meat just slips off the ribs. The sides are okay; the chili's good, the baked beans are dry (avoid!), the baked potato is standard, the rice is decent enough, the mixed veggies are alright. And I particularly like the dinner rolls; very soft, warm, and kind of sweet. I've never saved room for dessert yet, though. FOOD QUANTITY: 4/5. Fair, especially for the price. I always leave with leftovers. PRICE: 4/5. Fifty bucks will cover dinner for two and tip easily. OVERALL: Just a bit under 4/5, but it gets extra consideration for its consistency. Definately a place I'd frequent regularly.
