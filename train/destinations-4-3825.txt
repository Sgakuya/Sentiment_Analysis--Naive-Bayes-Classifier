lets look at reality here. rochester gets a bad rap, its a great place to live, yes, 220 days of clouds, but if there is one passing cloud the whole day, that counts, the sun comes out most of the time durring those cloudy days. the downtown rochester population, not including greece, gates, and all of those places, has a very high unemployment rate, but what most people dont know, monroe county has the third lowest unemployment rate in the country, and the 4th highest rate of jobe gain in the past year. oh, and metro rochester is growing as well, population went up 4 percent since last census, not a giant boom of people, but definetly not a decrease, so i dont know where you got that whole thing about everyone is leaving. and, it has also been named americas friendliest city 3 years in a row. i left and came down south, and now can't wait to move back to rochester, at least they dont get a damn hurricane every year, and 4 inches of snow doesnt close everything down like it does here. most of the people that do move out of rochester (way fewer than those from buffalo,and fewer than the number that move in) think they made a mistake, my self included. when i get back, i will make sure everyone i talk to knows the truth. STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT ROCHESTER, IF YOU WANT THINGS DO CHANGE, HELP OUT ,DUH!!!!!!!!
