Do Not shop at Friedman's Jewelers! They will lie about the quality of their jewelry, not like you can not tell that the diamonds are total crap! NEVER EVER EVER EVER buy a quad head ring! They WILL fall a part, trust me I worked there for five years! They can not fix these rings either. There warranties will not cover anything, and chances are they will make you pay for the repair! There cluster diamonds, or fashion rings, will lose diamonds within a year, especially if you have them cleaned. There jewelry is cheap because most of it is made with 10k gold and is hollow. You would be much better off to go to Sterling or some other store where the quality is better. I am not a disgruntled employee but I only want people to be aware of what they are buying. DO NOT BUY THE CUSTOMER APPRECIATION RING! Not worth five dollars let alone thirty.
