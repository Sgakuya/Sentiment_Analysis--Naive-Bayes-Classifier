When was the last time anyone told you that you could NOT be a teacher... Oh! but if you take This Major. you could become a Janitor! Wonderful..... Just wondeful... IC is WAY over rated... and WAY over priced for a nothing school... Administration is a bunch of morons that behave like comatosed frogs, croaking the same response to every question they don't know how to answer... Well... you need a 3.5 GPA to get in to that program Meanwhile, the Creep with the 3.5 GPA cheats like hell... and Administration becomes one of the Three Blind Rats.... Forget your dreams... cuz they destroy your self exsteem... you just ain't never gonna be good enuf kid... Avoid this school and you will avoid being dissapointed.... IC is just not worth it...
