 Better Off Dead is a pretty entertaining high school comedy. The show is about a guy whose world is falling apart after he's dumped by his snooty girlfriend. The plot is fairly predictable, but other aspects of the movie are surprising and simply bizarre. The guy's mother is always fixing extremely unappetizing food, and there's a scene in the kitchen where she's stirring a pot that has giant tentacles waving out of it. There are also many unusual characters, including a diabolical newspaper boy and race car drivers who show up at stoplights. Perhaps the strangest character of all is the neighbor boy across the street. He's an unbelievable nerd who is constantly using nasal spray and worrying about what Mother will say. If you're in the mood for a light, silly show, Better Off Dead is a good bet.
