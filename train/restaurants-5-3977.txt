I was reading a comment by a guy who gave the Cheesecake Factory one star simply because he had not heard of it. The Cheescake Factory will not just put a restaurant anywhere. They have to build the restaurant and train the staff. Therefore, they will not just put a Cheesecake Factory anywhere. The food is made in a from-scratch kitchen. As far as those of you that have commented that the Cheesecake factory MADE you wait 3 hours to eat there is absolutely your problem. The did not make you wait that long--obviously you wanted to. One last thing, the whole thing about the cheesecake factory is the experience and you will pay a high price for it. The portions are large and the decor is great but do not expect more than a nice restaurant that serves cheesecake and happens to have entrees and appetizers because you will be very dissapointed if you wait a long time for a table and expect more. The cheesecake factory is a great experience on off-peak times. The vanilla bean cheesecake is great. BTW the whipped cream is not imitation (it is homemade).
