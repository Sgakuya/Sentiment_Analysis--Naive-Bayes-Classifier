I drive 25 minutes one way to my nearest Winco, rather than pay an arm and a leg to the Safeway and Albertsons stores that are 10 minutes away. Since I live in a rural area, I do one major grocery trip a week, and I am always amazed that I can buy so much food at such a reasonable price. In my opinion, unless you're rich, it is down right irresponsible to shop elsewhere! To be fair, though, to the naysayers, not all the Winco stores are clean and bright. The store nearest me is new and beautiful with wide aisles and lots of room. The older Winco store where I used to shop is pretty dingey and the aisles are narrow. Also, the management didn't do a good job of making sure the pallets were out of the aisles by 7:00 am, and the employees who were restocking seemed oblivious to those of us picking our way through the maze. But that was just one store. The one I shop at now is a dream come true.
