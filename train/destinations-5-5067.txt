Before you post here I need to remind everyone that there is more to New York STATE than NYC and Long Island. NYC is a fabulous city but it only covers about 300 sq miles in a state of 47,000 sq miles. Upstate NY is like a cross between Western Pennsylvania and New England. The pace of life upstate is very laid back and unpretentious in sharp contrast to NYC. There's a lot of cool smaller cities and towns like Ithaca, Corning, Potsdam, and Ellicottville and bigger, historic cities like Buffalo, Albany, Binghamton, Rochester, and Syracuse. The wine region in upstate NY which runs from the Finger Lakes (http://www.fingerlakeswinecountry.com/documents/area%20touring%20map.pdf) west to Lake Erie is the 2nd biggest wine producing area in the US next to CA's Napa Valley and quite a tourist attraction. NY State is really 2 completely states in one and a very interesting place to visit.
