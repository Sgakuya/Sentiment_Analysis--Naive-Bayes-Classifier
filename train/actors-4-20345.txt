Ok, the MooCow will come clean: he loves Alyssa Milano purely on accouwnt of her stunning dark looks. Period. Her acting career is...well, checkered. She always seems to be involved in junk(Who's the Boss, Charmed, Melrose Place). But there is no doubt that Ms. Milano possesses one of the moost beautiful faces ever to have graced the small screen. Even a piece of absolute junk like Embrace of the Vampire is made almoost palatable simply because of her presence. She is the epitome of Guilty Pleasure. She's not a horrible actress, just not a particularly gifted one. That's pretty moooch par for the course in Hollywood. But few can match Alyssa's stunning beauty, sexiness, and over-all snugglosity. :=8D
