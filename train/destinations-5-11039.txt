I had a great time at this place. In between my freshman and sophomre years at college, I was a camp counselor at this camp in the Poconos, PA. I had the 9 10 year olds and my best friend there had the 7 8 year old kids. When the big field trips were announced, we were on opposite sides of the spectrum. He went to some water park that turned out to be for kids up to the age of 6 years old, so there were just a ton of little pools filled with urine for him. I, on the other hand, was sent to chaperone about twenty 9 10 year old boys and girls (along with a couple of other counselors) at Great Adventure. Got to the park, broke off with a counselor from Wales, UK and pulled like 6 or 7 of the kids that we knew would be adventurous (and were tall enough to go on all of the rides). The other couselors had kind of the whiny kids that needed to be taken care of and babysat. Well, it was a beuatiful day, tons of great rides, great water tides - I remember one where you almost go straight down this water chute and at the start of it your body is not even making contact with the slide and some huge lagoon type of place where you could jump off of this cliff-type of ledge. The kids had a blast and they treated is well, which made the time that much better. It was also great to get out of the camp for a day. Ate tons of park food since we were given an amount of $$ to buy food for the day. Great park - I remember that there was a lot of 'dangerous' stuff to do there. Stuff that I was surprised that they let you do and that could be considered high risk. That may have changed over the past 10 years with lawsuits and all, I am not sure.
