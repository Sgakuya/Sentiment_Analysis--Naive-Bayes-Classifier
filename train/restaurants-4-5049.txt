I don't think anyone confuses Olive Garden with REAL Italian food any more than going to Taco Bell makes you feel as though you just drove south of the border. With every possible nationality filtering into this country over the past few centuries, unless you live in the middle of a swamp or the deep woods, you have no doubt had the opportunity to learn the difference between genuine ethnic fare and something you get at a theme chain restaurant. Still, that doesn't make them bad places to eat occasionally. I've probably been to Olive Garden about five or six times total. The food - at least what I've ordered - has been very good overall, but not what I would term unforgettable. The much ballyhooed salad and breadsticks were also very tasty, but would not inspire me to make special trips there just to order them. Then again, I've been to some very old and respected Italian restaurants run by old and respected Italians and didn't always fall in love with everything I've ordered either. Eating out, especially in the chains where things can differ so much from place to place, is almost always a hit or miss experience.
