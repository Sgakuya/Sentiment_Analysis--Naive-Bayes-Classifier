Braveheart is an excellent movie. It shouldnt be used for historical accuracy, because the real Braveheart for all we know, could have been a raping monster. The truth is, we dont know what William Wallace was like. Mel Gibson, as usual, was awesome, he even directed the movie. Braveheart isnt just all action- its a mixed movie. it has drama, action, love, etc. One false point- The king really lived for years beyond Wallace's death. The king ended up dying of old age or natural causes in a convoy while the country was still at war with Scotland. Despite this, Braveheart is worth every one of its 180 minutes. Watch it again and again!
