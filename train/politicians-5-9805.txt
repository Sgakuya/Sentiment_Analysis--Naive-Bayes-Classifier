The last time we saw a man of integrity in the White House was 89-93. We are about to be blessed with the next! Thank You GOD for giving the complacent Christians of this country a second chance. Though we are not deserving of one, you are a God of second chances! I will be praying that not only do we turn to you for everything that is right, but most of all, you will get the Glory! Matthew 6:33 Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his rightousness and all these things shall be added onto you! May you bless our great land. Abdul689. Read the constitution. The forfathers instituted seperation of church and state to protect the people from having the government dictate how and where we worship. It is not there to keep freedom of religion out of government. That is what the people came to America for, to have the freedom to worship God. What scares people about faith anyway? Take a look at government. Don't they have prayer breakfasts and bibles at swearing in ceramonies? Wouldn't that be unconstitutional if the law said that we must seperate church and state? Think about it...I prayed a lot for our country in this election. And I know that He is in control of what happens. Because I have learned His ways. It is a lot better than trying to figure out humans ways! Interesting that you used Get ahold of yourself , and Jesus in the same comment though. I did just that 18 years ago when I was an 18 year old, I accepted Jesus as my savior..well, I should say that I let Him get ahold of me..I don't mean to offend you, but I do have the freedom to express my thoughts on our Government, and there they are.:)
