The Shape thinks that along with Halloween, Friday is one of the most original and widely viewed horror movies over the last twenty five years. Halloween brought back suspense, Friday showed us gore. From the moment the audience sees a very young Kevin Bacon squered through the throat with an arrow, a new kind of horror film is on it's way to movie history; the teenage slasher film. Done on a very low budget, with excellent special effects by Tom Savini, this movie set a precedent that was copied thousands of time; the more gore, the better. The story was pioneering back in 1980, and unlike the horror films of today, original and suspenseful. Although nine sequels were to follow (parts 2,4, and 7 are worth seeing), none captured the magic of the first one. All real horror fans must see this film, and realize that 99% of all horror films since then are mere rip-offs. And thats the way the Shape sees it this 22nd day of June 2001
