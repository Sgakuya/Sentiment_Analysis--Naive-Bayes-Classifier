Jeff Bridges is sadly underrated as an actor, and I must admit that it is refreshing to see him rated so highly on this list. Most of his films have been low-budget, independent films, but that still does not take away from his sheer natural acting ability. His recent performance in Seabiscuit was moving and inspirational. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance as the President of the United States in the 2000 film The Contender. I honestly don't believe that anyone could have played that role with such perfection. Other good Jeff Bridges films include The Muse, Arlington Road and the Big Lebowski. The latter is espescially underrated and probably one of Bridges' best performances. Bridges is a good actor, but I have to side with Wiggum that his performance in Starman was one of the most painfully annoying of ANY actor in at least 20 years. What was he thinking making that film?
