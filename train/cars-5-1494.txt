It seems that some of you are unfortionatly very misinformed. The Chevy Impala is one of the best in its class. A Chevy Corsica on steroids...please! I believe you are speaking about the Chevy Beretta. Which by the way, was a GREAT car for the money. Now, to the one who was speaking about the Nissan Maxima...COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES AND ORANGES TO ORANGES! First of all, the only Impala that runs close to $30K is a new Chevy Impala SS. How can you compare that to a 2002 Nissan Maxima. Dont get me wrong, the Maximas are nice cars but you must compare it to something that fits. Your nissan Maxima probably compares best to the Chevy Impala (standard with only the basic features and a small six cylender....if that! Your nissan is most likly a big four.) I have a 2000 Chevy Impala LS Police Edition and I LOVE IT! It handles, its fast, it get good gas milage, and is loaded down with options. From heated leather seats to the spoiler, power sunroof, Bucket Seats, and the alloy wheels, i have every option that was available for that car. I did my homework before i bought the car new and trust me...no Nissan, Honda, or any other car company out there offers such a great car at such a respectable price!
