Bad Ass Coffee (one of the smaller chains) has the most incredible coffee ever. It leaves Starbucks Beans Brews in the dust!! They only use Kona coffee from the mountains in Hawaii. Their lattes are rich creamy, their coffee has a deep, rich, aromatic flavor. Their atmosphere is always relaxing as well. They welcome you to sit down, kick your shoes off, hang out. They have couches, a TV, tiled tables, an outdoor patio. They support local artists by allowing acoustic musicians to play for tips, Bad Ass provides the advertising. Bad Ass Coffee also supports local charities, benefits, fund raisers. They offer delicious baked goods fabulous quiches. To top it all off, their staff is nothing like these other places. The Bad Ass I've been frequenting for 8 years has pretty much always has the same staff the same manager. They are mature people that make the shop feel like Cheers ( where everybody knows your name ). This is a top notch establishment!!
