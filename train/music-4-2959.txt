To date, this is the best Beatles album I have heard...although Back In The USSR could have used a few drumrolls (hint hint, Ringo). Really, one of the only bad things about the album is the song Rocky Raccoon . I got a question...why did that band not put a few more Harrison songs on the albums? He wrote some of their best stuff! ( While My Guitar gently weeps and Piggies are both on this album.) Other favorites include Glass Onion and of course, Back In The USSR . I really don't understand what a few hardcore Beatles fans hate so much about the album...it's really very high quality. I might have given it five stars had there not been a few hints of typical Beatles cheesiness. Take care, eeveryone!
