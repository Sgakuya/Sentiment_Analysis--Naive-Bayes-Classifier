Great Talent but for the position, he's simply another slash (kordell steward) only with more arm strentgh and speed. Over the years, it's proven that what makes a good QB has nothing to do with running the ball. A QB has to have other entangibles like accuracy, anticipation, poise, toughness (mental and physical)..etc, and Vick doesn't have any of that. He's way too fragile (get's nicked up and bruise with the slightest contact), He can't play well hurt, He cannot read the defense to save his life and He doesn't do the little things that a great QB needs to do as far as Leading a team from the QB position. Take away vicks running and the falcons never see what the playoffs feel like ever. Age will catch up to him just like it did with randall cunningham and every other running QB. In my opinion, a QB that can't put a pass where it needs to be is about as effective as a gymnist who does a perfect routine and can't stick the landing. That kind of performance will get you talked about, but it won't win the gold or any medal. Vick needs to step up and show us something as a QB, not a runner. Sure he sells tickets, but that ain't enough to consider him a great QB.
