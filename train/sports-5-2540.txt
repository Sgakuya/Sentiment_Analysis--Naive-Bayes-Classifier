Modern day baseball genius. Year after year his team makes the playoffs - it was 3 years in a row up until last year, when they missed it by one game - and this is all with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. By focusing on the overlooked stats like on base percentage rather than home runs or averages, he was able to get some affordable hitters. OBP factors in walks (which the A's typically are league leaders in ) and if you ever played ball you'll remember your coaches saying a walks as good as a hit. With all this talk about average no one cares about OBP and that's why Beane gets them cheap. He surrounds himself with some brilliant management and scouts who are able to identify the young studs that they can pick up cheap, and they obtain them by trading off a guy or two who's gotten some publicity and trade value, while not necessarily performing to the hype. Beane will always surprise you and he picks players that are competitors and fun to watch.
