ONE WOULD HAVE TO RATE DIDDLE AS A VERY GOOD COACH, HAD HE PLAYED A BETTER TYPE OPPONANT SEASON WIDE, HE DOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED GREAT! WHILE WESTEN DID INFACT TAKE WESTERN TO THE N.I.T. AND NCAA--THE REALITY IS THAT HE WENT WITH THOSE TEAMS! DIDDLE GOT PLENTY OF MAJOR COLLEGE TYPE PLAYERS AT WESTERN KENTUCKY---HIS NUMBER OF PLAYERS THAT ENTERED INTO THE PROFESSIONAL RANKS TESTIFY TO THAT, BUT THE MAJORITY OF HIS GAMES WERE AGAINST TODAY'S EQUAL OF N.A.I.A., AND JUNIOR COLLEGES! AMAZINGLY, DIDDLE IS RATED IN THIS STRING, AS BEING SUPERIOR TO RUPP, YET THREE OF THE MAJOR PLAYERS FOR WESTERN IN IT's 1940's SUPER ERA, WERE SENT TO WESTERN FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY AS CAST-OFFS! EVEN IN THE 1960's WHEN WESTERN AGAIN WAS PUT BACK IN THE HIGH MAJOR RANKINGS , BY COACH JOHN OLDHAM, THE 2nd,- 3rd BEST PLAYER OF THE 60's WAYNE CHAPMAN, WAS A TRANSFER FROM KENTUCKY! STARTING IN 1969 WESTERN HIT THE JIM McDANIALS ERA OF PLAYING SUPER BASKETBALL--EVEN GOING TO THE 1971 FINAL FOUR---AND BEATING U.K. BADLY, ON THE WAY---ONLY TO LOSE THE ENTIRE McDANIALS ERA BECAUSE OF A MAJOR CHEATING SCANDAL! BIG MAC, HAD SIGNED WITH AN AGENT, SEVERAL OF THE PLAYERS ENTERED WESTERN ON LOADED GRADES , AND THE ENTIRE ERA's GRADUATION RATE THE TOP PLAYERS WAS NEAR ZERO! AMAZINGLY DIDDLE, LEFT WESTERN KENTUCKY COLLEGE AS THE WINNINGEST COACH IN COLLEGE AND NEVER HAD AN INTEGRATED TEAM--NOTHING SAID! ADOLPH RUPP, WHEN HE LEFT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY AS THE WINNINGEST COACH OF ALL TIMES, HAD ONLY ONE INTEGRATED TEAM--AND IS RAKED OVER THE COALS EVERY SEASON!--INCLUDING E.S.P.N.
