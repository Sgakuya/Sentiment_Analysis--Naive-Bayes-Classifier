It's a good game,plus it's real dark, like not freindly and it is funny, I love Chatterbox109 and I really hate DoubleCleff and MSX. 911, I agree there are funny ads, but none of the songs on flashback are that great. And this is good but Vice City is way better than GTA III, because there's more stuff to do, although GTA 3 has 3 islands and Vice city has 2, Vice city islands are bigger. Compared to Vice city. TommyVercetti is right. It is garbage compared to Vice City, I mean you can't go on motorcycles or fly helicopters or own property or go in buildings or eat food or get more weapons.U can fly planes but they can't go in the air. Vice City and GTA3 are always on top.
