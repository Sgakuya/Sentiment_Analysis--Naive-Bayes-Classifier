I don't understand why people insist on shopping there and then bashing the hell out of it. If you don't appreciate their style, don't shop there. If you don't like what their models look like, don't shop there. If you don't like the music or the smell or the prices or the associates or whatever then don't shop there. The staff can be a little conceeded, but if you want the Abercrombie logo, you have to deal with them and their prices. My advice is to do what I do. I started shopping at Hollister a lot. Their sales people are a lot more people friendly, I am a brand rep there and it is such a fun place to work. I enjoy shopping at Abercrombe and Fitch but you can get clothes that are alomost the exact same at Hollister for about jalf the price.
