Fine actress with an almooost otherworldy beauty, Ms. Paltrow has turned in one solid performance after an-udder - althought the MooCow's favorite just might have to be Emma. She has a killer cowbination of girl-next-door sweetness and unearthly, almoost elven beauty(she has THE moost beautiful neck the MooCOw has ever seen, its like a swan's). Thank her mother, Blythe Danner, for the genes, and her manager for good choices of material(Emma, Shakespeare in Love, Se7en). Gwynneth is the real deal, and has earned mooore than enough respect from her peers in Hollywood to where she is cowsidered to be in the top drawer of female leads, along with Halle Berry, Cate Blanchet, and (god forgive me!) Julia Roberts.
