I have been living almost all my life in Holland, and have lived in Spain and Italy. Besides that I know Germany and Belgium qiute well. Looking as an outsider to my country I can say that the worst of Holland is the weather. If you are from a country or region with similar weather conditions you won't have any problem with it..or at least no more than local people do. People are quite easy going, cities are beautiful without the big boulevards and buildings like you see in Madrid, Paris or Rome. Transport is good everywhere, specially in the western part of the country. The bigger cities are very mixed with cultures from all over the world. Marihuana you can buy everywhere, not only in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam the marihuana is more expensive then in other cities because of the tourism. In general Amsterdam is the most expensive city when it comes to living. It's an open country for foreigners, not hard to find a job allthough salaries are not to high. Maybe it's the best country to live in in Western Europe. The airport is ok and has cheap flights to almost anywhere at anytime. Final conclusion: Not the most beautiful country in the world, but pleasant to live in. It makes you feel like you have many possibilities. Only the weather sucks, but we're working on that! Bye
