One of the greatest hitters of all-time, it was said that Babe Ruth copied Shoeless Joe Jackson's swing. That being said, does this player belong in the baseball Hall of Fame? You know what? Maybe it is better that Jackson never gets enshrined (and not for any obvious notoriety which has tainted his legacy). Being a notorious legend as Joe Jackson is today, he is still remembered by many afficionados who keep his name alive in the annals of baseball lore. In effect, Jackson's missing name on a roll of Hall of Fame players only adds mystique to this unfortunate South Carolinian. The greater legacy, however, maybe that he is more remembered (for good or bad) than a great player by the name of Mel Ott who did not involve himself in any mishaps or ill-advised schemes which embarrass the game. In a society that feeds off human car-wrecks such as Steve Howe and Jose Canseco, it is not a surprise that Shoeless Joe is more remembered than the sweet swinging Cajun gentleman, Ott. This is unfortunate, to say the least.
