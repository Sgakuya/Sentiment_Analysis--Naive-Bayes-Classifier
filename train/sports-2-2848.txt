I loved Bo as a player. He was always an emotional player with a volatile personality. Unfortunately, these qualities can lead to disaster as a skipper. He knows the game as good as anyone and has the potential to be a successful manager. But his vile temper did him in with the Padres and now he is self-destructing with the Phillies. He has cultivated an atmosphere of fear in the workplace and players appear tight and afraid to make mistakes, else receive the full wrath of a Bowa rant-fest. The Phillies were everyone's pick to go far in the postseason this year; but they never seemed to get on track and now the Braves are running away with the NL East once again (Of course, the Braves will suck in the post-season as they do every year and no one in Atlanta really cares anyway). Someone has to be made accountable for the Phillies' latest Phailure (Particularly, their utter inability to beat the Florida Marlins). It's time for Bo to Go. The Phillies have two excellent replacements in John Vukovich or Charlie Manual. As for Philly fan, Time to Root for the Eagles.
