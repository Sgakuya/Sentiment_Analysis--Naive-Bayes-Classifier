UPDATE-Oklahoma fans beware of what you ask for...Nobody is ready to face the Trojans...Awesome Defense (remember defense Oklahoma) High Powered offense=BALANCE...There is a reason they are rated #1!!!! Hey Clarkone68...2004 Texas Tech 70 NU 10. I do not say this gloatingly, I despise OU and like NU because they used to be able to beat Oklahoma. Oklahoma has a very good team this year. However, the students and fans of Oklahoma had better get used to the University of Southern california fight song. Because they will be hearing it numerous times as USC clobbers UO in the BS (I mean BCS) championship game. Go USC
