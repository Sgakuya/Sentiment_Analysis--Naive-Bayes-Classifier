Meg Ryan is a terrible actress. She plays the same character in every movie. She was cute when she was young, but she's completely outgrown it. Problem is, she isn't choosing film roles that are helping get rid of the cute thing. In the Cut was just stupid; she was still the same ol' Meg Ryan, just more boring. And on a completely superficial level, her lips are getting out of control. I'm sure she's had collagen injections, and it looks awful! Anyway, the long and short of it is that she has had her day, and I don't understand why she's still hired or so popular in Hollywood. Move over and let some new, REAL talent in!
