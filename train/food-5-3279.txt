These are quick and delicious meals if you aren't up to cooking. Since I usually cook for myself (or my girlfriend cooks), I buy them only as an easy lunch treat (i.e. a break from leftovers) for at work and only when they're on sale for $1.99 at Shoprite. Most of the meals aren't all that great for my taste, but I love a few of them: 1. (Hungry-Man) All Day Breakfast, with Scrambled Eggs, Buttermilk Pancakes, Hashed Brown Potatoes, Sausages & Bacon Strips. Usually you have to touch up the eggs somehow (nuked eggs need help), but you get sausage AND bacon! Great easy breakfast or bruch at work.... 2. (Hungry-Man) Boneless White Meat Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes, Corn & Chocolate pudding. Very tasty.... 3. (Sports Grill) Beer Battered Fried Chicken Strips with Cheddar Steak Fries. This is awesome! My new favorite from Swanson. Overall, I'd recommend these to anyone who likes a break from cooking their own meals. I'm not sure what their regular price is where you live, but as for me, when they're on sale for only $1.99, I stock up a little. :) And for the going home to your trailer stereotype comment: that's funny, and sometimes true. But in any case: trailer, apartment, house, mansion... these meals taste good wherever you live. :)
