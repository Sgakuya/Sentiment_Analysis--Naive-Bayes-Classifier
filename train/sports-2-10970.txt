I'm sure that somewhere in there beats the heart of a good tactician and a great football mind--he was raised and reared by the best, after all. But a couple of things trouble me here. First, he has an unjustly arrogant attitude. Sure, he's done a commendable job at Clemson and Tulane, but he has yet to prove his ability to win the big game (i.e., Florida State, or a respectable bowl game). Second, and I see this because I live in the local Clemson media market, this man is obsessed, and I mean OBSESSED, with the solid program Lou Holtz is building down the road at rival South Carolina. Hardly a post-game interview goes by (no matter who that day's game opponent is) that he doesn't make some snide, off-the-cuff remark about the University of South Carolina. Sure, be up-to-speed with what your rival is up to, but this guy takes it to the extreme. Show some class, Tommy, and worry about the game at hand. South Carolina will be waiting for you at the end of the season, I assure you.
