THE GREASTEST PLAYER OF ALL-TIME. Besides the home run single season and career records (that were later broken), look at the other records he set that are still standing today: 1. Babe Ruth was one of only two people (Reggie Jackson being the other) to ever hit three home runs in a World Series game and is the only one to do it twice (1926 1928); 2. Babe Ruth is ranked first among outfielders with the highest average home runs per at-bat; 3. Babe Ruth holds the record for the longest complete game victory in World Series history. In 1916, as a member of the Boston Red Sox, Ruth went 14 innings to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers; 4. Babe Ruth led the American League in home runs 12 times and has the most base on balls with 2,056; 5. In 1920, Ruth established a still-standing mark with his .847 slugging average. He followed that with the second-highest mark ever (.846) in 1921; 6. When Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in 1927, he hit 14% of all home runs in his league that year. For a player to hit 14% of all home runs today, he would have to hit over 300 home runs in one season; 7. From 1915-17, Ruth won 65 games, more than any other southpaw in the majors; and 8. After the Red Sox sold him to the Yankees, Ruth single-handedly outhomered the entire Boston team in 10 of the next 12 seasons. These are just a few of the records Babe holds. Babe Ruth deserves more than a 5-star rating. . .a million stars would start to reflect on how great he truly was.
