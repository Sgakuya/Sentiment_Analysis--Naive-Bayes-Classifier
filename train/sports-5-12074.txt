* Shares the load with Ronnie Brown but has a remarkable ability to break the first FEW tackles by opposing players. Fans of various other programs running backs should watch this guy if they get a chance. He is great in the open field but awe inspiring when he hits the middle of the line and rips through the defenders. Should at least be in New York for the Heisman ceremony. * A very impressive player. The best back I have seen at Au or UA since Bo Jackson. Having been hampered by injuries and poor OL play it is hard to say if he is truly great. He is coming back for his senior year and I expect big things from him. If he excels this season I might rate him a 5. For now he can only rate as good. He deserves 5 stars for returning to finish school though.
