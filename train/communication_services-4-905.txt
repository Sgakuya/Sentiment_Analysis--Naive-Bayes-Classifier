A year ago I would have given five stars. I got my phone for free, and all I do is go to walmart and buy one of those cellphone cards for my minutes. It is kind of annoying that before every call connects it reads your cell minutes "based on where you are calling, your account has *** minutes of talk time available" THEN it rings. So it is annoying if you're in a hurry. I had no problems with this phone until a few days ago. It restarts by itself..weird. But it is three or four years old and I use it a lot so I guess its just worn out. I will see about getting a new phone...depending on their customer service and how accomidating they are I'll change my score accordingly.
