If you haven't had Guinness, you don't know beer. If you haven't had Guinness, and don't know beer, you haven't lived. A proper pint is an Imperial Pint--a bit shy of 20 ounces, in a glass that bells out a bit at the top. Ideally, you're trying the non-pasteurized, on-tap version. Guinness is surprizingly sweet, a bit choclatey, and to call it any one thing is to deny how much their brewmasters have accomplished from simple malt and hops. I don't know. Maybe it's the Liffey. There are a lot of ways to make a beer. There are a lot of styles of beer. Guinness, undoubtedly, is the master of its style of beer. It's smooth, complex, soft, and hopefully for God sakes hasn't been abused by shamrocks carved into its head. When you consider that a pint of a good german Octoberfest or a dutch wheat beer will typically cost you double the price of Sir Arthur's concoction, it's a buy, too. Some ideas for Guinness: Mix it with sweetened condensed milk. Eat oysters on the half shell with it (stout may not be what you normally think of, but it's ideally paired with shellfish). Don't drink Guinness too cold (about 40 Fahrenheit is right, in my opinion) and don't drink it on a hot day--it won't slake your thirst, it's far too hearty. As they famously said, "Don't be afraid of the dark." If you can say as he can, Guinness is good for you, how grand to be a toucan, just think what toucan do! Slainte!
