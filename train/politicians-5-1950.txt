Put yourself in his place. He did all the right things. As far as a conspiracy between himself, President elect Bush, and Harris, that is nonsense. Harris did her job. If there was a conspiracy it lied within the Supreme Court of Florida. As far as the black vote in Florida, it was the likes of the Democratic Party, Jesse Jackson, and others who pounded into the heads of the black people to vote Gore. Most of them were first time voters. They got them to the poles but they forgot to show them how to vote. The uncounted votes in Florida were because they didnt follow directions and it happened throughout the United States. If your black leader tells you who to vote for, is that really a vote? Jeb has done a good job in his state. I applaud him for how he handled, probably the most troubled time in his political career.
