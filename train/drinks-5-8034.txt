By far, best consumed on the rocks. This beverage already has all the mixer you need with the peach and apricot flavoring. However, if you want to get a good warm fuzzy, you had better buy the 100 proof bottle because the 70 proof has been watered down. BTW, who the hell are these people who remove the alcohol content from liquors anyway? Must be parents of high school and college kids who hear horror stories about their kids drinking and getting in car wrecks. Put the alcohol back in Southern Comfort. Great drink but overpriced in my opinion. Especially in light of the fact that they have reduced the alcohol content.
