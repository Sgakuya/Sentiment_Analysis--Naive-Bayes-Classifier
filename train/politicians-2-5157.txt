Tonight I want to recall my vote. I am very tired of looking at the Vice President making his pompous appeal to the voters for patience. I think we have shown great patience in Florida. I will admit now that I wish I could get my vote reversed now! Mr. Gore never seemed 'personable', but I never realized just how overbearing he is. It is too late for me, but I hope the courts are not convinced that he is sincere about getting the voters real wishes shown. How can he presume that ANYONE can read those voting cards better than they have previously been read. I have noticed at my election site that just handling the cards can cause slight bends or dimples. And finally, why aren't they counting ALL the counties in Florida, including the ones that Bush carried. Wouldn't they be likely to provide additional votes against Mr. Gore??
