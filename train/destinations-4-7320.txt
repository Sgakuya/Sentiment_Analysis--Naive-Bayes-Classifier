Naples is an atypical Italian city, although many Americans think it is the quintessential Italy. It is noisy, chaotic, has a high crime rate, and is overbuilt. Despite that, the people genarally are friendly, outgoing, exuberant, philosophical, and amazingly clever and quick-witted. Comments based on having lived in Naples a total of about four years (1967-68 and 1979-81). There are pleanty of sights to see in the city itself (lots of great panoramas of the bay, and museums such as San Martino), and lots of great attractions nearby (Pompeii, Herculanaeum, Capri, Ischia) Food is great, espcially if you like seafood, pizza, or pasta. Wines are good, but not as good as in northern Italy. Ice cream and coffee are at least as good as anywhere else in Italy. Mozzarella is a local specialty, and bears little resemblance to mozzarella found in the US, which tastes like rubber in comparison. Fresh mozzarella to a Neapolitan means mozzarella that's less than 12 hours old. It is unquestionably the best in the world (it is made from water buffaolo milk). Hotels are typically Italian, not totally comfortable, but clean and adequate. Traffic in Naples is totally anarchic; don't even think of trying to drive there, unless you have a southern Italian heritage yourself and maybe are used to driving in Boston already. Naples should not be a primary travel destination, but should be included on any itinerary of Italy. Be aware that other Italians joke that if you ever want to see what North Africa is like but can't afford it, take a trip to Naples.
