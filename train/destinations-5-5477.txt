My family moved from East Tennessee to Litchfield Hills Connecticut when I was seven years old. Twenty nine years and three children later, my husband and I now make our home in New Canaan and have no desire to move into something better because it doesn't get any better than this. The rolling hills, winding roads, quaint downtown and white steepled churches presents the quintessential New England atmosphere. The excellent schools, low crime rate, community events, church influence, and friendly neighbors who pitch in together for someone in need and keep watchful eyes on their neighbors children as they do their own creates a wonderful sense of community not that easily found these days. The fact that we are within 10 minutes of Long Island Sound, 45 minutes away from NYC, 1 1/2 hours from the Atlantic, and less than one hour from the Berkshile Hills (Litchfield -north)provides us a plethora of exciting weekend things to do before coming back to our small piece of heaven right here in New Canaan. Other areas of Connecticut have their share of wonderful attributes as well; but as for me, New Canaan and the Fairfield earn the entire state a five.
