Kenya is a great country. As a Peace Corps volunteer living there for 2 years I was able to enjoy what Kenya has to offer. If you want to visit Africa, Kenya is a great place to start. It is often referred to as Africa for beginners. While still very poor, it is relatively well off compared to its neighbors. It has a well developed tourist industry, and they speak English! I was amazed by how different my expectations of Africa and Kenya turned out to be from the reality of it. If you have the chance, I would recommend a trip to Kenya. Do your research to know what you are getting into, but the rewards are great.
