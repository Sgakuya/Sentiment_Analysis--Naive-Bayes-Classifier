Well it took them long enough and here it was, a possible contender to knock Half Life off the top spot - arguably it didn't - I think it did but very soon afterwards came Medal of Honour and it wasn't even worth arguing about anymore. RTCW was as you can imagine nothing like the original Wolfenstein game, this game was scary and in a very American way tried to mix WW2 reality with off world and super natural horror which for me was its let down. The engine and ambience was promising and it was certainly worth playing twice but after playing MOH it just seems a little bland. The Multiplay was great, I'll give it that but it is now, alas gathering dust underneath MOH add-ons.
