Busy, busy. You can spend an entire afternoon in Harvard Square simply visiting the bookstores without being bored. There's a little twist to each charming or overwhelming collection in the square. This place is teaming over with intellectuals and tourists, from near and far, seeking a good read. Highly intellectual stock of books - if you're going to school, a professor, or simply in need of the experience of learning again, this is the place. Philosophy, physics, anthropology, social history, poetry, novels and more. The store is right across the street and at least four more of the best bookstores I've ever been to are a short walk away. Harvard Square is the place to be for a book lover. And the rest of the Boston book community is equally competitive.
