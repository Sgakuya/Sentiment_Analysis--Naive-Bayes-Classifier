I saw this film some months ago and decided to wait awhile before finally deciding what I really thought about it. I had a lot of people I respect blown away by the film. Problem is, even after reflecting long on the merits of the picture, it was just not my cup of tea. In all fairness, the massive positive hype put forth by the movie critics and media made it hard for the film to live up to expectation. I liked visually what I saw, but, I did not get the religious experience that a lot of people did. For me, it just didn't translate very well to my western mentality. For sheer enjoyment I'll take Gladiator .
