I think he is a brilliant actor! When I saw the Deer Hunter years ago, I was literally stunned, and still am now after many more viewings. Other actors have moved me over my lifetime, but I know of no other actor where I can watch a film a number of times, and feel as moved as I did the first time I saw the film. I have seen a variety of other films he has been part of. It is a real pity that he has been cast in so many cameo roles, as he steals the film even then. He seems to get so far into his roles that even villains dont come across as being one dimensional. His acting stands out despite his modesty, which just makes it all the more appealing!
