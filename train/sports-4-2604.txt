He has to be regarded as one of the best managers/coaches in baseball, if not sports, history. Sure, he hasn't had a whole lot of success in the postseason, but winning a championship is more than a lot, and I mean a LOT, of people can say. And in 2004, when Atlanta is no longer viewed as a premier baseball power, they still have a solid hold for first place with lesser players, and you know it's the coaching that got them this far. Only one championship knocks Cox down a point, but that still doesn't take away the fact that he was an extremely successful coach and has the ability to make something out of nothing.
