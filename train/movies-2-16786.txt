How disappointing. I had been looking forward to this movie for a couple of weeks before it came out. I dragged my boyfriend opening night and had high expectations. I thought the story sounded interesting, the characters cute and the idea original. Well, I believe in coincidents and random events happening but this was too much. One after another. There were parts of this movie that could have been completely deleted and you still would have gotten the same movie/story (like Ben Affleck being an alcoholic, why did that have to be included? Couldn't he have just had a hard time, did alcohol have to be there? Or how he went to the Palm Springs Center to get cured...and then they drove by it after the water slides, a little unnecessary I thought. I could go on and on about events that were too coincidental). Then there was Ben's sidekick. Who was he and why did he have to be an alcoholic too? Why did he have such attitude right away when they met? A little unrealistic. Then there was Gwenyth as a mom. Very unconvincing. She was too young and not mom like enough for me to believe. There were so many bad things about this movie. It is too bad because i love the idea of the story of 'what if' but this was just stupid. I really don't think anyone should pay to see this movie and perhaps rent it when it comes out but don't expect much.
