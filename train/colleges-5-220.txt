UT Austin is a terrific school for many reasons, namely (1)Austin (a wonderful place to both live and work); (2)Resources (a large state university with class size large enough to justify providing the best facilities); (3)Faculty (most have very relevant real-world experience, not just some Ph.D. with a lot of theoretical understanding); (4)People (I genuinely liked my classmates); (5)Real-World educational opportunities (since Austin is such a high-tech startup hotbed there are many practicum, internship, part-time, etc. opportunities). Now, lest you think all is rosy, there is a real reason UT is Top 20 and not Top 10 and that is the fact that it is a state institution. It is governed by the State of Texas and its legislature and this often leaves the well-intentioned MBA administration and faculty wringing their hands because of an inability to get things done (e.g. raise tuition to support better facilities, alter basic institution policies, pay faculty what they could get at private MBA programs, etc.) Overall, UT is an excellent choice - especially if you actually are a TX state resident!
