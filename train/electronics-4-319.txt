I just got the Panasonic CV50 about a month or so ago and I don't have any complaints about it. When my CD player broke, I figured that I may as well get a DVD player instead of getting the CD player fixed. As a result, it was important to me that the product had a multi-disk feature and played CDs as well as a CD player does. Well, I haven't been disappointed. This model has built-in dolby digital decoder which means that you get dolby digital sound quality even if your tuner doesn't have the capability (I did read that it doesn't play CDs that you burn, but that doesn't impact me). And, the picture quality is incredible. The difference between DVD and VHS is obvious. A couple of warnings about DVDs in general. First, be aware that many of the movies come only in a letterbox version (black bars at the top and bottom). Second, if your TV doesn't have the proper inputs, you are not able to have the VCR and DVD player hooked up at the same time. All that being said, I'm glad that I got a DVD player and I would recommend this model.
