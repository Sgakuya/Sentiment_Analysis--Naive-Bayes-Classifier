For his humor and spirit, I would give Moore 5 stars. BUT, because he does not provide adequate documentation for all the claims he makes in this book, and because a few of the claims are intellectually dishonest, I have to say his effort was a bit disappointing overall. He is sloppy with the facts in this book. There are facts that, objectively presented, would support some of Moore's positions, but they would require greater explanation, digging, and work on Moore's part. Instead, the burden is on the reader to track down or decipher sources. There are much better books available out there. One example: The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, by Greg Palast. This book takes a well-documented look at forces (financial and ideological) influencing politicians of all stripes, Democrat, Republican, and others, and readers of all backgrounds and beliefs would benefit by reading Palast's work (instead of Moore's).
