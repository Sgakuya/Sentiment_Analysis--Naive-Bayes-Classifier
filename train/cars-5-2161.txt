I have 2 32s. One is an n/a daily driver and is the longest runner I have ever had. There is no American (mustang, Vette, etc) that can even come close to the longevity of the VG30DE. It is now over 200,000 and runs just as strong as it did at 0 miles. My TT (50,000 miles) outperforms any car I have seen at the track. Well, with the exception of the 911s, Fararri's, Lambo's and Astin Martins that come around every now and again. Yeah, a Supra has more potential, but does not have the prestige or legacy that the Z car has. Not to mention that the Supra got it's resale value increase from a gay ass movie (F&TF). A TTZ with around $3k into it (and the car costs around $10k for a good example) will beat 99% of the cars on the street and yield you at least 600hp and 550+ ft-lbs of torque. Personally, I have all of that power, but I don't even have the experience to fully utilize those kind of #s on the track (that's the road track, not that straight line, hill-jack BS). Yeah, woo-hoo, the straight line is what gets heads turning here in the US of A. But, a real driver knows better. The track is where it is at and the Z excels at every track I stress on it. A great GT car. Oh yeah, congrats to Greg DuPre on his 9 sec. 1/4 run in his Z32 with full interior and stock internals. I have had the MkIV, an RX-7 and a few American sports cars. The Z was the car that won my heart. I think the 350s are a little too trendy, but they will evolve a bit I think. "Once again... The last letter of the alphebet is the final word in sportscars".
