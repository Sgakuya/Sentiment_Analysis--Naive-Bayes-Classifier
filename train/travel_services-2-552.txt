I through philly on the way to europe and had a nice experience, i thought that the international terminal was beautiful and i had no problems. on the way back, however, immigration was a nightmare, i had to haul my bags 200 yards through customs only to recheck them, and then had to walk outside of the secure area and go back through security to connect to my other flight for absolutely no reason. moreover at the magazine shop i visited, the employee at the counter disappeared while numerous people were waiting to buy things. then U.S. airways bumped about 4 people off of every domestic flight...2 days before christmas. next time i'll fly direct to MSP.
