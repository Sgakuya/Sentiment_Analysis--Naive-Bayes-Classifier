Purchased GE microwave/convection 12/22/02oven at Sears store in Alexandria ,La. model #JE1590C 001 Sears # 02073459000.The convection onven was faulty. set temperture 350 oven lite would come on but the temperture would be 250 temperture of oven would be approximately 100 degrees less than what it indicated. Had GE warranty technician check and verified same. Return the item to Sears and order another one . Received it Jan 9,03 it had the same problems It appears to me that all ovens that model and made Sept 02 will have that problem.I have informed the local Sears and GE customer relation of the problem. I would like to receive a microwave/convection oven that works properly Calvin C Bryan 318 448 3395
