Verizon Wireless is a new company! Give it a chance! Three major cellular companies merged along with smaller cellular companies. The major companies are going through growing pains. One company thinks running it their way is the only way NOT! Therefore, everyone has to rethink of doing business the Verizon way or the (right way). Changes can not be made over night!!! As far as that Customer (smart butt) Service Rep., did you get his or her name. I would have BI@#$ed until I talked with some one that knew something about the rate I was on then get that (smart butt) in a lot of @#$%. I have done it before and I will do it again!! They are there for the customer; NOT to file their finger nails.
