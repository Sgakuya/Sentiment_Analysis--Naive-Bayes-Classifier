Janet Reno, you go Girl! I think people hate her because she has BALLS and she does the right thing. She's not controlled by men. If she was my Momma, I'd be so proud of her, and I still proud of her, even though she's not. I hope she runs for the Governorship of Florida and whips Jed (G. Dubya's brother) Bush back to Texas where the rest of the Bushes call home. Being of Latin background, don't believe that Latinos in Florida support Jed Bush, and hate Janet Reno. Majority of Latinos, support Janet Reno's decision on Elian Gonzalez, because Latinos believe in the bond of a Father and Mother figure. So, you go Janet Reno! I'm waiting to celebrate your victory!
