I like the additions of Richmond and Hunter; they add much-needed depth...I question the addition of Walker; it's not like Horace Grant was CWebb or anything like that, but handing a starting slot on the 2-time world champs to an unproven guy like Walker isn't a good sign...Every year, I question Rick Fox as their starting 3, but every year he significantly contributes to a postseason run...Fisher's injury will affect them; he's a spiritual guy, a great leader, a second coach out there. Hunter, on the other hand, was given the keys in Detroit, and he misfired often and played selfishly. He's not a guy that you can win a championship with...Shaquille O'Neal is the most dominant player to come along in decades. If they're ever in trouble, they just dump it down to him, and he makes things happen. He's a very underrated defender, too, a good shot-blocker...Kobe Bryant's only knock is lack of consistency from long range, but playing with Shaq, who needs threes?
