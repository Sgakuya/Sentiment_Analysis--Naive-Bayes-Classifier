This is my favorite fast-food place. They have a smorgasbord of selections regarding drinks and the dessert menu is incredible. I ordered a burger today for the first time here. Service was very good and timely(waitress was friendly). They gave me a selection of either to put mustard or mayonnaise on it(a #1 for mayonnaise and #2 is mustard). Since I hate mayonnaise, I guess upset with other chains that automatically put mayonnaise on it. For the first time, a chain asked me what if I wanted mayonnaise on the burger. It also did not have ketchup on it(but gave me packages in case I wanted to put it on myself). This was another good idea(nothing worse than a sloppy burger with both ketchup and mustard on it). I am going to start going here more often.
