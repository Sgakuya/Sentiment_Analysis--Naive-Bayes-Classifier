Good points: It's reasonably clean, at least in and around the capital. Certain things are cheaper here, like food. The people are a lot of things, but at least they're not pretentious. They have a good zoo, the Canal area downtown is nice, and most shockingly, a quite decent system of libraries. The airport isn't packed and it's rather efficient. At first, I thought the people were friendly, but I'm beginning to see the rudeness mentioned below coming out. For a state with such a low level of education, it's surprisingly bureaucratic- you'll have to fill out numerous forms and put up with endless hassles and inconveniencies. LOTS of needless bureaucracy to boot. Little to no true diversity. Relatively little to do here. A Bible thumping state- about ten fundamentalist Protestant churches on every block. There is a lot of racism, conformity, strong anti-intellectualism, and a thinly veiled Anti-Catholicism in the air. Politically, nearly everyone is so dumb they'll buy into whatever Bush and his gang have to say. Little to no culture: by far the best thing they had to offer was a free Buddy Guy concert. The cuisine tends to be third -rate, and I have only been to 1 good restaurant- a Macaroni Grill. The Italian food in particular is a joke. This is a Bob Jones University/ Ian Paisley sort of place, and the local tv stations include several channels with phony, red-faced, white-suited "preachers" sweating out booze and demanding your life savings. Outsiders are regarded with, at best, suspicion. This place also features, amongst it's other charms, draconian laws and a repressive and brutal police force. Miles and miles of strip malls, autobody shops, supermarkets. Indianapolis as a city is fair, but outside of it is nothing but cornfields, crudely carved signs with exhortations for sinners to repent,ads for Uncle Elmus' Crab Shack and the like. The scary thing is there's actually places that are even worse.
