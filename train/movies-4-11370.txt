Very well executed film. It's not rocket science but it delivers great action sequences and some really funny moments as well. My favourite scene was when Jackie Chan fought off the street burglers in London and used hilarious props, such as an umbrella, a canopy roof and almost every piece of fruit imaginable. The choreography was creative, so it was entertaining to watch. I've always liked Owen Wilson's comic sensabilty as well and he plays the role of the boaster with nothing to back it up, perfectly. I also enjoyed the interesting pop culture references that were thrown in for fun. For example the detective at Scotland Yard who became the author of Sherlock Holmes, and picked the name of the character because Owen Wilson's character used it as a disguise at a party.
