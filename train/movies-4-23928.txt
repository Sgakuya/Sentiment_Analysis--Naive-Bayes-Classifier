A (mostly) gentle fantasy that starts a bit slow and continues at an unhurried pace. K-Pax poses the question, Is this guy just one of the more interesting nuts in the bowl or could he possibly be exactly who he says he is? . Spacey s portrayal of Prot is endearing, whimsical, and, as usual, brilliant. Jeff Bridges (who is IMHO one of the more underrated actors in his age group) also gives us his usual excellent low-key performance as the psychiatrist who tries to unravel the mystery of this man who claims to be from the far off planet K-Pax. By the time the end rolls around you are presented with two distinct choices. I can t speak for everyone but I was convinced Prot s story was true - and if it wasn t it should have been.
