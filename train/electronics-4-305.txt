The uniden EXA series phones are pretty good and they have a really long range, up to 500 feet. that's not that bad. I like the features of it and I like the sound quality, it's not hi-fi or anything, don't expect that with a regular analog line. The only complain is that the buttons on the hand held unit are to easy to press and you can accedentally hang up easy. I learned how to manage and not hold it so close to my pretty face. I did hang up quite a tew times by accident and I was talking to a support pro about an account situation and i accedentally hang up and I had to wait another half and hour to talk to that person again. that sucked. oh well. The phone basically has all the features a typical 900MHZ phone does but it does have extras that are convienent. I like the EXA series phones fromn the #1name on cordless phones.
