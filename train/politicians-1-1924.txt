As a person living in Florida, I must say that I seriously hate Jeb Bush. He has really done nothing useful as Governor, and I just want to know how the hell he was re-elected. McBride was just so much better. Here that Floridians? What the hell were you all thinking? Anyway, I'm just going to mention something I read about recently so you can know just how terrible he is. His new plan to save money on the Florida budget is to fire all the lawyers representing death row inmates. Of course it's because they are too expensive, it has nothing to do with the fact that the office attracts young, liberal, anti-death penalty lawyers, oh no. So he's replacing the government lawyers with private lawyers. Hm. How is that going to save money you ask? Well, he's only going to allow those private lawyers to bill 840 hours. Considering that death penalty cases are usually quite time consuming, sometimes taking upwards of 3,000 hours it looks like everyone is going to fry!
