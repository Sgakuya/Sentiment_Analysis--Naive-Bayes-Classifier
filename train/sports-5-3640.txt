pops was one of the greatest Pittsburgh Pirates to play the game and probably one of baseball's most warmhearted ambassadors. as a kid i watched willie from the steps in my parents old home as my father layed asleep on the couch after working all day and while my mother was off working until 11pm in order to care for me during the daylight. i'll forever cherish those moments of watching that big buddha of baseball crossing the plate revelling in the twighlight of his great career. last year pops died when PNC opened...people wept at the statue that sits proudly and menacing in front of that beautiful ballpark.
