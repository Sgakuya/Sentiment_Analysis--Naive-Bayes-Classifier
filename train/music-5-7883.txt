so many things going on in this video. From a supermarket, to kids tracking Shirley Manson down, from a guy with a glowing lightblub as a head, to naked chicks who look as though they've been attached by the hair... nuns... everything, also it's mega cool mid way through the video as the music slows down, it cuts a scene with Manson walking into another set which is a graveyard, then right before her is the man with the lightblub for a head, then it shows her with her leg in mid air about to kick his head off as the music starts to pick back up once more. Amazing is an understatement for the video. Nominated for 8 awards at the 1998 MTV music awards.. One HELL of a video from a great band. Everytime you watch it, you see something new. Plus the scene where Manson and perhaps Duke on all fours with the two kids on top of the as though they're riding a horse. how kinky! hah
