What a game Butler played yesterday. When I turned this game on, they were down 28-14 to a long, athletic, frantically pressing Louisville team. What immediately struck me about Butler was their body language - instead of being rattled or defeated, they were snarling mad... smacking the floor, bumping the blue chip Louisville athletes, and ferociously fighting through picks. Clearly this team was not used to being down so big, and were pissed off about it. And lo and behold, Archie started making his threes and the Butler big men were able to hold their own against the Louisville big men, and the next thing you knew, Butler was up 10. I look forward to seeing them in the next round.
