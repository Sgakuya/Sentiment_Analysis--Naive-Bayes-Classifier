 Losing Nelson is a very good book, especially if you're interested in history or psychology. The plot is unique and difficult to describe, but basically the book is about Charles Cleasby, a middle-aged history writer who is obsessed with Horatio Nelson - one of Britain's greatest Admirals and a national hero. Cleasby's inability to reconcile one of Nelson's actions with his idealized image pushes Cleasby further and further into psychological imbalance. The book works on several levels - as a history lesson, a psychological case study, and an examination of the dark side of heroes and hero worship. Unsworth's writing is excellent, especially when he describes Nelson's naval battles (both the strategy and the brutal action). Losing Nelson is a challenging and worthwhile book.
