I have had Excel's telephone service since '99 and have never had a problem.They have always been a company of their word.As far as the My Line Complete Pkg. goes it's awesome.It's not a knock off of MCI actually they came out w/it after Excel did.As far as getting letters about going over your limit ...What is it that you expect??? If your not abusing it you have nothing to worry about. This pkg. was created for residential use only not buisnesses with faxes and networks and etc... Their customer service is great also.Just to let you know the only time you would reach India is if you called before or after hours. It's not Excel's problem if you call during that time. Also, who really thinks that your not going to have to pay taxes and regulation fees on a phone bill??? I would highly recommend this to anyone.
