It's cold, there's nothing to do, and it's full of regressive politics. I keep reading these posts about how great it is but people can't name anything to do past a museum. It's overpriced, the women are uptight and don't put-out. I lived here for 2 years and it was a big waste of time in my life. Since I left, I met a beautiful nice Southern girl that I wouldn't have met if I stayed in this uptight overpriced state. There are a lot of gays here and they don't appreciate the Bible, which is the foundations of this country. It's very regressive and needs to be more progressive like Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The reason they all like the Red Sox is because it's so boring and there's nothing to do except watch baseball. So you're going to pay high cost of living prices because of a state's "history," give me a break. If I'm going to pay high cost of living wages I would hope there's something to do. In Boston, there's nothing to do except stare at each other, freeze, and listen to a bunch of political activists. And the only reason it's in the Top 10 on this list is because people are not naming off stuff to do in the state, they are judging it by its politics. I'll tell you the politics -- regressive -- it's an independent rat race. Judging specifically on the stuff to do here, there is a museum, an old rundown ballpark (Fenway), a downtown area that is nothing special, and some historical places. There's about 3 days of stuff to do here.
