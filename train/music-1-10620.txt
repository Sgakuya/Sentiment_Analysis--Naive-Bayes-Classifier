I'm sorry to break it to some of you, but I can assure that what Avril, and in effect her CD, is not anything new. My sister borrowed a copy from a friend, and being the open minded individual I am, I gave it an objective listen. Before I go any further, I want to establish the fact that I am a punk of the truest sense. The Clash, Sex Pistols and Ramones (all of which are better bands more than words can express campaired to Avril) are commonplace in my musical repertoire. I have mohawk hair that I dye it regularly in various colors not found in nature. I believe that safety pins are fashion accessories. And I can truly say that, while she may look the part, Avril is nowhere near punk musically. Her songs are sour-coated candy pop, and her substance in devoid of anything new, let alone revolutionary. Don't buy into this sad corporate attempt at punk rock, there is so much better to be had. On a final note, anybody that claims that Avril is new, fresh or punk, and does know who Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious are, then they probably have their head up their ass.
