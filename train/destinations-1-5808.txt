Every memory I've ever had of Florida has been one of going down there from New York to see my relatives die. I've taken a vacation there exactly once, and that was to Disney World. Too commercial, too noisy, and too depressing---my parents told me and my siblings, right in the EPCOT Center, that they were planning to separate. Now, how cool is THAT for a 15-year-old teenager to hear? Doesn't exactly make me want to take in a visit to the monorail or go to Cape Canaveral. About the only thing I enjoyed was St. Augustine and seeing the Spanish moss hanging from the trees. Thanks, but I'll stay away from the Sunshine State for a LONG time.
