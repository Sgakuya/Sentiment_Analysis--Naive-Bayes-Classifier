what both bush and gore don't talk about is how our congressman and senators are using their office for personal gain's thru big corporations. this is against the law!!! where is our attorney general? what about all the departments of the government who will not answer to the general accounting office for over spending by billions? what about the big corporations who violate the law, and get their hands slapped? what about congressman who submit hr bills and buy stock in that corp, and put in wife's name and then make mega bucks selling the stock after the hr bill is submitted? if we had accountability in our government, they wouldn't have to worry about insurance, s/s/ medi care. why don't these people talk about squaring away the government? first!!!!! and start back to the basic's, or do both runners need these special interests??
