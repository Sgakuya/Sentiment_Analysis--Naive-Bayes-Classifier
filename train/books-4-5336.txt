For large portions of Bel Canto, I found myself irritated at Patchett's sympathetic, unrealistic portrayal of Latin American terrorists. I'm pretty familiar with Peru's Shining Path, Colombia's FARC, and even Mexico's Zapatistas - and nothing that I have read would hint that in actuality, terrorists are the lovable, misunderstood, talented individuals, who if given the opportunity, would become outstanding members of society that Patchett portrays them to be. In Bel Canto, this unrealistic, naive, almost silly description goes on and on - parts are funny, parts are touching, and most of it is well written. Just as Bel Canto begins to convince the reader of the dreamy, unbelievable fairy tale of how kidnappers and hostages can really get along - back comes reality - and in a hard and brutal way. The last couple pages of this book rattled me, and not to give anything away, I found myself wishing that Patchett had stuck to the liberal, housewife interpretation of Latin America's terrorist underground, and not jolted me back into the vicious reality. Patchett writes well, you get attached to the characters, and there's a lot of interesting symbolism. Worth a read.
