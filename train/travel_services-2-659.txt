You wanna talk about a terrible airport!!! This place never gets better for the 20 years I have lived in Southern CA....no,no,no....it gets worse. Security is nice now...because they work for the government...before they were very rude and careless. I was wearing shorts, a shirt, and sandals...no problems. Those not so lucky...was pretty much everyone else! The security is a little lacking, so expect to wait a long, long time. I flew on a red eye, and ended up waiting for 20-30 minutes. LAX also makes it very difficult for the 1st time vistor to understand where the terminals are. They had one baggage carousel for 6 different airlines....because the others were being rebuilt. That was not the bad part...the bad part was the way they mixed all the luggage together and didn't tell you which airline was putting luggage on the conveyor.....a waste of an hour sifting through 100's of pieces of luggage. The stupidest thing I saw was a Japanese airline flight who was told that their luggage was going to placed at our carousel....but while we were there, they announced in English that the their baggage was being sent to another carousel. Unfortunately, it looked like many did not understand English, since they were still waiting for their luggage at our carousel. The location of the airport gives the best representation of LA by giving tourists the impression that LA actually looks like Compton. This airport has really got to improve its image....one really does not want to fly out of this airport, except out of extreme necessity. In the future, I will definitely shell out the extra $100 to fly out of Orange County.
