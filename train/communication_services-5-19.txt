Not sure where some of these comments came from but here is my experiance. I used to have a total phone bill of on an average of $185. I got on the complete package and now am paying $60. There is obviously taxes on the $49.95 or $59.95. If your calling normal people, like friends, family and residents you will never get a letter about standards. This is free long distance, so they monitor calls so you don't abuse this. Abuse is 900 numbers, faxes, internet...basically if you joined MyLine from Excel to call long distance to friends and family, your fine, call as many times as you want as long as you want. But if your trying to take advantage of free long distance by using it for business or by calling 900 numbers for hours on end, then you'll get told about it. I've had no problems with customer service, nor have I had to call them other then add inside wire survice. I have had no problems with my phone service, and have had no hidden fee's or problems. The bill is very nice also, it show's you all your long distance calls, how many minutes, then a big fat zero. It's always nice to see.
