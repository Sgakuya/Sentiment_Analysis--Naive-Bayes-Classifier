I picked up a copy of this book after hearing lots of positive comments about it, and I wasn't disappointed. Andrew Weil's advice seems sensible, and he provides plenty of evidence to back up his recommendations. For the most part, Weil tells you things you know you should be doing- buying organic produce, eating lower on the food chain, eating more fruits and vegetables, etc. He gets really specific, though, and that's helpful. For example, Weil says to include oil in your diet, and he goes into great depth discussing the types of oil you should include and why. There is an extensive recipe section in the back of the book, and it looks good. The recipes don't require many ingredients, which I appreciate. If you're looking for a general guide to nutrition and you're willing to put out some effort to shop for the healthier foods discussed, this book is for you.
