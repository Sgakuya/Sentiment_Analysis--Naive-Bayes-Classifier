I could go on and on about how this pustulent ball of vaginal discharge is a mindless ranting imbecile, but I don't think I will, other than say that the buttplug should have run off like a crybaby when Bush was elected. I think when he said he would, it actually got MORE people to vote for Bush! As far as acting goes, he's hammy. Real hammy, and I'm not just talking about his physique. If he had one more corny line in Pearl Harbor (Dumb and historically inaccurate movie), I was going to put a bullet through my TV. He made a passable at best Jack Ryan in hunt for Red October. The highlight of his acting in that one (which was, other than the presence of Baldwin, a good movie) was his impression of Sean Connery. So you get a terrible rating for being a terrible person and a terrible actor, Alec.
