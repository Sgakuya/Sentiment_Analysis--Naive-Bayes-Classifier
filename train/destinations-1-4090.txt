I moved here from pittsburgh and it was the worst thing I EVER did. I lasted 7 months and am tomorrow on my way to a real city, Portland. This is the worst city, if you want to call it that, that I have ever been to, and Ive been to Cleveland. Outside of the desert weather there is a huge list of crap about this place. First of all, if you dont speak Spanish you are automatically out of the running for anout 90% of the jobs, I thought we spoke English in this country? You cant walk anywhere, everything is so spread out. Public transpo is nonexistent, the CAT bus line is a joke. Every apartment complex is exactly the same, I could go on and on. The ONLY good thing about Vegas is there are a ton of decent paying jobs for people without an education. but again, speaking Mexican is a prerequisite for most of them.
