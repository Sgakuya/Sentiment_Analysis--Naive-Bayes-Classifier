I will admit I am biased. I was a long time employee of Wegmans and worked my way up from a grocery associate to store level management. The service customers get is also the service and care employees get. I left to join an Ahold company for more money. What a mistake, it was the worst place I have ever worked. There is a reason people are frienldy and helpful at Wegmans and why it is clean and beautiful. They treat their customers and employees like people and the environment reflects it. Complain about an egg farm, how different is it from any egg farm? Go look at Perdue or Amrour or any meat packing plant for that matter and you can find things that may make you consider vegetarianism.
