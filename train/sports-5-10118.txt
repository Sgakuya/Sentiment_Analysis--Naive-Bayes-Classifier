Fine Player. Fine Coach. Fine Man. He is a Southern Gentleman who is a ardent environmental conservationist. No conspiracy thoery could change my mind. Bama Fans don't like him because he beat them four years in a row. If it had not been for poor officiating and a miracle kick in '85 as well as a single botched play in '84, it would have been eight straight wins. And when you start calling him a cheater, you have to realize that he learned all he knew from the Bear whose recruiting discretions are well known in many circles. Ramsey was a crybaby whose wife ran the show and was mad because her hubby wouldn't be bringing in a NFL salary.
