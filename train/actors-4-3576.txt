For me is by far one of the most talented actors I have yet to see. He is...well...not very attractive, but the one thing about him that we all seem to agree on is the power of his voice. Pure sexiness. A quoute from a Alan Rickman fan: He'd make a killing with phone sex. Hmmm... And hey, lil_9571om - that is always the case, there're one or two buggers out there who come to the board merely to say HE SUCKS. Get a life!!! I mean lil_9571om YOU SUCK because I've checked out all the reviews you've posted and they pretty much all say HE SUCKS! Why join this board if thats the only two words in your vocabularly? We come here to praise Alan, so get a life cos sure as hell looks as if you need one.
