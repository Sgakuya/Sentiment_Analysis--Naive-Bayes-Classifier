FDR was not a perfect president, but then we haven't had many. In answer to Ploopy, FDR did not like appeasement, and tried to halt Hitler's expansion by sending him a list of countries he'd rather not have Hitler attack. Hitler, rather understandably, laughed, because the US had no enforcement power. FDR wanted to fight in the war but the anti-war opinion of Americans kept him chained. WWI had taken a toll and also there had been some studies into the role business had taken in the first world war that caused this feeling. It was only after Pearl Harbor that people were willing to enter. So don't judge the man that presided over the worst section of history over that.
