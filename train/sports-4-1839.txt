Though the Braves are my hometown team, I've never been much of a fan. Frankly, I have very mixed feelings about the franchise in general. I always considered them either flat-out terrible (which they were when I was growing up in the '80's), or a maddening combination of exciting (in the regular season since '91) and heartbreaking (in the post season since '91). I have a great deal of respect for Bobby Cox and most of the players through the years, but I've never cared for the ownership and back-office management. I guess, if for no other reason than they're my local team, I'd like to see the Braves do well in '03, and maybe, just maybe, beat the Yankees in the World Series someday.
