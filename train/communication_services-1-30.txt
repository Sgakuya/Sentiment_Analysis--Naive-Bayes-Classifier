I have been with Sprint for four years, I can't compare it to other carriers. However, the past year and a half when I upgraded my service they have been overcharging me. They didn't set up my account properly according to Sprint. That I was being charged on nights and weekends, when in fact I have 3000 nights and weekends. When I realized this after seeing an outrageous bill. Sprint said corporate policy is two only go back two months for credit. They owe me way more than two months time. It was going on for longer than that. And now when I am trying to resolve this, they don't seem to want to help me with this situation.
