Lots of action, a decent storyline, and some phenomenal chase scenes make this an entertaining movie. Claire Danes' performance is the only one that I would call strong, but who goes to see T3 for the acting? While no terminator could possibly be as bad ass as the guy from T2, there was something chilling about seeing a beautiful, emotionless terminatress prancing around. My only complaints about the movie were its blatant product placements, and the obvious influence that Arnold's political handlers had in ensuring that everything that came out of Arnold's mouth was charming, funny, or noble. All in all, pretty much what I expected - plenty of action, decent storyline, and a fast 2 hours at the theater.
