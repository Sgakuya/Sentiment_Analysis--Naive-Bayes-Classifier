This film was made at roughly the end of the cold war and the prevailing theme of peace and unity over old hatreds seems allegorical of the spirit at the time. This ties in well with the humanitarian idealism prevalent throughout the Star Trek franchise. The way Kirk plays off his main antagonist throughout the film with Shakespearean quotes and retorts is pretty well done and reinforces the epic nature of the film. An enduring legacy of this film would be the zero-gravity assasination scene, unparralleled in its presentation of a cold, clinical political assasination. The only shortcoming of this movie is that William Shatner's acting is hardly reminiscent of his KHAAAAAN!!! performance and is (like the other somewhat aged cast memebers) a little below par throughout.
