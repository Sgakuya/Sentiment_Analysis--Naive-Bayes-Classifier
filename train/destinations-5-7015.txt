London has to be one of the great cities of the world. My comments are based on too many visits for me to count (I think it's up to about eight) between about 1992 to 2000).Don't go if you want to relax, because there's just too much to do. There's something for everyone. Possibly the only negative note is that you really have to get used to watching to your right instead of left before you cross a street because of the British habit of driving on the wrong side of the road. Food is good (maybe not great); everything from fish and chips (those are great) to Chinese, Indian, Italian, yhou name it food. The people usually are so polite and correct it makes you wish we had some of the same here in the States (it seems as if every female in a service job calls every male Dear of Love). Hotels in London tend to be somewhat stodgy, and room sizes and comfort vary widely. First time I stayed the bathroom was larger than the bedroom (no joke). Prices can be high, but use common sense. Go to a Tesco (a supermarket chain) and get ready-made sandwiches and reasonably priced soft drinks for lunch. Stay away from sidewalk vendors for drinks - they will gouge you. If you're there for a couple of days or more, get a London Walks brochure (available in most hotel lobbies), and take as many of these walking tours as you can. First-rate guides (many are actors or writers in their regular jobs), and there's a real variety of walks (ghost walks, pub crawls, Jack the Ripper, etc.).I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, it's worth the visit (and the language is not a problem - well, sometimes it is. As they say, Brits and Americans are two peoples divided by a common language!).
