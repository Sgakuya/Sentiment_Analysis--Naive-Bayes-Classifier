I really enjoyed five out of six areas I visited in Quebec. Montreal, Quebec City, Chicoutimi, Baie St. Paul were all great. People hospitable, and the ambiance was unique compared ot naywher in North America. Trois Riviere was so-so. As for speaking in French, my high school French got me by okay, even in Chicoutimi, where no one speaks English practically, it seems if you try somehow you can connect. It was amazing when I had to, I could remember how to tell the Canadian Tire mechanic that my brakes were making a strong noise in French. (Les freins fait du bruit tres fort.) Just think if someone showed up at a store in Detroit or Toronto and tried speaking in French or Spanish without making any effort to choose English words, I think they'd be pretty much ignored too. You have to show some effort and respect for people.
