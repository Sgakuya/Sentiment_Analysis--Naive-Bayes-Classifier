While I won't be doing any commercials for Fox TV's "No Spin Zone", I will opine thta Lynn Nolan Ryan as probablpy the single most intimidating pitcher ever to pick up a ball and that his numbers (statistics, as always, being dependent upon a wide range of factors) do not in any way do him justice. Nolan Ryan was a "Notre Dame" like opponent. The kind of guy who's reputation alone got your knees to shaking and made damn sure that when you dug in at the dish against him (As if anyone ever really dared to!) you'd better be sure that you brought your "A" game. It was gighly repeated that a good day against Ryan was oh for four and hope that you don't get hit by a pitch. He threw harder, longer than any man in the history of the world, struckout more batters than anyone will ever come close to, tossed seven no-hitters and at least a dozen one-hitters, and could have easily won 400 plus games had he not played for four weak-hitting expansion teams. When he was clocked at 100.9 miles per hour it was in the ninth inning of a game in which he had already thrown over 125 pitches. I think that the normally self-promoting hall-of-famer Reggie Jackson said it best when he said of Ryan, "That guy is in a completely different league. I'm a fastball hitter, so that is the pitch that I love to see coming. I like ice cream too. But not when it's served by the truck load." I'm sure that there are about five thousand strikeout victims that would echo Jackson in his sentiments.
