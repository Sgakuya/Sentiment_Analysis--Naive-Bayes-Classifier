Circuit City is based around customer service. They try to enforce being quick to customers, being knowledged, and productive. if a customer is ever treated in a bad way...it may be an accident or a misunderstanding. We are all humans and make mistakes...understand that there are problems in every store and every work environment. Also understand that every once in a while a store may hire someone that said they were something they were not, and im sure the store is working on weeding these people out. Circuit City wants the best for its customers...hello happy customers make better sales...better sales means a successful buisness. Its a great place to get what you need!!
