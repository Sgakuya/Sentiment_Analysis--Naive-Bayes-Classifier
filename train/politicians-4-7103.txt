Mr.Ed: I am a male about the same age as the Reverend and I have done my own share of 'phillandering' in the world. I never purported to be the moral leader of anything excpert my own family and I let them down miserably. This kind of action led to a long hard time for my ex-mate and chuildren. An apology does not fix the heartaches and change the selfishness I demonstrated. I have been forgiven, but the lagacy I created lingers on. I see Mr. Jackson allegedly may have used his non-profit organization's monies to spport his private circumstances. I recall that Mr. Chavez of the NAACP similarly was accused of this kind of arrangement and this cost him not only respect, but his standing as a leader. Mr. Jackson should not only aplogize for his breach of public trust and familial pains, but come full clean on his financial dealings and if he has misused the funds, resign, and allow the next generation a chance to speak for themselves. We need men in leadership roles who will demonstrate 'lifestyle leadership' rather than talk the talk! Walk the walk.
