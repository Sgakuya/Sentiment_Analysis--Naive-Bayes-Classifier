Denzel Washington is hands-down one of the best actors of our time, and the fantastic performances just keep on coming. Denzel has such depth and range as an actor, and every role he plays seems to come so naturally. He literally becomes his character. Denzel gave a commendable performance as Trip in Glory. His performance as the cynical African American Civil War soldier was truly a prophecy of greater performances to come. His supporting role in Philadelphia was indeed a memoriable one, and it truly added to the film. He also gave a riveting performance as the troubled, alcoholic Colonel Serling in Courage Under Fire in which he investigates the story of a female pilot killed during the Gulf War. Washington then turned in a brilliant (and moving) performance as Coach Herman Boone in Remember the Titans. Like all of his other roles, this role seemed to come so naturally to him, and he was completely believable. In the crime drima Training Day, Denzel Washington undertook a different type of role than he was used to. For the first time, he played the villian. Washington did a fantastic job playing crooked narcotics officer Alonzo Harris. His performance was filled with intensity, and it was quite refreshing to see him undertake a darker role. Equally riveting was his performance in John Q as a desperate father out to save the life of his sick son. Denzel also turned in acceptable performances in Fallen, The Siege and The Hurricane. In the final analysis, Denzel is one of the best actors of our time, and clearly, the best is yet to come.
