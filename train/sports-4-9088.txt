I like Grant, I've always liked him, but he's not in the category still of the next Jordan like he was in maybe 97, 98. There are many question marks for Hill going into 2002-03. One which has yet to be answered is how he and McGrady can coexist. Who is the Magic's leader now? Assuming he can return to his Detroit form, Hill is probably the most versatile player in the game. Nobody combined athleticism, size, passing, scoring, and decision-making like Hill, except maybe Pippen in his prime. I just wonder if his re-return will have a negative impact on the Magic. Rust has to be a major factor as well. It remains to be seen if he can rebound from two ankle injuries in two years.
