HEY CAGE! Your precious Viper is only ranked first by default. Read the ratings and the Viper is tied for first with the Lexus SC with the others not far behind. As for the Supra being ranked 22nd, I guess it's because people like you give it a bad rating without good reason. You're a fool to drop more than 50 grand on Dodge, a so-called high quality car . Have you ever actually owned a Dodge? Buy one and then tell me about it. As for which car would have the biggest crowd around it in a parking lot? I guess yours would cause it's so damn ugly. They'd probably be laughing at your car. Also in case you didn't know, Chrysler isn't exactly in the best of financial health. So guess which model is likely to get the axe first if DamilerChrysler is forced to thin it's line-up? Your Viper! The Avenger is discontinued by the way so it deserves zero stars.....
