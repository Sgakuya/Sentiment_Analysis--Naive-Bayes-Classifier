This is my second favorite album by Joni (the first being Ladies of the Canyon ). Joni shows she is a master of songwriting with her clever, fun and sad lyrics and transient melodies. Her guitar-work is also stunning. The alternate tunings that she uses give extra originality and attitude to her music! she shows that she can can be bluesy and upbeat with songs like All I Really Want and Carrie as well as slow and emotionally stirring on tracks like River and The Last Time I Saw Richard . She also packs a delightful punch with clever mid-tempo ditties like A Case of You and My Old Man . Not only are her songs brilliant, her voice soars above the music with strength, beauty and virtuosity!
