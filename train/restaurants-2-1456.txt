I have never received service this bad anywhere. Upon arrival I pushed the order button and waited. Nothing happened. I tried a total of 3 times over several minutes with no answer. So I went inside, maybe the button didn't work. I waited in plain view while the person in charge did everything possible to avoid me, even going back and talking to one of the cooks, shuffling papers, etc. The one carhop on duty said that the person in charge would help me in a minute. About 5 minutes later, while the console was beeping for someont to order, the carhop went over and took an order then took my order, as the person in charge did absolutely nothing. Twenty-five minutes later when I finally got my food, I tipped the carhop well and got their names. This was at the Sonic in Cherryvale, Kansas on 12/20/02 at 12:30 in the afternoon. The person on duty was Missy and the very helpful carhop is Tasha. This was the worst I have ever been treated anywhere. I do not know these people. If I were the owner I would most certainly have fired missy and made every attempt to give Tasha the chance to move up. I hope nobody else ever has to experience this type of service.
