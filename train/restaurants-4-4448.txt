Great food, but nothing at all like real Australian food. Try finding a good burger in Australia. I challenge you. I couldn't remember one thing on Outback's menu that was actually served in Oz. Real Australian food is second to terrible. I'm not surprised it's a former English colony. Quick note too; 75% of Australians, even in the Outback, are not like Steve Irwin or Crocodile Dundee. To the guy that says upscale restaurants are more expensive than Outback, yeah you're right, but then again, people who eat in upscale restaurants don't usually patronize Outback! Genius. Different market. Great food anyway at Outback. Australia needs more of these restaurants, desperately. There are some in Oz, ironically, btw.
