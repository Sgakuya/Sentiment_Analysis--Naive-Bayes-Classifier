I call them Cocksucking Cox. I have to have them for Internet because there's basically nothing else available in my area. If there's a way to screw it up, Cox will do it--in spades. I had Dishnetwork for a while but I they don't have FitTV or Oxygen so I decided to go back to Cox. So I call them to install and request a DVR. Guy is supposed to get here between 1-3 which pisses me off to begin with. Why can't they give you a specific time? Guy arrives at 4 looking like he got out of prison an hour ago. He spends 5 minutes outside the house doing something, has no DVR with him. Tells me I'm all set. I get in my car drive to Cox and get my DVR. Get home and hook it up. Oh, but it's not a DVR, it's just a digital box. Cox is closed, which is fine because I can only get channels 2-13 anyway. Next available appointment? Saturday between 1 and 3. So the guy shows up at 4. Cox time runs differntly than regular mortal time. Tells me there was a 'trap' on the line. Not sure why. I'm not either, but I can't wait for this pitiful ass company to go out of business.
