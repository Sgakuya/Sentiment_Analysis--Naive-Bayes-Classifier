Anyone who rates this cd any lower than 3 stars either hasn't heard the cd or is afraid to beleive that people outside the nineties originated many of the popular cultures around today. I can understand if he is not your taste but if that's the case you probably didn't buy the cd to rate it. well anyway, all the songs have great rhythms to keep you interested. The lyrics in every song still hit you with that little bit of shock. and classic to his style, there is a comedic song in the little things which is very amusing. The title track gets you set for everything you will hear in the rest of the record. The video Gimme does good on the core of the song. And finally songs like Sanctuary and Cold Machines still show how he knows what it feels like to be alone. It's a great cd that can attract new fans, keep old ones, and hold it's own against any band's music out today with the help of a little marketing.
