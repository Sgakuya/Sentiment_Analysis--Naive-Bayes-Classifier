My parents are from Hungary, and I have visited three times now. It really is a great city. Of course it is going to have dirty sections...Hungary was on the wrong side of two World Wars before being oppressed by Communist Russia. The country is slowly becoming more successful economically and is on it's way to becoming the glorious nation it once was. The food is wonderful, the people are friendly (just try to greet them in Hungarian...not too difficult), and the sites are beautiful. There are other cities outside Budapest that are definitely worth visiting...Pecs, Tihany on Lake Balaton, Szeged..etc. I highly recommend a visit to Budapest to anyone interested in experience "Old" Europe.
