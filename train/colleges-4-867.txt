I received my undergrad degree from UOPHX I found the team experience to be enjoyable and the workload to be difficult. I have heard others who have similar concerns as the ones posted on this site, but I found that the quality of an education is dependent upon the individual and if you are unwilling to learn or unwilling to share your experiences with others you are not going to get an enjoyable experience from UOPHX. When reviewing a University it is important to remember that no matter where you go there are always critics. I am currently in a Senior Management job and I owe it all to UOPHX. I have had professors from Berkeley, Harvard as well as Columbia who have taught at UOPHX. When I understood the caliber of professors UOPHX was determined to bring in I was more than determined to absorb all the information I could from these more than qualified individuals. UOPHX has the best library resources (that they spent thousand on in order to give their students the edge); they are the leaders in online education and I have been amazed by their ability to provide their students with information whenever possible. I have been to traditional colleges and have never had the type of knowledge that UOPHX has for its students at the touch of a button. It is sad that there are those out there that did not take advantage of such great tools. If you are interested in learning more about UOPHX I would encourage you to take the time and take a class and see if it is right for you.
