...The only reason I gave it a single star rating..is simply because I couldn't put in HALF of one! MS should have done a little more in proving out this OS's many issues...but instead they rushed this product out to give the masses some of the immenities enjoyed by those already using Win 2K, which I think, is STILL an awesome OS! I wish I could say I had memorable times when I upgraded to ME from my original Win98SE...but alas, there werent any! There was nothing but confliction with almost all my applications, especially anything Symantec/Norton! After two months of frustration, I re-installed 98, and for about a year, I was putting up with "the issues that ME left behind". When I found that multitasking was getting more and more difficult, regardless of what I did to optimize and/or tweak the parameters...I then decided to completely clean out and re-format my drives, and install Win 2K...probably what I should've done in the first place. Now I've heard feedback from others that ME worked better when you bare bones installed it on a new or cleaned drive, or when you purchased a new computer that was designed to run ME, but NOT when you were upgrading from something older...such as 98. It simply isn't a reliable enough OS for me to trust. Ford had the Edsel...Microsoft had ME....
