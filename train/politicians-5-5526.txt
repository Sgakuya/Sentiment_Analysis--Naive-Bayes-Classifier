Those who question John Kerry's patritism for calling for a regime change in Washington should consider the following: Kerry is a decorated Vietnam Vet. Where was george w while Kerry was getting wounded in combat? Bush went AWOL from the Texas Air National Guard in 1972 to avoid taking a drug test. But now, he has no qualms in sending others to kill and die for his country. We should also ask who reallly supports our troops. How is george w thanking the past and present American military personnel for their service? In January 16, 2003, the Bush Administration announced it will suspend enrollment in the VA health system for at least 160,000 qualified veterans due to budget constraints. Furthermore, the Administration has proposed cutting 15 billion from the veteran programs over the next 10 years. This while proposing tax cuts which provide millionaires a tax break of at least $90,000 per year.
