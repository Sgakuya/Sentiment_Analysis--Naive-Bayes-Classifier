I think the commercials for Carl's Jr. are great - the guy sitting on top of a washing machine just chowing down on a giant cheeseburger - Don't bother me, I'm eating. Intrigued by the commercial, I finally tried a Carl's Jr. Burger a couple of weeks ago at Pac Bell Park. While it was a decent fast-food burger, sadly it was nothing to write home about - and definitely not in the same league as Wendy's. It goes to show you, a good ad campaign does not the burger make. UPDATE: Carl's junior is starting to grow on me. The fries are better than average, and both the Super Star and the Six Dollar Burger are pretty damn good. My favorite thing about Carl's Junior? They wrap the handburgers kind of like a taco, so that you don't drip sauce all over yourself while you eat and drive. It's the simple things that make me happy...
