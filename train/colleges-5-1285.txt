Don't have 1500 on the SAT? Forget it. Actually, that's oversimplified. Last year Duke turned down 50% of its applicants with 1500+ and accepted only 47% of high school valedictorians. Academics rule here, which explains its position as one of the top 5 or 6 research universities in the country. Perhaps its greatest asset is its ability to prepare its undergrads for grad/professional school. A recent Capital Campaign raised over $2.3 billion, a large percentage of which will go for undergraduate financial aid. You get the complete university experience at Duke, and it's more than a one-sport school. Athletically, not only does Duke succeed with men's and women's basketball, but with most "non-revenue" sports as well. Football is the only real problem, and this, too, will change. Meanwhile, focus on the technique of your jump shot, and you'll be fine!
