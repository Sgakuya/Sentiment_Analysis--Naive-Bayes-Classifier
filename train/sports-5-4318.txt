I have to honestly wonder about a person's opinion when they blast a coach with the integrity of someone like Tubby Smith. I was not happy about the loss to Louisville or any other loss Kentucky has had this year or any loss they have ever incurred. I don't know of any coach who has won every game in their entire coaching career. I look at what a coach does after a loss, and the changes he makes to fix problems. I think Tubby Smith has made alot of so-called Kentucky fans eat their harsh words of criticism. He has done this in a class manor not worthy of the likes of these sorry, so-called fans. One only has to look back at what we did to a young man by the name of Roderick Rhodes. He never lived up to the hype the analysts put on him, but he was a steady, unselfish player, and most of all he was a Kentucky Wildcat. He was family, yet he suffered through constant heckling and jeers from the Big Blue Nation. Saul Smith is another example, he incurred some of the ugliest remarks of anyone in blue and white. Is this how we treat our own? We should all be ashamed for what we have become. The time when these players and coaches need us most is when they are losing and when they are down, yet we want to jump off the bandwagon then. I have been on the bandwagon all along, sometimes I have been unhappy, but nonetheless I have stood by Kentucky, and will do so until I die. I just wish the people who have criticized Tubby Smith and the Kentucky players and it's program would leave. They are the ones who deserve the heckling. They are the disgrace of the Big Blue Nation. They should be the ones to leave. They are an embarrassment to the Bluegrass State! The fact is we will probably lose a great coach like Tubby Smith because of these low esteemed people. It would serve them right. Yet we as true Wildcat fans will suffer along with them. Thanks to all of you who call yourselves fans for possibly running off one of the greatest college basketball coaches Kentucky has ever seen!
