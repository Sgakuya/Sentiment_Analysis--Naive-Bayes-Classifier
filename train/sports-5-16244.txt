I think that steve McNair is not just the greatest QB that ever lived, but he is an EVEN BETTER PERSON! I just got his book, running and gunning with Steve McNair! And while yes, it covers only til 2000, you will learn somethings about him that will blow your mind! he is a very special person, for the way that he handles himself! he is the toughest player to ever play the game! he has overcome so many injuries, even a mysterious shoulder infect of which he almost had to give up football, plus, leading the titans from a 1-4 start last season, ALL THE WAY TO THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP! with turf toe, bruised ribs, hurt chin and a bad back! THIS GUY IS THE REAL DEAL, THE TITANS ARE THE BOMB, AND HE WILL HAVE A BREAK OUT SEASON THAT WILL BLOW EVERYONES MIND AND HE WILL BE LEAGUE AND SUPERBOWL MVP! steve is god in cleats!!!! love kim
