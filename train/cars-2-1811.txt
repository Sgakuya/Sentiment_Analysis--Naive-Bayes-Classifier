Nothing but problems! As soon as we get one bizarre problem fixed, we have another one. The wiper mechanism spontaneously combusted recently. My husband went to the Oldsmobile dealer for a replacement part that cost us about $100 (not to mention my husband's hours that went into fixing it). The dealer failed to mention that this particular part was covered by a recall!! Now our air mapping system ??? is going! It's making the car stall, lurch, jump. Our transmission is shifting hard, too, we just found out that Oldsmobile made these cars so that you can't check or change the tranny fluid yourself. You are forced to pay $60+ to have someone do it that has the proper equipment. It's a sexy car. It's cute, spunky, etc. It has guts for it's type of car. It's engine has get up go, BUT it has become a huge hassle. And we're wondering if it will still be drivable when we're done paying it off! Oh, I should mention the leather. Leather doesn't rip, tear, or snag. They should not advertise the interior as leather; it's more like pleather. Oh, it's $700 to replace ONE seat!
