Everything I've read, seen or heard about this guy so far has made my character judgment meter hit somewhere between goofball and dangerous, indecisive people pleaser. He plays the anti-war, Viet Nam protestor one minute and points to his military record the next. He is now spouting the exact opposite opinions concerning statements he made a dozen or so years ago. Just WHO are you Mr. Kerry? I really had to laugh when he immediately jumped on the band wagon to criticize the first of the Republican campaign ads for using a split second of 911 footage. It doesnt take much imagination to realize that if they hadn't mentioned the attacks at all, Kerry would have been whining that they weren't taking it seriously enough. This guy may have the dubious honor of being even more confused and pointless than Ted Kennedy.
