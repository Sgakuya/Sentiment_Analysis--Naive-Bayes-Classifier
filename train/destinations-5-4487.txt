I have up in Miami and lived in NYC (Chelsea) for 5 years. I later moved to San Francisco for 1 year and then to here to Atlanta. I have been here for 3 years and I LOVE it. The city is vibrant. I cannot and would not live in a boring city.The nightlife is good and the architecture of the skyscrapers is splendid. Atlanta is sprawling and the traffic just plain sucks. I meet more people from the NY area here than I would have ever expected. For me, Atlanta represents all of the fun, culture and excitement that I had in NYC, without many of the drawbacks of my $3200 rent and sometimes unbearable winters. The shopping is fabulous with almost everything from Cartier, Tiffany, Nieman-Marcus, Saks and Bloomingdales to small shops like the Boy Next Door. The only thing I miss is Barney's...I'm sure they will have that soon. The greatest thing to me is that I now have a car again, something I missed in Manhattan. The population is diverse, young and hip with lots of attitude just like I like it! If you are a prude or don't like gays then Atlanta is not for you. For me, Atlanta is great and aside from NYC I don't think I would ever consider any other American city and I have visited every single one that matters.
