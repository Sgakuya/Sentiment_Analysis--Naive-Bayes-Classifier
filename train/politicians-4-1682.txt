OK, I'll say it - I was wrong about Arnold. He's doing a good job, and being true to his promises to work across party lines to get stuff done. His star power has been able to accomplish what political experience could not - get people to the negotiating table. I think elected officials from both political parties are scared of him, and this is a good thing. He's high energy, optimistic, and actually, his politics pretty closely match mine - liberal on social issues, conservative on economic ones. Arnold, if you read this, I'm sorry for creating the most disturbing things about you becoming Governor weblist.
