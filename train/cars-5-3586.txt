Always been a gmc/chevy man and always will be, But I tow my boat (chevy motored) with the 1997 Ford Explorer xlt V8 because GM didn't have a vehicle at that time that had a v-8 without being huge for my wife(primary driver). I have the 5.0 and love it. 19 mph on the highway, who knows mpg in the city. Two things went haywire in the 65K mileage since I owned it. Dead battery after about a year and rt side fog light burned out twice. The only other complaint I had was hairline paint cracks in the channels on the roof but no-one could guarentee that they could fix it due to it being a seam between top and sides.It only shows up when you wax (every 6 mos.) I'd buy another one, especially now that they have independent rear suspension. Sport Trac looks like and even better combo. I'll stick to chevy motored boat though!
