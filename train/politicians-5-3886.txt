GEORGE BUSH MAY NOT BE A POLISHED ENOUGH SPEAKER TO WIN THE DEBATES BUT I REALLY DON'T CARE. LOOK WHAT WE GOT EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN MOST AMERICANS VOTED FOR THE CANDIDATE THAT TALKED THE SMOOTHEST! I DON'T GIVE A FIG ABOUT GEORGE BUSH'S DEBATING SKILLS! I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S BENEATH THE POLITICAL FACADE. I LIKE WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND I KNOW WHAT HE LEARNED AT HOME FROM HIS PARENTS. I DON'T AGREE WITH AL GORE'S VALUES OR HIS IDEAS - NO MATTER HOW WELL HE STATES THEM. HE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT-IN-TRAINING FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS UNDER THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MORE TO BREAK DOWN THE MORALS AND FAMILY VALUES OF OUR COUNTRY THAN ELSE HAS EVER DONE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. I THINK HE HAS BEEN A GOOD STUDENT AND THAT HE HAS LEARNED HIS LESSONS WELL - AND I INTEND TO CAST MY VOTE AND MAKE SURE THAT HE DOESN'T GET A CHANCE TO TEACH WHAT HE HAS LEARNED TO MY GRANDCHILDREN!
