The truck, as well as the company,are crap. My truck is used primarily for commuting, all highway driving. The rotors warped within 15k miles. The dealer cut them at my expense. 15k later, they were warped again. This is a common problem with the new rams as well as the jeep grand cerokees. The manufacturer refuses to cover their brake problems and unfortunately chooses a critical component to cut costs. Everyone having similar problems should log on to www.nhtsa.gov and log a complaint. Maybe we can force a recall and make the bastards put good brakes on our trucks! This is my first crysler product. It's also my last.
