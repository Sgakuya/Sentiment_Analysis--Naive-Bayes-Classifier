Obviously BIGBABY is a Ford lover. WAAAAA! He has shot down a bunch of other makes and always recommends the Explorer or Highlander. Try actually buying a vehicle before critiquing it. Trust me, I had a Fix Or Repair Daily (FORD) I had a Jeep Cherokee and thought it was great until I bought my Montero Sport. The only minus I can give is the lack of punch when you stomp the gas pedal. BIG ***** DEAL. I don't off road and I drive safely. The lack of punch is a very small price to pay when you get a vehicle that is better in every other way. A lot of your comments will be based on the dealer. You can take it to ANY Mitsubishi dealer for service. Some are good, some are bad.
