Rudy Giuliani was the greatest mayor in the history of New York City. His uncanny leadership and assertion abilities set an example for current and future leaders of major cities world wide. Prior to his inception, NYC treasures, such as Times Square, were havens for prostitutes and criminials. Rudy took back the city from such evil elements and reasserted New York as the capital of the world. Although I believe he could have avoided half the television cameras following 9-11 and he certainly did not need to be in the dugout at the all-star game, he did an exceptional job as mayor. Anyone who believes that the incredible growth and prosperity NYC experienced during the 1990s was a result of Koch and Dinkins is dangerously delusional and probably needs to be institutionalized. Ultimately, I wish Rudy could be president but I am afraid his personality would prevent him from achieving such prestige. However, if Rudy chooses to run for governor or senator, watch out! I guarantee he will win.
