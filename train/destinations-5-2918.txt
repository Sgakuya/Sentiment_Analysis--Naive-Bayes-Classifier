I can't see how you can't respect New York City. We all started out here, it is the port into america, or at least it was, now that has unfortunetly turned into the makeshift bridges accross the Rio Grande. I can see how somebody would not want to live in NYC, it could be overwelming, but i dont see how you can just hate it, you would have to be very close minded. I DO REALIZE THAT THERE IS MORE TO AMERICA THAN NYC. It's just that, NYC has every bit of america, Atleast, all of the cultures. For anyone coming to america, i would of course say visit NYC, it is our greatest city, but its not our only city. See the rest of America as well. Just make sure that you go to NYC first, because a great deal of the rest of the country (99% of whome have never been there) don't like NYC and think that it is nothing but snobby rich people or criminals. WRONG! I will be first to admit, i don't think that i would want to live in Manhattan, but maybe some other boroughs like staten island or brooklyn, sure! And i would live in almost anywhere in the area around NYC. As hard as it may be to believe, the entire metropolitan area of new york even though it spans three states, feels like a big family of 30 million people!!! Its just great, its the capitol of the world. People from all over the world and all walks of life meating at the crossroads of the world. This is going to sound very corny, but if there is ever a free united world, New York would have to be the capitol, no other city comes close. And everyone who reads this, what do you think the chances are that evilone as she is so perfectly named, has ever actually been to NYC or eaten the pizza?
