Robert Redford directed this fairy tale film about golf, and it resembles no other movie so much as The Natural, the great mid-80s fairy tale baseball movie that he starred in, with perhaps a dash of Field of Dreams as well. That's to say that it's beautifully filmed, a little cheesy, more than a little predictable, but well executed and very enjoyable to anyone that wants to like it. Cynical moviegoers need not apply, as the Yoda-like character played by Will Smith is tough to swallow (Smith's low-key charm goes a long way to making the mystical Bagger Vance believable). But it's pretty to watch and generally uplifting, so it deserves a cautious recommendation.
