He meets the Shaq in NCAA's, granted Shaq is a little younger and smaller{not by much}and Uconn creams them. I know they lost the next game but after that who cared, went farther then they should that year.Took Northeastern into the Hartford Civic Center at a Uconn Christmas sponsered tournament, you know how that works and who is set up to win, not this year, Northeastern creamed, not beat but creamed DON Perno and the Huskies, I think 2 years later Don is gone and the rest is history. He meets Duke in the NCAA finals 1999, heavy underdog against the Blue Devils and Coach K, you know what happens.This year what can I say.Yes he had the players but he not only had them he molded them and got them to their potential and personally I believe if the officiating in the Duke game was a normal well officiated game for both sides he would have run Duke off the floor, my opinion only. I also like that he is feisty and speaks straight on all subjects. He has founded a Cancer and heart foundation. He represents his school with class and honesty. Is he perfect, probably not but he is a class coach. I would never say the best but he is right up there with those considered the best. Give him the horses and he will get the most out of them. I know his graduation rate is not that of Duke's but he has had a lot of players leave early for the Pro's and the majority are doing better then just average, he also had players leave for Europe who had not done so well, three I know of and he feels bad that they did not get their degree but they were freemen who made their own decisions. He's not perfect but in my eyes he's close.
