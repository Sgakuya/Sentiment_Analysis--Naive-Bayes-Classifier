Bibi Netanyahu was the first Israeli Prime Minister to run an American style campaign. He even speaks nearly perfect American English, you can find him doing media appearances here because he can elicit the sympathy of Americans much better than other Israeli politicians. He lost re-election to Ehud Barak in 1999 but now serves as Finance Minister under Ariel Sharon's Likud government. He's a bit of a nutcase; he has and still does suggest to the Americans that we take the fight Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Iran and just for fun Egypt and Saudi Arabia all in the purpose to establish a more secure realm. That's foolishly naive at best; it's certainly not in America's interests to be taking up these wars and Israel would invoke the wrath of the millions of Arabs by doing this. You want to secure your realm, not de-stabilize it further!
