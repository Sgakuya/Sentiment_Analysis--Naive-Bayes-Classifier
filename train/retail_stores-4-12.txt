Quality can vary from store to store, but I do find myself patronizing them pretty regularly, particularly if I want to grab a book, CD, or DVD quickly. I don't have a personal preference for them over Borders, or vice versa, but it does bother me that these big corporate chains have suffocated a lot of the smaller, independently run bookstores, which simply couldn't keep up and went out of business. One of my all-time favorite bookstores used to be Womrath's in Hackensack, NJ, which had been there for decades. It's gone now, thanks to the corporate chains like B and N and Borders. Of course, I can't really get on my moral high-horse in this instance, as I patronized the corporate chains even as I patronized stores like Womrath's and the Happy Booker in Morristown. But it is sad...
