I'm not really a pickup truck kinda guy but I rented one of these for an extended period of time and I have to say I was quite impressed. Perhaps I don't have a lot to compare it to other than the occasional ride in someone else's truck but I really liked this truck. Not much acceleration but hey it's a truck right. Comfortable inside I drove it on a couple of 17 hour trips. I found it to be quiet on the highway, smooth riding, easy to handle, great visibility from all directions, very very accomodating. The only complaint I have is that with the hardcover for the bed there wasn't a lot of height to carry stuff. From the bed to the cover is probably only aobut 2 feet.
