i have only been dipping for about 2 years and started out with skoal b/c it tasted pretty good, not a great buzz(at all), but did the job, then i went to grizzly(packs a little more punch)wintergreen, and everybody told me straight was the best thing out there. I figured everybody crazy, but it turns out i was thinking of natural, so i went to straight, which up until recently i thought was the best thing out there. I was desperate for a dip and my friend had some copenhagen black, i was like okay, this is gonna be nasty, I was wrong copenhagen is the shiz niz, really strong though, but good. now i am a ferm believer in Copenhagen. And one more comment, i understand the consequences of dipping and i have thought about quiting many a time(did for a week 1/2),but depending on the person it can take anywhere from a year to 35 years for mouth cancer to set in, just remember, it's a choice and you have the right to make your own decisions on how you lead your life and/or set examples for the youth of america today.Brush Your Teeth, use peroxide after brushing, and be safe.
