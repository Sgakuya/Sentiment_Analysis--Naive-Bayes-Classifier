Too many people rating the US as a tourist destination seem to be a. from the US and b. never seem to have left the US on holidays or, on the other hand never seem to have left Europe. I am from Ireland and last summer i was in the US for 8 weeks.It was the best holiday ive ever had. Started in New York made my way down to New Orleans (31 hours by train) which is the best place i have ever been, party city. Then travelled up to Chicago. Went to Canada for two weeks then back to Boston then home. There is so much to do and see, so many things to experience from huge cities to absolute wilderness. We went out canoing beside New Orleans and saw aligators which was amazing. Lots of great museams, buildings, resteraunts, bars and the weather compared to where I'm from is great in the summer, American people are generally very nice if a little naive about the world. They really do not know much about the outside world and assume that its the most free country in the world with the greatest justice system and the richest all round people. This is obviously not true, and becomes quite evident when visiting places like Holland or Switzerland or some other European countries which are much more free, safe and rich. Militarily and industrially the US is top though. But all this is irrelevant, the US is a great place to visit, the people are very nice, it has its problems but so does everywhere country. In the US you can experience every possible good and every possible evil. It is a huge country. A lot of people disagree with the US government and for some reason assume every american is fat, stupid, gun-toting and narrow minded. These are not reasons to stay away from the US which overall is a great country. Whatever your views on George Bush and his policies may be, you should still visit.
