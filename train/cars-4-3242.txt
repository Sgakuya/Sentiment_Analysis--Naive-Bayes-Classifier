I own a 2004 Renegade, bought it new. This vehicle handles great in the snow and mud. Light bar is very helpful when wheelin at night. Horsepower is great, considering the class comparisons. The interior gives you the look of a wrangler with the comfort of a Larado. Factory skid plates have also come in very helpful except when it comes time to remove the oil filter, however, a K&N oil filter with the nut will fix that problem. Brakes are very poor, perhaps the worst on any vehicle i have ever owned. The rotors are warped/glazed and pads down to about 25% life after only 12,000 miles. It also seems to have a vibration in the power train, Jeep can't seem to correct the problem. It has a locking torque converter which is good for gas milage on the high way, but in the mountians of PA, it seems to be shifting from 4th to 3rd and vice-versa all the time. All around this is a solid vehicle. A great choice if you are considering a escape xterra as i was. The vehicle is also very modable. A simple addition of a K&N cold air, helix power tower throttle body spacer, and Borla duel exhaust really open up that motor and give a V8 sound with the gas milage of a V6. There are also a wide variety of lifts, aftermarket skids (if you don't get the renegade package), bumpers, winches, and other offroading equipment. The handling of this vehicle is debatable. I have owned several late model mustangs before my liberty, and I must say that it doesn't compare. However, for a suv with the short wheel base, it does quite well when under the rights. THis is a great choice for a dad who loves the adventure of a jeep, but has problems putting a car seat in his wrangler. And for the younger crowd, like myself, makes a great party vehicle for you and your friends. I would definatly purchase another renegade and plan on doing so in 3 years.
