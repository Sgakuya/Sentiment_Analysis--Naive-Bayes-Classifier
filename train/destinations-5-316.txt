Overlooked gem of Australia. The cleanest best laid out, prettiest and friendliest city in Australia too. We always come back here for the worlds best wines and food. The climate is pure mediterranean and it has a culture and ambience that really no other Aussie city can match. It has the greatest number of pubs, retaurants and cafes per capita in Australia. Actually, Adelaide has 1 restaurant for every 32 people which may be a record?? It has great beaches and it the gate way to the best outback country. I only hope it stays how it is, as some of the other cities (sydney, melb and even perth) have been ruined by tacky devolopment and freeways through the city center! Great place! Go there...
