From the very first track, Thunder Road, this album is superb! Thunder Road is soooo beautiful! Also, 10th Ave. Freeze Out, and Backstreets have a sound that is unmistakeable rock and roll! She's the One and Meeting Accross the River give some depth and variety. Born to Run and Night are nothing less than perfect music that makes you want to get up and go somewhere! And of course, what song on this planet can compare with Jungleland? None at all! That song is so powerful, and even though its 10 minutes long, I say it should be longer! Just picture that song live! Well, anyway, its the most awesome album, and it shows us why John Landau made his now famous quote, I have seen rock and roll future and his name is Bruce Springsteen! This album is AWESOME!!!! The Boss is the BEST!!!
