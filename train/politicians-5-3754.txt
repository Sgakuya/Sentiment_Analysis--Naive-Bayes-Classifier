I believe that Bush will make an excellent President for this country! Far more excellent than the lying, cheating, and adultery i have seen for the past 8 years! Yes, he may have a DUI record, but don't you see, that he has turned over a new leaf and is trying to right the wrong he committed. I would rather vote for a person who is willing to say he was wrong than to vote for someone with no backbone at all. Gore has spent his life almost entirely in Government, Bush has actually lived in the real world and knows what is best for the American people. Another reason I would rather have Bush is that he is a much more moral person than Gore. Anybody who can back up Clinton and agree with his kind of thinking is putting his talents and abilities to waste. The ungodliness in this country through the past 8 years under the Clinton-Gore administration has risen sky-high while our morals have been driven into the dirt. How can we trust a President who says one thing to one group of people then turn around and say something totally different to another group of people. That is what I call a two-faced guttersnipe of a liar! And that is exactly what Gore is. Bush may not be perfect, but as I live and breathe, I will support him through this whole ordeal! May God have mercy on this sin trod country!
