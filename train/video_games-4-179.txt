Well, I'm not sure if this is a step up or a step back from the previous Quake games. The graphics and AI are immensely improved, the characters are original, and the weapons are fun and exciting. However, the single player factor, which is the most fun for me, since I can rarely play games in multiplayer mode. Gone is the story based mission format from Quake 2. The are replaced by sometimes colorful, sometimes creepy arenas in which either real players are pitted against each other or one player is pitted against a variety of AI opponents. This is fun, but it can get old really fast. This game is basically a death match only game, with a few variations like cooporative and capture the flag modes. Apparently Unreal Tournament is a lot deeper, but I have never played it, so I won't compare them. The sound has stayed pretty much the same. Great fast paced rock beats help your way through the frenzy. Jump pads and power ups assist you on your quest to make the most kills. This the multi player mode Quake 2 should have had. Bottom line: Buy this if you're a quake fan or if you just wanna blow things up. Fun, but no more than a multiplayer shoot em up.
