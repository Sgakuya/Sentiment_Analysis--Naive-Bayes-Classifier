2005 is certainly a different season for the Dolphins. They started slow but have played very good football the last few weeks winning some tough games on the west coast. I believe a lot of credit should be given to head coach Nick Saban. They clearly outplayed San Diego this past weekend and looked disciplined and very tough on the offensive line. Though I'm not sold on Gus Ferotte I believe they can win out their last three games if he doesn't make any stupid mistakes (like slamming his head into the goalpost). The Dolphins have an easy schedule the rest of the way even though they play New England the last week of the season. The game will be a lot less important to New England at the time since they will have clinched the division or at the very least a playoff berth.
