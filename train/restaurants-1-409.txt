Wendy's Spinach Salad is considered fairly new in their menu. Two weeks ago, I ordered one Spinach Salad and my experience was totally fabulous. The whole salad is made of spinach leaevs, shredded bacon, eggs, cherry tomatoes. Yesterday, I ordered Wendy's Spinach Salad at a different Wendy Franchisee - my experience was totally aweful. The salad I had only had spinach leaves on the very top of the salad - beneath the surface, they used lots of lettuce instead of spinach. I felt cheated. Quality of food is standardised throughout the same fast food chain, isn't it? Next time, when you go order Wendy's Spinach Salad, watch out! Ask them about the contents of their Spinach Salad if you are going to order that!!!
