Nice movie. Two sisters who are very different. Cameron Diaz is Maggie the wild kind of screw up younger sister.Rose Toni Collette is the Lawyer more grounded responsible sister. Their mother died when they were little girls. The dad raised them. Rose has always looked after her less responsible younger sister. After a big fight and Maggie has nowhere to go {her step mom kicked her out}she finds out she has a grandmother she did not remember. she goes to Florida to see her and the grandma lets her live there . She lives in a nive retirement community . Maggie finds she does well there working in the home and the elderly people like her. Rose gets a letter from the grandmother she goes. down.so the she can see the grandma. Won't give away the rest. Has some very nice momments. a likable movie. Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley MacClaine were all good.
