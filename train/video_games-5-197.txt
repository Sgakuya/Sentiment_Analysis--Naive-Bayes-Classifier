Rainbow Six and its sequel, Rogue Spear, will redefine your attitudes on the increasingly hackneyed first-person shooter genre. What removes it from the tired mayhem of games such as Quake and Unreal Tournament is its deliberate pace. You must carefully plan your attack, and then carry it out by systematically clearing the enemy from rooms and spaces. The graphics engine add to the realism, along with the wide-range of weapons and accessories, expecially in Rogue Spear. All this, and a rather entertaining plot-line, not surprising since these games are put out by accomplished thriller author Tom Clancy. Plus, the game really shines in multiplayer, where the games tend to be more varied than the endless, brainless meelee of the Quake set. Also recommended: Swat 3 from Sierra.
