A very talented actress yes but not one of the all time greats. All time greats need to show excellence in a range of acting types (for example, comedy as well as drama) and I don't think she's done that yet. As for her leftist politics, she's welcome to have them and promote them, but there is often something disturbing about how many leftists don't really want true freedom for all, just for freedom in ways they define it. There was an article recently where Ms. Sarandon spoke of wishing that there would be a compulsory system where young people would spend two weeks in a different culture as a way to experience the world. Maybe a good idea, but why not let it be a choice for people rather than compulsory? I thought forcing people to do things that were supposedly good for them was only a fascist way of doing things. Who would of thought that a so-called good hearted liberal leftist would be guilty of the same transgression?
