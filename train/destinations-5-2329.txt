I have to agree with a lot of other of the comments on this page: Prague is beautiful - even enchantning - but during the summer it is completely overrun with tourists. That said, it is still definitely worth a visit - lots to see and do, and also a great base for visits to castle Karlstejn, Tabor and even Ceske Budejovice, home of the original Budweiser Budejovicky Budvar. Prague itself offers beautiful 19th century architecture, a great cultural scene (music, art, theatre, etc.) and a lot of nice restaurants and bars. There is a reason why I've visited the city five times (No, I am not a Czech, nor do I live in the Czech Republic ;-).
