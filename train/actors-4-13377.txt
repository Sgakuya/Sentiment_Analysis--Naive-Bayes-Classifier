I think as far as the acting goes, Demi is superb, if not Oscar worthy ! I enjoyed almost every movie she was in, and I definately think she is ageless when it comes to her outer beauty. There is a reason why this woman is a living legend in Hollywood. HOWEVER, if you look at her personal life, it leaves something to be desired, even though it really isn't anyone's business. Sometimes I think people can go a little overboard when it comes to rating celebrities, almost to a psychotic level ! When you are supposed to be rating the acting, you rate them personally, it makes no sense. But even I have been guilty of this. I guess it is human nature. ANYWAYS, I do recommend watching Demi in her movies. Excellent actress !
