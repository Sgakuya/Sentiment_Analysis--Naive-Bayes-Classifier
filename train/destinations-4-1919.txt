I'm a Canadian, and I can safely say that I admire most things about the United States. Americans and their country get a bad rap, and its true their government (not the country as a whole) has done some questionable things in the past, but I don't think any country has a perfect track record. On average, Americans are decent, hard-working people. One of the only countries where profits is not a dirty word, and has to spend so much time saving the rest of the planet from itself, yet it gets its face spit in way more than its share. Stand proud, America: some of us out here still respect you. (Just get rid of that godawful pro wrestling and weak beer!)
