Marlboro Reds 100's are the best non-menthols out there overall. Very rich tasting, and I can chainsmoke as many as 5 of these cigarettes easily. I smoked Marlboro Reds 100's for a while when I first started smoking, and this is my second time around enjoying them after smoking only Newports for the past 2.5 years. I think Reds are better not just because of their rich taste, but they're also not as strong as Newports. Yeah. Reds are made by Phillip Morris, but even if I DO get cancer from smoking these cigarettes, it would be stupid of me to turn around and sue PM. Not when I'M the one who decided to start smoking. If you would like to talk with a pro-smoker, drop me a message, or you can even check out my pro-smoking website.
