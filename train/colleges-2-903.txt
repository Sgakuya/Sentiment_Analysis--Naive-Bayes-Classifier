My experience at DeVry was one that I would not go through again if I had a second chance. I would advise those thinking of going to DeVry to do their research on the school first before putting thousands of dollars into DeVry's pockets. Here's a quick rundown of my experience: 1) I had no problem with financial aid, cuz I figured, if DeVry wanted its money they would do everything in their power to get me the loans and grants I needed to pay them... which they did. 2) The majority of the classes in my particular field, Electronics Engineering Technology, were lacking competent, motivated professors. The quizzes and tests they give were mostly open book and open notes with questions that were the same as the ones on your notes or book, or very similar to them. All you had to do was replace old numbers with new ones and you got yourself an A. There were some professors who cared, but not too many. I would say that the general ed. professors cared more than the professors in my major. But what good is that if you want to learn electronics. There were professors I had who talked bad about DeVry during class, that's when I knew how big of a mistake it was to go to DeVry. I had no choice, but to stay. I was getting old and going to a regular college would take too many years. That's an upside to DeVry, if you pass all your classes you'll be out in 3 years or less, depending on your degree. 3) I graduated DeVry Magna Cum Laude, which, if DeVry was tougher on their curriculum and not have professors who give easy As, I can say, I would never have gotten. I would rather have an average GPA and good intruction, rather than a high one and not learn as much as I should have considering the cost of the school. Maybe I didn't put enough effort into learning as much as I could. But imagine what my GPA would of been if I did... 4.0?
