Not even half as good as Hogi Yogi or Blimpie's, much less Subway -which the best national sub chain in my opinion. The bread is quite often stale, and the toppings -quality wise and sheer variety- are quite mediocre. The very name gourmet sandwiches is very inaccurate and an absolute joke. The sandwiches have the appearance and taste of a very amateur homemade sandwich, no exaggeration. You know that a restaurant that boasts real mayonnaise as a primary amenity of their sandwiches is pathetic and doesn't have much going for them. At least the Jimmy John's in my town delivers (what other sub chains deliver?) to residences and their deliveries are pretty fast.
