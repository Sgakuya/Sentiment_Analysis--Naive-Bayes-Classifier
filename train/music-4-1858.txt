After a few experimental albums (think: Suzanne Vega in her 99.9 Farenheit Degrees phase, or U-2's stint of Brian Eno-produced albums... supposed to be forward thinking but really just high-tech noise) Tori returns to an album of just plain great songs. She is still the supreme artsy-faery goddess of song, Joni Mitchell's soul in the body that Stevie Nicks USED to have, with just a sprinkle of pixie dust to let you know she's still got it. Boy oh boy, she still has got it. If you're going to buy this CD, get the Deluxe verion, with all the cool add-ons and supplementary stuff. It ranks up there with her first two albums, and is at least the equal of Boys For Pele, minus the harpsichord.
