I have to give Cell One 5 stars considering where I live. My choices are very limited, it is either Unicell used to be Cell 2000, which is very spotty service, Verizon, which is even worse, only service on major highways here in Northern Minnesota. I noticed that someone else mentioned that their CellOne is owned by Dobson, mine is as well, based in Duluth. They are nice to deal with on the phone. I have dealt with a few rude Cellone employees in person. Oh, and I also got my 50 bucks back on my rebate when I switched plans. I have always recieved notices of special offers in the mail. People are always going to have a good expericence or a bad experience with companies.
