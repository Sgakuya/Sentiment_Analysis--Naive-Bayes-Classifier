I had the opportunity to speak with Nader at Niagara County Community College in Sanborn, New York, back in 1990. He was speaking about the dangers of a government that failed to heed its citizens in a consumer-oriented society. I found him to be knowledgeable, pleasant, and brutally honest. I feel he speaks for the average American who may feel intimidated by our elected officials. Because I find him honest and forthright, perhaps that is why so many jaded, cynical politicians find him a threat to their privileged status in this country. His book, Unsafe at Any Speed, is a must-read if you want to find out more about cover-ups in not only the auto industry, but in big business as well. There's a lot of unpleasantries in our country that certain people do not want Joe Bag-o-Doughnuts to know about. Nader's got balls, my friends. Kudos to an unassuming man who truly wants the best for the American public!
