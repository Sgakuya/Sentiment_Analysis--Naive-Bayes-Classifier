While I do not consider myself a political expert of any sort and normally refrain from leaving political comments, I do care about this nation and am concerned about where its headed. I went and saw this film on Friday to find out for myself what all the fuss/acclaim was about. First of all I suggest everyone watch the film and then make up their own opinion- without relying on the news or anyone else's hearsay. As for me personally, I did not find it Anti-Bush propaganda as it has been called. Rather it was Michael Moore's own interpretation on the president and his time in office. I find it outrageous that if a person so much as lifts an eyebrow against the president, they are accused of dissention. I personally have always been against the war in Iraq and feel Bush has gotten this country neck-deep in trouble. This film merely affirmed my own ideas that its time we got someone else in office. This film is a mixed bag- humorous at times, quite thought provoking and even painful. Some scenes of the soldiers, our boys who are dying out there, and their interviews hit too close to home...but maybe that's what America needs to wake up. As I said, please see it and draw your own conclusions- you might be surprised by what you find.
