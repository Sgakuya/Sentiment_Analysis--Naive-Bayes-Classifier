I find it funny, looking at some of the past (and sparsely smattered) negative comments. I believe we all have something in us, which makes us beat to the beat of different drummers so I will try to be tolerant here. But I guess I just cant imagine spending one of lifes precious moments bashing someone that I didnt care about. Unless perhaps I felt that I had a valid and purposeful reason for bashing him. Even then Id probably try to be somewhat constructive and not use words such as dweeb and sucksbut just cause Id want to be taken seriously, ya know? But then maybe thats just me. Anyway, feel free to count me among those who beats to the beat of an incredible voice and accompanying airdrums. For those who got that no explanation is necessary. For those who didnt just be still for a moment... and listen. It will be the end of your stillness.
