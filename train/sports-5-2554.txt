I actually know Theo Epstein in Person and not to mention his entire family up to his sister in law. I hate to see ppl posting clueless opinions about him, when clearly he has nothing to do with Brawls, or anything of that sort, what happens on the field during the game is not his responsibility. The job of the General Manager is to trade players, and work out contracts for the players and employees. He is not responsible for brawls at all, and i think he has done a load better than most GMs we have had on the Red Sox team, we got pretty far last year. Theo is an amazing GM. Mayb i'm a little bias because i know him. but i hate to run across forums of ppl who have ignorant opinions about whether Theo is doing his job or not, when he has done a great job for someone just coming onto the team. He has tried to get good players for the Red Sox, but unfotunately it is hard for the Red Sox to out bid a lot of these rich teams (like the Yankees). It is only a matter of time b4 we get to the World Series, and i believe if any GM can get us there Theo Epstein is the one.
