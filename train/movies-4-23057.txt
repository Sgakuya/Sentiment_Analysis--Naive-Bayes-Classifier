SCI-FI movies don't wash with the missus, so I had to wait for the kids to grow up to rent it under the guise of family movie time. Missus was asleep within the first half hour. My 10 year old boy tired of it 3/4 the way through. But me and my 8-year old girl dug it. Having seen the first three (now being called IV, V, and VI) many years ago, I liked how the characters we all know quite well, really started out. Who would have guessed Darth Vader would start out as a nerdy little kid? While for the most part (in Star Wars standards), the movie was widely panned, I thought it was just fine. It had lots of action and the special effects have improved vastly from the first iterations, though good for its day, now look like Revell models on strings. The light saber fight between Qui-Gon and Darth Maul was suberb -- better than anything in any of the Matrices. Even the much-maligned Jar-Jar (Or as my daughter used to call him, Booty Man) was comic relief. I think there may have been a PC issue with him, if you know what I mean. In the final analysis, those people that are so critical of Phantom Menace, probably are still living in Mom's basement and waiting for their next gig after their dot.com job disappeared in the Internet bust. Stop taking this stuff so serious and just enjoy the movie for what it is.
