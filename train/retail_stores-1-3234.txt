I have been a loyal Blockbuster customer for over 10 years . I have dutifully rented and returned every movie on time. For this I have been shouted at because of simply asking a question about a 2-for-$20 sale on previewed movies (I asked if I could buy one for $10.00). I have had make special trips to Blockbuster at least 3+ times to straighten out incorrect late charges only to find out the DVD's weren't shelved or improperly shelved. Also, their late fees are abominable. I read on the internet that 20% of their profit is from late fees. At any rate, after over 10 years business I still felt like a newbie everytime I would go in the store. Blockbuster does not deserve to be in business in my estimation. I'm turning to Netflix!
