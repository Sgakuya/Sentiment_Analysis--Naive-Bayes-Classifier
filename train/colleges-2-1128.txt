Harvard may have a great reputation, but by all indications it is very overrated. A few years ago my son was recruited by Harvard. We visited Boston and the Harvard campus and were very unimpressed. At the convocation for prospective students and their parents, there was no one who could or would answer any questions. We were basically told that Harvard was a great and wonderful place and that's all you needed to know. My son decided on a close to home Southern university where he graduated with honors and made Phi Beta Kappa. If your child is interested in a highly selective university or college, he or she would do well to consider Chapel Hill (UNC), Duke, Vanderbilt or several other schools in the South. Consider also that in 2004 even The University of Alabama had more All-Academic Undergraduate Scholars than Harvard.
