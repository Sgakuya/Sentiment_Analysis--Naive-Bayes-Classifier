I respect what John Carpenter was trying to do here, but it kind of fell short. He was trying to do something no horror series has ever done. Taken the title and kept giving it different stories and none of them conecting but with a running theme...HALLOWEEN! This movie might have faired better as its own movie rather than a sequel for a Michael Myers hungry fan based series. A very original concept, but done kind of low standard. In other words, it could have been lots better. Still, it manages to be a cruel and unusual sci-fi horror film. It was a very unconventional story that you can tell was handled like a regular horror flick. Could have been really good.
