UPDATE: Great point from MYThoughtsOnThis. I totally forgot abouth the wine vineyards in the finger lakes region. But seriously, the winters in the upstate are suicidal with the continuous clouds and snowbursts. It was nice, however, not being tailgated by pickups with confederate flag license plates. (2/29/04) I'm surprised at some of the poor ratings people have given this fine state. I would imagine most of the poor reviews are from some resident of Pigs Loins, Arkansas or some similar ungodly podunk craphole. Prior to the 911 attacks if someone had askled me what people from New York were like I would have said rude, cold, uncaring, etc. But I have to say, I was very impressed with the way New Yorkers took care of one another. Their sense of giving to those in need was nothing short of stellar and the city has a remarkable mayor who remained very composed throughout the ordeal. Being from Florida, I seriously wonder whether the residents of this state would have responded in similar fashion had a terrorist attack of that magnitude hit my state. I hate to say it but I don't think we would have been as selfless. The same could be said for the other transient states and cities in this country. People who make blanket statements about New York have either never been to the city or never had the opportunity to see the beauty of the upstate. The Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown is well worth a visit and located in the beautiful Catskill Mountains. Besides the BHOF, there are numerous clean lakes and plenty of ski resorts. Because of the state's location, other big cities like Philly and D.C. can be visited within a day's drive. Boston and Toronto are a short drive away as well
