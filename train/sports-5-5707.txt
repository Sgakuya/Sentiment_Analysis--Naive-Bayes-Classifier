Sean May is an all around fabulous player! His presence in the paint is undeniable. He has impecable scoring abilities against some of the biggest players in college basketball. He has uncontested might in bringing down and maintaining the rebounds. But he also has the smarts to diversify. He is an amazing player! He has worked so hard to improve his game and be where he is today. He most definately deserves all the praise and alcolades everyone has been giving him. And as for the comment from ems4duke: I guess that last Carolina-Duke game proved who was better between Sean May and Shelden Williams. With 26 points and an unheard of 24 rebounds, the undeniable winner is Sean May... probably the best center in the NCAA. Anyone who doubts that Sean May is better than Sheldon Williams should check out this picture at ESPN.com: http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/photos?photoId=701634&gameId=250650153
