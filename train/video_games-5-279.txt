Presto Studios did an Excellent job with this license. The Myst series has always held the highest standard in first person adventure, often years ahead of it's time. Presto integrated an updated version of its own 360 engine from it's highly-acclaimed Journeyman Series and give it a new lease on life including 3D accelerator support, full-screen rotation, environmental sound (supporting all accelerated sound cards), fully orchestrated music and seemless integration of live characters, to name a few. Another notable feature is Presto's talent in keeping system requirements to bare minimum, where you don't have to buy a new system to play it; in fact, you can play it on a 233mhz Pentium II with no acceleration at all and run smoothly. The control interface is simple enough for most kids, and there is no gore or inappropriate themes; this is a classic family game. Lastly, this game can be played with no previous knowledge of the the first two Myst games. So go ahead and buy it! You will not be sorry.
