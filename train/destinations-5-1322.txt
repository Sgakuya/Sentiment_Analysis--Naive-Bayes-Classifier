Germany has a great array of things to recommend it, from natural beauty, to architectural attractions, to high-tech goods and gadgets of all kinds. Comments based on numerous visits between 1972 and 1996. The Germans run the gamut from extremely friendly to rude, obstinate, and self-inflated. German customs officials can be pompous, narrow-minded, and in some instances, just plain dumb. The Bavarians are fine to deal with, but in some other places, people can be overly bureaucratic with too much of a passion for Alles in ordnung. Food generally is good, but mostly a little heavy for my taste. I'm not a beer drinker, but the conventional wisdom is that German beers are great. The wines, in my opnion, are not very good at all; no match for Spanish or Italian, but maybe as good as French (which is not saying a lot in my estimation). Hotels and gasthauses I have stayed in were always very good to excellent in terms of cleanliness and breakfasts, but spotty in terms of service. German drivers are skillful enough, but be really careful driving in the fog; I saw one series of accidents on the Autobahn once that had over 50 cars piled up in 11 separate accidents (I stopped counting after that). Overall, it's a country with a lot of variety and beauty, with high prices to match for the most part. The people are a blessing and a bane at times. Nice place to visit at least once, if not more often.
