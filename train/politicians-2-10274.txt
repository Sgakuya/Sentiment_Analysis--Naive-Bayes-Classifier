It's amazing how many 1 and 5 stars GWB has received by Rate-it-All reviewers. I suppose he is a fairly extreme topic but here's my opinion. GWB is probably better for America than Al Gore, considering that Al Gore is a pacifist who probably would have apologised to Muslims after 9/11.GWB also started term strongly, succeeding in Afghanistan, but I'm not so sure about Iraq. Yes, I know he kicked Saddam out and then captured him, but what about the number of US soldiers killed there- in the past month, say, about 34. And look at the US economy. Yes, it wasn't it's fault that it's a mess and it is getting better but hey, the National Debt is getting bigger and bigger. I think Cheney is more of a factor in his decisions than the CIA is, especially when Cheney is a complete civilian. If I was American, I would think about voting for someone else.
