A dream come true!Paris is the most amzaing and wonderful I have been. I do speak french so I'll admit the French will treat you better when you speak their language. I would suggest staying in the Chamo-Elyees district. It is close to everything. The Arc de Triomphe, the Grand Palais and Pont Alexandre III. It is romantic, but it is also a place to just have fun. From the Moulin Rouge to Versailles the things to do are endless. And please please please visit Montmartre.Sacre Coueur is breathtaking! Montmartre os the highest point in Paris and you can see everything from here. It is a beatnik kind of place. Artists live in the area and you can buy some beautiful art vor pretty cheap. Visit Paris whenever you can!
