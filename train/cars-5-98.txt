Nobody seems to have a clue anymore, I mean thee is this awesome quad that is almost race-ready as soon as you buy it and people are dissing it. I've owned 5 sport quads and with every one they just keep getting better. The Honda is my current quad and is by far the best one yet, I've had the raptor 660, banshee, yfz450, 400ex and this one. I dont care what anybody says especially Yamaha guys, on the trail or track it hardly has anything to do with the machine your on but you yourself the rider. I took my 400ex to a trail system up here in Canada and couldnt find a raptor , banshee, yfz450 or a 450R that could stick with me in trail. As you all can tell I'm not really biased towards Quad makers just the people who ride them ALL talk
