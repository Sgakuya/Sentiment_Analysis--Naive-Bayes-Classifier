Purchased a 2004 Purple/Black Busa on 04/01/04, so am still in break-in mode. Bike obtained from Cycle Sports Hawaii, and had accessories pre-ordered and installed before pick-up: DD chromed slip-ons, double bubble chrome wind screen, 5-spoke chrome wheels, chrome passenger grab bar, rider & passenger gel seats w/Hayabusa kanji, braided brake & clutch lines, under tail kit w/LED turn signals. I did these mods simply for show, as I have no intention to seek any more power from this beast. This speed pig has more capablility than I dare to explore. Besides, there just isn't enough road on the island of Oahu to even make the attempt. As far as blackflag33... I agree with letereat: that boy's just blowing smoke. The Hayabusa is an outstanding machine!
