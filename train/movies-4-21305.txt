One of my favorite movies of all time. The camera work is a little off, the editing was a little jerky, but the overall feel of the movie was great. The story is tight. The actors (Michael Pare, Tom Berringer, Joe Pantoleno, and an early performance by Ellen Barkin!) all pulled offan excellent performance from a rather dark script. If only the sequel could have done that...... Anyway, the music was a real throw-back to the sixties except the two more familliar tracks, On the dark side and Tender Years. The dark, rocking song Season in Hell really shows the versatility of the band that performed the actual music, John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band. Too bad they never caught on outside of this movie.
