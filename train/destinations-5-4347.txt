Well come on people this is LA !!! Yea it has smog, traffic, crime, illegal immigration out of control. But this is California, it still has that magical pull to it. I would come here as often as I can, there is so much to do, beautiful weather, world class shopping, dining, nightlife. You have Hollywood,the ocean and beaches, amusement parks.If you get tired of the city, spectacular scenery is just a short drive away. I know it has problems, LA does not have that city pride, like maybe Chicago or New York City. That has alot to do with the fact many people are transplants from other areas. If you want an exciting vacation come to LA, if you don't like big cities or are timid, take the family to Yellowstone, watch out for the bears though!!!
