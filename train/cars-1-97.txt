Quick and qiet needs shut his quick and loud mouth. hondas suck and we all know that. the only reason there even on the market is because they can make a good car and found some left over money to make a motorcycle. u suck and so does your bike. quick and qietlearn from your name b qiet. and hey 2 fast for yfz, the only reason y u can beat a yamaha is because uv put like fourthousand more dollars in your bike. but im sure that soon your going to blow your intire engine and then youlll be waving at the yamaha guys as you set and only wish that you had just gotten a yamaha. cause yamahas dont require nitrous to be fast. you can put an air system and a jet kit on a 350 and kick any hondas ass. peace and love to all honda suckers who spent way to much money on their P.O.S
