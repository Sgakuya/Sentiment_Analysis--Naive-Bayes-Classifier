Tori Amos' worst is still light-years ahead of 90% of the rest of the music world. This covers album is half-brilliant. Songs like Rattlesnakes, New Age, Real Men, and Strange Little Girl are just brilliant. Her re-interpretation of Eminem's 97 Bonni and Clyde is a work of mad and chilling genius - like watching a really scary movie. Some of the songs are duds though - Happiness is a Warm Gun does *not* deserve its epic length. You'll either love or hate what she does to 'Heart of Gold' - personally I love it, but everyone else I know thinks her cover of that song was a massacre. Definently NOT the first album to get if you're looking to get into Tori Amos, but an interesting and good offering just the same.
