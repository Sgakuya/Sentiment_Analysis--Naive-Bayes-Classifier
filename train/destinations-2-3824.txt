I'll start with the good. The prices for homes are reasonable and it's nice to have Canada and NYC in a day's drive but the weather is ridiculous and depressing. The unemployment rate is pretty high and the downtown area is completely dead. It must be the only downtown area where parking is never an issue during the holiday season. I grew up in Chicago and moved here shocked at the rate of white flight everyone is terrified of going downtown which only adds to the level of deterioration. In order to get a dent public education you shoold definately be in a suburb like Brighton. My husband and I have already set plans to move on.
