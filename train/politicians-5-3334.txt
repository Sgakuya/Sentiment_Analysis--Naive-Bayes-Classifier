I firmly believe Director Ridge was an excellent choice for the Chief spot in the Homeland Security Division. In conjunction with the other critical governmental security divisions, former Pennsylvania governor Ridge successfully rolled out a Color coded risk assessment plan, which is easily identifiable to all American citizens. In addition, his organization, with the help of the TSA and Department of the Navy, has greatly augmented security at our critical infrastructures, and has systematically identified and routed out key terrorist figures; and continues to do so. He should be commended for his vast achievements, in such a short period of time.
