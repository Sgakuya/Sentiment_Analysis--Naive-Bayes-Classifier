My 2004 Passat 4 motion wagon has done nothing but shake, rattle and roll. It has shaken at high sppeds since day one, wobbled at slow speeds and rolled to and through a slow stop. Front brakes have been replaced twice, rear brakes once. In between, the specialists could not duplicate the problems, but brakes were replaced. This gives a new meaning to the old boogie song. In addition, the car has lost OnStar several times, the side defroster nozzle barely breathes, the left rear window doen't go up and down correctly, the mileage does not meet manufacturers specifications as stated in their brochure. I lost a piece of molding which service said was replaced. While talking to the manager about the problems, I mentioned the replaced molding. He reached down, took a piece of molding off another car, and voila, my car had a molding. The top rail molding dislodged and added extra beat to the interior Monsoon music. The rear window washer was out of commission during most of the winter, even though the dealership said they fixed it. It did work finally, spraying backward so the car behind me got a free wash. But hey, I like being helpful. I'm bringing the car in tomorrow for another fix. Then...on to the Lemon Law! I checked Carfax and discovered that my was was listed. The only problem--I bought it new and was supposed to be the first owner. I've filed a complaint with the RI State Dealership and License Office. I loved my other Volkswagen but this one gets a BIG ZERO! or shall I say a BIG YELLOW OVAL with LEMON printed inside.
