For anyone planning on getting service, please consider your options carefully. I had really good luck with the phone and service from them for the first year or so - when I had no reason to contact them. The nightmare began when I called to work with them regarding additional (!) services. Many, many fruitless hours of phone calls later, I am no longer a Verizon customer. You can check out additional information on my experience at: a href=http://www.barnesconsulting.com/verizon.html http://www.barnesconsulting.com/verizon.html /a . I welcome anyone with poor experiences to mail me their story, and I will post it on the site.
