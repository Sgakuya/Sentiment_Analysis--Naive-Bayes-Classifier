We are all embarrassed about Newt. How does Missouri feel about Rush? I moved here from the other South - Southern California. I've lived all over this great country. Rural Georgia is like rural Missouri (yes, I lived there, too) or any other rural area. Atlanta is a city full of immigrants from Michigan and other states. One thing I have found interesting here is the number of people from the North who enjoy bashing the South. Southerners aren't jealous, they are sick of the bashing. Many cultural and economic problems here can be traced back to the 1800s when this agricultural area was burned, conquered, and occupied. Yep, it's full of folks you don't want to be around because you saw all you needed to know on TV. If you believe those stereotypes, please stay in your own racist, one-horse, hick town and savor the sense of superiority you feel. Or maybe you could try helping this area? Hmmm... Low education rates, high infant mortality and poverty rates.... If this were Brazil, you might help. Or maybe you wouldn't.
