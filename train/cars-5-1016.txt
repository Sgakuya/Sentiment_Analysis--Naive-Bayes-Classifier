I can't believe the morons on this site who still believe that building an American car is a process relegated to the Big Three automakers. In case you didn't know, almost all the import auto manufacturers have assembly plants and design centers located in North America. So it is utterly idiotic to denounce the off-shore automakers based on the fact that they're not American and that they take jobs away. They simply build BETTER cars. End of story. I have always owned imports and I will never ever waste a dime on a domestic car for patriotic reasons. A smart buyer purchases a car because it's good, not because of where it's made. Obnviously many people agree, otherwise the Camry and Accord wouldn't be trouncing the Taurus, Impala and Intrepid on the sales charts, while winning endless awards and accolades!
