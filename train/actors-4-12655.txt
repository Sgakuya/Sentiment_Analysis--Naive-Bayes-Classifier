I had always found Charlize Theron to be a pleasant actress with a good delivery and an undeniably pretty face. But on a second glance in light of her Academy award, I have decided she is better than many of her films would lead you to believe. I think she's one of those actresses who has the talent and yet manages to swamp herself in shallow roles and films lacking quality. Her performance in Cider House Rules has always impressed me and now with her acclaimed role in Monster, she has convinced me. Beautiful, down-to-earth and talented, I hope her Oscar win will lead her to better films with material that will allow her to shine.
