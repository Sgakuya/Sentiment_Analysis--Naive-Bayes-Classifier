When I was in Chicago all I could think of was what a 'concrete jungle' the city was, but after meeting so many nice people it totally blew that image out of my head. The people truly make this city what it is. A big metro full of hard working people who just want to make a buck to feed their families and put shelter over their heads. And also, if you think Chicago is the windiest place in the country, you obviously have never been to Wyoming before...UPDATE: Chicage had 599 homicides in the year 2003, for that reason alone it loses a star, regardless of how much I like the city itself...there is just no excuse for this...they obviously need to get control on their crime in Illinois, and especially in the major urban centers...it makes me ill...
