This movie is ridiculously bad. I could hardly stand it. Thank Goodness that it made up for it's dragging and rather unenjoyable or interesting plot with ludirous dialouge and completely stupid characters. I never laughed so hard in all my life. I walked into this movie with a couple friends of mine and you cannot help but crack on it. It practically begs you to. Usually when my friends and I crack on a movie it is mainly inside stuff. But this film is so intellectually numb and void of any talent in the script, directing, editing and most of the acting department it gives you the moments and the ammo to make the jokes. I would have given this movie a one if it wasn't for the great time I had making fun of how undenyably crappy it was. Recommended for a good laugh, but nothing else.
