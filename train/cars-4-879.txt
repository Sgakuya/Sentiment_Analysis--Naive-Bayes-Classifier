I just purchased my 2003 VirageI. I previously rode a 1999 Tigershark 770 TSR, it was wrecked in a storm. So far, I am satisfied with my VirageI...has a nice hole shot...plenty of power.I am disappointed with top end speed. My speedo says top end is around 50-52 MPH...I was told it would make 60 MPH. (Maybe the speedo is inaccurate) I hope to do better as it gets broke in as I only have 5 hours on it now, and haven't pushed it too much yet. I think the forward-neutral-reverse handle is in a poor location...should be closer to the operator...shouldn't have to reach under handlebar to shift. Quiet and stable machine and the fuel economy is great! I like the direct injection, no choke...starts and idles perfect...no hesitation when you hit the throttle. If I can get some more MPH out of it...I am a very satisfied customer so far!
