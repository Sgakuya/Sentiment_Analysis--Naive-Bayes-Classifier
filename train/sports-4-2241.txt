To my mind, they represent the old Brooklyn Dodgers in that their fans don't necessarily expect instant gratification, and follow them more out of love of the game than demanding nothing less than winning the whole thing. In that regard, they resemble Cubs or Cardinals fans with unconditional love for their team, instead of the pre- 2004 pessimism of Red Sox fans ,or the mindless ego gratification and strange sense of validation that some local Yankee fans get with their team's often predictable success, or the knee- jerk phoniness and bandwagoneering of non-NYC area fans. Mixed success over the years: 2 Series winners and other good years mixed in with awful clubs, they tend to be either very good or extremely poor, seldom in the middle. Have made some solid moves lately that should restore them to the top of the pack in their division.
