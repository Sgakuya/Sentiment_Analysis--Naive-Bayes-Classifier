After reading the comments from Bettina I wonder how much she knows the man and his opinions. So far George Bush may be able to control his erection, but not his daughters. Additionally, his stance on the environment should be condemned. Al Gore would have made a fine president and it is only the machinations in a state where Bush's brother was governor was he able to get into the White House. I would rather have had Al Gore as my president rather than the clown that now resides there. He will sell the American people down the drain if you pay him enough. Time for a man of honor to be in the position of President of the United States and I say that man should be Al Gore. Pity we have to all suffer for the mistakes of all the voters who judge a man on his erection....dumb, dumb, dumb.
