I wish you'd stop downplaying the Mountain West, PBeavr. It is without a doubt the fastest-improving conference in D-I and has several teams with a chance to succeed in any given BCS conference. In fact, right now, it's on par with the Big East, and could easily rival the PAC-10 in the next decade or so. Utah is ranked in the Top 25 preseason polls for several reasons. Firstly, eleven wins is not an easy feat in ANY conference. Secondly, it beat both top mid-majors AND solid BCS schools. Colorado State, TCU, Oregon (the same squad that beat Michigan), just to name a few. Thirdly, you know something's going on when you become (arguably) the top mid-major program almost overnight - Meyer really is that good, and Utah can compete with virtually any team in America.
