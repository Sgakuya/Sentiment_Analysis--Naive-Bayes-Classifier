Tony G. has redefined an otherwise overlooked position. A tight end getting nearly 1,300 recieving yards? That's nuts! You can't say there's better players out there, either... because there's not. He led the league in receptions last year! He's helped the Chiefs become the #1 ranked offense and now everbody is scrambling to find a tight end like him. Definite future Hall of Famer. UPDATE: The feeling I have from watching the Chiefs all season isn't that Tony G. has declined, as some would like to suggest, but rather that the coaching staff was entirely unable to utilize him all season. I still consider him the best tight end in the NFL.
