Halle Berry is one of most beautiful women I ever seen! Many people criticize her for doing a nude scene in 'Monster's Ball', (imo that part could've been left out) but I don't think she degrade herself in any way. As far as her acting skills, I admit it isn't very great but good. She been in the acting game for so long now, she deserve to be acknowledge more as a serious actress than just another pretty face in Hollywood that gets the typical 'cute girlfriend' or 'love interest' role in movies. She is capable of playing any role just like every other actress out there, and winning that Oscar has proved that she can.
