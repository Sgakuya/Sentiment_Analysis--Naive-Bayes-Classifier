I attended UMUC both in class and online for my undergraduate degree, and now, after a few years off, am back into a graduate degree. Although I have read many of the comments posted on this site regarding poor customer service, etc, overall I have found the quality of the courses and material to be outstanding. I too had to experience long lines, etc, when I was attempting to register for courses when I was overseas; however, that was due to the demand for the courses and the attendance of students in those programs. I found many times the long lines were due in part to the schedules that many of us active-duty types had to keep, leaving very little free time to make it to register at a time when the traffic was negligible. As I mentioned above, I am in the graduate program, online, and am able to do everything that I need in order to register, order books, and attending online. I have found much of the curriculum to be very challenging, and particularly appreciate the new MyUMUC portal. Look carefully at the online universities and I think you will find that UMUC ranks as one of the top cyber universities around as recognized by Forbes repeatedly. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=FORBES+umuc+best+of+the+web
