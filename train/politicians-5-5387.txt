After wacthing tonight t.v. with Bush and Gore I was left with a thought,does VP Gore really belive that Gov.Bush really has never killed a man the answer no because there has been proof to prove a man that was not guiltly yet Gov.Bush refused to listen to the proof .Is that the kind of man for this counrty I as a voter say no.I agree with my choice that Gore would not be just fair but honest if you have had that many children and married to a good wife with so majorly bad times from lossing his sister to his son being hit,he would understand that thur good times in our goverment and bad times too you just do not jump off and take the easy way out.I also want to think about this how many years has he been in our goverment working for the people of the U.S.A. I know it was befor I was bron frist he was in the miltary,he has proven to me and many that I know that a man can be good and I belive the only person who is prefect would be God himself so are we asking for Gore to be god no just to be a great man to have our children to look back on and read in history books about.GO GORE!
