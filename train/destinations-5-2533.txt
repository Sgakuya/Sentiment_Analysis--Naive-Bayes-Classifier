I lived there for 4 years (stationed on a submarine.) If you go to Oahu, these are the things you MUST do:..... 1) Drive up to the North Shore to see the waves (especially in the winter months)..... 2)While you're up there, stop at one of the graffitied up shrimp trucks on the side of the road. They have the best shrimp EVER!..... 3)Go snorkeling at Electric Beach on the west side of the island. It's WAY better than the touristy places, and it's free too (bring your own gear though.)..... 4) Go to the Pali lookout. It is perhaps the most beautiful view in the world..... 5) And last: Hop on a plane and visit another island for a day or two... they're even better than Oahu! Have fun, and Aloha!
