How is Torre number 1? HOW IS TORRE NUMBER ONE? it's like saying Phil Jackson is the best coach in the NBA, Torre's teams are pre-made for him, and all he has to do is chose which overpayed all star to put out there, or which former or future cy young winner to pitch the game. here is Joe Torre's agenda for the game. inning 1-sit there and try to look interested, pick my ear on camera. innings 2-5 take a nice nap where i am not in view of camera's. inning 6, wake up and check the score, and maybe pick my ear a little more. inning 7 make my trip out to the mound to put in which ever relief pitcher i am told to put in. inning 8-talk to Zimmer about what's on TV tonight, get a drink of Gatorade. inning 9- put in Rivera, celebrate victory, try to make it sound like i watched the game in the press conference.
