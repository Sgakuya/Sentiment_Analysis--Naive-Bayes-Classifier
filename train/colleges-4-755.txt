I am a Ph.D student in the school of education with an emphasis in teaching and learning at Capella. I am in my dissertation, having completed some very extensive work in each course (including much effort in my research papers for each class and very difficult comps, both written and oral)I have found the coursework, comps, and colloquia very rewarding and challenging. Anyone wanting to just sit through a degree without having to get involved can attend any traditional institution, but with Capella and her sister school Univ. of Phoenix, one has to be involved in a continuous manner, as every learner has to complete the very extensive research papers, to accomplish what face-to-face traditional institutions do not do. I have attend both, and will never attend a traditional institution again. Online and Capella are definitely for those requiring a quality learning experience.
