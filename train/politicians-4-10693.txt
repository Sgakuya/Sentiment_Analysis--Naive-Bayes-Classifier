Nixon's crime was spying on political rivals. He had an obsession with winning elections and would do nearly anything to do so. Did he abuse power? Yes, because he used govt employees and resources to do the spying and bugging of hotel rooms. He ultimately stood up and resigned rather than drag the office of the Presidency through an embarrassing impeachment process (Bill Clinton, however, did not have enough class to do so). In the final analysis, spying on political rivals is not a big deal for me personally, although I agree that he would have been rightly impeached. Nixon ended the Vietnam war. He opened doors to China, however subsequent administrations did not follow up and assist China in abolishing Communism. Nixon's Chinese negotiations, at the very least, caused the Chinese to think twice before aligning themselves with the Soviets, and laid the groundwork for the current Chinese attitude which is less Communist each year (I predict the overthrow of Chinese Communists within 10 years. They left Hong Kong alone after acquiring it from Britian in 1997 and their economy is too strongly supported by semi-free market exports to the US for the Commies to ignore). All in all, an excellent leader but extremely flawed in his personal and political obsessions.
