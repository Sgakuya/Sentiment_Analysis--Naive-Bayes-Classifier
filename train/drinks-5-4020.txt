This is an interesting web site, you have rated bacardi 151 higher that Havana Club. C'mon. I have been drinking Rums all over the world. Havana is very good and not just because it is illegal (I have never had a problem bringing it in, the customs people are currently worried about REAL bad stuff). I would rate this, the 15 year old Matusalam, amd the Bacardi 8 year old as the best I have ever tasted. OF course, the Bacardi 8 is far and away the best deal but, whenever I go out of the country, I get some Havana Club. By the way, the Havana Club is without a doubt the best o drink with a cigar, crush some mint leaves in the galss, pour over ice and light up. Hot Damn!
