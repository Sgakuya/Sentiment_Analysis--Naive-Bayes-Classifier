The Empire Strikes Back (released in 1980) was a great movie and a strong sequel to Star Wars (1977). As other comments have noted, this was a darker and faster paced film than its predecessor; however, this added to the realism (by science fiction standards). One secret to the success was the quick editing and segues from scene to scene and subplot to subplot which added to the frenzied feel of the movie to great effect. As a sequel, there were no major casting decisions (ie Mark Hamill still plays Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, etc); however, I was dissatisfied with Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. The choice of an black actor was inspired, yet Williams has never impressed me and didn't here. Nevertheless, 120 plus more minutes of screen time allowed the director and screenwriters to develop the characters even further (though Yoda was not believable in my opinion). Of course the overall plot and special effects were spot on (given the available technology). Good does not always win every battle, and this fact of life was hammered home. My biggest complaint with the film is that it has no closure (ie it doesn't stand on its own like Star Wars). No movie should intentionally be left to be continued. Notwithstanding that single complaint, one must acknowledge that The Empire Strikes Back, as well as the entire Star Wars saga, is now a part of the human experience and has added phrases and concepts into the common lexicon (ie the force).
