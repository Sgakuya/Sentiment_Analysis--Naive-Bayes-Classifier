It will be interesting to see if this man will ever come out from behind the dark stormy cloud of suspicion he took office under. It will be even more interesting to see if he can stick to the high standards some people assume he has and expect of him. I almost don t see how he can win with some people attributing him with God-like characteristics and others won t give him even six months in office before they start to blame him for every evil scheme known to man. It seems like the old adage - damned if you do, damned if you don t. It is kind of interesting to see that liberals have suddenly remembered where they left their ideas of morality as it pertains to the presidency. And it s really amazing to see how generously they re tossing these virtuous ideas at Bush like soft, ripe tomatoes. Where were those tomatoes when Clinton looked in the nation s face and lied to us point blank oh, yeah sitting on the back shelf rotting away for the last eight years. I guess they were too busy concentrating on the great economy to notice the stench.
