Mubarak has been running Egypt for almost 25 years now. Aside from political stability, what does Egypt have to show for it? Not much. No political or economic reform to speak of, nor any real foreign policy initiatives like Sadat. Population growth is still out of control: Cairo is overpopulated and falling to pieces. The average Egyptian is poorer now than he was in the 1970s! Mubarak isn't as brutal as Saddam was, or the Saudis still are, but arbitrary arrest, torture, imprisonment and even execution still happen on a daily basis. Because of this, and Mubarak's refusal to allow any real political opposition, he has turned many Egyptians towards Islamic terrorism (Osama's second-in-command is an Egyptian doctor who was tortured in one of Mubarak's dungeons). The latest word is that Mubarak wants his son, Gamal Mubarak, to be his successor as 'president for life'.
