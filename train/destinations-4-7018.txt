As a fellow Brit, I feel I have to say something about my capital. I have been visiting London since I was knee high, usually on my Birthdays and it has always appealed as an exciting place. Seeing as I only live 40 minutes away, I regularly visit for restaurants, clubs, museums, exhibitions, theatres, hotels and of course shopping. There is so much to do and historicaly you can't beat it. I do recommend you get off the beaten track occasionally just to sample the true London - get on the tube and get out of the heart. As a downside and seeing as I did work there for five years I would say it is very, very busy - England is a small country and we are finding it hard to cope with the tourism, let alone our own traffic and population problems but no matter what you might hear, we are not all pretentious and stuck up and we welcome happy tourists. If you are highly opinionated, easily offended and narrow minded then steer clear. Otherwise, you havn't lived if you don't spend at least three days in London. If you want to know any more, by all means leave me a private message.
