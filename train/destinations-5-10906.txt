Disney World is the greatest park in the world, it's what all other parks are compared to. They always come out with the best and most creative rides, and the tecnology used in them is always cutting edge. No, they don't have the tallest or fastest coasters, but there is no other park in the world that offers as many ride choices, or as many different great experiences as Disney World does. We went there last Christmas, it was our fourth time, and we saw the fireworks on new years in Magic Kingdom, at around ten at night it started to pour down rain, and didn't stop all night, and it was still one of the best experiences I had ever had in an Amusement park.
