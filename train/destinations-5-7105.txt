Firenze is, justifiably, a great city. An awful lot of art and history packed into a small space. Food is great (but many restaurants tend to gouge tourists, so beware). Comments are based on several visits in the 1972-1981 timeframe. Hotels and pensiones are adequate to charming. Leather good used to be a particularly good bargain. Ice cream in Florence is fantastic. Try Il Latini for unique food. Browse the gold shops on Ponte Vecchio if you have the means. Too many sights to mention here - trust your guidebook. Present-day Italian originated in Florence; the Italians say Lingua Toscana in bocca Romana (Tuscan tongue - or language- in a Roman mouth). A great little city. Don't miss it.
