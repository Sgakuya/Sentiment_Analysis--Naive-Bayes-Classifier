I find the junior Senator from Pennsylvania to be somewhat creepy. I particularly don't get his singular obsession with the gay marriage issue. Considering that the guy seems to be a rising star among GOP ranks, I think he merits some consideration. He seems to be one of these shallow social warriors more than anything else. Santorum should spend his time on issues that are of consequence to the American people, not some insignificant social issue that is not important in the broader scheme of things. Considering that he's a relative lightweight and tends to be more of a showhorse rather than a workhorse, this doesn't really surprise me. As for those who claim that he is a Machiavellian who just wants to be re-elected, I will say this much, he does really believe in what he says. Pennsylvania usually elects moderate Republicans to the Senate (Hugh Scott, John Heinz, Arlen Specter), not social warriors like Santorum. He's never been a good match for the state and Santorum realizes that the odds are against him in every race. He has lucked out in that he has had weak opponents in all of his past races. However, he has become a favorite of the religious right; indeed last year he was considered a contender in the race for Republican majority leader and may even be a candidate for the vice presidency come 2008 if he gets re-elected.
