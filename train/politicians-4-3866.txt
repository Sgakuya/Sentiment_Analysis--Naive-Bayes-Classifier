I believe that the negative comments on this site, especially the harrassing and personal bashing of the candidates, are a show of the moral decline of our society. Young and old alike have lost self-respect, therefore, leading to little or no respect for each other. We see this in all segments of our society. Broken families, sex abusing youth and adults, for-profit and not-for-profit company embezelments, etc., etc., etc., We all think we have the simple, easy answer. It is not simple! But let's use common sense. Al Gore has been a part of an administration that for eight years failed to fulfill promises that were made in regard to Social Security, Medicare, and Managed Health Care. All continue to be major concerns (fears) in our society today. The Bush/Cheney ticket offers a change. They talk about taking baby steps towards reform in all of these issues. WHY ARE PEOPLE SO FEARFUL THAT THEY MUST ATTACK THIS MAN'S ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE? I have never found G. W. to be bummbling or unable to express himself. On the contrary, G.W. illuminates passion for America. I find his unscripted and consistent responses to be believable and trusting. He remains himself and has been from the start. He stands by who he is, not what others tell him to be. My vote is for Bush/Cheney in hopes that they will help in the restoration of self-respect to our country and our people. My vote is for Bush/Cheney in the belief that they will work towards the reform of our Social Security System, Educational System and Managed HealthCare System. We, as humans, look to leaders that are reflections of what we are. Which candidate reflects your true self?
