One guy I know once described her as trailer trash wins the lottery . I think her problem goes way beyond that (generally unfair) stereo type. Actually, I think she's probably brilliant on some odd level. After all, she did manage to make it amazingly far considering she broke every rule in the How to Be a Successful Woman in Hollywood book (and maybe because she did). But, I think she's basically more of a mental case than anything else. Her biggest problem, aside from that, is that she just can't manage to keep that dirty laundry in the laundry basket where it belongs - she just doesn't seem to realize that we were really never interested in seeing or smelling it.
