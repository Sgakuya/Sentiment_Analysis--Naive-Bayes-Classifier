I think some people in this forum are confused. This forum is to give your opinions on George Bush, not John Kerry. Most people here are comparing Bush to Kerry when they really should stick to focusing on just Bush. I believe Kerry is EVIL but sense this forum is only about BUSH I believe bush is a horrible president! Does anyone think it was ABSOLUTLY necissary to go into Iraq without ANY United Nations support or the support of other countries. I think Bush made the dumbest decision to go into iraq almost independently. I believe we should fix this 7 trillion dollar debt by spending less money on military operations and more money in our homeland. Why can't we stay out of other peoples problems like most other countries??
