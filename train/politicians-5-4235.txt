As a young adult in this mess we call a democracy, I become increasingly more worried and scared of the direction in which we are heading every day. Ralph Nader will not win this election, the Greens may not take the next. But I think that's it's time to make some progress towards what this country needs and deserves. America is a society that is continually progressing in technology and ideas, yet for some reason, this progress is never the issue with our canidates. Why is it that no one seems to see the need for change? We are continually reminded that things were so much better before...well, it's tomorrow now, and we need someone who can lead us through that, not conentrate on building a time machine to bring us back to the 1950's when everything was perfect. Vote for whom you think will lead us best, be it Gore or Nader, but don't vote for Gore because you feel helpless in pursuing your dreams and visions. We've lived through terrible presidents before and we'll do it many more times again. Nader doesn't have a chance in hell, if everyone is scared off anyway, so how can we even know the truth, if we don't share? GET OUT THERE AND VOTE!!!AND VOTE FOR WHO YOU KNOW CAN DO THE JOB BEST!!!ARE WE MEN OR ARE WE MICE?
