People have a love-hate relationship with California. Conservative types from outside the state see it as a haven for loony lefties, hippies, and rejects from the Midwest. San Francisco would probably warrant such a stereotype, but this whole state of 35 million strong(not counting the many illegal Mexicans)? California has some of the most stunning, variable terrain in the country and benign weather to boot. More than just boasting mountains, beaches, evergreen rainforests, deserts, and farmland, the state boasts a wealth of options in many areas....you've got your Eurocentric types in scenic San Fran, trendoids and Chicanos in L.A., retirees in Palm Springs, surfers in San Diego, hippies in Eureka, conservative suburbanites in Orange county and so forth. These are just common perceptions of the above places, but they all have attributes make up the most diverse state in the country. No other state has a 'lifestyle' that could be called uniquely its own; California perfected 'lifestyle' living and successfully marketed it through Hollywood to the rest of the world, for better and for worse. I hesitate giving the state 5 stars, as the 'California Dream' of a single family home with a pool in an enviable setting has become tarnished. Most areas of the state are simply too expensive,especially in housing, and the bubble shows no sign of popping anytime soon. Managing the state's huge, diverse and continually growing population is an enormous challenge that has--and will--mean changes in lifestyle for many, specifically the large pool of destitutes that eke out a living statewide. The inequalities of wealth are especially glaring in Los Angeles....Bel Air and Pacific Palisades are a world away from Watts, East L.A., and even places like Riverside. Cali's become a tougher state to live in, but preserving it would be worth the effort.
