Kroger is your average mega-chain grocery store. There's nothing special to say about them. The stores are clean, but everywhere I've lived where there have been Krogers stores, they have maintained prices that range from high to ridiculous. Here in Cincinnati, where they are headquartered, they have a stranglehold on much of the market, and respond not only with high prices but with poor selection outside of the major brand items. If you want anything special, they probably don't have it. If you want even slightly less ordinary produce (say, leeks or coconuts), then you're sore out of luck at Krogers. Not exactly a well-run operation.
