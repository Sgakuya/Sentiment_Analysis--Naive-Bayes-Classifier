If possible, 5 stars for the voice alone. But add to that a hugely respected and impressive body of work and there aren't enough stars to do him justice. Cape Fear, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, Roman Holiday, the list goes on and on. And, of all his great roles, if I were to pick my personal favorite, it would without a doubt be Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird . Some roles - like Clark Gable as Rhett Bulter or Judy Garland as Dorothy - seem meant for one actor alone to play. This has never been more true than in the case of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. At least I know that I will always hear only his voice when I read this memorable line from the movie, I remember when my daddy gave me that gun. He told me that I should never point it at anything in the house. And that he'd rather I'd shoot at tin cans in the backyard, but he said that sooner or later he supposed the temptation to go after birds would be too much, and that I could shoot all the blue jays I wanted, if I could hit 'em, but to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird. Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncrib, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us. Blows me away every time!
