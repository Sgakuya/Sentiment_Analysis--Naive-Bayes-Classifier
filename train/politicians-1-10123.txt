There are plenty of facts about George Bush, actually, Mr. Political. Can you actually listen to the man speak, look at all he's done to our country, and then say that these people calling him what he deserves to be called don't have any facts? George W. Bush is an idiot who can't even talk right, and I'm disgusted that half this country voted for him. I personally don't like Kerry very much, but for god's sake, anyone over this lying, moronic scum of a president! How many people out there actually voted for him thinking that he would be best for our country? I'll bet a lot more people voted just because he was a Republican, or because he's a Christian who opposes gay marrige. This country is a freakin' bibleland. Okay, Christians, bring on the unhelpfuls!
