Brett is the best ever. He's put up unbelievable numbers over his career and he would have more rings if it wasn't for the pathetic defenses he's been stuck with the last several years. When he had a good defense he won the Super Bowl and a year later, lost barely because Packer D couldn't stop Terrell Davis. The year after that he was on his way to another Super Bowl but was robbed by a moron ref who ruled Rice's fumble not a fumble. Last year was close, but again the Defense screwed up. 4th and 26! C'mon. Yeah that last throw of his was bad but it should have never gotten to that point. I feel so sorry for him being stuck with such crappy defenses all the time. He deserves better. I hope he plays a few more years. He's still the best. He lead the league in TD passes again last year. People that say he's washed up are on drugs. A few more years and he'll have every record in the book including Marino's career TD passes. Go Favre!
