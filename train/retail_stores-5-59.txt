Personally, I love small used bookstores. I spend hours in them. But I also find I can spend hours in Barnes Noble. It is easily the best of all the major chains. I always found it funny though to see people lounging around on counches, drinking lattes and reading books in a book store. I mean, if you wanted to, you could never actually BUY anything there and just go in and read a book over several days. It must be a speed readers paradise... Back to the point. I have always found the sales people to be helpful and not pushy (a major plus). I like that they have local solo musicians in the cafe from time to time. Their selection is fabulous and I can always get a heads up on when new books are coming out from them. I must admit I really enjoy B N.
