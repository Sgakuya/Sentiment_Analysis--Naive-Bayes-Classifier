It was alright--it probably would have been an hour shorter had they not had so many scenes in slow-motion. They over-did the special effects, but that was to be expected. Story-wise, I appreciated the plot twist, and I thought seeing Zion was pretty neat, but the acting left much to be desired (well, again, that was to be expected). The fight sequences were very entertaining. The film had the feel of a graphic novel/comic book, but the jumping of the timelines (in/out of the Matrix and recent past/present; yeah, you can follow it, but it takes a second to realize that's what they're doing). Lots of action, some nudity/sexuality, obvious violence, overall everything you'd expect from The Matrix. (Amendment: I saw it again, was noticing the little nuances that I missed before. During slightly after Neo's scene with the Oracle, look for the little signs on the pole behind Neo (when he was sitting on the bench with the Oracle) and on the wall on the sequence directly after that scene. It's barely noticable, I missed it until my friend pointed it out, but it's only in focus for a second; also, listen for the interesting sound effects in the brawl.)
