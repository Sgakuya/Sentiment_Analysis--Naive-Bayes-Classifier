I was born in Virginia 23 years ago, and Ive lived in Virginia for 23 years. That would make me a 23 year old person who has lived in this state all his life, and though I have never established residence in any other state, I would have to say that I am over all satisfied with Virginia. The cost of living is not all that high in Virginia. Taxes can get a little high when you live in large cities or medium sized towns. I have never been to northen Virginia, I have spend all my life here in the southwest part of the state, an area which has a wealth of history, scenery, and other eartly delights. There is a lot of national forest, and things to do for free outdoors. Generally the people are friendly here and the crime rate is pretty low. Occationally there will be a murder, kidnapping, etc here and there, but its nothing like LA from what I see on TV. This state seems to be really pulling through the recent economic crisis that the entire nation has been in during the last few years, probobly the worst economic area of Virginia would be the southwest region, however there is a lot of pride around here generally speaking. Many people are proud of the town and counties they live in, and the people work together with the government on a regular basis to bring goods to the region. I can think of at least 100 things to do that are withing a hours drive of where I live. Nothing fun for younger people to do in VA? I guess not if you're into gang shootings, riots, radical and liberal movements, and so on... But if you like scenic walks, driving all day down endless dirt roads all over the mountains, bicycle riding, cookouts, going to malls, and movies, bowling, swimming, boating, or just watching TV, or sitting on your porch watching the bug zapper then this is the place to be.
