I don't live there either, but I think it's a great town. Detroit, for one reason or another, has gotten a bad rap through the years (maybe due to the high murder rate in the 80's?), but I think it has a lot to offer. It has a distinct culture and history which gives it a personality of its own (as opposed to many other cities of similar size). The institute of arts is absolutely amazing (I cried at the sheer beauty of it the first time I was there--boy did I feel dumb! :) ), the orchestra and their venue (Orchestra Hall) is second to none, and there are several beautiful old theatres offering high caliber productions of various plays/musicals/operas plus many small production companies that do a good job in a more intimate setting. If you're not into the arts, Detroit is definitely a great sports town regardless of the time of year with a plethora of professional teams as well as quality college and high school teams (the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is not too far away). What about educational opportunities? There's the highly acclaimed Greenfield Village and Henry Ford museum, several other science museums, a holocaust museum, and other cultural and historical museums. And nightlife? Well, I'm not into that scene so I can't say what it's like for sure. Maybe someone else can speak to that aspect.
