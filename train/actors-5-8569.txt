A great beauty! She went all the way from silents to a show of her own on television. And then specials. In the early thirties, she was in many movies that were fun. She was blonde, then. She is also known for her involvement in the biggest upset in oscar history. In those days, VARIETY used to conduct pre-oscar polls among voters, to see who were the frontrunners. According to one poll, Miss Young was ranked fifth, (after frontrunner, Rosalind Russell, followed by Dorothy McGuire, Joan Crawford and Susan Hayward.) Historians say that Miss Russell was halfway out of her seat, as the announcement was being made. Indeed, Miss Russell's husband, Fred Brisson, had hired the same publicist who was instrumental in Joan Crawford's win, for Mildred Pierce, and Olivia DeHavilland's, for To Each His Own. Miss Young's beauty is exhibited to great advantage, in the frothy, but enjoyable 40's comedy, Mother is a Freshman, opposite bobby sox favorite, Van Johnson. The public seems to still appreciate her performance, in The Bishop's Wife.
