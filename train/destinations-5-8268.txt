Most of the attractions listed here are lame (The Hollywood Sign?!?) but contrary to stereotype there ARE many nice places to see in LA, the Getty museum in particular. Getty was an eccentric oil billionaire (for a brief time in the 60s, the world's richest man) who collected some of the best artwork from around the world, but Italy in particular. Most post-WWII museums are designed by trendy architects chosen by commitees, so they look like utilitarian glass shoeboxes or alien spaceships. Luckily, Getty was rich and eccentric enough to have his own museum designed as a Renaissance Italian villa! What makes the museum unique is not just its design its location-it is on a hill overlooking LA, with an absolutely spectacular view, the best in town. The museum has an unusually informal feel to it compared to most museums. Its design is perfectly suited to the California climate, and that I hope will be imitated in the future. Definitely worth a detour.
