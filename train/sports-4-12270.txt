Brad Smith is one of the most electrifying runners in the country. However, he's a quarterback. He needs to work on his passing game and get some help from receivers downfield if he wants to improve. Otherwise, he's one of the best in the Big 12. To vkgemini, I guess humiliating Nebraska wasn't impressive enough for you. Brad had several touchdowns in that game, and one of them was even a receiving TD. Sure we lost to Oklahoma, but so did everyone else that OU played. In fact, according to the stats, Mizzou did better against the Sooners than most of the other opponents, and we beat the spread. The fact is, Brad Smith is a great athelete, but he can't win every game by himself... just most of them. He needs some sort of supporting cast, and Larry Smith's dismal recruits are finally on the way out, making room for Gary Pinkel's new blood. Brad Smith isn't stupid; he can only get better, and don't worry. He will.
