This movie was good! A real improvement over the previous Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers disaster. It really simply picked up where the 2nd one left off, totally ignoring the 4th, 5th and 6th ones, a wise move in my book. Jamie Lee Curtis was astounding as usual, but I was a little disappointed in the bad acting on the part of the WB Actors like Michelle Williams, etc. However, Josh Hartnett was surprisingly OK in his portrayal of Laurie's son. The most annoying thing about the movie was the size of Michael Myers- I do believe that they picked the wrong actor because this Michael Myers was almost ridiculously short.
