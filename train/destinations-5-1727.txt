I've been in Ecuador for three weeks now, and I've seen a good cross-section of the country - Quito, Guayaquil, Banos, Riobamba, Cuenca, Otavalo, Puyo, Alausi, the Galapagos... This place really is amazing. The Galapagos islands alone make Ecuador a top South American travel destination, but the fact that this country also has - in an area about the size of Nevada - a beautiful coast, a stunning stretch of the Andes, and a large section of the Amazon basin, elevates Ecuador to another level. On top of that, the people are friendly and your money goes a long way: you can eat a great dinner for $5 and stay in a decent hotel for $10. Definitely a fantastic place to visit.
