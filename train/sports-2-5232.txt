He's a punk. Admittedly, Laettner had a great collegiate career, and his performance in the `92 regional championship game against Kentucky was amazing. But he nullified that great performance by stomping on the neck of UK player Aminu Timberlake as he was lying on the floor, one of the alltime bushleague acts of college basketball. He should have been kicked out of the game for that, in which case he never would have made that last second shot, and we wouldn't be subjected to his grinning mug a million times on TV every year around this time. Laettner reminds me of Niedermeyer from Animal House. It's my understanding that his teammates disliked him almost as much as Kentucky fans. And he's been pretty useless in the NBA. Karma, Chris baby. And Duke is the Microsoft of college basketball.
