It's hard to like an actress who is responsible for breaking up so many relationships. Matt Damon - Her co star. He left Winona Ryder (his live in partner of several years) while he was her the male lead on a movie with her. Casualty No 1. Nicholas Cage - Her co star. Ms Cruz went straight from Matt Damon to Nicholas Cage. Cage was married to Paticia Arquett (his wife of many years) and like Matt Damon, he announced his marriage breakdown just after making a movie with Ms Cruz. Casualty No 2. Tom Cruise - Her co star. A friend of mine owns an entertainment business here in Sydney and her business hosted the wrap party for Moulin Rouge. This was only 4 months before the Kidman/Cruise marriage broke up. In my friends words, Nicole and Tom were extremely affectionate and all over each other (in the nicest possible way) and this was as they were in private, with no cameras anywhere near them. Nicole and Tom also renewed their marriage vows shortly afterwards. Four months later, after making a movie costarring Penelope Cruz, the Kidman/Cruise marriage was Casualty No 3. Nicole suffered a miscarriage just after the marriage broke down. Casualty No 4. I would imagine any man is fair game for this lady and I use the term loosely. I bet actors everywhere are forbidden by their wives to work with Ms Cruz, and who could blame those wives. Tom Cruise made the biggest mistake of his life by breaking up with the beautiful, classy and humble Nicole for this awful woman.
