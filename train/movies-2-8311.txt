This is just another Hollywood attack on Christianity and, more specifically, Catholicism. This movie used two tired out cliches, that God is a women and Jesus was black. Get real! I guess that makes me the Holy Ghost. The movie had a disclaimer in the beginning warning the viewers not to get offended because it is just a funny movie. But the truth is the Zionist who run Hollywood will stop at nothing to put down the ideas of Gentiles and this movie is just one more notch on their bigoted belt. If someone made a movie putting down Judaism, as Christianity was here, there would be non-stop protest and claims of 'anti-Semitism', but trash Christianity and the Jews will just make another such film without batting an eye. This movie is just an excuse for Jewish bigots to rant against Catholics, and spread distain for the faithful. Truly a hateful movie hiding behind comedy.
