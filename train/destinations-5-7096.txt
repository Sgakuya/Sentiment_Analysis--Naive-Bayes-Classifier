Dublin is a great city. Yes! Dublin has it's filth, it's poverty and social disorder, but show me a capital city that doesn't have this and I'll move there straight away. Dublin is a community, it is very difficult to go out in Dublin and not meet someone that you know (this is a nice thing), a city such as London is so anonymous that people cross the street if someone else is in trouble in front of them. Dublin is easy to get around, walking being the best option(those who complain about the traffic use their cars as often as possible). The comments made below about Dubliners being stupid etc was quite obviously made by someone from the more rural part of Ireland as for some reason the city folk and the rural folk have a seriously strong dislike for one another, although they do all come together for their dislike of the English.
