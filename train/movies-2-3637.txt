I saw this movie this past weekend. I went to a drive in and they didn't have the greatest selection and while the atmosphere was perfect, the movie was not. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I really like James Spader but he failed miserably. Keenue didn't live up to the expectations I had for him since I saw the Matrix. The story was a mix of 'Seven' and 'Kiss the Girls' which sounds like it would be good but first, it has already been done, and second, it was just horrible. You never cared about the characters once. They tried mixing all these themes but nothing came together at all. About an hour in the movie there is this huge chase scene but it lasted so long even though you know that they aren't going to catch him or else the movie would be done. It is important to have the chase scenes suspenseful but not overdone and this movie was overdone to the point of riduculousness. As bad as the movie was, I still enjoyed the drive-in and it gave me a chance to laugh out loud and say how bad I thought it was with out getting hushed.
