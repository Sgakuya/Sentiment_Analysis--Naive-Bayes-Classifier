A race baiter extraordinaire. The real problem with this man, however, is his character. He has used his position to enrich himself in the most shameless ways imaginable. Moral relativism at its most cynical. Read Shakedown . It will blow you away. I read one story about this man on the web where he told an interviewer that he enjoyed spitting in white people's salads when he was a waiter in South Carolina. Pretty telling incident. Our history is a series of ebbs and flows. At the flood, we become confronted with over reactions and unfairness. As Senator Moynihan said, anytime one group starts complaining about their rights, it's always at the expense of someone else's rights. In this instant and because of the flood, we've had to suffer unethical, immoral, and criminal conduct from a series of racially motivated politicians ranging from sexual peccadilloes, jury nullification, an unjustified racial chauvinism and blatant racial favoritism. No one dared criticise these people and actions but the tide is turning. The rest of the citizens in this country, Hispanics and Asians as well as whites have had enough of the crime and political correctness absolving them from any criticism. The Hispanics are becoming a more significant minority and their value system is decidely mainstream. Honest work and honest living. On every front and in every part of the country, they are challenging the black hegemony that denies them a share of the sunlight. Rampant favoritism such as college admissions is being challenged. Politicians such as Mr. Jackson, Mr. Sharpton, Ms. Waters, Mr. Conyers and Mr. Farrakhan, to name only a few, are no longer getting a pass and their hate filled messages are no longer going unanswered. Mr. Conyers is pushing for slavery reparations. We should ask about the millions that went into the Great Society programs and the damages that the crime from this group has inflicted on us all at one point or another. The gravy train is coming to an end. Welfare is being replaced by workfare. None too soon, A natural equilibrium is kicking in that rights the wrongs that so many have had to endure over the past fifty years. Equality has largely been achieved but it is stopping at the verge of a perpetual guilt trip and free lunch. Thank God!
