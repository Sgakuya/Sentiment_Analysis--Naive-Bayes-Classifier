Michigan State University is probably one of the best schools to obtain your undergraduate education. One reason for this is the vast number of programs that are offered. Let's face it, most high school seniors aren't REALLY sure what they want to major in. Luckily, MSU has 14 degree granting colleges offering over 200 programs, just in case you change your mind! But it's not just quantity, it's also quality. Every one of my engineering professors was available to talk and answer questions outside of class. Plus, my fellow students often organized study sessions to review difficult material. You weren't on your own. Add to all that a beautiful campus, 150 study abroad programs, excellent recreational facilities, and a great intercollegiate athletic program. It's no wonder that MSU was the prototype for the 69 other land-grant institutions that followed it. Go State!
