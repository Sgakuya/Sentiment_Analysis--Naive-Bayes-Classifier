Let it go, people. Clinton's outta there we're still here, aren't we? I don't think anyone died as a result of the president's sex life. Why can't we get past what humans do in their spare time give the man some credit for the political things he has done. Our country is in good shape...we are prospering economically we're not involved in any wars, are we?? (There were no Desert Storms during Clinton's reign). No one is perfect...not even Bill. I don't belive there is one person out there who doesn't have some kind of incriminating evidence that could haunt them in the political spotlight. Apparently, people think running the country is an easy job...I think it requires a little more effort than Welcome to McDonald's, can I take your order please?
