Anybody who thinks VC is soft and doesn't want to win, I ask you to look at some tape of the '98 Tarheels. And I'm sick of hearing about his injuries. If you are injured, you are injured . What can ya do? And he still always comes back before he is ready. And ask the guys at the Rucker if VC is soft. If that doesn't convince you, tell your favorite player to stand under the rim when he is coming at it with a nasty look on his face. And he only wants out of Canada because they are giving him nothing to play with. They are selling out the Arena because of him - why should they dish out cash for players when VC is already selling out the arena every night? Hell, I'd want out of a content to suck franchise myself. I know his heart and I know it's big. The same goes for will to win. You people actually think a Carolina boy who played under Smith and Guthridge doesn't want to win? Not possible. He wouldn't have made it past freshman year, trust me. Hey, Vince, no matter what happens on the court, no matter people say, folks in this state will love you always. REAL BASKETBALL PEOPLE. REAL FAMILY. PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND THE GAME AND UNDERSTAND YOU. KNOW THAT. Hey man, I'd want out of that f%cking frozen tundra myself. There is a place better than the rest. A place where the sky is that unmistakable shade of blue. A place where the girls are pretty and the weather is warm. A place where basketball is a religion. A place called North Carolina where millions still love you. Remember that. And we'll have you the leading vote getter for the All Star game again buddy. F canada!
