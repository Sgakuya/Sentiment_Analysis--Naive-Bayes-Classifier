I live in Richmond Virginia where the grocery market is dominated by 3 chains.They are Kroger,Food Lion and a local only chain Ukrop's.Ukrop's is in a class all by itself and makes both Kroger and Food Lion look like terribly bad jokes.The quality and service provided by Ukrop's beats them hands down and the chain is nationally recognized for it's superiority in many catagories....and the prices are not higher there.Kroger's pricing has always come across as sneaky to me.They seems to almost try and fool you by jacking up prices on things you might not notice it on.The stores are oddly set up and the selection in some catagories is skimpy at best.Even Food Lion often has a better selection and better pricing.
