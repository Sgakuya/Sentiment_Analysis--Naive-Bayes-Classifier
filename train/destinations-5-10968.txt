We just went this past Friday and had an awesome time. I thought it was going to be some rinky dink little park but it was probably the best park I have been to in a long long time. The crowds were minimal with the longest wait being 15/20 minutes for StormRunner (WELL WORTH IT!) and then a few 10 minute waits. A wealth of coasters and fun snacking and dining options. All the usual arcade games and games of chance. People were friendly and in a generally good mood. The kiddie rides were interspersed which I think makes great sense so that a family can entertain various age groups at the same time. We actually went without our son and had a great time. Will visit again next year!
