I would say great, but I can't. I'm from Boston. I grew up despising the Yankees and will die hating them. HOWEVER, I respect them. Yes I do. They have the some of the best fans on the planet - in any sport. What spoke volumes to me about the Yankees was the crowd chanting Paul O'Neil when he was playing his last game in Yankee stadium. When you play in New York, and play hard, respect the game and the city - people will love you. Drop one of those elements and you can forget about it . There cannot be a more widely recognizable logo than that of the New York Yankees. Try and walk through an airport or a mall and not see one. We don't have to like them - and I don't. But you're a fool if you don't respect them
