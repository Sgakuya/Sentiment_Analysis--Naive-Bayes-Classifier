I have been a fan of AMC on and off for the last 30+ years. Up until the time Olga came on the show, I was probably watching less than 20% of the time. Now, I watch everyday hoping for Lena to be on. A close family member of mine came out right before the Lena/Bianca s/l. I had a real problem accepting it. This s/l with the amazing acting and chemistry of Olga and Eden has helped me see another side of homosexuality. Olga has a real chemistry with the camera whether or not she is delivering any vocal lines. Her hand gestures and eye contact say it all. I am puzzled as to why AMC is not using her talent more and developing her character more. They need to get back to more adult love and romance s/l's. BTW, I am not a member of any of her fan clubs! I do appreciate how her superb acting in this storyline has helped and changed my life---AMC4SUE
