Boy howdy, you can expect decapitations, dismemberment, spraying blood, very graphic murders etc. This is sure one of the most voilent films I have ever seen. Music is consistently fantastic throughout and peaks at the gratingly brilliant renditions of various 60's numbers performed by a Japanese girl band. A fairly big section of this movie is actually animated, very well at that. Needless to say the fight scenes are excellent and peaks at a scene where the main heroine faces off against hordes of black suited men (hmm). This film of course reeks of retro and obviously tries SO hard to be a bruce lee movie but as one of my fellow reviewers said, is similar to live action anime. I mean it's got a cute martial arts knowing schoolgirl in it, what more proof do you need? Overall, its well reccomended (though NOT for the faint hearted).
