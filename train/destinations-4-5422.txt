First of all, I'm very insulted by the people who say that those from Illinois are bad people. Just because you've had some bad experiences with just a few residents doesn't mean that everyone in the entire state is mean. Good Lord, talk about being judgemental! Personally, as someone born in DeKalb IL (not far from Chicago) I DO NOT think I am from Chicago - we say this because this is pretty much the only city that people outside of the midwest are familiar with in Illinois. As for there not being much...ya'll just have do a google search to find tons of things to do. We're not a bunch of rude hicks in a nothing state and if you think that then you are deserve whatever bad treatment you get. Illinois is the type of place where if you are nice we are nice. And we try to be nice right the beginning. And no, Wisconsin does not dominate this hell hole. If you take just five minutes to compare the two states you'd find that Illinois has a strong influence on southern Wisconsin while Canada has a strong influence on northern Wisconsin. Try not to be so hasty in judging a location and it's people. We may not be perfect and we never say we are but we try to be helpful. Hell, just walk down Michigan Ave. in Chicago, ask for directions, and you're more likely to have someone actually SHOW you the way rather than just tell you. At least, if it's summertime that is. By the way, DeKalb is known for Cindy Crawford, Isaac Elwood (inventor of Barbed Wire), and the NIU Huskies. We are not a hell hole.
