It seems like Ashley Judd has already done a couple hundred of these formulaic movies: 1) Show some skin -- but not too much skin; 2) Show some people get murdered; 3) Make someone a prime suspect; 4) Make someone else the actual suspect; 5) Have Ashley in a life-or-death struggle; 6) Watch Ashley prevail; 7) Show the credits. Ashley is just downright beautiful and she kicks butt. Other than that stinker comedy she did with Hugh Jackman (where the only highlight of the film is watching her jump in the air in a scanty pair of panties), you can always count on Ashley Judd to deliver a watchable movie to kill a couple hours in the evening after a long day with the kiddies.
