This one hurts the most. I mean this one REALLY hurts. I love the Phils. I grew up with the Phils. But they suck. And like a trailer-park wife I keep coming back for more abuse. The Phillies have finished last MORE TIMES in the history of the National League since 1883. This amounts to 120 years of bad baseball. Only shining moment was the span between 1976-1993 when the Phils were competitive and made the World Series three times while managing to somehow beat the Royals in 1980. My happy childhood has passed into a dark, dispeptic, brooding adulthood because of the slow agonizing demise of my ballteam. They will win the World Series again when I am old and gray.
