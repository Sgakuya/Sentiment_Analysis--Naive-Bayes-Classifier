I like her...good on her for bucking the blonde, perky, the biggest issue in my world is what dress I'm gonna wear to the prom values system that seems to be perpetuated these days. I'm not saying the USA is a wholly bad place, but it is unfortunate that people are sometimes scared to entertain the possibility that their country is not an 100% fabulous place all of the time. It takes a brave person to stick their head above the parapet and even if she is not offering a particularly balanced view either, isn't that what the USA prides itself on - the right to freedom of speech. Good on Janeane for doing her thing and not acting as though the prozac will make everything alright.
