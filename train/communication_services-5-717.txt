I have had this phone service for 5 years now. Up until recently I have never had any major problems or concerns with this phone service. Last month when my bill arrived they accidently over-charged me $125. I went down to my local Sprint PCS store to ask a representative in person why this had occured. He promptly fixed my problem (making sure I recived a refund of $125) and for my inconvenience Sprint is giving me the next 2 months of service FREE. Needless to say I was very pleased that they offered me that. Also, I plan on sticking with this phone service because through my job (Advocate Healthcare) I recieve a 20% discount off my monthly bill.
