Hastert has been a very good speaker of the house. He is a very good manager and that is key to making sure that house business is done properly. He is not an raving ideologue like Gingrich; Mr. Hastert does everything in an understated manner, but that should not be mistaken for ineffectiveness. He has managed to work with the many different elements of both parties to come up with legislation that is moderate and bi-partisaned. He is definitely the polar opposite of Newt Gingrich, who never compromised. In legislative process, the key word is compromise. The main reason why Gingrich could not build on the Republican 1994 victory was that he misjudged his political mandate. Hastert hasn't and that is why the Republicans are still in the house.
