When the smoke clears - all of you negative nitwits will see that this man was right all along. The economy is doing fine. Shut up and read the statistics. Bush's only real problem is Iraq. It's a shame that all of this falls on him (but, I admit, it must) because the most brilliant, thoughtful and informed minds in the world were convinced Iraq had weapons of MD. Even Hillary! Most Dems joined her in her support for the president. He didn't lie to us; He told us what he and the congress were told. The entire Middle East situation is a result of our support for Israel. Period. But blame all this on GWB? Even liberals like Clinton and Carter supported Israel. There have always been terrorists. The only solution is to smoke them out of their caves until so few are left and their networks broken, that they are rendered impotent. If Al Gore would have been elected in 2000, he would have been advised similarly, have done the same thing as GWB, and would be in the same situation.
