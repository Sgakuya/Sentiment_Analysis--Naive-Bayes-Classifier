Ok, as a Dallas resident of 14 years, born in Seattle, moved to Miami, then Denver, then here, I must say that people who think Dallas is a boring and cultural wasteland are quite mistaken. You must not have been awake when you saw this city. It's huge and sometimes impersonal, but no more than any other metro area of 5.6 million people. The West End, the Arts District, JFK Museum, the architecture, the Meyerson Symphony Center, Uptown, developing light rail system, zoos, museums, aquariums, small, local theatre, abundance of restaurants (the most per capita in the U.S.), Angelika Film Center, wonderful climate (gets a little hot, but it's good swimming weather), plenty of lakes, and most importantly some of the kindest people anywhere in the world. For your reference; I've travelled all over, every state in the union, and many, many overseas nations. Dallas is going through a difficult time economically. But every city does. It's suburbs are gorgeous, particularly up the tollway to the North. Dallas has no more or less problems than any other major city, but I find it to have class and charm all its own.
