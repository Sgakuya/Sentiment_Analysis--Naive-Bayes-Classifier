I love Tim Robbins movies! And I respect the fact that he stands up to important issues; a true American. Popular belief would lead us over a cliff, but when we have a voice contradicting an insurmountable amount of propaganda and popularity, you must make a movie about it! So come on Tim, make a movie about it. A president that has a plan that seems too radical, like The Project for a New American Century linning the pockets of big corporations with billions of taxpayers money to rebuild a nation, pumping billions of gallions of oil from the wells of Iraq. Freeing the iraq people is just a by product for the real plan. You don't think that our government would spend 85 billion dollars to free a repressed people! First we starved them with sanctions, then we disarmed them, then we bombed the hell out of them. WOW, do I love democracy.
