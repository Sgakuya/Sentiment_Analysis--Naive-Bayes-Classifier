What's not to like? Their stores are huge, most things have LOW prices; also, despite what people say, I've tried Wal-Mart store brands for a number of items (shampoo, detergent, cookies, etc.) and have rarely been disappointed. Two things I'm not crazy about (but not enough to reduce a star): their clothes aren't that great (although they're fine if you're just getting jean, shorts, t-shirts or undergarments), and when you shop in the electronics section, you have to really look at what you're getting to make sure you're not getting either a yucky Full-Screen DVD or an even yuckier Edited CD. Other than that, no complaints whatsoever.
