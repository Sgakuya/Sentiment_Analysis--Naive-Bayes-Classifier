Motorola has an excellent reputation for making great products. I bought this phone mainly because of the name but also it's one of the few mobile phones out there that actually reach from your ear to your mouth. It seems that only the flip phones can do this, all others only reach the middle of your cheek. It's shaped to conform closer to your face than most phones. The last time I checked my mouth was in front of my face NOT on the side. This phone has so many features, and such good call options that I can get a call in the middle of the desert and during prime time rush hour in Manhattan. It's effectiveness is considerably affected by which service you sign on for also, so I would suggest getting a good service to go with a great phone.
