Heaven on earth. There is a massive, donut-shaped wavepool called The Torrent that goes in a circle (you can get off at the beach or keep riding it to your heart's content). You could spend your entire visit there, without visiting the rest of the park, and have the time of your life. No lines, no wait, just fast-paced fun and big waves. You can ride it on an innertube, but I recommend going without one. Ride it to the wave machine and stand there, waiting for the water to slam down on you. It'll knock you underwater for a few seconds and carry you off. It's really a rush (albeit a little bit dangerous, but hey). The rest of the park doesn't quite live up to The Torrent, but it's awesome nonetheless.
