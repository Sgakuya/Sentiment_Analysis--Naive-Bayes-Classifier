Come on Guys!! Football is an emotional sport and if your heart isn't in it, your emotions wont be, either. Every player decides at what point it is right for him to retire. For Barry, although still physically able, he thought his time was up. He didnt feel like playing anymore. Barry Sanders stil posted the best numbers ever in about every category. Not every carry got him 60 yards, but he did almost always get a few. Very few backs can turn 7 yeards out of every run. He blessed us witht the greatest highlight clips of all time, and with a great story of a legend to tell our kids. he3 was the best ever, and his early retirement doesn't change that a bit.
