While there are many things I admire about Secretary Rice, I must say that I am in total disagreement with regard to her dangerous policies toward Israel, I also question her intentions on this matter. HE who keeps Israel neither sleeps nor slumbers.... He will curse those who curse Israel and bless those who bless her.... The apple of HIS eye.... I believe I read something in Ezekiel about the eyeballs and flesh melting off the bodies, of several nations, before their bones hit the ground, who decide at some time in the future to attack Israel.... I also distinctly remember reading that 5 out of 6 of these attackers would be killed in a bloody massacre, some time in the future, when they attack Israel and their blood would reach a horses bridle.... etc. Something to think about anyway.... Has she read her bible lately? When it comes to Israel, I seriously feel she should have pursued the career of Concert Pianist....
