Directed by John Sturges, The Great Escape (1963) is an epic story based on the true Allied escape from a Nazi prisoner of war during WWII. For the uninitiated, the director and screenwriters based the main characters on a combination of real life soldiers whose different talents helped the success of the escape. The major talent for the movie included Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, James Donald, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Donald Pleasence. The producers originally received some criticism for using American actors and implying that American prisoners also escaped (as the Americans were moved prior to the actual escape); however, historians and the surviving escapes have defended this, citing the efforts of the Americans to the eventual success of the escape. An interesting part of the film is how the screenwriters differentiated between the S.S. and the Luftwafa, the latter in charge of the German prisons. It was the former who carried out the execution of 50 of the escapees after capture, while the Luftwafa hinted at sympathy and disapproval of these killings. The bottom line is that The Great Escape is both fun and entertaining film, but has a bit of history and real life heroism as well.
