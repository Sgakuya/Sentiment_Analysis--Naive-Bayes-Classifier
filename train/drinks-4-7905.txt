Booker Noe was the Ambassador of Bourbon, the fifth or sixth? generation to head Jim Beam Brands, and this is the batch he put his own name to. Personally, I find it too strong--it's over 100 proof--and that can interfere with the depth of flavor it does have. I prefer Jim Beam Black and Knob Creek when drinking bourbons, but this is definitely something special. If you're trying Booker's for the first time, have it served to you on the rocks. It's much too fine, not to mention costly, to drink with a mixer. Let the ice melt until it's at a dilution you can tolerate, and at that point you'll really taste the genius of the late Booker Noe. Don't let the bartender add a garnish like a twist. You're trying to see what an expert distiller--and legendary raconteur and just plain hell of a guy--could do with a humble ear of corn and a Kentucky creek.
