Let's be fair here guys...so many of you are so biased it's disgusting. And that goes for people on both sides of the political spectrum. George W. Bush has done nothing wrong since entering office and he has without a doubt returned dignity and honor to the White House. While at the moment he is doing a fine job, I'm not sure if I will vote for him in 2004 as I am beginning to realize that there is not much difference between a Republican and a Democrat in this country. I used to think Republicans were the party of smaller government, but this is not the case at all. They have no become a moderate Democratic Party. I'm tired of our Socialist approach to the role of government and I think everyone else should be weary of Big Brother as well. This is why I intend on voting Libertarian from now on, and I urge all Republicans to do the same...As for you Democrats, you might as well vote Communist the way your party has turned out.
