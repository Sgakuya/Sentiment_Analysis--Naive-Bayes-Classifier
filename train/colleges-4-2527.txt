Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is a good school. It had an image problem in the past, but the new president is working very hard to improve campus aesthetics. As for an urban campus, VCU is better than a lot of other inner-city universities. VCU has become a top-level institution and is ranked by the Carnegie Foundation as an Extensive Doctoral Research University(Highest ranking from Carnegie). The art and med schools are terrific, the new engineering school is gaining good press and VCU has 20 u-grad programs that are ranked as some of the best in the nation according to U.S. News. VCU is a good school, just a good urban school. If you love medium size cities, Richmond offers plenty of opportunities in the form of museums, restaurants, nightlife, and cultural activities. If you're creative, motivated to learn, and don't have the same, mundane cookie-cutter mindset about colleges, I encourage you to check out VCU. People like to down the school because its inner-city, but don't realize that it holds many academic rankings and that not everyone wants to go to a boring college out in the middle of nowhere where you have to plan a trip to the nearest store or a mall. The campus is high energy and in my opinion, is Virginia's most dynmamic university, besting Tech and UVA in diversity by far.
