He seems like a righteous and good enough man, as well as a respected and competent Senator. Is it my imagination or is there a reason why Joe Lieberman and Jackie Mason have never been seen together. As a retired career Naval officer, I lean towards the Pachyderm. However, as one of the so-called chosen, I watched the 2000 Election with interest to see if the country was receptive to vote a Jewish man one heartbeat away from the Presidency. I am curious as to whether Lieberman's J-Factor affected the outcome of the 2000 Election. I do recall one Jewish columnist complaining, We needed a Jewish VP candidate in the mold and stature of Jackie Robinson. We ended up with the Jewish equivalent of Choo Choo Coleman.
