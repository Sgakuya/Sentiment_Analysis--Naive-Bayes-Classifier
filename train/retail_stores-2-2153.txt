The good, the Bad the ugly. The good- They will train you to be a great SalesMaker. If you worked at the shack and made salary you were probably sitting in the back room hiding from the forcefeed customers. The bad- They treat store managers very bad. I was demoted from being a manager because 3 people came into my store moved the cameras took money from our cash drawer and walked away with over $1000. I supposedly was not protecting customer assets. I have also seen other managers that wanted a life outside of the shack be put in stores with no or little help. The ugly- If it is not in a new box sealed up do not buy it. Do not buy displays. They are normally returns that have been repaired.
