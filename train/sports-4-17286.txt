Excellent season so far. I'm still not sure if they have enough of a running game and strong enough offensive line to get Philly into the Super Bowl. Mc Nabb is an excellent QB in my book. He doesn't have the skills like some of the other QB's in the league but he's durable, an accurate passer, and knows how to win games. Another reason I like the Eagles comes from living in the Tampa area. All these fair weather redneck Bucs fans don't like Philly. That reason alone is good enough for me. A friend of mine from PA was down in Fla this weekend. We were watching the Philly-GB game and pulling for the Eagles. There were two sullen-looking Bucs fans that were clearly pissed that the Eagles were winning. He told us You can't cheer for Philly in here and after T.O. did his bird dance one of these a-holes screamed at the T.V. I hope they knock his f-head off!!! Right in front of some females. This just shows you the type of rednecks we have to deal w/ in Florida. And give these clowns some alcohol and they start talking even more $hit and looking for a fight. In summary: Eagles are my favorite team and Martin Grammatica is my favorite kicker. May the Bucs go winless the rest of the way!
