If I had seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon when it first came out, I would have been impressed. As it was, unfortunately, all the relentless hype raised my expectations far too high. Yes, the martial arts scenes and special effects are entertaining to watch, but they aren't revolutionary. Didn't The Matrix already break that ground? Still, the acting was solid, and I enjoyed the story, which had a timeless, mythic feel. Given that the plot was generally conventional, I especially liked the unconventional, ambiguous ending. Overall, if you haven't seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it is worth renting, but don't go in expecting a masterpiece.
