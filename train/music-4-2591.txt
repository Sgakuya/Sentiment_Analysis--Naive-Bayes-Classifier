The Beatles redeemed themselves after the catastrophic infighting of the Let it Be sessions. Come Together and Oh! Darling are standouts on Side 1, and Side 2 is characterized by little bits of melody that form a pop opera, as John Lennon called it. Though Lennon stated he did not like the pop opera it's actually very effective. We're given brief character sketches of Mean Mr Mustard(always shouts out something obsscene),Polythene Pam (she's so good-looking that she looks like a man) and the characters in She Came in Through the Window (and so I quit the police dept/and got myself a steady job). These people are interesting and we might like to learn more about them, but time is short, and we have to accept these brief glimpses. With Abbey Road, the Beatles signed off with class and dignity.
