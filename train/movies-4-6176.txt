A pretty good movie. Audrey Hepburn was good as Holly Golightly the country girl who came to the big city to marry a very rich man. She meets men by being an escort to them or as she says $50.00 to go the the powder room. She never admits to really being a prostitute. a new man moves in to an apartment above her and they strike up a friendship. he is a struggling writer.both have their problems. Of course there is the hope that they end up together. I also read the book and they have different endings. the only complaint i would have is Mickey Rooney although a great actor had a dumb role in this movie{he played an asian man} and it is a bit dated from the sixties.
