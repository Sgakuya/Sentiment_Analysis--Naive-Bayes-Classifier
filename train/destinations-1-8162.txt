I lived in Kansas City for 99% of my 40 years.... most of it within a couple of miles of the zoo. I always drove to Omaha, or St Louis to go to the zoo, however. There's FAR too much walking, NO signs of any helpful employees (or any employees except in the rare shop or restaurant you can find open). I am disabled by Multiple Sclerosis, and there's no way I could walk the entire zoo, and the gates and doors of the zoo are entirely UNaccessible to disabled visitors in a wheelchair. There is far too much back tracking (walk for what seems like forever, to see MAYBE one or two animals, then walk back the way you came). I love the idea of a natural environment for the animals, but we're talking NO animals on exhibit even during great weather. I sure hope that the wonderful new zoo director will make the KC Zoo worth going to!
