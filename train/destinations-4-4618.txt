Improving. Milwaukee has this odd problem, it seems, in deciding whether or not to move forward. Every time a building is suggested or a modern proposal made, people get concerned that the city won't look exactly like it did in 1894. When I lived there in the late 1990's, I would have rated this city a 3 for OK. Now it's a 4 - a few years ago, the Midwest Express center opened, a new, stunning art museum arrived on the lakefront, the intrusive downtown interstate was torn down, and the city suddenly began to improve dramatically - the downtown is now booming, condominiums are appearing along the previously abandoned Wisconsin Avenue, the newly built Riverwalk is very pretty, and the lakefront makes for a pleasant walk. There's also a nice system of parks and bike trails throughout the city. There is unfortunately still a very dull industrial element to a large portion of the city, however, lots of abandoned factories and buildings, far too many bars, and not enough restaurants. There is still an odd tendency for the city to stagnate and remain in place just as it starts to move forward. Except for Summerfest, for example, the multiple cultural fests are repetitive salutes to alcohol. Milwaukee is a pleasant enough city overall, however, the people there are friendly, and it is seriously underrated on this list.
