I'm origionally from the Baltimore-DC Area, and I plan on going to college at AU, so I'm a bit biased here. However, I'm sure we can all agree that Washington D.C. is a beautiful city to visit with enough tourist attractions to keep visitors busy for a few days. As Americans, we should each travel to this nation to see what our country is all about- our heritage, our history and our government. There are some parts of the city that you want to stay out of, but every city has its bad parts. I suggest that any red-blooded American visit Washington D.C. at least one time in their life for a true American experience. Washington D.C. is a city of northern charm and southern efficiency - JFK.
