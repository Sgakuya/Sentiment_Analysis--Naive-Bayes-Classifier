The only reason why I gave this movie 4 stars was because of the music. And of course, Ken Watanabe, who was excellent. He was so good, he made me forget about Tom Cruise. Oh my god, the music was superb! It brought tears to my eyes when all I wanted to do is laugh out and yell bullshit! It is what actually made the movie so sad, that and of course, Ken Watanabe`s acting. He is so charming. I cried like a baby when I was watching it. But of course, the set and props were good as well, and the landscape was so beautiful, so idyllic! It shows that the budget was rather high. Overall impression of the movie is that it is very very very sad, even though it is not completely historically correct, and it has an action figure for a hero. The way it made me feel... undescribable. It s the music I tell you!
