I went to Planet of the Apes with my husband (a die-hard fan), and we were both disappointed in the movie. On the plus side, the costumes and make-up were fantastic. We couldn't believe how realistic the apes looked, even when speaking. However, the plot was nearly non-existent, and we never warmed up to any of the characters. Mark Wahlberg, who plays the lead, was unlikable in nearly every respect, and his performance was flat and uninspiring. There was a lot of unnecessary violence in the movie, too, which was a big turnoff for me (even my husband remarked on this). Finally, I was surprised to find myself feeling restless and bored in places. I think I checked my watch four times during different slow periods- not a good sign in an action-oriented movie! Don't waste your time on Planet of the Apes, even when it comes out on video.
