Truly one of the best, and it is getting better every week. They are clean, up-to-date, reliable enough to take you to any place in the most populated parts of the Bay Area, and now they are painting the trains to look much prettier. Since they are now planning to connect to San Jose Airport and its Amtrak/ACE/Caltrain Station, they should have more room for luggage. I would wish that the trains are not crowded in order to move your luggage through the aisles and seats if you came from or going to SFO or OAK Airports during the commute hours, but that is normal. However, I have heard that BART is the best transit system in the nation (by a survey). After being on many transit systems, I should agree because they are starting to remodernize their stations. If you go to San Fran, stop at Montgomery, Powell and Civic Center stations, it has changed a lot since the 1970's.
