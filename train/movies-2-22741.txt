As A Depiction Of The Comic The Movie Sucked, 2 Much Creative License A Bad Costume Choice. Had There Never Been An XMen Book, Then The Movie Would've Been Good. Storm: One Of The Best Displays Of Abilities Many Rasberries 2 Whomever Chose 2 Say She Wasn't In Full Control Of Her Powers...@ 16 She Was Bringing Rain 2 Tribes In Africa Was Revered As A Weather Goddess, Encased In A Metal Molding Of Herself By Dr. Doom She She Warped Weather Patterns For Miles Then When Released, She Stopped The Hurricane Altho She Did Pass Out From The Effort. Speaking Of Africa, Where She's From...Get Out Ur Flashlights So We Can Look 4 Her Accent In Broad Daylight Cause It Was Lost! See Had They Not Cameoed The New Mutants Powers They Could've Sprung For A Voice Coach 4 Halle. Next Time U'll Listen When The Masses Say Get Naomi Campbell! Wolverine: Yo I Loved The Claws...Kool Way 2 Give Scot The Finger! But Couldn't They Have Gotten Someone A Lil More Menacing Or @ Least Made Him Up 2 Look That Way? Cyclops: Oh God!...Next! Rogue: Liked The Subtle Southern Accent, Wasn't As Harsh As The Cartoon The Book Portrays It That's Kool...Pre Ms. Marvel Powers...Good Job But I Would've Preferred 2 See The Short Skunk Doo Instead Of The Carol Danvers Perona In Control Long Hair Y'd They Wait Til The End Of The Movie 2 Give Her A White Streak? Marvel Girl...? Ms. Psyche...? Phoenix...? Black Queen...? Dark Phoenix...? Oh Hell, Jean Grey!: Worst Display Of Powers, Aren't Telepaths Suppossed 2 Know What's Goin On In Another Person's Mind Except 4 Another Telepath Rogue...Then Explain How Toad Got The Drop On Her? Come On People Proffessor X Trained Her Better Than That...Again, See What Happens When U Cameo Unnecessary People's (New Mutants) Powers. Proffessor X: He Was Kool 4 Who He Was, Perfect. Magneto: Could've Been A Bit Younger A Bit Heavier They Played Him Jus A Lil 2 Weak...Were The Acolytes Anywhere Around? Sabertooth: Perfect! Jus Think, Tyler Was Only Hired 2 B A Stuntman...Alright 4 Timing. Y Was Iceman Jus A Teen? Who Was The Kid Poppin In Out While Playin Basketball? People Kept Asking If It Was Nightcrawler But Kurt Bamfs Out In A Stinking Cloud Of Smoke He's Blue. Mystique: Y Didn't She Rogue Know Each Other, If I Remember Correctly, Wasn't She Rogue's Foster Mom? Hmmmmm...Big Blooper! @ The Beginning Wolvie Was In A Cagefight With A Guy He Broke His Hand Punching Wolvie's Fist Due 2 Adamantium Laced Bones Yet The No Clothes No Shoes Wearin Mystique Is Whippin Ass! Mystique Always Knew Better Than 2 Go Up Against Wolvie Without A Blade 2 Go 4 His Jugular Or Her Exploding Gas Skulls(Which 1 Was Missing From The Tip Of Her Hairline Along With Her Boots Dress Storms Accent!) Not A Good Depiction...Hope The Next 1 Is Gonna B Better.
