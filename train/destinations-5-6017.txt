Although I was born in East Los Angeles, my family roots are in New Mexico. My father was born in Albuquerque and raised mostly in Las Cruces. The family goes back a few centuries in New Mexico and I still have a lot of family there. When I was a kid we would vacation there and we had the best time. I have good memories of The Land of Enchantment, especialy the food. Chile reigns supreme in this great state, both green and red chile. My father would buy gunny sacks filled with green chile and he would make his famous Chile Verde. Everything taste better in New Mexico, enchiladas, carne adobada, chile colorado, pozole and menudo. Even the rice and beans seem better. Something in the soil just brings out the heat and flavor in the foods. I have been back a few times as a adult and it has changed a bit. But it still seems like a great place to live. The white, Hispanic and Native American culture seem to have merged into one great culture, while retaining their individuality. Also for boxing fans, New Mexico has turned out a few good fighters. Rocky and Louie Burke (My Cousins) , Johnny Tapia and Danny Romero. I hope to visit again soon.
