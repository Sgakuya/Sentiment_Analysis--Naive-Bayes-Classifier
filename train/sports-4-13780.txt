Sherman has kept the team competitive and ready to play in most games, regardless of the numerous injuries that have occurred throughout the season. The team does not give up. Special teams and the defense are disciplined and much better prepared to play a full game than the previous coach. The offensive problems are the result of the loss of dorsey levens (the prototypical west coast HB who can run AND catch the ball) and TE chmura, though bubba franks has shown an ability to catch the ball. The biggest problem is receivers who drop WAY TOO MANY ball. Sherman has gotten favre to play within himself and thus lessen the risks of an int. Rhodes could never do that. I'm hopeful that with more game experience, Mike Sherman will develop as a tactician and that is an area in which he needs improvement.
