Pretentious undergraduates without the courage to stand up to their parents thus the piercing/hair color/leftism that will quickly die off once they go into the job market. Yes, some very bright and original people. . .but the lack of intellectual structure (ciriculum and otherwise) is cause for snickering in several academic circles. Don't get me wrong, these are smart and nice people. . .but there is something very immature about a student body that defines cool by arbitrarily rejecting EVERYTHING that isn't uber-tree-hugger-leftist. Then again, I'd rather be here than a more conservative place. Four Stars.
