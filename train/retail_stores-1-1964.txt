They have a lot of people willing to help you, but sometimes it's too much. When I go in there sometimes it feels like I constantly have salesperson looking over my shoulder ready to jump in every time I stop to look at a product. Their advertised prices are pretty good, but be ready to deny a rediculously-priced and unnecessary service warranty. Sometimes they don't take no for an answer, either. I bought a TV from them one time, and I told the floor salesman I didn't want a service warranty. When I got to the checkout, the cashier asked me if I wanted a service warranty. When I said no, he tried to persuade me otherwise and I had to say no a third time. Besides that, sometimes they'll try to talk you into "free offers" with strings attached, such as one time when they wanted me to allow them to share my credit card number with a magazine company with the promise of getting a free year of issues. The cashier told me how easy it was to cancel the subscription so that I wouldn't have to pay anything. Yeah, right. If I wanted to hear a sales pitch, try to be persuaded into buying things I didn't want, or receive a good offer (with strings attached), I'd go to a sketchy used car dealership.
