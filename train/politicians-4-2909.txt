I called Sen Ben Campbell a turncoat when he switched parties and so to be fair I have to say the same for Jeffords. But Donna Brazil stated it best -- Jim Jeffords did not leave the Republican Party, the Republican Party left James Jeffords. Trent Lott was asleep at the wheel for this one and deserves to lose his leadership position in the Party. Bush deserves some of the blame because members of the Republican Party could not even get through to him, most notable Sen. Snowe, when they found out Jeffords was about to switch parties. But most of the blame lies squarely on the radical right wing of the Republican Party who refused to accept Jeffords heartfelt opposition to the President's tax plan. It was those right wing members with vows of retribution against Vermon't Dairy Farmers that drove Jeffords out of the GOP. Good on 'em!
