I got my 1997 Nissan Altima GXE in 1997. I have a minor complaint about road noise but I would imagine it would go away if I hadn't been too lazy/cheap to get it repaired. My biggest complaint is that it got broken into 3 times...I'll share the blame for one instance, maybe two, but I'm convinced that the third time happened because Nissan's, Toyota's and Honda's are targeted for theft. Very low-maintenance vehicle; runs great and gets great gas mileage. If I weren't moving cross-country I'd run her to the ground. Many good times and memories - I will miss you Altima, and may your next owner get as much use out of the back seat!
