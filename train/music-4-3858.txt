I liked this album a lot in high school. It was derivative, and it was obvious these guys were ripping off the Rolling Stones, but then so did the NY Dolls, a band I revere, and a lot of other bands who did pretty good albums. If you are going to rip somebody off, make it somebody worthwhile, like the Stones. This album seemed to represent Aerosmith at their peak. Their albums after this quickly deteriorated, and then they supposedly went on hiatus to get off of drugs. Cleaned up, they resumed their career, but you would never know it was the same band. Banal? Puerile? Insipid? They had become all these things in just a few short drug-free years. Not that I ever qualified as a fan but it was sort of sad in a way, although I'm sure these guys are laughing all the way to the bank. I'm not a proponent of drug abuse by any means, but as soon as they cleaned up their act, their music couldn't have been more boringly banal than if they had gotten Huey Lewis to write their songs for them.
