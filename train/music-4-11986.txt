Da Destiny's child c.d was off da chain.It talks about every day things.It's just that like the song (Say My Name)Every time you try to get a chance to say their name they is always kicking somebody out of the group.Also Beyonce' needs to let someone else sing sometime even though her father is the producer but it's not called Beyonce' and Destiny's Child.But they have good voices and to keep up the good work.For all dem haters out there that be hatin' on them.HONEY'S PLEASE!!! It's also good that they put some church up in there,cause I love that song Amazing Grace.Their music also influences teenagers minds (like me)And it's a good influence.I know what ya'll thinking but really it is.
