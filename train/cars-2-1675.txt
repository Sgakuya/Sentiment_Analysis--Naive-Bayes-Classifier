Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Once America's best selling family sedan, the Taurus has been eclipsed by both Camry and Accord. And for good reason. The 1996 redesign was nauseating and Ford flooded the marketplace with Tauruses by dumping them on rental car companies and taxi fleets. No wonder they're so cheap! Tauruses are quite literally a dime a dozen. You don't buy a Taurus because its a good car you buy it cause its cheap! Even though the Taurus is soon to be discontinued, you can bet there's gonna be a glut of them sitting on dealer lots in the next year or two when the rental car and taxi companies renew their fleets.
