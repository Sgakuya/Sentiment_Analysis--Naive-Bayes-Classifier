I cannot stand this comic. When I read it I truly feel sick to my stomach. It is a horrible strip and I have wondered for years why it stays in the paper. I really hate it. Here is the text from a recent one: Arg! April Showers. It's good for the flowers. What flowers. The ones that come in May. May?! Sure. Then they miss all the rain. Why is this crap defended and lauded? It's like the guy spends no more than five minutes thinking of the most cliche and pointless words to stick in there. And what REALLY bothers me is when I went on the internet to search for other people's opinions of the strip all I found were positive reviews... WHAT THE HELL. Cute, simple, sweet. I can't fathom this mass-absurdity. The strips only redeeming value is that it is drawn well. But horrible stories make it a mute point.
