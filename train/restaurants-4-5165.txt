I really like this place. It has a very nice atmoshpere and the people here are really nice. they are more personal than others that I go to. I have not fully experinced it yet (I've only been there for lunch and we only got some salads and I got a steak burger thing which was reallly good!) I like it alot so far and I think it is a nice place to go to eat. I liekd my steak burger and it was huge!!! my mom's salad was really good anf fresh and I do not remember what my dad had... But I don't recommend it to large families unless you got alot of money. it runs up to 20 buck more expensive then Ryan's for 7 people to eat there. It is more for a couple to go out and have some drinks and a really nice meal, now don't expect a romantic romeo mood... it has more of a bar feel to the place and it is cool I think.. I like the service there. they are pretty prompt with it. I like the hollywood and other relics that were on the walls. This place deserves a 4.4 so far. (mostly for concept including cost factors for most people).. I'll have to try the rest out!!! ;)
