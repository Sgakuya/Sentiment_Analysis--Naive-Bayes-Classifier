MY SISTER AND I ATE AT THE APPLEBEES IN BEDFORD HTS,OHIO ON ROCKSIDE ROAD TODAY,9-25-03. WE HAVE EATEN THERE BEFORE. SERVICE IS USUALLY POOR, BUT TODAY IS THE WORST AND WE WILL NEVER GO BACK. THE MALE THAT BROUGHT OUR FOOD WAS SNOTTY, AND WHEN TOLD HE FORGOT THE SAUCE HE CALLED US SEETIE IN A VERY DERAGATORY MANNER, AND WHEN HE CAME BACK WITH THE SAUCE UN QUESTION HE SLAMMED IT ON THE TABLE. WE ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER, WHO APOLOGIZED AND ASKED WHAT HE COULD DO. I TOLD HIM TO FIRE THE CREEP, BUT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE CHARGED US FOR OUR MEAL WHICH WAS RUINED DUE TO AGGRAVATION.I MADE SURE THAT EVERYONE IN THE RESTAURANT HEARD OUR COMMENTS. DISGUSTED IN OHIO, JUDY AND MARYBETH
