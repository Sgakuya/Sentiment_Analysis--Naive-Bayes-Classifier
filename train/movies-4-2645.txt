Released in 1986 and directed by Robert Harmon, The Hitcher is a surprisingly deep and entertaining horror thriller. For the uninitiated, the story involves a young man, Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell), who takes a job driving a car from Chicago to San Diego. To relieve the boredom, he throws caution to the wind and picks up a hitchhiker, John Ryder (Rutger Hauer). Ryder turns out to be a psychopath and tries to kill Halsey; however, he escapes. Nevertheless, Halsey is not through with the hitcher yet as Ryder decides to torment him by leaving a trail of dead bodies to find despite Halsey's best efforts to warn others. Along the way, Halsey becomes the ultimate suspect, but is befriended by a young waitress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who helps him prove his innocence. While there is not really anything new with the basic concept, what makes this film work is the genuinely creepy aura that Rutger Hauer exudes through the screen and the Average Joe portrayal by C. Thomas Howell. The viewer can easily put themselves in the driver's position, and the film reflects the natural fear of letting the outside into our cozy, protected confines of modern society. The bottom line is that The Hitcher is a horror movie that relies on a feeling of helplessness from being outwitted rather than being out muscled.
