A lot of people talk about Pitino. Let Louisville keep him. It took him what 3 or more years to get a good team that could play. Well you can say what you want Tubby wears the National Champion Ring not Pitino. I'm a die hard fan I'll be in thier corner even if they loss every game they play. Your comments only prove that you can careless about Ky unless thier winning. Fair weather fans. What you think about them now. I beat all of you are probaly telling eveyone that you knew Ky and Tubby would be great this year. You all need to stick with Pitino. I don't even care if they loss in the first round of the SEC. they will have to win 9 more games to be NCAA Champions so let's give them a break. Remember when they win they SEC they loss the NCAA and win they loss the SEC they win the NCAA. We can hope that they go all the way and win both.
