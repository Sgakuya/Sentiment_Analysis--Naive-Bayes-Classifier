For me, the coolest thing about this book was its discussion of whether you can have control over how you are perceived. In Tobias Wolff's case, when he moved with his mother across the country, he made a decision that he was going to be a different person when he arrived. He was going to be popular, smart, outgoing, and he was going to leave his reputation as a troublemaker behind him. His thinking went that the people that he was going to meet did not know him from Adam, and therefore, he would have control over the image that he projected. What he found was that you are who you are, and that over time, your true colors come out whether you want them to or not. A nice quick read with some excellent coming of age descriptions...
