I love my Elantra!! I have the 2000 GLS model and its great. It has the 100,000 mile 10 year warranty. What more could you ask for. It's great on gas(which is wonderful right now). It does excatly what it says it does in a head on collision too. I had a 93 Elantra and in 94 I wrecked into a tree head on. Although, my 93 model didn't have a airbag at the time, I still walked away. The car did excatly what it said. The hood goes up to a point and the motor drops. So nothing gets pushed back to the driver/passengers. I just walked away with a few bruises. For 12,000 what more could you ask for you have saftey and reliablity.
