I'm not sure I'd want Jason Williams on my team, but he's a lot of fun to watch. If he can tone it down a little bit, stop taking idiotic 3-pointers from way behind the line, and cut down on the foolish trick passes, he and Webber will make a powerful team and an excellent core for the Kings. But if he makes those improvements, he probably won't be as entertaining a player. I also give him points for that cool commercial showing Williams and Randy Moss as kids, but I have to take away points for that annoying commercial where he's a rapping cartoon. I wonder which would be more entertaining - a highlight tape of Williams or a blooper tape? He definitely has flashes of brilliance and flashes of uncommon stupidity.
