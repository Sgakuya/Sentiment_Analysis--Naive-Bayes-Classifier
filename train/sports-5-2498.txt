Such idiocy to rate this team one or two stars b/c you don't like them. Start voting with your head instead of your heart. The Cubs are a very tough team to beat reagrdless of whether they collapse in the postseason or not. I think that the Cubs will be stronger than they were last season. They have upgraded their defense at first base by signing Lee from Florida and made a smart move in signing Todd Walker from the Red Sox (DAMMIT!!). Walker proved his worth playing excellent in the Red Sox series vs the Yankees with his bat (.400 avg) and his glove. The Cubs have also strengthened their pitching adding Greg Maddux to a starting rotation that includes Kerry Wood and Mark Pryor. In fact, Chicago has the best 1-2 pitching tandem in baseball with Wood and Pryor who will only improve as they are still quite young. Many believe Schilling-Martinez of Boston are the premeir 1-2 starters but I don't belive that to be the case. Taken as a whole, I believe the Cubs starting rotation is second only to Oakland. The Cubs starters can go deep into a ballgame (this will take the load off of their suspect bullpen). Their outfield still looks pretty good defensively, but more impressive at the plate. Cubs only weakness I see is catcher, and bullpen
