I have used AT T wireless,Nextel, Cellular one and Sprint. And out of all of these AT@T is far the worst, there line of Nokia phones are built like garbage, there service is at best sporatic and there service department is the pitts. Last week I had a problem with my AT T phone (we use them at work) it took them all day to troubleshoot the problem. There fix, take the phone back to the store from which it came. So I did, the woman there spent two hours on the phone with AT T service before they deduced the problem was with my phone. So AT T's fix was to give me a loaner while mine was scrutinized by there tech department. This phone is a real winner, every time you to use it or even if you just pick it up to use it, the damn battery falls out of it and hits the floor. This is only one of many AT T horror stories I can tell you, beleive me there many others. You want good cellular service go with Sprint or Nextel..
