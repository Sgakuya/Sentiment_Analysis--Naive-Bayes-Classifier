Baltimore's MTA has to rank with one of the worse mass transit systems in America. It's a constant game of guessing when your bus will come and if the bus driver will even stop to pick you up. The coaches are as old as dirt, but that does not stop the MTA from putting them on the road. Undue preference is given to those people going to baseball or football games. How do I know? An all call went out to the bus drivers telling them that the best buses would be cleaned up for a football game and, as far as the other drivers were concerned, it was catch as catch can when it came to the other coaches. When asked about it at a transportation forum, Flanagan, Maryland Transportation Director gave only a very flippant answer about everyone deserving a safe and clean bus to ride. The average rider is made to feel like dirt most of the time when asking a driver for directions, etc. To top it off, the MTA and Yellow Transportation are being sued by the FTA for its mistreatment and neglect of disabled customers.
