Ok, so Kobe cheated, and thats bad. But people(haters) need to realize that he made a mistake, just like everyboody else does. And I know he didn't mean to hurt his wife. Kobe is a really great person. He doesn't cuss on live(or not live)tv, like Shaq. And he doesn't kick the ball in the stands like Tmac(But I do like Tmac a little and he is fuuuine). People want to say he is a ballhog, but have the time he passes, some nobody goofs up the shot. Like this last Sunday against the kings.Most good things happen when the ball is in Kobe's hands, just like this wednesday against portland. Kobe made two three pointers, the last one with 1.0 seconds left. Kobe may not get the MVP this year, but he sure does deserve it. Having had 3 injuries, and hearings in Colorado, he always makes a comeback. And what about before the games. While the other lakers are just arriving, Kobe is practicing. He's probably practicing as we speak, if not sleeping from all the hard work he has been doing. Kobe deticates so much of his time to basketball, probably for comfort, since haters want to jump on his back. By the way, Kobe is so cute!!! (#1 fan!!!) Email me for commentz Lakerqueen8@verizon.net
