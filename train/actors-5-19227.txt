If someone asked me if I could pick any celebrity I would love to meet, date, or marry it would be Matthew Perry hands down!! He is the funniest actor in the business!! My favorite movie he was in was Fools Rush In. I read an interview he gave and his answers about what he said about what kind of person he would like to date made me love him even more. In my opinion, he is real and naturally talented. I love his portryal of Chandler on Friends and I can honestly say that if he quit the show I would not watch it anymore. I would give anything to meet him. He is my role model. I thought he was just as attractive when he gained weight as he was when he was thin. I watch Friends everyday because he is histerically funny and he makes my day! On Friends and Fools Rush In I love the way he seems like he has a huge heart and that's the way I like to think he is in real life. What is most attrative about him is that he never seems arrogant. To the person that said all of those horrible things about Matthew it sounds to me like your envious and there is no way I would ever believe any of those things that you wrote. I think Matthew Perry is the greatest and I would absolutely melt if I ever met him. Matthew Perry RULES!!!!
