Apparently the Beatles did not enjoy making this album. Nevertheless it contains a good number of great tracks. The negatives do irritate, such as the dreadful, self-indulgent Revolution 9 ; and Helter Skelter will be forever tarnished by its unfortunate association with the Sharon Tate tragedy, although this is hardly the fault of the Beatles. But the rest of the recording has some real gems. The raw energy of Back In the USSR contrasts with the sweet lullaby, Good Night . Then there is the acidic Piggies , with its echoes of George Orwell's Animal Farm, and the amusingly old-fashioned Honey Pie . Blackbird has a lovely melody and a wistful message. I Will is a beautiful song - (I still treasure a recording my sisters and I made singing along to it when we were very young!). Ob-La-Di is pure bubble-gum - simple and catchy. The variety of musical styles, the memorable melodies and rhythms - this helps to provide a 5-star rating for this album from this marvelous group.
