I have a 04 Crew Cab SE with the nice leather interior, 17 alloys borrowed from the Super-Charged, and 6CD in-dash changer with premium speakers...this truck is loaded (minus the Super-Charger). There is absolutely no way anyone can get such a loaded, sexy looking, reliable, head turning, comfortable compact or full size truck with all the mentioned benefits for under $24,000. I have owned two of these trucks, an 01 Crew Cab and now my 04. Do not listen to all the Import haters that leave bad rating...they probably don't even own one of these beauties. These trucks are built tough and perform exceptionally great on-road with comfort and not with that choppy feeling you get from Tacomas. They are extremely capable of towing up to 5000lbs. with no problem, and best of all they LOVE when you take them off-roading. I outfitted my truck with an AIRAID cold air intake system and a Flowmaster exhaust. The sound and the added pep is fenomenal and you get this using the cheapest gas available 87 octane. My next upgrade is going to be a set of Bilstein heavy duty shocks, BFGoodrich All Terrains, a Fabtech 3.5 lift kit, and a thumping Eclipse sound system added to my original Nissan changer (so there is aftermarket parts out there for these trucks, you just gotta look for them!). The only complain I do have (but does not veer me against my comments of a great truck) is the somewhat cramped rear seat area, and not to impresive gas mileage (17-19mpg). Other than that, go out and get yourself one, you wount be disapointed.
