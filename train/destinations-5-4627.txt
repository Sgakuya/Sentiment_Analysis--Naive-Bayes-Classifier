This is a town that doesn't bull$hit. If you are a phony then this city will expose you in a minute and you will likely leave and tell your friends that Milwaukee sucks. When in reality you just got schooled by an American city that rejects pretension and embraces authenticity. I have been to large cities all over the US and Milwaukee is able to compete with just about any of them. Over the past several years the city has experienced a rebirth of its downtown with many people moving back to new apartments and renovated loft condos. The city always had thousands more bars and clubs than most and live entertainment is cheap. With 2 major outdoor music venues a variety of national act visit yearly. As a city that once had the tallest office building in the world, icon Milwaukee City Hall 1895-1897, Milwaukee has maintained its classic architecture and traditions and is a legit American City.
