I have always maintained that Jane is a very talented actress even though many of her film s topics leave me strangely cold (Klute, They Shoot Horses Don t They, Agnes of God). I was young when she did her well-publicized anti-war protest at home and in Viet Nam so I never really knew some of the detailed facts about it until much later. However, I now no longer wonder why she was so hated for the things she did during that period of time. For instance, giving notes that had been slipped to her by American POW s seeking help to their captors while full-well knowing these men would be beaten or killed if she did this (and they were). I am amazed that she wasn t put in jail or even shot as a traitor back then for this and many other unthinkable things she did. But then, she was the daughter of a well-known celebrity, had a certain amount of celebrity in her own right and was, of course, most importantly very wealthy. For nearly anyone else the case would have had a much different outcome. She now says she is a born again Christian. Well, I hope so Jane we all need forgiveness for the things we ve done wrong but you re in need of it in a really BIG way.
