Cox cable service nighttime lineup is a joke! Many of the channels (like Comedy channel and KTLA) become infomercial channels at night- as if we didn't get enough of this boring crap during the day! I'm also very tired of all the lies and mud-slinging they do concerning digital satellite dish TV services (like DirecTV). To me this seems self-defeating; they seem afraid of the competition so they try to trash them. I have yet to speak to any DirecTV subscribers who aren't pleased with their programming and service while I think I could fill a book with compaints from Cox customers. We need cable competition or stiffer regulation of cable sustems like Cox in San Diego. We have the technology to operate several cable systems on the same grid- yet Cox and other systems don't have to share. To me this is nothing but a rip-off of taxpayer money. This is not a public utility- this is a private business (oh the communications division has gone public on the NYSE-big deal!) that uses public infrastructure and is PROTECTED FROM COMPETITION! If the PUCO wants cable systems to be treated and governed like utilities then they need to do their job or get out! Regulating cable systems won't work because they are businesses competing in what should (be an open market. Cox thinks they can buy an infrastructure (like an abandoned, incomplete fibre-optic network for pennies on the dollar) constructed on or under public lands and operate it like a privately-owned business with little regulation. Who do they think they are- SDG&E? rc
