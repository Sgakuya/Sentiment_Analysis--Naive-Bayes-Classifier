Tamara Braun wasn't meant for the role of Carly to begin with... one of the worst recasts of all time. She has no range, I feel no depth coming from Tamara as she portrays Carly's plight at being a Mobsters Wife, or as a Mother who fears for her children, she plays Carly more as a baby-sitter than parent. If Tamara was able to veer away from the dark side of Port Charles, and play Carly as she did in early in 2002 as a single Mother trying to make a life for herself then maybe I'd be willing to give her another chance. Tamara doesn't give Carly any versatility, you always know what to expect and that's just plain boring to watch.
