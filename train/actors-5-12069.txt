 Smedley , this wouldn't be Novos would it? I like Winona. I think she's pretty, sexy, intelligent, weird, mystical, aunry, rye, and full of spitfire. I love active qualities in a woman like that. I like her voice and her narrative demeanor, it is the genteel volume and hiss-like back undertone that brings your attention toward her. She can send cold ice along your spine, or a warm tongue at the base of your ear...always teasing and choosing to deliver only if you qualify. She is an independant stance for women as a whole and I think that her variety in roles is the mark of a true professional actress. I'd like to see her in more Mid-eval era movies where she can portray a witch seducing a man into infidelity and madness, much like her role in Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible.' Women in life are like that. They will use deceit and sensuality to get their way, and Winona knows how to lift this part of herself out and throw it into her characters. She will cast a charm spell on you, and she will laugh when she has taken your heart. I like her name too, Wi no na. It's befitting her cute rarity and sexy femininity.
