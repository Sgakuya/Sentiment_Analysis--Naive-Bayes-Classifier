I DON'T WANNA ACT OBSESSED WITH NICK, BUT I THINK HE IS THE BEST POWER FORWARD I HAVE EVER SEEN PLAY. I NEVER WAS INTO COLLEGE BASKETBALL UNTIL I FIRST WATCHED HIM AS A SOPHOMORE. AT FIRST HE WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT AS SOON AS BECAME A JUNIOR AND SENIOR HE WAS IN THE SPOT LIGHT ALONG WITH KIRK AND GOODEN. THEY HAD THEIR BAD DAYS, BUT ALL AROUND THEY ARE THE BEST. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A TEAM PLAY SO GREAT TOGETHER, LIKE THE LA LAKERS. NICK DESERVES ALL THE ACHEIVEMENTS HE HAS RECEIVED, AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT THE END FOR NICK COLLISON. I KNOW HE'LL MAKE IT TO THE NBA AND HE'LL DO WELL. NOT ONLY IS HE THE BEST AT SHOOTING UP CLOSE, BUT HE'S GREAT AT DEFENSE AND BLOCKING SHOTS FROM THE OTHER TEAMS, AND GREAT WITH ASSISTS. I'VE MET HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. HE IS A BIG INSPIRATION IN MY LIFE AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM ON THE BIG SCREEN AGAIN, I LOVE YOU NICK . . .
