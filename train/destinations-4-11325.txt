It's a little cool and mysterious and trashy all in the same breathe. If you're visiting from California and you have to cross Tahoe in the winter....do yourself a favor and take the northern route, 80E. It's still tricky because the elevation goes over 6000 ft so you can prepare for some sliding around into snow banks, especially if you are driving a Mitsubishi Lancer. But if you take the southern route, rt 50...be prepared for snow chains, bloody hands, and 10 hours in traffic, and one heck of a wild ride...is all I have to say. Once you cross into northern Nevada the mountains make for a pretty spectacular sight. Reno itself is a bit of a timewarp in the same sense as AC although you're in a very different part of the country and you can feel it. I referred to the clientel as characters which they were in the truest form. Well anyway it does it's job as a gambling city with a bit of an entertainment factor. You'll want to go to Vegas for the true gambling, shows, and nightlife experience. Don't make a special trip out of Reno but if you're in the area, drop by and check out a different sort of atmosphere.
