I don't particularly believe that he is either overrated or underrated. I believe he is a good actor and people know it. I can say that I do not find him the least bit handsome but he is intriguing. Although his role in Traffic didn't seem too memorable (I remember Don Cheadle much more in this film), it does show that he can be a bit verstile. I even watched Excess Baggage just to see him and disappointed...in him not the movie. I also enjoyed his small role in Snatch. I believe the problem I have with him is that his looks can't really get him into too many varying roles. No matter what, he always seems to look like an drug addict or drunk. But I will forever say that The Usual Suspects was his movie and I loved him in it.
