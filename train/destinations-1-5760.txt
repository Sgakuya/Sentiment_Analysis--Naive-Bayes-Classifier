Naples is nice- and St. Augustine is very old and charming. South Beach and its art Deco buildings are wonderful. The west coast is less crowded and has many nice beaches. Ft. Lauderdale is now a popular destination area to live and visit with its beaches and many amentities. But thats the best- the bad is nearly everywhere- most of the state is flat, hot and humid and in many areas crime ridden. Also the education system is way below average. With global warming heating things up in the future, the state will be subjected to flooding and potentially devastating sea rise. Also it seems very likely there will be an increase in the number of intense storms and hurricanes. Enjoy the nice beaches, palms and sunshine while it lasts- otherwise relocate at your own risk.....quite frankly,how anyone can rate this hot and humid,cockroach and alliagor infested state above is 2 is beyond me.Jeb Bush is a stooge - who has no more brains then his brother. Poor schools, and higher costs then many believe. Again beware- as I alluded to earlier- climate change is escalating fast- which will have dire consequences for the 'Sunshine state'. UPDATE- I am glad texana understands the empirical evidence about climate change- not only in Florida- but every state.
