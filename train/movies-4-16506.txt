This isn't a movie to be watched lightly. Cowritten by teenager Nikki Reed, this was based largely on her own life and many other young girls' lives out there. Every parent should watch this film and receive its wake up call. I've seen many of the horrible things portrayed in the film firsthand and was impressed by how controversial subjects were handled. The heart in Thirteen cannot be missed- it shows in the blatant honesty and lack of sugarcoating. Evan Rachel Wood was utterly fantastic in how she captured the spirit of this girl completely. Holly Hunter was terrific as the sweet but rather helpless mother. This film is a perfect means of how to open a door of communication. A disturbing but fantastically honest film.
