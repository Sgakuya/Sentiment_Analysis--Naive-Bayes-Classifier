I am amazed at the number of mean spirited and hate-filled remarks from those who claim to beintellectuals with a broad-minded tolerance mindset. A broad-minded and tolerant individual is too smart to show his or her butt on a forum like this by placing an entire area into the ignorant box. Instead of poking fun at a Christian convservative and labeling them as uneducated bible thumpers a person of this intellect will accept the Christian conversative's right to be different as well as he does his liberal minded friends and those who do not embrace Christianity. An intelligent person also has the broad minded vision to understand that Tennessee is much more than an Elvis Shrine and Country Music haven because they have done their homework and know that Nashville's music scene encompasses a much broader base than country music; furthermore, that Tennessee is home to one of the most formidable nuclear plants in the world...and folks, jobs like this aren't for the ignorant and uneducated, and that the mountains of East Tennessee are some of the most beautiful in the nation. Tennessee has alot of transplants, many of whom are from the North East. And while I'm too smart to jump on the I hate them damn Yankees bandwagon, I think Tennessee must have more going on than good beer and moon pies, othewrwise why the attraction? Tennessee's a great state: diverse,much to do, friendly people who look beyond the label on your purse, and for the most part-a safe place to live. Grow up. Sticking your nose up and labeling a state solely on some statistic board you've read speaks volumes for your own ignorance.
