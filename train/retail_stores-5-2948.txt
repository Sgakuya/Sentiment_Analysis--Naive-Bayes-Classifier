I have many pieces from Kay's (my wedding band - it's actually an anniversary band because I didn't want an engagement ring, diamond necklaces, silver braclets and earrings). I have had no problem with any items or sales associates (S. Attleboro, MA). They have resized my wedding band several times (during my pregnancies and after) and they have even done work on pieces I have purchased from different locations. I have always been happy with their service. I think it's important for people to know that depending on the store they go to, the work they are having done may not be done at the store. I know that sometimes work is contracted out by area jewelers.
