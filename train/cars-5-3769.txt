The reason I can say it is great is because I have one, a 1993 Red OT(open top). My husband and I do use it for everyday use. It has a great stereo, air conditioning(new 2000 unit), the only bad thing is the gas mileage which is actually better than a 2000 Ford Excursion so we shouldn't complain. Yes it is a symbol that you can have whatever it is that you want if you want it bad enough. Our Hummer did not cost the $107,000 that a new 2000 does but ours does not have the extras. Yes it can climb a mountain, go through water, snow, hail and everything else without a scratch. Why do we have it, because we can. Plus my husband likes the attention it gets him from the ladies : )
