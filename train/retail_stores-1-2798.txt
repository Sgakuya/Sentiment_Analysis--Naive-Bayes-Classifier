Bought my fiancee his wedding band at Fre Meyer Jewelers on 10/17/04. Had it resized. When I went to pick it up. The band actually look warped. I requested that they redo the ring. When I went to pick it up the second time. It was no longer the same ring style. They actually took off the satin finish off the band and tried to pass it off as the original ring. I requested that they replace the ring. Went back today 11/29/04 (Wedding is on 12/5/04. No ring yet. I requested a refund and it took me two hours just to convince their corporate office to give me my money back. I couldn't believe the service that I received after paying cash for a 1ctw wedding band!
