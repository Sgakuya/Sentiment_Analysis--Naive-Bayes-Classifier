I recently ditched my 98 Neon for a 2001 Alero and let me tell you I couldn't be happier. I test drove the car for 15 minutes and I refused to get back in my Neon to go home. I felt like I cheated myself out of 4 1/2 years when I broke down and bought the Dodge after being a firm GM buyer. I bought the Alero with a little over 25,000 miles on it and I've put on almost 1,000 miles already because I can't keep myself from taking rides in it. I love the way it handles and how comfortable the ride is. And as for miles per gallon, I've hit 29 mph on the highway. Too bad Olds is no longer making cars because it's safe to say, if they were, I'd definitely by another Alero after this one.
