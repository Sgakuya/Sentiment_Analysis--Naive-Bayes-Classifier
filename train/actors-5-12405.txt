Angela Bassett is one of the best actresses of our time. Notice I did not say African American actress of our time- she is one of the best out of all the black, blue, white, red and green actresses. She is very careful about choosing her roles, and she always delivers. She really deserved the Oscar for her portrayal of Tina Turner in the drama, What's Love Got To Do With It . She perfectly brought Tina Turner to life on screen. Great performances in How Stella Got Her Grove Back , The Rosa Parks Story and Jacksons: An American Dream . She seems to have a nack for playing real-life characters. She belongs so much higher up on this list- I can't believe that LISA KUDROW is rated above this talented actress.
