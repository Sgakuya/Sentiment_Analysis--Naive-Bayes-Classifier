I think Njal23 comments below hits the bull on the ass with a shovel. I was disappointed because I was DYING to see this movie and waited almost a month to get the DVD from Blockbuster. At first, I was laughing -- not belly laughs -- but amusing. But then the gross and vile little puppets and their antics grow thin in a hurry. The movie was just not any funnier than an average South Park episode -- and it's stretched to 98 minutes. I did get a laugh every time one of the liberal Hollywood traitors suffered a violent and humiliating demise, and the song, Montage, played during the montage was cute. I would have given it a 3 if it was by a couple of unknown hacks; but I expected better from Parker and Stone.
