I really hope Tijuana has changed since I was there - it needed to. Granted, it was a short trip and it was several years ago, but it still conjures up thoughts of bad smells, filth (including human feces on the sidewalk) and a trip back to a time I could never be nostalgic about. The people were nice enough - though not really what I would call friendly. But, they were mostly vendors and shopkeepers interested in relieving us of a few dollars so I'm sure that wasn't a very good cross-section of the population. This is the only part of Mexico I have ever visited and, considering its location and basic touristy purpose; I wouldn't really want to judge the entire country by this one short trip. Still, I do not long to return any time soon.
