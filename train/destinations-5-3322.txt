I am from New Orleans and I must add that there is alot of crime, but for a reason. People don't walk around with guns in there hand a shoot people for the fun of it. The major problem with this city is DRUGS! Drugs has been the cause of nearly all of the deaths. Though it's true that bullets has no name, you shouldn't be anywhere where drugs are being sold and smuggled and you should be OK! I am a african- american female and I have been through all of the worst housing developements and here I am today. It's not too often you hear white man shot to death leaving jazzercise class. Most likely you're going to hear black male shot to death in the courtyard of the Magnolia Housing developement or police wounded in The St. Bernard housing developement. I say that to say this, if you don't deal with drugs are interferre with drug dealers , what a wonderful life you'll live in New Orleans!
