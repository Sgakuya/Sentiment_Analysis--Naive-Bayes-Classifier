This is an excellent book. Andersen offers a non-partisaned view of the life and times of the 42nd President of the United States and the first lady as well. The reason why I emphasize non-partisaned is because Clinton is the type of figure that either inspires absolute adoration or dislike; there is no in between. Andersen records Clinton's life as history, it is not a policy analysis book. It reads very much like a paperback novel sometimes. Believe me, it gets interesting sometimes!! It starts out with a recording of the individual childhoods of both Bill and Hillary. They really are opposites of each other; Bill was more outgoing and Hillary was more quiet and studious. When they both met in the 1970's tbeir individual histories combine to form the history of their marriage. Despite what most people say about their marriage; I do think that both Bill and Hillary need each other. Now the question of whether their marriage is one of convience is a whole other matter...but then again, is it really our business how they conduct their private lives? Bill and Hillary basically got married because Hillary had faith that Bill would be president someday. She moved to Arkansas just to mold Bill into presidential timber. At the White House, whether in the shadows or not, Hillary was Bill's number one adviser on various issues. This book was very interesting because it really shows what makes both Bill and Hillary tick. This would make excellent reading for a psychology class.
