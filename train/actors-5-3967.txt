he is so handsome and really really good... He has this really heart warming voice,this charming smile and those eyes.. it's really killing me! And when i see his pictures,it's like he's staring at me.. and his eyes ar eally like sparkling diamonds. I first saw him in Quiz Show.. Charles Van Doren... Then in The English Patient, he was really fantastic there. Then The End of the Affair. I really really got jealous of Julianne Moore cos ralph touched her like she was her real lover and kissed her passionately! That movie really made me jealous! I watched Schindler's list and he was handsome there but my gosh his weight! It's okay! He's the best! not really.. but for me he is!
