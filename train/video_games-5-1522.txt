Until RE4 appears, this is still one of the most stunning looking games to be released on the Gamecube to date, along with it's prequel Resident Evil 0. Sure it's a remake but when the graphical overhaul is such a big leap from the original, it's hard not to feel as if you are playing an entirely new game. Character's and monsters look and act more life-like than before and there are moments that will genuinely have you on the edge of your seat. Some people find the controls some getting used to but if you've played any of the previous RE games, you'll know what to expect. However if this is your first time, you'll need about half an hour before it all starts to feel intuitive, after which you won't look back, or rather you might, over your shoulder that is. Best played with the lights off. It's creepy, atmospheric and beautiful all at the same time.
