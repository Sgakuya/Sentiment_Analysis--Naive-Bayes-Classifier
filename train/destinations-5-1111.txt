I went to Italy for the first time a couple of weeks ago (in early October), and I had a fantastic time. I visited Venice, Florence, and Rome over 10 days, which was just the right length of time. The summer crowds were gone, and the weather was excellent. I was absolutely blown away by the artwork and sense of history everywhere I went. It was overwhelming! The food and wine were wonderful, just as you'd expect, and the shopping was great. Highlights of the trip included wandering the streets of Venice, climbing the stairs to the top of the Duomo in Florence, and seeing the Roman Forum. Having lunch in the dining car on the train rides from Venice to Florence and Florence to Rome was a lot of fun, too. I hope to return to Italy several times to check out the rest of the country. There's so much to see!
