Their is no one person who can guard him. He will get his shot off with even 4 players on him. Something Kobe and McGrady cant do. He is able to take it to the basket and score with five players around him and go to the free throw line if the ref calls the foul. Trust me Kobe and Mcgrady wont be able to do. Shaq should be shootig free throws everytime the Lakers are on offense. He being fouled on every play before the ball goes into him and when hes shooting. Everytime they foul him it should be a flagrent 2. You can compare players around the league like MJ,Kobe, McGrady, AI, Vince, Webber, KG, Jermaine Oneal, Tim Duncan. But no one can be compare to Shaq not even the great centers who have played. This is history you are watching, the opposite team knows the game plan. That it is going into Shaq and you now it and you can send your whole team. But he will still score and get fouled. Why is he so UNDER RATED. He should be MVP every year. Or at least name him WORLD MVP.
