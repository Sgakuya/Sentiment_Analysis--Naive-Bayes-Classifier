I'm embarrassed that I gave Adams a pretty low mark before reading Ellis's book, Founding Brothers. My earlier comment was right about the Sedition Act being a huge failing on Adams' part, but now that I've done more reading about Adams, I'm struck by how prescient he was on so many topics. His foil Jefferson was naive on several subjects (e.g., the promise of the French revolutionaries) where Adams obviously was doing more clear-headed thinking. I'm looking forward to reading the new biography by David McCulloch, and it sounds like there may be a new national monument for Adams and his incredible wife Abigail (and perhaps for his son JQ and his cousin Sam). What a family! One more thing, I heard a speech not long ago about how Adams basically handed Jefferson what would become his ticket to immortality, the assignment of writing the Declaration of Independence. In fact, it was Adams who had been the prime mover in getting the various colonies' representatives to come around to the idea of independence -- and his (unprepared) remarks that led to a decision in favor of drafting the declaration were described by witnesses as incredibly eloquent and persuasive. But Adams had that extra bit of wisdom and humility that led him to give deference when it came to drafting the document; he thought Jefferson was a better writer, and he thought it was important that it be seen as coming from a Virginian (since Boston folk like himself were -- rightly -- seen as hot-headed). Pretty cool that he took one for the team like that... strange that Jefferson would become his biggest political rival two decades later.
