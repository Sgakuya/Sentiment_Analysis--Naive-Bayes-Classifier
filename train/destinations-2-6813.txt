Just one of the ugliest states in the country. Run down houses, potholes, no landscaping, trash on the streets.....Frankly just plain old ugly place. The natural lands out in the country are still pretty, wherever people haven't really touched it, but basically their seems to be a huge lack of civic pride. Otherwise there's no way they'd allow some of those multiple eyesores of buildings to remain. And they're just WAY tooo much into college football here---but frankly that's because there's nothing else to do. What place doesn't have a mall? That's no culture. Anyway, Tulsa's the best city of the lot, but other than that I'd keep driving through. Also, it is true that there are some incredibly mean spirited blatantly racist people here. I've never met more mean people before in my life. However I have met some incredibly wonderful people here also. I personally believe that the people with positive stuff to say must be from here so they're accustomed to all the things that turn most of the visitors off.
