I lived in Atlanta for about five years, so I spent a lot of time in Georgia and have almost nothing but good things to say about the state. Sure there are rednecks, and the level of cultural sophistication may not be the highest, but other things make up for it. Atlanta is the most diverse and interesting city in the southeast. The north Georgia mountains have some great hiking and camping. And Savannah is a unique, beautiful little city. In addition, it was easy to take great weekend trips from Atlanta to places like Destin (a nice beach on the Florida panhandle), Hilton Head, and Charleston. Would I want to spend the rest of my life in Georgia? No way. But it really is a great place to spend some time.
