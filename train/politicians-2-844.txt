I am going to give Chretien a 2. He used to be a 4 when he had courage and idealism, and even when he stood up to the Bloc Quebecois and helped to keep the country together. Since then he has become far too comfortable in his office. His level of smugness is nauseating, like when he makes jokes about pepper-spraying protesters, or snubs Bush. Everyone in Canada hates George Bush, but the Prime Minister cannot afford to let his emotions get in the way of diplomacy. I'm not saying he should have supported America's stupid war, but he could have done more to keep the diplomacy alive between our countries. Yes, Bush is a little child waving his daddy's shotgun, but a good politician will find ways of working with that. He didn't accept the resignation of the cabinet minister who publically called Bush a moron, which was a mistake. I mean, Bush IS a moron, and that's being very generous, but a civil servant has the duty to keep such childish namecalling out of the picture. I am not ashamed that he has defied the Bush administration, but I am ashamed of the way he did it. Canada deserves better, because it IS better than he is.
