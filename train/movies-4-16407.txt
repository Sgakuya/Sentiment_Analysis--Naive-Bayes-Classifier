At first, I thought there was no way I would watch a movie called House of Sand and Fog (TOO INDIE AND ARTSY-FARTSY FOR ME). But Wifey comes back from Blockbuster with...you guessed it. I had all intentions of falling asleep early on; but surprisingly, the movie is quite good. Ben Kingsley is such a great actor. His portrayal of a former Iranian Army Colonel (in the Shah's regime), is a compelling portrait of a man whose immense pride and stubborness result in a not-so-feel-good ending. Jennifer Connelly, is sensational playing a dumb white trash chick whose apathy and wickedness propels a chain of tragic, events. Though I didn't like the character she played, Connelly is talented and beautiful. I give it a definite GO RENT IT Decision.
