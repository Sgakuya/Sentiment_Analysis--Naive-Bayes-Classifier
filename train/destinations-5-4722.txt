I am a fellow detroiter and I love my beautiful city. With its great attractions such as ballparks, museums, parks and so much more. It make our city a great place to live and visit. I know that there are bad areas of the city, but hell, there are bad areas of all our nation's large urban cities. I'm sick and tired of people only judging Detroit as a high crime area as if their cities dont have a police force. Which shows that there is crime. I know for a fact that there are nice areas of the city. I live in one, and plan to raise my family in one. Not to mention all the new commerical and residentual development that has come or has been planned to come to the city. In conclusion, I love my city and wish others would open their eyes and see too.
