The world has been waiting long enough for an actor with such talent as Edward Norton.One of the most admired and sought after individuals of our time,the words Intelligent , Talented ,and Sexy will seem to permanently brand this young actor.Most actors of his generation can not seem to hold a candle,or live up to the strict expectations that an audience would demand.For someone to take the role of a character and completly immerse himself into that particular state of mind,is as astounding as it is mystifying.I have never been disappointed by his roles on screen.In my opinion,Edward Norton stimulates the mind and speeks out with every character he portrays,and I am only compelled to witness such acting genius.Edward Norton will continue to amaze and capture the heart and imagination.
