i have been chewing for 2 years now, and its the greatest evr, love the satisfying habbit, of jamming the biggest dip i can get in my lip. i live in canada, and no where close to the border, anyways, i had a buddy pick me up a tin of peach, PISSED its not here yet, PEACH IS AMAZING, it took about a year for apple to make its appearence on the shelves in canada, and thats not fair, BS, i wanna see peach soon. especially when there is a factory in quebec, ALSO, the pric is outrageous, we pay the cheapest i have seen it is 5.80,and rairly 4 dollars on the military bases. ALSO, we don't get double stack like US, we only get 15 gram tins, that aren't even tin, i was reading an article, and they complain that canada doesn't chew as much, and we need more, drop the prices, give us the flavors, give is the big tins, and give us all the brands, LIKE KODIAK
