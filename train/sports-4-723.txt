I'd give him a 3.5, but since they don't give half stars, I'll round it up to four. In his prime, in Seattle, he was by far the best player in baseball. He could do it all - hit for power, average, run, and play excellent D. No other player in baseball and few in all sports could match his overall talent and charisma. Sadly, that ship has sailed. He had one solid season in Cincy - his first. And that was far below the numbers he was capable of putting up in Seattle. Hall of Famer? Yes. Five hundred home runs, several MVP-type seasons and simply the most dominating player in the 90s. He's certainly not getting any younger and I think he's kidding himself when he wants to play. He's 34, still capable of playing a few more years. In all honesty, he should rest on his laurels and hang it up. There's little more he can do - he already has his Hall of Fame ticket waiting.
