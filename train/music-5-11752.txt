well...being from the east bay area and all I am suppose to be aware of what real punk is. The truth of the matter is that punk can be classified in many different ways. K, I'll admit GC isn't true punk, but they speak from the heart and aren't afraid to let their emotions show which impresses me a lot. Their music is not only for 12 years, but for any age really. I'm 20, and I have to say that their music as therapeutic as well as entertaining to me. Plus, if you've ever had the chance to meet them you'd see how sweet and down to earth they really are. Regardless of anyone's opinion, this band is absolutely wonderful! They're doing their thing and I love it! :D -Crystal, eastbay area cali
