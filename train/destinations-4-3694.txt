Upside: Denver is a very livable city if you have a decent job. It is green and pretty clean with lots of parks, trails, and friendly neighborhood pubs Lodo and downtown are vibrant and equl to Minneapolis in things to do. The transit system is one of the best in the US, and urban planners are creating "new towns" near the light rail stations. It takes about 45 minutes to get to the real prize- the Rocky Mountains, and a dozen ski areas including Vail are within a 2-3 hour drive. With about 25 historic neighborhoods, you can have that old city feel in the "New West". It is up and coming as a quality place to do international business. Downside: It is not as liberal and progressive as most residents would have you believe, although it is very gay friendly and Democratic. It will cost you big city prices for some very average and often bland and overpriced food. Stick to Buffalo burgers (grown in Colorado) and you won't feel ripped off. The burbs could be in Ohio, but for the amazing Rocky Mountain backdrop. The worst thing is that Denver is becoming a very large and dangerous organized drug trafficking center, and the Denver cops are totally worthless (or else involved with the drug gangs). If you DO NOT hang out on Federal Blvd. or Downtown Aurora you will only see the gangsters driving by about every half hour tinted windows and no license plates). You could be killed if you are in the wrong spot on Federal Avenue or in Aurora, and all you will see are gangsters, although the Asia Town district on Federal and Alameda has some good food. Crime went up 20% since 2000, they need a cop transfusion!
