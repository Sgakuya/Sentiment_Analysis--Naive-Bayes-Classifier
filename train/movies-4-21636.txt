Since no adaptation of any book is ever as good as the book, and never quite meets with the vision of the author even when the screenplay is written by the author, I shall not be making comparisons between the book and the movie. I must say that I was quite pleased with the movie in general. The special effects were, in most cases, very good, and the visual effects to display the size differences between the hobbits and humans were superb. The costumes and makeup were extremely colorful and well created. However, I had a few problems with the movie. I found Frodo a bit too efeminate, and while he did not intend to be charged with his task, I found the movie's constant repeating of that fact through Frodo's actions and the words of the characters to be quite tedious. I found the battle scenes to be quite well coreographed, and I enjoyed the epic qualities of the movie, but because the movie is almost three hours long, not withstanding the fact that there were no long expanses of useless time wasted in the film , I found my self looking at my watch more than once. On a second viewing, I did not find myself doing this. I did not like the termination of the film because of its abrupt and incomplete finish, but I realize the need for continuation to the next movies. I believe that the breaks between the StarWars movies were better done. I eagerly await the next film.
