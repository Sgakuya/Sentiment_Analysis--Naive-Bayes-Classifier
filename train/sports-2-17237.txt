As a lifelong Cowboys fan, it is becoming increasingly difficult to cheer for this team. The reason is simple and can be summed in two words.....Jerry Jones. I know that Jerry is the owner and, as a result, can do whatever he wants. However, in the best interest of the team, I strongly feel that the time has passed for Jones to relinquish some control of this team. For example, it is time for Jones to hire a GM. During the past few years, there have been numerous qualified individuals who would have been excellent GMs. In my opinion, a respectable GM would assist greatly in managing this ship, which is beginning to look more and more like the Titanic with each passing season. Giving the Boys a 2 was a painful event for me. But, until Jones opens his eyes, this team is in serious trouble. Denial is not just a river a in Egypt.
