A man who comes under false pretenses.He claims to want to promote economic growth through US mexican trade, but he has no economic plan for his own people. A man who has serious economic problems at home but he has no economic policy or solution within the borders of Mexico. His only solution is to tell his countrymen and women to come to the US illegally. He encourages people to break the law. Everyone out there that thinks that illegals coming here illegally is no big deal better think again. The system is already overloaded financially from paying for healthcare for illegals.It cost California and Texas 150 million dollars a year just to care for injured and sick illegals. That is 150 million tax dollars that are lost to the citizens of those states. You better wake up people and face the fact that an open border is not a good thing.If you want to see what an open border will create you need look no farther than Tiajuana.
