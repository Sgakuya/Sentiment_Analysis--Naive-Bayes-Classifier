OK I am BIG BLUE to the CORE!!! I have to say Pitino is one of the top five coaches in NCAA basketball today. His falure at the Celtic was only a result of his players money going to their head. Pitino knows how to motivate his players, play tenacious D, use the 3 to open up the inside, and also how to get his team to join in on his game plan for the season. I only hope that he does not rest on his past performance as Crum did in the 90's and that Pitino will always recruit, practice, and coach as he did at UK! THE CAT's will always be the team everyone wants to play, beat, and BE. If UL will come to our level year after year this area will be the NCAA basketball center instead of Durham NC.
