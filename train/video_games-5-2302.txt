This game is pure genious. I could sit and play it for hours just because of the simple fact that you can keep making up new trick cominations. I am a skater myself, and I think that this game mirrors real life pretty well. The graphics are excellent, and the way the skaters move is almost life-like. The tricks look realistic enough, and the levels are awesome because they offer you a wide variety of places to skate.And I have never seen a game with a cooler soundtrack (it's all punk music made by real bands). Sometimes I like playing the game just to hear the music. Even kids who aren't skaters and don't know a lot about skating enjoy this game. It is easy to play after you get the hang of it and it teaches you a lot about pro skating. And you get a lot of different pro skaters to pick from (Bob Burnquist is my personal favorite). It's just a really all-around great game...my favorite game for any game consol.
