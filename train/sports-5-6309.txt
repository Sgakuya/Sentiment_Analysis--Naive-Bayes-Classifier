wow bluetarbaby, you are the reason duke fans can't stand carolina fans. you say the most ridiculous things. your comment that you do not even care if the tarheels have a season next year, because that title will keep you happy at least a year is pretty pathetic, to be a fan means you live and die with every game. or are you just a fair weather fan? anyways, we'll see how much you talk next year when we have two acc first team members returning, along with some freshman all americans and a few very experienced seniors, not to leave out demarcus nelson and david mcclure who have a lot of potential, especially in nelson's case. it's going to be an amazing year! duke fans: how many points do we think duke will beat carolina by at cameron? what about the dean dome? i'm going with 24 at cameron and 20 at the dean dome. *i also have to ask what makes one say that duke is racist. Let's take a look at the duke basketball starters, and then the carolina starters (from this year) and ask ourselves which team represented more than one race. oh yes. duke. that's right.
