I can't believe this state has gone backwards. I used to be a registered republican but if this is the shit that happens when a Republican President is in office then my republican days are over. Ohio isn't the only state that is dealing with this recently. Missouri is going through their own concealed weapon law right now. This isn't the freaking wild west. I didn't realize this state had enough yokels in Columbus to push this through but I should never be surprised anymore. Why didn't the people of the state get to vote on this? BOB TAFT IS THE BIGGEST ID*OT A STATE COULD HAVE AS A GOVERNOR! I thought Illinois' George Ryan is bad. Did you also see the news that Ohio just based Hawaii and California for thr #3 most taxed state in the country. Ohio taxes it's people more than CALIFORNIA? This jump was due to all of Taft's bull tax hikes last year. As a Cincinnatian I am embarrassed that he is from our part of the state!
