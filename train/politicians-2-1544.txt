Let's just get something straight. Do not confuse evil with stupidity. The man is far from stupid. If he was, he would be dead already...or at least out of power. He is not a stupid man. He is evil and has no conscience, I'll say that much. On the other hand, I don't believe he has chemical or biological weapons any more...and Bush and Blair and Howard will have a lot to account for if they have blown up yet another country but find nothing to justify it. And whoever has said it is up to America to save the day again...you're wrong. It is never up to America to save the day...America chooses to involve itself in other countries' business and try to dictate to countries the governments they must have. It is not up to America to place governments in countries in order to have more yes men around the globe. If Saddam had all of these weapons and was such a threat...don't you think he would have already done something in the past 12 years...or at least in the past year knowing that Bush was out to blow up his country? He would not have waited until now if he was such a threat.
