Though hot in the summer, it is a good city to see as the residential areas and some of its parks (including Old Sacramento) are beautiful. The place itself is quite convienient as now it can show you the way to many destinations (they have signs up) and their transit system is all right- light rail is the best for going around Sacramento. Not too high profile like the Bay Area, LA and San Diego, but if you tolerate the climate and see its diverse history in Spanish rule to the Gold Rush and up to today, this city on the way outskirts of the Bay Area and situated on the Sacramento and American Rivers is great to see. If you are a fan of NCAA Track and Field or women's rowing, you have plenty of chances to see the city- CSU-Sacramento will host both championships until 2008, or perhaps forever. This city along with partnership with the Bay Area deserves to host the 2016 Olympics- hope they do...
