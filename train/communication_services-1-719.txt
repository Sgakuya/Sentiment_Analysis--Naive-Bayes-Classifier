A very deceitful company. I've been with them for over 2 yrs. I've been overpaying for a silly 350 anytime minutes. I've been watching other phone carriers were offering 400 anytime at a less price when I called back in January to have them either give me the extra 50 min or I would be leaving them. they agreed and added 50 extra min. to my anytime minutes plan. I was still waiting for a good deal from another carrier. I finally decided to transfer my number to Cingular. and when my bill from Sprint came up, they were charging me $150 early termination fee. I called to dispute this charge and to my suprised they replied. I'm sorry sir, but a few months back you changed your plan, and that constituded another commitment plan. The fee still stands...WHAT!!!??? adding 50 min. changed my plan?. they don't even have any plan like that anyways (it's either 350 min. or 600 min.) I have explained that when I added those 50 min. the customer rep. did not inform me of a new contract, nor did I receive anything in the mail for specifying a new contract. Had I know back them it would've been a new contract, I would've told them to shove it up their asses...I kept trying to explain them that I have been deceived until they hung up on me...what kind of customer service is that???
