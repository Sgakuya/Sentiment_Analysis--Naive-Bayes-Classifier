Despite some enjoyable moments and Diane Keaton's performance, Something's Gotta Give is a sappy, annoyingly predictable movie. It's about a divorced older woman (Keaton) who has an affair with her daughter's former boyfriend (an old guy played by Jack Nicholson). Diane Keaton was great in her role, but Jack Nicholson was simply repulsive and extremely unappealing across the board, another reason the movie was hard to stomach. The old people jokes, especially the one about the reading glasses, wore thin early on, and they just kept repeating. The movie dragged on, too, for at least an extra 30 minutes. I'm wondering who's finding this movie so cute.
