Stupid rating (rantings) in this poll. First of all, that NCAA investigation was a joke. A local shoe store was to blame for giving discounts and credit to players. That pales in comparison to Michigan alums giving cash to players... or the free academic passes all the SEC schools give. Anthony Davis, OUR Anthony Davis (RB), had a 4.0 at WISCONSIN last year - any of you EVER had a 4.0? Anyway, back to Barry. He inherited a mess that destroyed all the great work done by the late Dave McClain. Ever hear of the VEER offense? Barry inherited VEER players recruited by a very poor coach, Don Morton (do you know how long it took to find that name on the Net?), trying to run a wishbone offense in the Big Ten. Within three years, I was sitting in Pasadena, watching us beat UCLA. Barry made Wisconsin the Big Ten team of the nineties with THREE ROSE BOWL WINS out of three Rose Bowl appearances!
