If i don't get out of this horrible place soon, i'm gonna lose it!!!!! I am a very politicaly, economicaly, and demographicaly aware 16 year old. I CAN'T STAND THIS PLACE!! I moved here when i was only 6, i was originally born in a REAL city! Rochester NY, where you could tell the city from the suburbs, and all of the houses don't look the same. and where there isnt a WAKE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. In which you can live in Raleigh and GO TO SCHOOL IN APEX!!!!!!!!! LIKE I DO!!! We get a tornado warning every damn day here in the summer, lol, they have tornado drills in the schools, which are INCREDIBLY OVERCROUDED AND UNDER FUNDED!!!!!!! Raleigh/Durham spends an average of $3,500 per student, while the national average is over 6k, and it is over 8k in Most of the Northeast, which is were so many stupid people leave and come to this hell hole from!!!! Trust me all of you people in your late 20's and early 30's that hear all of the BULLS**T about Raleigh being one of the best areas to raise a family. My family, and most of the rest of the family's that move here, become extint!!!! The divorce rate is one of the highest, AND EVERYONE IS ON SOME KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICATION!!!!! NO LIE!!!!!!!! HALF OF THE KIDS HAVE ADD, AND PROBABLY NEARLY ALL PARENTS ARE ON ANTI-DEPRESSANTS!!!!!!!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T COME HERE IF YOU ARE IN THE SEARCH FOR A PLACE TO RAISE A FAMILY!!!!! I really can't think of one good group of people that would like this place. It is mostly a place for techies with trophie wives and preppy, apathetic kids to come and live, get divorced, and bail thier kids out of jail!!!! EVERYONE READING THIS SAVE YOURSELF THE HEARTBREAK AND STAY AWAY!!!!! THOST DAMN MAGAZINES ARE WRONG, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE BEST AREAS TO LIVE, ITS PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST!!!!! But as most people reading this who live in raleigh know, it is all swept under the rug! I'll bet people in the rest of the country didn't here about the whole chapel hill/orange county school system predicament. If they did, chapel hill wouldnt be a fast growing town, with a now poor school system!!!!! it would be a depleating town with a poor county school system!
