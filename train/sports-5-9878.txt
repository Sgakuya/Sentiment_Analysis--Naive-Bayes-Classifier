I like the Wizards and I'm pulling for them, don't get me wrong. BUT, aside from the Carolina/Jordan curse on the Bulls (Duhon's turnover, Jay Williams injury, Deng's injury, etc), the Wizards won this series despite LARRY HUGHES! Sure, this guy gets his numbers, but he does the absolute dumbest, selfish things I have ever seen. I saw him take AT LEAST 10 bad shots tonight! He shoots like he is McGrady, Carter, Bryant or somebody. This guy will do a pick 'n roll, both defenders will follow him, and he'll throw up an 18 footer with 4 hands in his face. Again, I like the Wizards, and I sware on my life I don't say this because he went to Carolina, but Jamison should be the second option. We're talking about a guy who once got 102 points in 2 consecutive games. Plus, he's smarter, more clutch, more experienced, a natural scorer who rarely takes bad shots (I know they look ugly sometimes, but he hits them), and he is just flat-out better! Why is Hughes playing like this in a game 6!? It drives me crazy. He can't possibly be concerned with his stats in a crucial playoff game..................can he? Once again, I like the Wizards, and I like Hughes on defense, but get real......... .....he took one of the worst shots I have EVER seen in my life, with his team losing, late in the 4th quarter of a game 6!- and he does it ALL THE TIME - CONSTANTLY! BOO THIS GUY WIZARDS FANS, he deserves it! Maybe it will make him change his style - be good for him. )))) )))))))))Update, The Wizards are good - RATED THEM!
