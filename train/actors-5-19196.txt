He is a great actor, and although after he started Friends he has done only comedy movies (The Whole Nine Yards, Three to Tango, etc...) I'm more than sure that he is able to make dramatic roles too. He is very talented, even when he was younger his acting was good, and with the years it has become better and better. In his personal life he has gone through a lot of difficult times, and i hope he knows that all his fans are with him, all the way, supporting him! He seems liek the perfect guy, the guy that every woman would date, he is just perfect :) And even though i dont know him in person I can see that he is a great person, funny, cute... evrtyhing!
