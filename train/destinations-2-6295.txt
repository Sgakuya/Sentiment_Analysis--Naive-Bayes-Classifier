Not all it's cracked up to be. School systems are segregated and terribly inequal, although recent reforms in Raleigh have slowly started to improve. But change comes very slowly to a state such as NC (or any state for that matter). Like Georgia, too many Yankees have moved here and have transformed the state (Charlotte and Raleigh and the Chapel Hill area) into another New York or New Jersey. NCers are understandably resentful of this Yankee invasion and I don't blame them. Hot as hell in the summer, but very nice inland. Not a lot of religious diversity outside of Charlotte and Raleigh. Pamlico Sound and the coastal regions are prone to hurricanes. Too much underlying racial tension. Great basketball mecca. I wouldn't want to live here, but it's an OK state to visit.
