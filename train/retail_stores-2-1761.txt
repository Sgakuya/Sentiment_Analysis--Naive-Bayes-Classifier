Walmart is a great place to go to purchase consumable items such as toothpaste and deodorant. For example, the larger size Mennen Speed Stick is $2.90 - $3.20 at the local drug store or supermarket. At WalMart, it is only $1.99. However, their durable goods leave much to be desired. Most of it is Chinese-made garbage of abominable quality. My girlfriend and I went shopping for lawn chairs. The chairs at WalMart were of laughable quality. Thin metal tubing, (maybe 1/2 thick) was covered by sloppily molded woven vinyl straps. Any self-respecting retailer would be ashamed of placing this junk on their shelves. The chair started to bend when my petite 5' 1 girlfriend who weighs 107 lbs sat on it. My 200 lb heft would've flattened it. Tools? Clothes? Housewares? Forget it! They are maybe one or two notches above what could be found in the dollar store. The shopping experience isn't much better. The stores are rather sloppy and the whole environment itself seems rather dismal. The employees vary. Some are extremely friendly and helpful while others are downright hostile. Maybe I can't blame them. It's pretty hard to have a good demeanor when your wages won't ensure your survival. For the shopping experience, I prefer Target. True, the quality of the merchandise is often just as bad as WalMart's, but the stores are more brightly lit and cleaner.
