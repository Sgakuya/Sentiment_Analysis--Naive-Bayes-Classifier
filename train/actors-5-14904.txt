Shirley has got to be one of the best of all time. When you see a Shirley Temple movie you don't even think of the name you just call it a Shirley Temple movie because she was the movie. Most child actors today are surrounded by big name actors and they are not even a main draw to the movie. I mean seriously, who says I'm going to see a Haley Joel movie? Haley is a good actor but I saw sixth sense because of Bruce Willis. Her movies were popular then they are still popular now and they will be fifty years from now. Shirley had to actually act and perform. Today so much is done for the actors. Shirley stole the screen.
