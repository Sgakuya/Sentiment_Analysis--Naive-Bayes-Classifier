FDR was a good man and a good president. He was responsible for saving america from the great depression. WW2 didnt do anything about that because we werent in world war 2 when FDR became president and created jobs as well as social security, which is still helping people to this day. Nobody should blame him for what happened in the concentration camps because, Hitler was responsible for that and america didnt even enter the war until peal harber was attacked by the japanese. if it wasnt for him entering into the war, even more people could have been killed, and america would have been taken over by the nazis which is what they wanted. FDR was a very intelligent, and moral president.
