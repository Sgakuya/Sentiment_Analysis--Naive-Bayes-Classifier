Seems all angles are covered on this. I got to the point that I was sick of reading the comments. I do, however, wonder why some people post comments in the first place that state loser the record speaks for itself and horriable man. All this proves to me is that these people do not research what they are talking about. Beit you love or hate Clinton make a point if you are going to be negative. For that fact do it if you are going to be positive. I believe Clinton was a average man who did what the people wanted him to do. Isn't that whu we elect officials? The best comment I read talked about yes, Clinton lied, but no-one died while Bushy Jr.'s lie of WMD has caused the death of 700 so far.
