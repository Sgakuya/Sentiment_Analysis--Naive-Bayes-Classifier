Mattmcdowell, All those things you named off involve alcohol. Yeah, its nice to go to a bar every once in awhile, and a house party at a university can be fun too when you are young, but tell me some fun things in general I can do without carrying around a 40 all the time?? Also, mentioning Windsor and Sarnia is not Michigan, thats a whole different country this is supposed to be about rating Michigan. In the summer, you can go water-skiing or tubing, fishing, biking, and rollerblading for fun. But after the 4 months of decent weather, there is nothing to do here that doesnt involve getting drunk. Its true that people arent very social here but there isnt a lot of places to be social at. I suppose you can join a rec league if you like to play sports. In general, its a nice place to live about 4 months of the year and other than that, if you dont like to drink all the time, theres hardly anything to do here. Overall, it is a unique looking state with 4 climates for every calendar year. It is what you make of it, but dont get too attached on one thing (i.e. swimming), because the weather is always changing. There isnt much consistency here with weather and the people are edgy at best, but there are some you will find once in awhile that are warm-hearted. If you are into the winter sports, which I'm not, there's snowmobiling, skiing, and ice fishing. Theres nothing past a casino or mall for activities that don't involve freezing or drinking.
