The first and probably the finest examples of the current Media Presidents where the American electorate voted for the image not the policies or party of the candidate. A truly charismatic and gifted public speaker, an excellent leader, a very good administrator with the training and experience as an actor to command the media and hone his image to and remain popular. History will record Ronnie Reagan as one of the most overrated president of the 20th century, right up there with John Kennedy His administration is given credit for an economic upturn that should be credited to Paul Volker, appointed as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve by the Carter administration. Deregulation of a number of industries whose effects are just now being felt now that they have trickled down to the average American. The cold light of history will condemn Reagan for the Contras, his support of the murderous regimes of Chile, Nicaragua and Guatemala and for not controlling the CIA and their cocaine and drug trade with Panama and other Central American countries.
