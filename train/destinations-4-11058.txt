Six Flags America works for me because I live in Maryland and its the closest amusement park around. If I had to travel farther for it, I probably would choose to go to Kings Dominion instead. My negatives are similar to what other raters said. The 9 dollar parking is a little steep, and the food services inside are not that great. However the coasters are great. Many coaster options, and they are all fun. Aside from that, the water park is probably the only other redeemable part of the park. However the park has come a long way from Adventure World and Wild World. Six Flags has put a good deal of money into the coasters, and like Medusa said, there is a lot of capability for expansion and improvement.
