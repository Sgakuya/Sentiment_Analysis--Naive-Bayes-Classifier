What a major disappointment. I was told I would recieve local HD channels. This is not true without purchasing an additional dish to mount and on my home. The 625 reciever has a hum and high pitch, enough to disturb nightly sleep. First I was told I would recieve three months of free movie cahnnnels, then the installer told me I would have to call in to recieve those. when I called they said I should have had them from the start. The installation was very sloppy: the burial cable goes in and out of the ground between the dish and the house, the cable was not grounded, the cables go through the house gutters, there was plastic bags, parts and screws left either in my driveway or blowing through the neighborhood. When I called with my concerns the people I spoke with were impolite and not very helpful. I had it at this point and requested to have it removed. I was told there is no grace period and there would be a $140 cancellation fee. Neddles to say I am extremely unhappy.
