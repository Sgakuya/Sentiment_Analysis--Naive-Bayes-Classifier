I originally had low expectations for the Game Cube, because of its reputation for being for children only. I have to admit, though, I was wrong, and I'm glad. This system features pretty good graphics (depending on the game), compact EVERYTHING (from the console itself to the game discs to even the controllers that you can buy seperately), extensive accessories (attachable LCD screen, Game Boy advance compatability, etc.), 4 controller ports, very decent loading times, and a fair selection of games. Most games ARE geared for children under 13, but there are a few good games out there for older audiences (Phantasy Star Online is a fun game, amongst others). It's a good system especially for younger players, as it's still generally geared for them, but Nintendo seems to finally be getting to the older players (albeit a bit slowly). Definately worth considering if buying for children or if you've seen the games and liked what you saw.
