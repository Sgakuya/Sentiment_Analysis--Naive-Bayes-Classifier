People! Hating Blockbuster is not going to make your lives any less miserable! I wish people would realize that every is run by a different store manager and staff! Just because the staff at the Main St. store are less than stellar does not mean the staff at the 1ST St. store are worthless! Don't judge the company because of one bad experience. Also EVERY Blockbuster store is required to have poster on the price board with the store managers name and number as well as the district managers name and phone number. If you don't see and the staff won't give up the goods, call the store at 10am any Monday morning, I GUARANTEE the store manager will be there, and just like with any person, treat them how you would like to be treated!!!!! No manager at any business is going to go out of their way to help a person that is cussing and calling them and all their employees morons! I hope this helps at least one person open their eyes, and remember, that moron telling you that you have a fee might be a future customer at your job...how do you want them to remember you????
