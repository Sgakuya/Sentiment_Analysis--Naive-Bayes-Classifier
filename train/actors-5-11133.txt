Nicole Kidman is one of my favorite actresses, and she belongs so much higher on this list. She has so much talent- it is truly remarkable. Not to mention that she is extremely beautiful. As an actress, she has so much depth and range, and I love the fact that she can make her accent disappear when necessary. That must have taken a lot of lessons. In the interviews that I've seen and read, Nicole seems to be down to earth, not to mention incredibly modest. While most Hollywood actresses are getting $15,000,000 to $25,000,000 dollars in this day and age, Nicole Kidman, who has been a major player since the early 90's, only drew in a modest $7,000,000 for her last three films, which were all very successful ( The Hours , The Others and Moulin Rouge ). Her performance in The Hours was phenominal, and she most definately deserved the Oscar. I also enjoyed her performance in The Others - she was first class in that film. I was also impressed with her performance in To Die For . I think that Kidman was at her best when she starred in Malice as the maniplative wife of Bill Pullman who uses him to secure her own greedy desires. She also did remotely well in the action films, The Peacemaker and Batman Forever . In the final analysis, as modest and down to earth as she is, I hope that Nicole realizes just how talented that she really is- and incase you guys didn't notice- she is one of my favorite actors.
