Someone said there was no sense in Ben Affleck's character falling in love with Joey Lauren Adams' character in this movie. 1) She'd been with guys before she met him, as have many lesbians, so is it really such a stretch that she'd fall for him or think she had? 2) Who ever picks and chooses who to fall in love with? 3) There are still plenty of people who think that all women are bi, rather than just straight or gay, and they have to learn the lesson the hard way. 4) Ben Affleck's character was obviously not too swift if he thought a threesome would solve all their problems, so he wouldn't get right off that she wouldn't be interested in him.
