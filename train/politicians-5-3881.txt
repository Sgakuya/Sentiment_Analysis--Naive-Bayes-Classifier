George W. Bush may have come from money, but he is about as down to earth as you can get and you can get that way only by caring about people. I feel like I could invite him to dinner and talk to him about anything and he would listen. He admits his mistakes, he laughs at himself (and makes others laugh). He cares about his family and I belive he cares about me and my family. I read that when his sister, Robin died, he was only about 5 or 6 years old. His mother went through into a deep depression over the loss of her daughter. One day she overheard young George tell his friend that he could not play with him, he needed to play with his mom because she was so sad. Now, no one wants their mother to be sad - but even as a child, he wanted to do something . I could never vote for a man like Al Gore. Our country has been totally and globally humiliated by Clinton's actions and lies and yet Al Gore introduced him as The greatest American President Excuse me? If Al Gore thinks Clinton is a great president - what does he have in mind to top Clinton? How can you possibly expect truth from Al Gore as a president, when even the news media are questioning his lies DURING the campaign. It is time for a change. Also, I heard today that if NO changes are made the national deficit will be paid off by 2009. Gore's proposed plan is to pay it off by 2012. That is three years longer!!! Think about it - if that makes sense to you - then perhaps you should not be voting at all!
