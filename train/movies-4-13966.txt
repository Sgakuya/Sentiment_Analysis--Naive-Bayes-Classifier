 Taxi Driver must've been pretty shocking when it came out in 1976, and even today it's disturbing. Robert De Niro is terrific as a New York City taxi driver whose deep resentment of society's moral decay boils just below the surface. The rest of the cast (Cybill Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks) is first-rate, too. I really liked the way Martin Scorsese used intriguing camera angles to create tension and dramatic effect throughout the movie. Usually I'm annoyed and distracted by the use of such a technique, but it was very effective in Taxi Driver. The movie is very dark and depressing, with lots of violence, and it did drag in a few spots. It's worth seeing for the acting alone, but be prepared to feel pretty depressed afterwards.
