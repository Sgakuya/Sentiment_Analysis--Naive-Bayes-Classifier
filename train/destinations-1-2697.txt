As a New Yorker who lived in Chicago for 2 years, all I can say is I will never leave home again!. I spent my entire time in Chicago listening to other people make cracks about my accent - and they talk about New Yorkers being rude! It gets worse....pizza sucks, you can't drink the tap water and besides, who ever heard of a hot dog that has pickles and tomatoes on it anyway?....just get me something from Nathan's! If there is any plus side to living in Chicago, it might be that your fur coat, if you have one, will definitely get used at least 6 months out of the year! I WILL NEVER, EVER CROSS THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE!
