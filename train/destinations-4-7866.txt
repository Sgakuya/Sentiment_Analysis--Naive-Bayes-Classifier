Man I figured you can get up to the Sears Tower, look around, and get out in a half hour. What happens though is you wait in one line for a half hour to get through the metal detector. Then 45 minutes you are waiting in a line to get on the elevator. Then you are looking at another 45 minutes to wait to purchase your tickets. Then another 20 minutes waiting in line to watch a movie about the Sears Tower. Then another 20 minutes waiting in yet another line to get on the elevator to get up to the Sears Tower. Then you look around for a half hour and wait in line to get back down, then another line to get to the main floor where you must exit. Nonetheless, it's one of those things you have to do if you're there, and the view does look pretty good from the 106th floor.
