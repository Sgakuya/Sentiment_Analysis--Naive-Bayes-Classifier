The Patriots overall get a 4 star rating. I've always liked their players for years. Steve Grogan, Stanley Morgan, Raymond Claiborne and John Hannah were always top notch. But they were no better than the New York Jets until Bill Belichick and franchise savior Tom Brady came along. After that, forget about it. They learned how to win. Aside from Joe Montana, is there anyone more clutch than PK Adam Vinitieri? Players with more heart than Deion Branch, Tedi Bruschi and Ted Johnson? I love this team. Gotta love 'em. Go Patriots! That's all I've gotta say. And to you Cincinnati fans moaning and bitching about Corey Dillon getting a ring. If the Bungals had won a few games when he was there, his exodus might never have happened, so SHUTUP ALREADY!
