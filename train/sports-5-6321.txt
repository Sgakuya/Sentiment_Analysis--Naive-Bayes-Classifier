I don't know about some of these other teams rated higher but Im gunna have to start watching their games I guess.. Maybe the west coast has something for us back here in the east. Ya'll know Im a hometown NC girl though so, Im a big time duke fan. Not sure why people are so against the devils... Anyway..this year is looking good...an experienced starting lineup...but not a very deep bench.. but Melchioni,MCclure and Dockery are doing a good job of stepping up when they get time off the bench... The landlord is havin his way in the post and he's doing a great job of avoiding fouls which is important this season. Shav is playing good D but...shooting ability is suffering...Now that he's bacl from mono though Im seeing a spark in him which is promising. Ewing is a great senior leader but needs to be more vocal...and JJ Redick is coming on strong this year great ppg numbers and his stats are up all around.(My favorite player of the year by far) Im looking forward to this year...its not the best team as far as depth I have seen but they are very capable of winning the ACC they just need to keep up the discipline and work with the bench in case of foul trouble. Im never disappointed in a DUKE season!
