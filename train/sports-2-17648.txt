I'm not a Jets fan, but I bet I'll sound like one. I like the way the team played last year, I thought they got the better deal in the Moss-Coles trade, and they have just generally done pretty well. I don't think New England is going to do well this season because they lost some veteran leaders, so that makes the Jets the probable AFC East Division champ in my eyes. Update: Wow... This shows how much damage a few injuries can do to a team. Curtis Martin has missed quite a bit of this season, as has Chad Pennington and more importantly Center Kevin Mawae. Struggling through these key injuries has turned this genuine perennial playoff team into a trash heap.
