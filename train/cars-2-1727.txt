I have been around Olds. since I was born, and I am sorry to see them go. The Aurora may be a nice looking car, but mechanically it is a piece of crap, and that it bad coming from me considering I am a G.M. loyalist. When your warr. runs out and you are left to pay for the parts and labor you will be so sorry you bought this car. My dad has a collision/mechanical shop and I am there on Saturdays and I can honestly say that there are at least three to five that come in every Sat. and generally it is the same thing. The fuel rail and the battery are the most common, and generally the most expensive. Be aware that if you have one or are getting one that you need a special battery that only ACDELCO makes but they guys that don't sell ACDELCO batteries generally won't tell you that and you have the wrong battery that creates more problems. So if you can get one cheap it is probably b/c it needs a ton of work. My best advice is stay away, there are no good years, they all have the same problems.
