Great Business School. I'm starting there in September 2002 to do my full-time MBA. I went to open days at Cranfield, LBS and at Warwick. Cranfield left the best impression by far. In fact it was the only school I did end up applying to. Ratings-wise (FT etc) Cranfield may be behind the other two, but you have to look behind the ratings at the various criteria. Before the open days Warwick was my first choice, but after I got told (over and over) how great their various ratings were it became boring. Also their sample lecture was crazy and most of the staff I talked to were highly theoretical academic types. LBS is two-years and I could not justify taking this much out of my lif at the moment. Cranfield people seemed to have their feet firmly planted on the ground and had very strong links with the industry - which means a great choice of practical projects for the final term! They also do a lot of research and publish, but at least they don't use it as their main selling point. To me the main objective in a one-year MBA is to get a solid overview of the latest theory but I want to learn only theory that is immediatly relevant and practically applicable. I can get the latest in airy-fairy academic thinking by reading latest journals if I find the urge to do that. I think Cranfield have the best ballance and will give me exactly what I'm looking for!
