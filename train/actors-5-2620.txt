I respect him as one of the bast actors I have ever seen. He can just act anything and any art and for that I really respect him. I first saw him in Keeping The Faith, which wasn't exactly Oscar- worthy, but he stood out to me so I looked at his other work. I am now addicted to his movies, and sad as it sound, I watch FIght Club (bits of it) about once a week. He is more talented than I could have ever imagined. I have so ar seen about 6 of his movies and I am excited to be seeing Burn This in about a week ( I just got tickets). My goal would be to work with him at one time or another, as I act myself. This is someone I really believe is a gifted actor and he's great because he doesn't overexpose himself to the media, so when you do see him, it's that much more memorable. And of course, because this is sort of an inevitably reached topic I thik he's cute. The big blinky eyes as I call them, get me evey damn time : ) (SO EN if you read this you are extremely gifted and I respect you a GrEAT deal)
