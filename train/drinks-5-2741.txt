For those who think carrying a paper cup with a Starbucks logo stamped on it is status , you should really contemplate YOUR purpose. I'm so tired of hearing people whine about the price of this coffee and the perceived high-browedness of its drinkers. I've tried them all; it wasn't until I had my first cup of Starbucks in 1980-something that I really appreciated coffee for what it was. (OK. A little coffee shop I discovered in Berkeley in 1976 set the stage for my appreciation.) I don't drink coffee for caffeine or to keep me charged. I drink it because I enjoy the taste. Starbucks was the first coffee shop I discovered that attempted to educate its consumers about what they taste when they engage in a cup of coffee or espresso. I find Starbucks coffees to be a reasonably priced, consistent-quality indulgence. Although the decor of the environment is somewhat monotonous and commercial, the product is great. If you can't afford it, then go elsewhere. If you prefer Folgers, McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts or Sanka, then simply keep out. Starbucks, they hate you because you're beautiful and successful!
