I have been with severalof the largest cell phone service providers over the years. Not really happy with any of them. Not because of poor service, but because of poor signals where I live. All made promises none were able to produce. So I decided to try Alltel, despite all of the negative reports that I've read about them. I figured they can't be all that bad and remain in business. Initially, the phone I received from them had lousy reception, right in the middle of the city. So I called their tech support and was told I could go to any Alltel store and they would exchange it. What? I didn't have to go through all the pushups returning the one I received via the internet to get a new one? Wow! What a concept! So I took it to an Alltel store, told them my problem. They recommended a phone that would meet my needs, took the one I didn't like, I paid the difference in price and I was on my way. And the signal I get at my home is great!! Additionally, all of my questions and concerns were answered courteously and professionally by more than one of there customer service reps, who gave me their ID numbers/phone extensions in case I needed to call them back. Very good customer service in my opinion. After dealing with the other companies, Alltel is the most impressive!!
