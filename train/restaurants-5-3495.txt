This has got to be the best pizza place ever! New York-style pizza, stuffed crust pizza, and pan pizza are all great! The sauce is sweet, but not too sweet (like Papa John's); a good balance. The cheese is very fine tasting, and not artificial tasting, like Domino's or Papa John's. The crust is mostly wonderful. New York and stuffed crust are great and unique in their own way. The pan crust is the best crust in any pizza place. The thin crust like any other pizza place. The only crust that isn't quite as good as at another pizza place is the hand-tossed crust. Domino's has a better quality hand-tossed crust than Pizza Hut has--maybe that's why Pizza Hut waited 30 years before introducing the crust. The toppings are great, but somewhat hit-and-miss. Some days the toppings will be fresh and crisp, and other days somewhat old. Still, I'd reccomend this pizza place over any other! Find a good coupon and get some of this pizza!
