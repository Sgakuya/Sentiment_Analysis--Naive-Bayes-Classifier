If you have lived through his administration you'll know what he did for us. He put pride back into being American. Never again in my lifetime will any liberal shame us into believing this country is not one to be proud of no matter how hard they try or hope. If you have studied the three big presidential historian (usually liberal academia) reviews that are sanctions about every 5 years you will see Reagan near the top... close to Lincoln and well ahead of anyone in the past 50 years including Kennedy. As time progresses these people generally move up the ladder. For instance just recently have we learned more about Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs. An actual phone conversation between JFK and Bobby Kennedy was released where they privately talked about how JFK should handle the Bay of Pigs in response to the news media. Some things are not released until many years later that are classified and even some items simply not found. For those that thought Nixon's foreign accomplishments and the ending of Vietnam would eventually catch up and boost him ahead of his position with these historian's reviews, it hasn't happened and possibly never will. Watergate was just too much.
