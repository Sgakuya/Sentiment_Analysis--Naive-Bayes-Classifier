Tim Horton was a star hockey defenceman for the Leafs and Sabres before tragically dying in a car crash many years ago ... in the '70s I believe. Owned now by Wendy's, they are thinking of separating it into its own division as it's a more attractive stock alone than grouped with Wendy's. Great taste and prices for cakes, Naniamo bars, butter tarts, croissants, mini pies and their coffee is really nice ... "make mine a double double". And Tim Horton drive throughs have a nice tradition where people will pay for the coffee of the person behind them as a gesture to "have a nice day". I live about 5 minutes from Timmy's and they are open 24 hours, so if I need a sugar fix, they are there for me. A Great Canadian pop culture icon.
