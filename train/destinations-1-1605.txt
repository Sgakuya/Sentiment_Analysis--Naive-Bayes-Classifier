The Jews claim that Israel (with the new expanded boundaries) was deeded to them in perpetuity by their god - and the rest of the world, especially America, is expected to accept that claim at face value and behave accordingly. North American natives ( American indians ) made a similar claim - that their land was given to them by the Great Spirit for their use. However, all dieties aren't equal in the eyes of Washington, and the native Americans got screwed out of their lands by American forces while the Jewish claim to divine-right occupancy is back up by American military support. Is it any wonder a million Muslims (and a few hundred thousand native-Americans) hate us with such an abiding passion?
