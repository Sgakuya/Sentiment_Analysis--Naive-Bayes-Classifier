Totally unconvincing in every role I've seen him in, especially in The Getaway. Looks like he constantly needs a shave and to wash his hair. If you're focusing in on his politics, save yourself time and energy: he's no more a political idiot than rightwingers like A. Schwarzenegger or C. Heston, and he deserves the right, like any other American, to put his ignorance on public display. I just wonder why righties are so threatened by those reviled Hollywood Liberals: is it that in their heart of hearts the righties realize the conservative ethos is false and ridiculous, yet they're not big enough people to admit it? Or is it they're so typically reductive and simplistic that they have no choice but to overreact, which is the hallmark of the reductive and simplistic mind? Or is it that they're envious because the Hollywood righties aren't as popular, sexy, talented, etc., as the Hollywood lefties? Personally, I think it's much ado about nothing, because both liberal and conservative points of view are illogical, out-of-touch and self-serving: it should very difficult for anyone with half a brain in their head to take either side seriously. So, one has to infer that those who do take either side seriously have less than half a brain. You do the math!!!
