Let's dispel with this notion right now. Charles Woodson didn't win the Heisman Trophy because of his defensive abilities. He should have, but he didn't. Woodson won the 1997 Heisman because of his highlight kick returns and receptions to go along with his breathtaking interceptions. Had he stayed on the defensive side full-time, there would've been no way he would've won the award as the voters just aren't that progressive. However, as just a defensive player, he was the best college football player in 1997 and one of the greatest defensive backs to ever play the game with a peerless combination of quickness, tackling ability and athleticism. Ok this part is for the guy a couple spots below me who wrote about 3 pages on why woodson sucks...All he is basing his knowledge on is stats...Maybe stats don't tell the whole story genius..YOU WANNA KNOW WHY HIS STATS WERE LOWER THEN SOME OTHERS..because since he was a freshman he was the most feared DB on the field..no one would throw to the reciever he was covering..still he had 8 Interceptions that year..he only caught a few passes because when he went onto the field the other team would double cover him because he was so dangerous and still he would make plays...Sometimes it's not all about stats PBeavr..I watched Payton Manning play 2 of the games he played that year..He looked like he could throw the ball but he wasn't anything special...Put a player at every position and have everyones attention on you at all times...Why am I defending this guy when I'm a spartan fan..well because sometimes you have to agree when you see the best... I saw him play here..That interception he had was probably the best play of the year..even us state fans admit he deserved the heisman..and michigan deserved the championship with him as the leader.
