This might not have so much to do with the city in itself but I was at one of the demonstrations against the EU George W Bush, and I left before things got out of hand. But seriously, oh my god! I don't think I've ever seen so much distruction, violence and abuse. The huligans ruined everything and what really bugs me is that the foreign media is going to focus all their power on ca 1000-1500 'demonstrators' that crossed the line than on ca 15000-25000 thousand that demonstrated in peace. Also let's not forget that many of the huligans weren't even swedish citizents, some were from Germany, Norway, Denmark and some other countries. Thanks to these huligans, 49 people have been brought to hospital as I'm writing this, among 500 people have been arrested and the police is calling in backup from the other cities in Sweden. Seriously, do they have any idea how much time and money it's going to take to rebuild this town. Those who live in the centre of the city have been told by police not to leave their apartments. I mean, I'm all for the public expressing their views but this is taking it one step too far. It could have one upside though, politicians might realize that most of the swedes don't want to belong to the EU. Not that they would care anyhow. Seriously Goteborg is a good town, although those who were here during the EU-meeting might think otherwise.
