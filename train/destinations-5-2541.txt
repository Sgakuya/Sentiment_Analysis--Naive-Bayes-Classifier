Known as the Garden Isle, Kauai is a very rainy and green island. In fact, the rainiest spot on earth is found in the interior of the island. This island is far more low key than Maui or Oahu, but all that's made up by great scenery and the best beaches in Hawaii. Take a helicopter tour of the Na Pali Coast, which is an uaccessible stretch of coastline on the northwest end of the island, the mountains end right at the beach, plunging into the sea. Its extremely dramatic, with beaches that have probably never seen a human footprint on them. You can see waterfalls going straight into the ocean. There's also great surfing nearby. In the interior, they have the Waimea Canyon, which is known as the Grand Canyon of Hawaii. This is Hawaii as everyone imagines it, a very interesting little island.
