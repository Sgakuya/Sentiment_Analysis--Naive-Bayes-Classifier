Big Trouble In Little China (released in 1986) is a completely over the top adventure film directed by John Carpenter which keeps the tongue firmly planted in cheek. For the uninitiated, the plot of the film is focused on John Wayne wannabe truck driver Jack Burton (played perfectly by Kurt Russell) who is thrust into the mystic world of Chinese magic and mythology in San Francisco's Chinatown. Burton and his cohorts (eg Dennis Dun as Wang Chi, Victor Wong as Egg Shen, and Burton's love interest Gracie Law played by Kim Cattrall) must rescue a damsel in distress while fighting off the 3000 year old Chinese warlord Lo Pan (James Hong) and his three primary minions, Thunder, Rain and Lightning (who have the respective powers of their names). The action is frenzied, lighthearted and very similar to the 1984 film The Adventures Of Buckaroo Banzai Across The 8th Dimension! In fact it is my understanding that Big Trouble was originally supposed to be the sequel to Banzai; however, in my opinion Big Trouble worked better with Kurt Russell doing his thing. Moreover, I do not know how the screenwriters could have incorporated all of Buckaroo's sidekicks into the film and still stick with the Chinese theme. The bottom line is that Big Trouble In Little China remains a guilty pleasure not to be taken too seriously.
