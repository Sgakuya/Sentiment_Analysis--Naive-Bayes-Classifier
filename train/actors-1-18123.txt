Gotta agree with everyone here. Here character on GH (Courtney) is so freakin repetative and bland that it's boring for us viewers to watch. No affence to Alicia or anything, I'm sure, given the right role, she's a great actress, but from what I've scene on General Hospital isn't even the least bit entertaining to watch. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that her character and her current pairing (Gag!) were shoved down our throats so fast that's it's practically second nature for us to throw her up! I hope this doesn't affend anyone. I just haven't appreciated or gotten into her efforts of playing her character on GH!
