I have a 1998 Jeep Laredo with 44K miles on it that just failed on the road due to a clogged fuel system. My daughter and others were at risk since the car came to a halt on a main road and could not be moved off ot it. It had to be towed to the dealer. The repair cost was $725.00. I was told there was a growth in the tank and the fix was to replace the tank or have it flushed out with bleach which is what they did along with replacing the fuel pump. If it was a growth then the tank was made without the proper inhibitors in it to prevent this. In reading another review it may be a liner problem. Obviously we are not getting a straight answer on this from the manufacturer and they are aware of the problem. The parts man at the dealer said he had seen numerous pump failures on this car,and unless the tank is flushed or replace the failure repeats in a very short period of time. Jeep said it was out of warranty and when I asked about the flushing with bleach procedure they started to dance and would not provide this in writing and claimed it was not something that applied to my car to begin with. I sense a cover up here. If any others have had this problem please contact me. The car is a gas hog, I have the 4.0 liter engine, the tires wear out fast and it has poor quality brake rotors on it. Not worth what you pay for it expecially with the high maintenance cost to operate it.
