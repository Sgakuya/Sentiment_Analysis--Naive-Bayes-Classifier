This is a fairly good album. It has some really great songs on it, such as Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) and Hitchin' a Ride just to name a couple, however I found that a few of the songs ended up sounding really similar to one another. These songs were the songs that you tend to hear from Green Day, fast paced rock songs and I think that for me, that style has gotten a little bit old. I don't mean to say that these songs suck, I've just grown out of that style. This is the album where Green Day have started to change their fast paced style a bit though and songs such as Good Riddance and Redundant are a nice change. These songs make this CD unique from past albums that Green Day have produced.
