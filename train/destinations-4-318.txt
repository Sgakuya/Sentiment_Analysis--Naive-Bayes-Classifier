Apia is a little pit of a town with dirty sewers clogged throughout the city and packs of mangey flee-ridden dogs wandering all over the place. But the people are the friendliest you will find anywhere in the world. Every morning the police begin the day parading down the street (most of them in lava-lavas and barefoot) to the government building where they raise the flag. If you get to Samoa do not stay in Apia or even the island of Upolu. Make sure you get out to the other islands especially Savai'i. A true traditional, undeveloped, island paradise awaits you just outside Apia's citys limits so make sure you explore while you're there.
