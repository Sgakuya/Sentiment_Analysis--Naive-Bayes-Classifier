I have a lot of respect for Jeffords. Here is a guy who is not by any means considered a maverick in the Senate and was respected by both sides of the aisle. He was a moderate Republican who tended to vote Democrat on many issues. Yet, he made the courageous decision to switch party affiliations to Independent because his beliefs were not in line with the Republican Party. He did this knowing that his change would switch the balance of power in the Senate. Anyone can make a decision when there is little on the line. How great it is to see a man who will make a difficult choice and stand up for his convictions, no matter what the repurcusions are.
