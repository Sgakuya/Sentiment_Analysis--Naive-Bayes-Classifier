Ive flown with AW many times. I was a loyal customer untill I needed to change a flight for a ticket I purchased worth $501, long story short they said they can only give me 5 $100 vouchers that can only be used one at a time and for tickets valued at over $400. This is CRAZY since most of the flights now cost about $200 - $300 round trip, I would actualy be loosing money each time I flew with the voucher. I would not recomend to fly with them ever. Your welcome to email me if you like, vthelmnt@aol.com if you have similar situations and can help me resolve this one. I did not accept the vouchers because it would have closed the issue.
