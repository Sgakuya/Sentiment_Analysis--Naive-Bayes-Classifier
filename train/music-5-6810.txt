I just wanted to tell all the LIMP fans to run to the stores immedietly and by this album! I saw fred durst and the boys in concert this week and they blew me away. There new CDis better then the best! Anyone who doesn't like limp bizkit SUCKS! This is a band that definatley does it all for the fans! From there laser light show to there awesome pyrotechnics! They are all about performing live, and if you get the chance to see them on there Anger Management tour don'y miss out, you are in for the time of your life. Guest appearances on this CD make it even better. Xzibit, Scott Wyland from STP, DMX,Method Man RED MAn and many more. Limp deffinetly speaks to the audiance with there new cd and if you havn't baught it yet! What the hell are you waiting for?
