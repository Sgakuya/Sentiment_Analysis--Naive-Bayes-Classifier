I'm not a fan of college football, but after seeing what Miami did the home town team (Neb. Cornhuskers) it's safe to say the 'Canes are the best team in college football. Their defense was awesome, encouraging the Huskers to turnover the ball three times (!) in the first half and later in the game, the defense made some great plays, including a couple in which Husker players got knocked flat on their asses, not even knowing what hit them. Ken Dorsey looks like the next Kurt Warner, after seeing the dead-on accurate bombs he threw. I'm glad for the Hurricanes because they shut up and depressed all the Husker faithful with no lives I am surrounded by everyday and have to put up with. It's kind of funny seeing all the Big Red folks so ... blue! Congrats, Miami.
