Ever since I was exposed to Dunhills I have been a fan. They have a certain complex taste to them. Sort of spicy with a hint of sweetness. They actually taste like real tobacco! I have found very few mass produced cigarettes that retain the smell of fresh tobacco. I once went past a plantation of the stuff and it was the sweetest most enticing aroma enveloping the atmosphere. I get sense-memories of that with every carbonised Dunhill. I often hear from the people selling them to me that I am the only non-old bag that they've ever sold Dunhills to. Apparently they have some image of being and old lady's smoke. I am an 18 year old boy and I say it doesn't matter as long as the taste is this good!
