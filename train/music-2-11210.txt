Whitney's record company ought to be slammed for misrepresentation. This is supposed to be a Greatest Hits album by Whitney Houston. It's really not. The first disc Cooldown does contain Whitney's well known repertoire of ballads untouched but the second disc Throwdown is a complete abomination of Whitney's earlier dance classics like I Wanna Dance With Somebody . Instead of the original mixes, we get new mixes of Whitney's earlier dance hits by Junior Vasquez and others, perhaps feeding off her fame so as to further their own careers. Yet, I couldn't care less about some new remixes . This greatest hits album should've included the original mixes of How Will I Know and I Wanna Dance With Somebody , etc. instead or being rejigged to appeal to a younger audience. I feel like I've been ripped off. Any Whitney fan out there agree?
