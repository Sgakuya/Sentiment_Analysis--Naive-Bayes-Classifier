It's Friday night and me and my girlfriend are hanging out at a bar and Janeane is tagging along. Why? Because Janeane is that kinda girl. She's a friend of my girlfriend who's mildly attractive, pessimistic, lesbianish, who has no date and no real interest from other guys. She's gonna smoke cigarettes, stand off to the side of us and she'll badmouth me to my girl when I walk away. She's a sourpuss who is secretly jealous of the other women who a prettier than her. If they get drunk enough, one of my buddies will get the beer googles on and take her back to his place and do her because that's what she is - The Other Chick. Hey's she got a little sense of humor, but I'm still not into her. Not by any stretch.
