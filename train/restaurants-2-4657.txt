I figured I'd give it a shot the other day; I mean, how different could it be from all the other sit-down places with all that americana type stuff nailed to the walls? Yeah, well, the answer is, surprisingly, VERY different. The waiter guy got our drinks, then went off . . . about half an hour later, the couple at the table next to ours got up and left in disgust, looked like they only got their drinks, too. Someone who I guess was in a managerial position came by and asked us how things were going. Uhhh . . . good. Except I think our waiter forgot us a while ago. Turns out the guy was walking around outside, talking on his cell phone. The food turned out to be dry and tasteless. Yeah, it's a single, isolated incident, but there are wayyy to many other options to choose from, rather than taking a shot with them again.
