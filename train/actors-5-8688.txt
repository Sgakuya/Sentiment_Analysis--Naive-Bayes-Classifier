Joan Bennett is one of my favorite stars, who I first got to know on TV's 'Dark Shadows' in the 60's. She wasn't a great actress, like Bette Davis, who could take poor material and make it good. But given the right role for the right director, such as the femme fatales she played in two classic Fritz Lang film noirs, 'The Woman in the Window' (1944) and 'Scarlet Street' (1945), she could turn in superb performances. She's also excellent as the desperate housewife being blackmailed by James Mason in Max Ophuls' 'The Reckless Moment' (1949). A blonde in the 30's, she turned brunette in the 40's and received much better roles. A highly overlooked and underrated star, and one of the most attractive women of her era.
