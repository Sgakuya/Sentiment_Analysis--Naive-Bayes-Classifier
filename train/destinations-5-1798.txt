Hey, folks, hold your horses here. I am a Canadian who loves America. Dont believe everything you read. We are pretty much co-dependent cousins. Every Canadian has some American friends and family down there and most Canadians like America. Give back American culture? Please dont be so hasty. We are a pretty small country but we have helped out and given you plenty too. Dont forget Tom Green, Pamela Anderson, American Apparel, Mike Myers or Austin Powers, Jim Carrey, Dan Akroyd, Peter Jennings, Club Monaco, John Kenneth Galbraith, Norman Jewison, Saturday Night Live, Rick Moranis, Mercer Consulting, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Aldo, frozen food, John Irving, basketball, football, Superman, insulin, the zipper, John Candy, Avril Lavinge, Nelly Furtado, Celine Dion, James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2) and the list could go on and on. Hey, Ive never met an Anti-Semitic Canadian. Some people are just giving us canucks a bad rap. I love Americans. They are always a fun crowd to hang out with. California is absolutely stunning and I love the Colorado Rockies, Boston, New Orleans, Minneapolis and of course, New York City. My folks retired in Orlando, Florida and I love it there. Canada and America are two best countries in the world. No need for squabbles.
