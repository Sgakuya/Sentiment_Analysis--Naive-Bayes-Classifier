Washington, D.C. is one of the few cities in the U.S. where you can almost imagine you are in Europe: Old, walkable neighborhoods such as Georgetown and DuPont Circle, height limitations on buildings, almost as many museums and galleries as Paris, a great subway system and lots of FREE cultural activites. People here may not be the most outgoing, but there is no doubt that they are the most educated of any large metropolitan region in the country. It's a pleasure to speak with people who value education. You could never accuse Washingtonians of being ignorant or provincial, unlike just about every southern city in this country. As for the crime situation, some reviewers claim that you will be shot at if you so much as walk your dog, but I would like to reasure people that NOTHING could be further from the truth. Crime is confined to a few gang-dominated areas where you are unlikely to find yourself. I lived here 8 years and never once heard gunshots. DC is my favorite American city after Boston and San Francisco.
