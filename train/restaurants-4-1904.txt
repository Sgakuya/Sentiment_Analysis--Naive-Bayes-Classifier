You certianly get more for your money at BK, and the Whopper is delicious. My only complaints are the fries and the commercials. The fries are sometimes cold, and when they're hot, they're still not as good as McD's (IMO, one of the very few good things McD's makes.) As far as the commercials with the plastic-Burger-King serial killer, they are just creepy. You know they are doing it on purpose so you remember the commercial. That's why the one with the cowboy was such an acid trip! Anyway, back to the serial-killer King. On one commercial, a guy looks out his window to see the King in the distance, then he blinks and the King is right there up close looking back at him! On another, the King is in bed with the same guy, and he wakes him up. Ok, he is either a serial killer, a pervert, or both. Anyway, that guy needs to get a restraining order.
