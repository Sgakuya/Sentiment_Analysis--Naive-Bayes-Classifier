I worked for a long time at Future Shop in Canada. The same kind of company and the same management style. In fact, Future Shop is now owned by Best Buy Inc. In my time there I have seen some really good employees get treated like dirt, and enough backstabbing to make a persian dagger weilder blush in shame. The very backstabbing that led to my termination. This company, like many large companies, doesnt give a rats a$$ about people. They just want your money. And guess what, most of us will give it to them! Pretty sad aint it. Next time you buy something from there, look at the employees. Do they look happy? I bet you most will not. There is so much dirt in their corporate ladder that I'd take pages and pages to describe how filthy some [not all] of the management is, so I wont even bother. Take it from someone who has been on BOTH sides, employee and customer.
