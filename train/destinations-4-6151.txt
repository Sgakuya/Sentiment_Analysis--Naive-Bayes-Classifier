Terribly stereotyped by the rest of the country as a state of rednecks and hicks. Yes, there are some here, but its part of the heritage of our state. There are rednecks and hicks everywhere as far North as Pennsylvania and New York. This state truly is a beautiful place to visit, and I loved visiting Mammoth Cave National Park. I was raised in Kentucky from the age of 5 to 13, and they probably were the best years of my life so far. A lot of attractions, notably Lincoln's Birthplce and Boyhood Home and The Kentucky Derby. Lexington is one of the most beautiful cities in this country with their notable horse farms. As a former resident of Bardstown, this city truly was a priveledge to live in. With its Civil War Museum and My Old Kentucky Home park, along with its gulf courses, it is one of Kentucky's most visited cities. Louisville is the largest city in the state, but it is still as low on crime as you would want any large city to be. A mixture of city, country, mountains and farms. A very diverse state! Go see Kentucky, where education pays!
