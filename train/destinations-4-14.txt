Cairo is the sort of place that is wonderful if you know what you are doing. I have been there 3 times now. You can see what you need to see in 2/3 days. Passport control at airport (1hr+), you can buy visas at bank kiosks just before passport control for US$15 (two stamps go on free page in passport). Don't even think about hiring a car or driving (use taxis/private car = very cheap), don't use buses/underground. Pay the extra for a 5* hotel (still cheap) (recommend mena house oberoi - pyramid view), or if in centre get room high up to limit noise (city is awake 24hrs). You are much better off using taxis and paying your own entry fees rather than going on tours (cheaper and you can take yor time + avoid the additional sales stops). Places need to see - Pyramids etc at Giza (300 tickets available daily for Kyops pyramid 150 at 8-00 150 at 1-00 (from small kiosk 100yards infront of pyramid entrance) need to queue befgorehand and be lucky. Also visit Saquarra 2 hr) and Memphis (1hr) (together). Museum - needs 3hrs min (mummy room extra inside) go Pm as all tours are in morning. Be firm but polite when being hassled (especially at Giza). Carry lots of small notes for tips (EG10) (or US$1) or (1). Food/shopping is very goiod value at the moment. Drink water frequently.
