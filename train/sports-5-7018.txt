Note to all the players trying to be the next Jordan: give up. Be your own best player, and lose the 'tude. There can be only one Jordan. UPDATE: While samjung23's assertion that Lebron will fail is true, I disagree with his assertion that Jordan could not create his own shots. If you can cut and drive like Jordan did on many occasions, then change your shot in midair, that is on the player, not the coach. A good coach will turn a bunch of guys into a team, true enough, but innate talent like Jordan's cannot be made by the coach. Shaped a little maybe. Anyways, I believe the best of all worlds would encorporate Jordan's ability to drive the lane and get that first step, Dan Majerle's perimeter shooting and hustle up and down the court, Charles Barkley's ability to back down on people in the post and get that rebound, Danny Ainge's fearless diving after the loose ball, and consistent high percentage free throw shooting.
