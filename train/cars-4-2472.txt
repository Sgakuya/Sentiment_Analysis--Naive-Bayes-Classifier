Have any of you guys heard of the Nissan GT-R?!? Yes the Supra is a great car, but still doesn't have the agressive styling edge of the 300zx, which Toyota so obviously was trying to emulate (old and reliable Toyota tactics). Toyota produced a slightly faster (speed) and quicker (acceleration) car, only 3-4 years later, and a less attractive package. Only a mother (or owner apparently) could love those looks. I'd still have one if on offer, but I prefer my Z. Here's an interesting fact for you guys... the speed record down the (short) straight at Australia's Mt Panorama race track is 199MPH by a 1200HP 300ZX. Also, go check the websites for the GT-R's, you might be surprised when you find the specs on the limited edition high performance GT-R's.
