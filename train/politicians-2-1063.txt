I am a supporter of Israel, however, the Palestinian situation is heartbreaking. I cannot understand how Sharon can bring peace. His destruction of 45 Palestinian homes when one Israeli settler was killed in unconscionable. (1980's) Collective punishment is a terrorist act! How can he judge the Palestinians as terrorists when he is one himself. It was a tragedy when Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by his own people. Rabin was truly on the way to peace. Rabin had my total support. The Palestinians have placed a condition to stopping the violence. They insist on no more Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. This amounts to theft of Palestinian property. I advise everyone to watch the movie Exodus. It is available on tape. I think it will be enlightening. It shows the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem by Menachim Begin, who later bacame Prime Minister, and his group. 85 people were killed! Who is a terrorist?
