I have a 2002 Elantra GLS and I can assure this is a great car. I drove all day from CA to CT in a 5-day trip plus have put lots of miles doing business trip and it has never left showed any major problem. Along all this years I have only changed oils, break pad and a couple of bulbs. This car has an excellent miles/gallon and I love its design. The only problem and the reason why I am rating it as 5 stars is its market depreciation. I was trying to trade it in and get a bigger car but all dealers are paying me $8k or less ONLY. Well, if you want to have a car for a long period of time... this is the car... If you are the kind of person who can't stick around with the same car for more than a couple of years... Don't even think about buying this car... Honda and Toyota have the lower depreciation in the market. Hope it can help you!!!
