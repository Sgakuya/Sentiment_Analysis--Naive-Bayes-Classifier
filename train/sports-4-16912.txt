I just gave them an extra star for that draft. Never mind who they actually picked this year, but Scott Pioli used a reusable franchise label on a free agent to wheedle a third round pick out of nothing. Then the Pats traded a three for a two next year. Then they manufactured another free second round pick and drafted a low first round player (on most draft boards) with that pick. So, why didn't they just steal the number one guy in the whole draft? Wait, that's coming next year! . . . Ty Warren was a reach. In Ty's defense, he has something that DeWayne doesn't have: reach. Ty is close to six foot five with long arms; Short DeWayne has stubby little arms and legs. A sack is a six yard loss, but a pass tipped straight up in the air at the goal line can cost seven points potentially lost for the offense and another seven for the defensive touchdown. For example, do you remember the Super Bowl interception against the Rams that got called back? That was a 14 point shift.
