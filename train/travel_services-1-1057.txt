DO NOT USE GLOBE MOVERS. The following is a report on Globe Movers Inc. of Sunrise, Florida. I recently moved from Princeton, NJ to Paris, France, and chose Globe Movers since they were the cheapest option (approx. $4.00 per cubic foot plus a charge of around $600 for packing my stuff). We had approximately 100 cu.ft., and were quoted a total price of about $1200.00. I have moved across the Atlantic previously, and this sounded about right. My goods were picked up on time, and I paid the full amount before leaving the US. After 3-4 weeks in France, I received import documents from Globe Movers colleagues in the UK (Confreight) who apparently look after Globe Movers European deliveries. All seemed well, and I expected to wait another couple of weeks to get my stuff. After another 4 weeks with no delivery I decided to call Confreight to find out what was happening. They told me that they were holding my shipment because Globe Movers had instructed them that I had not paid my bill in full. In addition, since there had been a delay, there would also be an additional rental charge on my shipment! The people at Globe Movers then informed me that in fact the total bill was now about $3000, not including UK rental charges!! At this point, Globe Movers is demanding almost triple the original quote, and they have all my worldy belongings including such irreplaceable things as my wifes wedding dress etc etc... I then entered into a prolonged (4 weeks) negotiation with Steve Kuller (VP of Globe Movers) to rectify the situation, all at my own expense (I estimate between $100 and $200 of long international phone calls, including many periods of being on hold and then being cut off by mistake). Globe had originally been extremely friendly and helpful, and were now being extremely difficult and unhelpful. After much heart-ache (would we ever see the wedding dress again?), Globe agreed to slightly reduce its price, and to cover the rental costs in the UK (around $400). In the end I paid a total of around $2700 including the cost of phone calls (more than double the original quote). My wife, my baby son and I lived for two months with no furniture as a result of this, and finally received our goods about 3 months after our move. Everything we received was intact, the only problem being that some of our boxes were missing! A total of about $1000 worth of clothes/books etc...were gone. I put in a claim for these items, but needless to say I get no response from Steve Kuller or any other representative of Globe Movers (I have waited more than a month for a response). So, total cost to me was around $3700, more than triple the quoted price. Its clear that operators like Globe Movers know very well that clients moving overseas have little recourse in cases like this since they (Globe Movers) are safely tucked away in Florida. If you dont want any nasty surprises with the cost of your shipment when Globe Movers is already holding your belongings (there is a name for this type of behaviour by the way), then DO NOT USE GLOBE MOVERS.
