Christian Bale is one of the best actors of his time. Most people that aren't big fans has only seen him in American Pyscho(which he gave a superb performance). But all the rest of his movies are all so great. Each of his performances seem so real alive. He does wonders to the characters he potrays and the movies themselves.And his talents are surprising, from singing (great voice)and dancing in Newsies, to swing dancing in Swing Kids. His role in Little Women was heartwarming. He gets so invovlved in all the movies. You can tell because he learns a new accent for each movie he makes. I look forward to outstanding new performances from this lovely actor!
