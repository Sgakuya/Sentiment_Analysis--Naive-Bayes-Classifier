I've been to the Buca di Beppo in downtown Denver twice in the last month, and I enjoyed it overall. The waitstaff is a bit too pushy and in-your-face for my taste, but I got good service otherwise. The food is very tasty, and the portions are gigantic. Everything is served family style, and each dish we ordered served about six people. (We made the mistake of ordering two main dishes for four people the first visit.) The food is really garlicky and spicy, which I liked, but we breathed fire for the rest of the evening. We saw lots of big groups at Buca di Beppo, ranging from families to teenagers dressed up for Valentine's Day dances, and it seems like a great restaurant for a celebration. For a chain, Buca di Beppo has a lot of personality and surprisingly good food.
