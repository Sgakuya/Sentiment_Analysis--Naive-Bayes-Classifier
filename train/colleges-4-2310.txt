This is a nice little school - and a school of choice for relatively smart, Catholic kids from the North East. The campus is decent, with an excellent student center and a state of the art athletics facility (the Pavilion). It is located in Villanova, Pennsylvania, part of Philadelphia's affluent Main Line , and is very much a suburb, for better or for worse. On the plus side, this school is safe - you can walk anywhere at any time of the day or night and not be hassled. On the down side, you have to drive or taxi to hit most of the local bars or restaurants. The school is very homogeneous, but it is a nice safe choice for someone looking to stay close to home, and surround themselves with pretty bright students.
