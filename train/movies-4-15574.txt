Honestly, I awaited the premier of this to-be blockbuster hit with great anticipation; I love period pieces, and historically, I find it one of the most fascinatingly tragic stories of our time. In fact, I'm ashamed to admit to sneaking in, just so I could see it the first day out. However, as much as I enjoyed the film, the characters, and the special effects, I was mostly annoyed by all the gushy middle school hype than anything else. When the girl next to me sobs under the exit sign, not because of the heartbreaking tragedy, but because Leonardo DiCaprio is dead-that ruined the movie for me. Once, not 15 times was enough.
