I love this little car. I am 6'4 and totally comfortable in it; the driver's seat actually can lower and raise in addition to sliding way back. As a case in point, I am more comfortable in my Golf than I am in my friend's Pathfinder. It handles great, is pretty quick, gets great mileage, and never breaks down. You can't go wrong with this car. Even more important from my perspective is how little maintenance is required to keep this vehicle running in top shape. I am notoriously irresponsible / lazy about upkeep on my car, and my Golf doesnt seem to care. Durable, quick, uncomplaining, and not too shabby looking (mine is forrest green with tinted windows), this really is the perfect little car.
