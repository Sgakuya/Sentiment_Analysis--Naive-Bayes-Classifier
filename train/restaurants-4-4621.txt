Carrabba's is pretty good value for the money. I've been to a couple (in Virginia and Maryland); food in the Virginia restuarant was not as good as the one in Maryland, but overall, it was a positive experience. As with most Italian restaurants, some of the dishes are what I'd call fancifully Italian (i.e., you'd be hard pressed to find anything like it in Italy), but the food is better than in a lot of other chains. My dishes tended to be somewhat tangy, but not unpleasantly so. The pasta (fettuccini Alfredo) was not bad, all things considered. Service was good, portions are ample, and the atmosphere is good. It's a nice place to bring kids, too.
