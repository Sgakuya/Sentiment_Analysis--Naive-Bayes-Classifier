It was sad to watch this movie and know it is one of the very last for Henry Fonda.Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda were both wonderful as a husband and wife spending a summer at golden pond.Norman is almost 80 and in failing health. His daughter played by jane Fonda comes for a visit with her fiance and his 13 year old son Billy. The daughter and Norman have never been close.so their visit is strained, they leave Billy the 13 year old with Norman and Ethyl while they go to Europe. Billy and Norman develope a friendship. and spend some of the summer fishing.All the actors are good. Henry Fonda won a well deserved oscar for his role. I like the fact that Jane and Henry Fonda real life Daughter and father got a chance to be in a movie together.this is a good movie.with some good scenes.
