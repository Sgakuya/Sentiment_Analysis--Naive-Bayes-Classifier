I thought the oldest Family Circus cartoons--from 1960--were all right. They were just plain average cartoons (what you might find in the Saturday Evening Post or a similar publication). But then it didn't seem as sappy as what runs today. Those cartoons often had stories--for example, Jeffy having his tonsils taken out--that people could identify with. Nowadays, the kids never age, the kids just mouth off cute lines, and everyone is so perfect. Yecch! Can't Mommy and Daddy have a divorce or a problem with careers or moving for crying out loud??? A few years ago, one person ran a parody on the internet--the Dysfunctional Family Circus--where people submitted their own captions for selected cartoons. Those were usually obscene, but many of them were more thoughtful and more insightful than the ones written by the creators of the original Family Circus themselves. It's too bad that the lawyers representing the syndicators of The Family Circus forced the fellow running the Dysfunctional Family Circus to end his parody. To me, that means that the creators of the real Family Circus are too thin-skinned to take a joke among other things. But I am afraid that there will always be newspapers which will want to run the real Family Circus and there are no signs that it will fade away any time soon, unfortunately. (I'd like to give The Family Circus no stars, but I can't find any way to do so.)
