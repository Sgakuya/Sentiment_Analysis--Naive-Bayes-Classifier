I would wholeheartedly recommend this (Dorling Kindersley)Eyewitness guide as the best available for the general traveller;clear,informative,well laid-out,and (for me the real clincher)absolutely crammed with colour photos of the different regions and attractions.There are more illustrations of great paintings and sculptures than are to be found in many Art books!It will certainly appeal to the armchair tourist who simply enjoys reading and learning about other countries.It also has the necessary practical advice.My only query would be its usefulness for the hitch-hiking hostel-user or the traveller who wants to get deeply into the heart and character of each area in a more personal way.As an all-round indicator of what Italy has to offer,though,it's a real pleasure to own.The several other Eyewitness guides to countries (Japan,Ireland,France,Portugal) which i have are of an equally excellent standard.
