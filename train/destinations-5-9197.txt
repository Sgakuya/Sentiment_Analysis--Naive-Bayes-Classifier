La Sagrada Familia (the church of the Holy Family if memory serves) is without argument, the highlight of any tour of Barcelona. What started as a vision of the architect Antoni Gaudi was tragically cut short by his death by being run over by a tram relatively soon into the initial construction. Gaudi not being one for written plans, there was no permanent record of how the structure was to be completed. This has led to rather disappointing results as his successors clearly did not have the same talents and vision, resulting is conflicting styles that do not reconcile with Gaudi's original work. Nevertheless, the entire incomplete project has a very organic aura, which reminds one (as another comment noted) of a giant sand-drip castle.
