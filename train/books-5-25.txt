Excellent book and very well written but at the same time both very depressing and very inspiring. Every chapter something terrible is happening and you think oh my god, well at least it's got to get better and then it would get worse. They have a pigs head, yeah that's right, a head for Christmas dinner and you'd think wow, that's got to be the low and then the next chapter one of the children would die and the dad would go off and get pissed and come home singing ditties. But, then there's the other side where he gets out of it all and you think how the heck did he go from that to be a professor at the Stuveysant (sp?) So in that regard it's inspiring.
