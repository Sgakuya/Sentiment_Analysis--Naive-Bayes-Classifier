Good sci-fi shoot em up. Not up to par with the originals edge but definatly a killer ride. Directed by James Cameron master of the over the top eye candy disater flick. He takes you into the dank and smelly future of our marine corp. Not only this but he takes these same marines along with Alien survivor Ripley to the Alien home planet from the first film which has been colonized by humans (Can you say government set up?) and has ceased sending transmitions from home. So the marines go down to investigate armed to the teeth. Care to guess what happens next? First to start the formula but is done very well. A good blow up the minster and f*ck em sort of flick. Recommended along with the rest of the series.
