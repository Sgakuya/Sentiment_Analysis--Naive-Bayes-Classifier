The single greatest tragedy of them all: this man gave up after Last Tango in Paris (although The Freshman is a hip little comedy). The scene in Tango where he cries over his dead wife's body is possibly the most powerful display of acting I've ever seen. I'm crying because his end is already here. After so many personal tragedies, he's got no fight left in him. We'll just have to relive Streetcar, Waterfront, and The Men and all those other great roles over and over again. He HAS to be honored. He won't show up, but the Academy, the AFI, every film and theatre organization in the world needs to honor him. They have to remind younger generations who started it all - who popularized the concept of The Rebel. Even Elvis and The Beatles would probably not exist without Marlon Brando.
