With the exception of Bobby V, the Mets really are a pretty easy team to like this year. Their outfield right now is made up of three guys who don't make more than $1 million combined. They have likable (not to mention really good) infielders, particularly Edgardo Alfonzo. And, they have the best hitting catcher in baseball history, a guy who plays his heart out every night. Combine all of that with a strong pitching staff, led by Mike Hampton and Al Leiter in the starting rotation and John Franco out of the pen, and you've got a team which is pretty easy to root for and damned good on the field. Times have changed from the 80's Mets, among the most hated teams in baseball history.
