One of the reasons I like this game is because it is probably the only game ever devised in which you get to play Fidel Castro (or Che Guevera, Augusto Pinochet, Eva Perone, Lou Bega {?}). Annoyingly enough this game is often discribed as a dictator-em-up and yet is one of the few games where elections are held. To cling on to power using a democratic method it becomes important to keep your people happy and satisfied (unless you want to rule by martial law but I have never lost an election). Every single citizen on your island has his/her own thoughts beliefs and abilities and you are given the option to bribe them and/or do a variety of nasty things to them such as assasination and arrest. To add to the complexities you also have different factions on the island which also effects your relations with the Soviet Union and the USA respectively. Though it is sometimes claimed you can run your island in a capitalistic way this is not really since everything (except the shacks) belongs to the government. The economic model is pretty complex but not as complex as I would have liked it to be. Overall a humourus fun little game that'll keep you occupied for a while at least.
