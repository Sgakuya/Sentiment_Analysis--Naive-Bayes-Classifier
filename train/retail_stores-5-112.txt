I think Powell's is one of the finest independent bookstores in the country, and certainly a viable (and even preferable) alternative to the chains-- BOTH as a brick-and-mortar venue for locals, AND as an Internet alternative to Amazon, Borders, B N, etc. The actual store is huge, but well organized. I think the greatest appeal of an in-person visit to main downtown store ( Satellite stores can be found around the greater Portland area) is the fact that Powell's is both a new AND used bookstore-- mixed together. This means that you can find old, esoteric and out-of-print titles side by side with the latest releases, and on a range of subjects you simply don't find most other places. For those who are more serious about their books, Powell's also has a Rare Book Room, which rivals many fine antiquarian stores. If you know what you're looking for, Powell's web site basically brings the store to your living room, and the pricing is pretty competitive with the big guys. Highly recommended!
