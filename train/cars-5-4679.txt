I have owned Chevy, one was good to me just the occasional tranny, seal, exhaust and brakes. My 2000 sierra was absolute garbage. I have already got surface rust forming underthe doors and the frame is even rusted through some spots. I had to replace u joints, drive shaft, complete brake system, hubs, motor for the passenger mirror, the tailgate drops periodically(one time dumping almost 2000 dollars of tools into traffic. Most recently my leaf spring snapped@ 120,000 km. I have aranged to buy a tacoma, I know that just the slower depreciation alone will be worth it, after all every one says toyotas are to expensive for what you get, but try dumping 35,000 into a chev before tax driving it for three years and selling it for 16,000. I'm not great with math but that alone should be reason enough to get into toyota. For everyone who still swears by a domestic, there is good reason for your obvious brand insecurity, If you didn't spend all your money on repairs you could atleast afford the drugs to releive your anxiety.
