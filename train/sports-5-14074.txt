Everyone forgets that the 49ers were a 1-15 team with NO history when Joe Montana came aboard. Even Bill Walsh had a terrible year pre-Montana. Joe Montana MADE that system great--and revolutionized the position (and the game). Believe it or not, Joe is actually UNDERRATED. That whole system was built around Montana's talents. Bill Walsh was a genius because he was the first to ever envision Joe Montana football. Jerry Rice was the best receiver ever, but, he might not have been without Joe. Joe made everyone around him better- just ask Jerry. If his last Super Bowl team was so talented, his early super bowl teams were almost no-names. ... Everyone forgets ... Joe Montana is absolutely the Greatest Player in modern football.
