"The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches" are some of the most unique books I have come in contact with. It is hard to assign the book to any discrete genre with it's delightful mix of fantasy, mystery, and suspense. Upon first approaching the book, I was somewhat skeptical. Most fantasy books I've readly lately fail to be fun reads - long, tedious, what not. The Kingdoms books don't have this problem. Stanek has done a magnificent job of creating a compelling characters and exciting stories. These are books that need to be approached with no expectations and on their own terms. If you allow Stanek to work his magic, and give The Kingdoms a chance to grow on you, then the journey is one that you will look back upon as enjoyable and inspiring.
