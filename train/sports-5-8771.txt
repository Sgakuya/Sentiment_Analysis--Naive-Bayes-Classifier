When Steve Francis was traded for Tracy Mcgrady people thought that Tracy is worth more than just Steve Francis. First of all the magic went 21-61 with mcGrady and are now 32-34 with Steve Francis. Steve is underrated. he does not get enough credit for what he can do on the court. the rockets were 45-37 last year with francis averaging 16 points per game that year. now the rockets are 39-27 WITH MCGRADY AVERAGING 25 PONTS PER GAME. Mcgrady averages 9 points more than Francis did with the rockets and still the rockets are about just the same as they were last year. With the Magic McGrady averaged 28 ppg in the 2003-2004 season. francis averages 7 points less this year(21ppg) and the magic are already 32-34 and are still capable of grabbing a playof spot. Thats a huge mprovement obviosly because the franchise arrived in Orlando. Tracy McGrady dint want to play for Orlando Magic General Manager John Weisbred. Instead John was interested in Steve Francis and im glad he got steve. Steve can show john how to really lead a team to the playoffs. While i say that Steve Francis is underated im going to say Tracy Mcgrady is OVERATED. People SAID THAT WHEN MCGRADY COMES TO HOUSTEN THE ROCKETS WILL BE A TEAM THAT WILL WIN THE FINALS. i dont understand why people are jumping to conclusions with T-Mac. Right now the rockets are battling their lives out trying to hold on to that 7th playof spot. So once again Steve Francis is just worth as much as Tracy McGrady. Stevie underated Franchise. ENOUGH SAID!!!!
