Hardee's used to be an excellent fast food place but now they are among the very worst. Their service is the absolute worst. I have not gotten a correct order from them in several years. I still frequent them because of the closeness to my home and their late hours, but I am always disappointed. The quality of food has dropped dramatically over the past few years as well. The actual size of the burger patties is shrinking by the day and they have stopped using real roast beef in favor of some kind of processed stuff that has all the flavor of wet cardboard. I am sure they are saving money with these changes but at the cost of many customers. This is a prime example of the bean counters' opinion mattering more to the board than the opinion of the customer.
