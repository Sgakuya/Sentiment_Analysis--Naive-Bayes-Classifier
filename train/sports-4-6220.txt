They're a top 5 team, no doubt...Frank Williams is as talented as they come; he's a great decision-maker, he makes teammates better...Cory Bradford had a disappointing year last season, but he needs to get back to what worked for him as a soph; his shot selection was pretty horrendous last year, he shot 38%...Lucas Johnson's injury is going to hurt them; he didn't put up gaudy numbers, but he was a great team guy, he'd dive on the floor, save the ball. Blandon Ferguson, for all his skill, just won't add the leadership...Brian Cook is a warrior, but he needs consistency. Last year, there were games where he looked like Chris Webber out there, scoring at will, but in other games he was more like Serge Zwikker; he wasn't even consistent half-to-half at times...Robert Archibald has good touch around the basket, but I wouldn't feel confident putting out a guy who takes as many needless fouls as he does...Can Bill Self win without Lon Kruger's players?
