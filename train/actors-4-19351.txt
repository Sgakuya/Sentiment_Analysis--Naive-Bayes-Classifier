I think that you should give this guy another chance and take a better look at Lost in Space not for the fact that the movie did not fair so well but his role in it. I think that Matt did a good job of his character and he certainly put some physical effort into it. I think that his role on Friends is very diverse, sometimes he's dumb as two thick planks and at odd moments he seems to be very much on the ball and can outwitt his companions. He's a friend I would love to hang out with cause with him things would be cool and you would know that he would be honest and forthright. As an actor I think that he has definate potential it's just that the roles that may suit him are not coming his way and that may have a great deal to do with his part in Friends. I see him playing a detective with a smart-ass attitude. He could certainly do with getting a shot at a serious role. Nice profile by the way.
