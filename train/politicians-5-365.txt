I love Prime Minister Blair. I think he is a man of integrity and remembers his friends, even when they are in trouble. He knows what it means to be a friend and an ally and stuck with the States even when France would not. He doesn't buckle under pressure, even international pressure, and sticks to his guns and does what he says he will do. He has an unsupassable sense of humor. On one visit to the States a senator greeted Blair in D.C. He showed Blair the Congressional Library and kindly told the story about how the British had burned it down during the war of 1812. Blair just kind of looked and said, This is a little late but, sorry about that. My gosh how could you not love this man.
