Pseudo-city...you have to drive an hour to get to anything. I am in my 30s and came here because of all of the hype I heard about what a great place this is. PULEEEZE!! The Triangle is nothing but a mega-suburb. If you like strip malls and oh-so-perfectly-planned housing developments, this is the place for you. I hate it. I hate the sterility of the place. I hate the Faux Olde Guard Inside the Beltline people...(otherwise known as drunken rednecks with a few bucks.) Come on people...Raleigh was NEVER Old South Money....u are making fools of yourselves and we all know it. I can't stand the posers of Cary...we all know you are in debt up to the doors of your Range Rovers. The whole place is just so plastic. Then there's Durham. Well Durham is just a slum with a freeway. And Chapel Hill? Pretty and full of over-the-hill Woodstock grads. I am lucky that I only wasted 2 years here. I am moving back to DC where it may be colder, but people are real. The city is real, not a bunch of posers. I can't WAIT to wash the plastic smell of this place off of my clothes.
