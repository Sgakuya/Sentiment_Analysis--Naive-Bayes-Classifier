I graduated from Cornell in 1997 and never once regretted my decision to go there. As other reviewers have mentioned, Cornell, like any college, is what you make of it. For instance, Cornell is a big school in a small town, which was exactly what I was looking for. Students who crave city life, on the other hand, should go to NYU or U. Penn. The academics at Cornell are challenging, and I found the professors to be approachable and caring -- I keep in touch with my advisor to this day. (I was an English major in Arts and Sciences). It snows at Cornell -- I never minded it, and now that I'm living and working in Southern California, I kind of miss it. There are a tons of diverse groups and activities to get involved with: I was in a sorority; I acted with a small theater group; I played in the marching band; I spent a semester abroad; I even got involved in the Ithaca community by working part time at a local day care center. Other friends of mine sang in a cappella groups, wrote for the paper, participated in Concert Commission (the group that organized concerts for the campus), were active in religious groups, held on-campus jobs, served as tour guides for the campus....the list goes on and on. My point is that I had a fabulous experience at Cornell, but so much of that was due to my willingness and desire to take advantage of the opportunities available to me. When choosing a school, think about the types of activities you enjoy and the kind of environment you'd like. If you want a small campus, Cornell may not be for you. If you want a near-by city, Cornell is not your school. If, like me, you wanted a large, diverse campus with a small town feel, Cornell may be a good match. Be honest with yourself about the environment you need to thrive, and once you choose your environment, get out there and become involved in it!
