Theres a few People that you can call the MAN;but Lenny Bias was really the Man.He had style and grace on and off the court;and was before way before his time.I was just 13yrs. old when the guy past and I still cant get over it.At 6'8 He had the Jumper accuracy of Larry Bird with the Dunking Abilties of Jordan and Domonic Wilkins.Would have loved to have seen him with that Celtic Jersey wearing his signature Reeboks;killing the competition.I truly believe this guy would have been better than Micheal Jordan as great ad Mike was.Anybody seen Bias play knows Im not crazy.A shame the youngers are looking at Lebron and Bryant;thinking they are seeing something.
