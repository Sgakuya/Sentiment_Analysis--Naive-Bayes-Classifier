I truly feel sorry for the total dufus Chief Wiggum whose laughable commentary can be viewed above. The biggest joke of all is how CORRUPT michigan univ is with all its 'bought and paid for' dirty sports programs, as well as a multitude of 'questionable admission policies' most recently exposed on CBS 60 minutes. I'm glad OSU admits ALL students of any color race or creed as it should be in the USA. The only real OSU snafu is driving the mean streets of Columbus, by all means use the city buses !! or bike around. The BIG problem here everone knows is how they won't FIRE J Cooper like they should (what a no talent coach geezus) anyhow good donut shops here and LOTS of part time jobs to help with moolah $$$ CRIME is a downer though do NOT repeat do NOT go out after dark for ANY reason
