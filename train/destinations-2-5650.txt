I have lived in Quincy Mass for 30 out of 42 years. My parents were born here as well as my grand parents, great grand etc... When I moved back from the south east, I thought I traveled in a time machine. I was hitting the same potholes that I hit 10 years ago. Moreover traffic and ignorant people increased to-boot. And housing is a laugh... At least 500K for a run down shack that needs another 500K for repairs. I'm sorry, but thats unacceptable. I want to own and live in a home, not marry one! I believe that people should be able to afford a reasonable home with one a occupation income. You should not have to work 1 full time and 2 part time jobs to support a home of 2 people. And how about the ocean??? Oh yes, I see you guys that mentioned the ocean as if it was holy water. Take a BIG drink of it. Hows my urine taste? Good I hope. The Charles river is a great swimming pond for all those who are adventurous. Watch out for brown trout. Also, politicians in this state are as corrupt as the state of LA. The BIG DIG is just the tip of the berg. Now, how about the major leaks this tunnel of perfection has? Billions of dollars spent, how many billions more to repair? They can't even complete a project without it in need of being repaired. SAD! I call the repair project the BIG RE-DIG. And Mass has the smartest people in the nation?? Where were they when they built this atrocity? Beware - - - move to a suburb and occasionally visit Boston as if you were going to the zoo... Don't feed the animals.
