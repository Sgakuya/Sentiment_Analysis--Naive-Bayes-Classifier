The most beautifully written (but not the best) book that I have read in the past 18 months. Corelli's Mandolin is a story of the occupation of a tiny Greek Island during World War II, and a resulting relationship that forms between a Greek girl and an Italian officer. De Bernieres switches effortlessly between wartime narrative and romance, creating a story that is historically interesting and emotionally satisfying. What made the book so special for me was de Bernieres ability to capture the cultural conflict between the Italians, the Germans, and the Greeks - doing so in a way that is subtle and indirect, as opposed to stereotypical. If you are a fan of historical based fiction, you absolutely must read this book. The only reason that it does not get a 5 is because the ending is frustrating....
