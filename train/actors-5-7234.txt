Antonio is a very gifted actor, check out Desperado, then see Evita, and The Mask of Zorro, he is great in action films that require physical skills, he is musically talented, and his acting ability is going to be realized in the very near future in his next film Original Sin with Angelina Jolie as his co-star. Antonio is not an egotist, he is humble and very intelligent. People should be watching Crazy in Alabama and see exceptional directing ability. He is great friends with Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, and recognized by Steven Spielberg as the man best to play Zorro. Anyone who has worked on films with Antonio say he is a wonderful human being, unselfish. Anthony Hopkins and Antonio became special friends on the Zorro set and want to work together again. He is vastly underated by Hollywood and hope more and more people will see he is just more than a good looking man. In Desperado Antonio did every scene himself, no stunt men were used in the making of that film, and in Zorro he did all the sword fighting himself. Physical skills require intellect also to accomplish what is needed in the movie business. So I say hats off to Antonio Banderas, more than just the latin lover, but an accomplished young man and talent that should be recognized in America.
