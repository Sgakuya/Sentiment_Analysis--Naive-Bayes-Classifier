I bought a 1999 V6 Passat as a certified used car from Volkswagen less than three years ago and I've been really disappointed with it. Since I've had the car, its been in the shop for 7 major repairs, totalling approx. $5000, a third of its used car price tag. While some of that was covered under its warranty, the problems with this car are staggering. On top of it all, I recently brought the car in for replacement of its lower control arms which were recalled, and as soon as we left the dealership, the car pulls really hard to the left. The dealership says there's nothing wrong with the replacement part, but they don't deny the car pulls severly to the left. Their remedy, replace my tires and then they'll see about replacing the part. Give me a break!
