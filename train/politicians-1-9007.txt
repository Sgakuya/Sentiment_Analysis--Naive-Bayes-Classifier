Let's thank Bill for the many gifts he has brought to our country. 1. He promised a good health care plan and it became a worthless plan 2. He policed the world on his behath and waged attacks and wars on other countries without a formal war treaty (Somolia, Kosovow, Iraq, etc....sheesh and people are up in arms now about Bush being a watch dog, this man had rabies oaming at the mouth) 3. Making the U.S. more morally bankrupt than it already was (I really don't need to say it....affairs.....adultry....lying under oath....deceitful.....inhale....etc.). 4. No real help in social affairs. Hey, I never said he gave us good gifts. I really do not see how this man improved our country in any way. Even the left of the leftists consider him a disgrace. Eight wasted years! That says it all.
