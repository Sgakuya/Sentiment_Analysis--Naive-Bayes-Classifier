The Art Institute has something for everyone, from the artsy Gold Coast snobbery to the casual art fan. It seems that every other work is something you've seen before, which is great for someone like me who falls most definitely in the latter category. From Grant Wood's American Gothic farmer couple with pitchfork to Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte to several works by Picasso, Matisse, and many other masters, to its impressive photography collection, this is world class stuff, folks. It is widely known that this is the most impressive collection of Impressionist art outside the Louvre. Chicago legend Jane Addams knew that art elevated even the most common individuals (such as myself) to remarkable heights. Go to the Art Institute, located in lovely Grant Park, and see for yourself.
