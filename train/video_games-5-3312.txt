This is one great game. With its storyline (Aeris dying, why didn't cloud just cast life 2 on her? Its complexity, and caharcters) that right there is enough to secure a spot on the best rpg list. But, no, squaresoft didn't stop there. They added many mini-games ( Chocobo racing, materia, weapons, limits, and those frickin hard american monsters) magic, summons, and abilities, just to name a few. The graphics are 1997ish but hey? What'd u expect? I don't base the game on graphics, just replay value, depth, story, and length. I would reccomend this to any gamer, even if you're not a rpg addict (like me). This game will definetely change your mind.
