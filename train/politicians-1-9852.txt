Another moronic, corrupt do-nothing Republican whose administration, along with Coolidge's, did nothing to fend off The Great Depression: in fact, the lameness and not-so-benign neglect of the nation's financial matters by this guy and his successor actually gave cause in large part to the worst economic catastrophe in our nation's history. Presided over a tainted administration and spent considerable time boffing Nan Britton in a janitor's closet just off the Oval Office. In this, the old whoremaster was decidedly a major role model for Bubba Clinton, almost as much as that other rake who couldn't keep his fly zipped, John We Hardly Blew Ye Kennedy.
