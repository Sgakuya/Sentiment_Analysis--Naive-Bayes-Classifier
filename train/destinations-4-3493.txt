Victoria is very pretty (how many times has this been said?). I like the archetecture of the Parliament buildings and Empress hotel and it's tourist theme is almost more British than Britain itself. I think the best attraction here is the Royal British Columbia Museaum. I spent a whole afternoon wondering around the place, it has fascinating exhibits that really replicate BC's history and natural beauty quite well. It actually exceeded my expectations. As noted by Kyll below the remainder of Vancouver Island has much to reccommend it. Tofino is very peaceful and has a lot of inspiring scenery where thickly forested terrain meets the open Pacific Ocean and incredibly green! Indeed Tofino is a great place to unwind and has a lot of nice beachfront hotels.
