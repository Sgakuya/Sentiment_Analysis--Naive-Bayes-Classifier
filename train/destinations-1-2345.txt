Wow, F*** Hungary They really rape you every single chance they get. We went to a bar with only an elevator for an entrance. Needless to say, we bought $100 glasses of s*** champagne beacsue they fooled us during ordering (damn, that hurts my ego), and some big hungarian douchebag wouldn't let us leave until we payed. I HATE Hungary, and all the unfriendly, non-smiling people in it. Lonely Planet mentions that these people have "patriotic sorrow." My interpretation of this is that they are extremely cold and hate english speakers. Further, there are only a couple interesting sites (the castle and Parliament are really cool!!), but it is generally a very dirty, gloomy city, with petty crime and homeless people everywhere
