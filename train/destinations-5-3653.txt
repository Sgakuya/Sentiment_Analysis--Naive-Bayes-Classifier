I went there in winter, and its really cold, but when you dress for it, you can take it okay. Its actually sunnier than many other places in winter too. Avodi using a car there, there are frequent buese on the main trunk lines, 800 and 801, about every 3 to 5 minutes. The rest are so-so. With the dressing of snow, or better yet a now fall of large flakes, its a fairy tale city, like off a Christmas card. Great restaurant choices too, but not cheap. Even if you don't naturally speak French, give it a try, you may have to use a little Collins gem Engoiish-French pocket dictionary, but that makes it fun. If you try to speak French, they will try to speak English, believe me. Some of the people who are down on the Quebecers are to say the least, inflexible. If you haven't seen this city, you're missing out on one of North America's gems, even the United Nations recognizes it as a world heritage city.
