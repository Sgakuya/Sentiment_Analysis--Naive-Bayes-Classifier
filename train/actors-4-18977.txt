Anyone who downgrades this guy because of his political beliefs just doesn't get it. The man's a professional provocateur, and very, very good at it. Just read the posts here and you'll see that he really knows how to push the buttons on these idiots. Roger Me was a classic, and Bowling For Columbine, although not quite as good, was far better than the vast majority of dreck that gets bankrolled these days. Furthermore, the President is not only an imbecile, but he's also a very reckless saber-rattler who's compromised the security of the entire free world as a result of his religious crusade/oilfield grab/faux war on terrorism. So, Moore was totally on target about that war criminal sitting in the Oval Office. I rate Moore a 4-star predicated solely on his talent and achievement, not on his politics.
