With the most amazing graphics of this generation, the Nintendo GameCube should be the king of video games now. The controller, with innovative analog shoulder buttons and a perfect layout that includes two analog control sticks is one of the best controllers ever. The system itself looks great and the nifty handle is just another great Nintendo touch. The small discs keep load times down and hold three times more than your average Playstation game. Nintendo's first-party efforts for the GameCube have been quite amazing. Super Smash Brothers Melee is, quite possibly, the best game of all time and easily the best fighting game ever. Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door destroys the Final Fantasy series and easily qualifies for best RPG ever. Mario Sports and Mario Party continue with great graphics and improved features. We're also going to see a new StarFox space combat game! And, now, we've got Sega on our side with the awesome Sonic Mega Collection and the jaw-dropping Sonic Heroes. Also, Sega has brought greats like Beach Spikers: Virtua Beach Volleyball and Crazy Taxi over to what I call the 'Cool Cube' as well. And, we can't forget the charming Super Monkey Ball series and the coolest-commentary-crew on NFL2K3. Also, Crash and Spyro have joined Mario's side. More exciting games are coming, thanks to Nintendo's brilliant plan to maintain support even after it's next console (The goosebump-causing 'Revolution'). So, don't be a square...get cubed!
