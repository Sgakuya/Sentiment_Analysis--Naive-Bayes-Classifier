I am a teenage girl, but I am not a teeny-bopper, NSYNC-loving, Britney-wannabe like the majority of teenage girls. That is why I love shopping at Hot Topic so much...it sells clothes for those people who like to be different and unique. They offer a lot of punk and gothic clothing, which I think is terrific because before Hot Topic there were no big gothic/punk clothing retailers around, and you either had to resort to buying clothing that didn't suit your style, or you had to find a hole-in-the-wall store in your area that sells punk/gothic clothes, which was really inconvenient. I visit Hot Topic weekly. It is a place where I can converse with other people that like the same things I do. It is a place where I am not gawked at because I wear spikes and have piercings. I feel comfortable in there. The only thing that is bad about Hot Topic is their prices...they are way too expensive. But I love the fashion, the band merchandise they sell, and i love the punk accessories...it's a perfect place to find clothes for the rebel in all of us.
