Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is arguably the best Rockstar game. The graphics are nice (but not perfect), the design of the game is just about perfect, the 80's music is good in its realism, the storyline actually makes some sense and the side missions are cool and follow-on. I especially like the Pole Position club (you know why) and the real weaponry adds realism to Vice City. You can also fly helicopters, sometimes with guns blazing. The best part about Vice City though, is its depth and variety (in several ways). There is nothing truly bad about Vice City, although its graphics can be noticeably glitchy and do sometimes disrupt missions. Other than that though, its the best...Rockstar..game..ever.
