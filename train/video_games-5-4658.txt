It all began with a Namco employee, a dream, and a missing slice from a whole pizza. Shortly after that day in history, the creation of the Pac Man video game was underway. Many months later, the game was released in Japan under the name Puck Man (Puck means eat). When Midway was about to release the game in the States, some folks thought of possible vandalism of the arcade cabinets, such as changing the P in Puck to F. With that possibility in mind, Puck-Man became Pac Man. Finally, in the year 1980, Pac Man was released in the western world. It didn't take to long for Pac Man Fever (also the name of a song) to spread to millions addictive to the dot eating, fruit munching, ghost chewing, power pellet propelling creature known as Pac Man. Many, many sequels were released over the pass 25 years since the original game was released, but most of them just don't compare to the original game. During the past quarter century of Pac Mania many folks discovered the almost secret workings of the game, such as the patterns the ghost take in the first 20 levels, and the once biggest secret of all, the Final Level. Thats right, there is actually a final level to Pac Man, but you have to be one brave, strong, addictive player to go on for possibly many hours in one game. Today, Pac Man Fever is not as strong as it once was in the 1980s, but many folks are still fascinated by the games inner secrets and attempts at tying the all-time unbreakable record of a high score. Who knows what the former pizza with missing slice turned Puck Man has in store for society for the next 25 years of Pac Mania?
