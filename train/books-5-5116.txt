I know this isn't a unique experience, but The Fountainhead hit me like a Mike Tyson roundhouse. I first read it my freshman year of college, and I couldn't believe how well Rand articulated ideas and concepts that were only vague impressions in my head. I felt like I was reading the truth, and I couldn't put the book down. I devoured it. And as soon as I put down The Fountainhead I tore through Atlas Shrugged and We the Living. But, like all phases, my infatuation with Rand passed. While I believe she is an important thinker with an original voice and a lot of great arguments, I also think she's missing a very fundamental part of the picture. If you're going through an Ayn Rand phase yourself, I'd recommend that you balance things out by reading something less rigid - something that acknowledges larger mysteries in life - maybe an introduction to Eastern religion or something by Carl Jung or Joseph Campbell. Rand is on to something, but she's not on to everything.
