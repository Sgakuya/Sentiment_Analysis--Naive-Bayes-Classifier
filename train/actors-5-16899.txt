I've only been an AMC fan for about 6 months but I have to say I was completely drawn in by the Divine Goddess of Lahv! She has to be one of the most incredible actresses I've seen on a soap. She seems very real compared to some of the other drama queens and divas you see on TV. The chemistry between Olga and Eden is amazing! Not to mention that doing a storyline that has attracted so much media attention is really putting yourself out there as an actress. I praise them both but I bow down to the Polish Princess. And how about those accents! Has anyone ever heard her British accent? How beautiful is that! She's my idol! Come on people...lets get Olga into the top 20 at least!!!!
