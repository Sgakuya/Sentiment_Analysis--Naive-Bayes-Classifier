One of the great aw-shucks actors of Hollywood's Golden Era, a pioneer of the talkies who's shelf life extended past the decline and disapearance of the studio system, a most adept performer who handled both comic and dramatic roles with aplomb. The first 25 years of this guy's career were marked by one fine performance after another, but the last ten years were marked by a reduced number of meaty roles. Did a fine job in Ball of Fire, the Capra films, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and High Noon, and his work in dozens of other less notable films was routinely professional and convincing. He could be a tad wooden, especially later in his career, and was somewhat limited in the type of roles for which he was suited, but this was fairly typical of studio era when performers were more stars than they were actors. For the most part, however, Cooper deserved the reputation and status he deserved.
