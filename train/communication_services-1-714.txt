I have a year left on my contract and count the days till i can dump this decietful company.If you don't have sprint don't get it.If you do get out as fast as you can. To be fair the coverage and hardware are great.But the csr's are the worst (possibly on the face of the planet). I don't know why they haven't been investigated to the fullest extent possible.I would urge anyone who has had problems to use the fcc complaint system,write your attorney general,congress,etc , any media that would dare to find out how bad they really are.I constantly hear stories of people being overcharged and lied to.I estimate that in the first year i was probably overcharged $200 and fought with csr's to get multiple $1000's in charges removed,and spent probably 100 hours phone time,and several days travel time +expense to resovle problems caused by csr's . I would encourage everyone who has had problems to speak out,seriously an average person,or bussiness would probably end up in jail if they implimented the same sort of practices.
