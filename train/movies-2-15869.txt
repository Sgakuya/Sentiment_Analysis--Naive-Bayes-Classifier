The movie began with sinister music, and throughout its duration it made it appear that Nixon himself was, on all occasions, unstable, paranoid and haunted by his childhood. At one point in the movie, he even sees a vision of his dead mother and cries out in despair. The presentation of his strained marriage relationship with Pat was ridiculous. She is supposed to have threatened to divorce him on the night he lost the Calif. governor's race in 1962. For the truth, read Pat Nixon, by Julie Eisenhower. She goes into great detail about Pat's warm and supportive response to her husband that night, including her bravo reaction when Nixon complained to the Press afterwards. Even Nixon's enemies have admitted (except for a few like Oliver Stone) that Dick & Pat Nixon were extremely close and in love with each other until separated by death. The movie also implies that his speeches were eruptive and full of bravado. Wrong - Nixon was known as the only president who came across as an introvert in his speeches. He was almost too measured, very unexciting. Trust me, because I'm old enough to remember him very well. Stone gives Nixon an advisor who is an overt racist - then Nixon threatens to blackmail that same advisor by setting the IRS on him. Does anyone seriously believe something like that? Lastly, Stone had the Watergate burglars doing NOTHING without Nixon's prior permission. This is fatuous nonsense. There was one scene that started out good, about the famous incident where he surprised some demonstrators late at night at the Lincoln Memorial. This really did take place. But then even that scene began departing from reality. I don't know what Mr. Stone's problem is, but he shouldn't have had to resort to out & out lying in order to criticize Nixon. I'll be generous and give the movie two stars, just because I've seen others that were worse.
