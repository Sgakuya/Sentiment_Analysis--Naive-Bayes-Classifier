The G35 has exceeded all of my expectations in a car. Granted, it does have some first year troubles (minor rattles and squeaks), but it has been relatively trouble free for the 16,000 miles that I have owned it. The performance of this car is amazing. The only other car that I can compare it to is a 1991 Porsche 911 Turbo. They both have the same handling 'feel'. They feel like they are on rails. The G35 is a little low on power in comparison, but is still relatively quick in its own respects. With all the other choices out there in the same category (BMW 330ci, Acura TL Type-S, Lexus IS300, etc) I feel the Infiniti takes the best of all these cars and puts them into one. The performance and handling of the 330ci (minus about $5000) and the IS300, the ride comfort and build quality of the Acura, and then added a little of their own flair with a beautiful exterior that no other car can rival (except a few Ferrari's). If I had to do it all over again, I would, without a doubt, purchase a G35 coupe once again. The only thing that I would change is getting the Navigation system!!
