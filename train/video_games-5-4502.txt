This game will keep you up 'till 1 in the morning playing. It's even better if you have access to the internet. You'll find 100's of fan pages with add-ons to make the game even MORE intresting and diverse(anything from skins, new objects, wallpaper and carpeting)! That's what i like about this game, there's so diffrent things to make your sims do, and so many diffrent ways to build houses- if your creative enough this game will keep you playing. The expansion pack is good, offering 5 diffrent neighborhoods insted of the orginal 1 in the game. If you never buy another game in your life buy this one and kill some time playing it.
