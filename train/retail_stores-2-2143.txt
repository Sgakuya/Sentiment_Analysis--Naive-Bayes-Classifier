I never really had much use for this store, so therefore I rarely go there. I do like their phones however. Also, reading some of the reviews about Radio Shack, it appears they are not nice to employees, and that so many of their customers are rude, angry, and argumentive. Sounds like any public business to me, lol ! If you are going to work with the public, just get used to it, there will always be some whiny ass know-it-all who thinks they can treat you like crap because alot of people think that if you work in a public service job such as retail, fast food, etc that you are automatically low class for taking such a job. But on the other hand, there will always be those few customers that are really sweet and nice and will always treat you decent if you treat them with respect. As for the customers that treat you like crap for no reason, there is such a thing as karma...what comes around, goes around...believe that...
