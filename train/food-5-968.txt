This is the king of the adult cereals, but don't expect kids to try it until they're at least 17 (the blends of taste and texture are too much for them, as they're anticipating the sugar high they get half-way through the multi-colored stuff). Originally marketed as having 19 vitamins and minerals (counting sodium, potassium, and protein), this Kellogg's mainstay has a munchy corn, oat, and wheat flour flake that remains crunchy to the last spoonful (something I can't say for Wheaties, Total, or Special K). YOU control the sweetening factor, which is why so many parents should start weening their offspring towards these choices ASAP (although most teenagers tire of the crass marketing and starchy sameness of kiddie fare and make the conscious choice to go with something more mature). Rumors abound as to this cereal's demise, but I hope it never happens (as the Battle Creek dinks would create a lifelong Cheerios buyer in me).
