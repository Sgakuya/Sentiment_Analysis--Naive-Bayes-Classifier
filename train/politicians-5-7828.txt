TR was a principled leader, something we don't see anymore among politicans. His foreign policy (speak softly and carry a big stick) defined our position towards tyrannical governments for the past 100 years. No other president has used coercive diplomacy like he did. It no doubt came from his rough and ready attitude that he acquired during his stint in the military, remember his courageous drive up San Juan Hill in the heat of the Spanish-American War? We would not be a world power if it were not for his strong leadership during a period of intense growth in American history. T.R. was not at all a hawk, he brokered a peace agreement between Russia and Japan after their war in 1905 which ultimately won him the Nobel Peace Prize. He was a warrior, but he was also a peacemaker as well. His involvment in that region also strengthened our position in the Pacific Rim. People complained then that he was an excessively activist president. I think not, the country was changing and T.R. was the right president for the times. He kept the monopolistic trusts in check which at the time was a threat to the free market system that our country was founded upon. When a company dominates one sector, it has the ability to set prices and therefore be able to gauge the public. Innovation is stunted because of a lack of competition and most of all, corporations are not held accountable by the consumer and the workers most of the time worked in sub-standard conditions. Teddy Roosevelt was a revolutionary president for his times. There were no pretenses with him, he always did what he thought was right, and T.R. was right an awful lot.
