A vastly misunderstood state when viewed from many parts of the country. Much to do in Boston- a wonderfully elegant and gracious city- with a long and storied history. Great shopping, museums, art, theatre and eating! The rest of the state has much to offer- Look toward Rockport or Newburyport- peaceful and charming. Western Mass has Stockbridge, (home of Norman Rockwell) Lennox- and Brimfield. In Boston-Drive over the Charles river to Cambridge and Harvard- cannot be beat for for culture. There is also MIT for all you geeks. There are fine hills and mountains in the Berkshires (western part of the state) and lots of coastline. I love Northampton- and of course Plymouth (Plymouth Rock and Plimoth Plantation. Drive route 6 from the Bourne bridge on Cape Cod- to Provincetown- see Marconi Point and the National Seashore- and onto Provincetown- quirky and crazy but lots of fun,with art, people watching and great food (the fried whole bellied clams are the best) The bay state has a high quality of life that many states would envy- and a well educated informed populace that is warm and sincere. The Bay state is the spirit of America. Enjoy this great state- and last but not least my beloved Red Sox are world champs!
