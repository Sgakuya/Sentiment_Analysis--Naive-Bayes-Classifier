Truly beautiful place. Peaceful, quiet, unpretentious, clean. The scenery is magnificent. The people are friendly, progessive, non-consumerist and anti-development, which are very positive virtues. Burlington is one of the most appealing cities in America, Brattleboro is a funky and fun little berg, Bennington is a flinty, but quaint little town that has a feel that's more like upstate New York, little wonder. Rutland has a gritty feel, too, and the capitol towns of Montpelier and Barre typify New England living. Some very good colleges here. Proximate to Quebec, which is another interesting and appealing piece of the turf. The only knock on Vermont is that real estate is a bit high, and career opportunities are lacking: the name of the game is to make your $$$ elsewhere, buy your house for cash, and settle into a less glitzy lifestyle. Heaven on Earth, indeed.
