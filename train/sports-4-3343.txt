Rather overrated.. he didn't draw many walks.. probably no better than Al Kaline..Alright look: Clemente: .317 Avg .359 OBA .475 SLG Kaline: .297 Avg .376 OBA .480 SLG Clemente has the advantage in Batting Average by 20 points, and Triples by about 90. Kaline leads in EVERYTHING else. Homeruns by 150, Stolen bases by 50, Walks by 650! Clemente was probably a better fielder, but not enough to overcome all the other advantages Kaline had.. I think Clemente was a great player.. but Kaline was too, and you don't hear poeple talking about him in the top 5 of all time. What other top 5, or hell, top 20 player had a .359 OBA and .475 SLG? Get real.
