Claude Rains was a phenomenal actor and one of my all time favorites. No matter how big or small the part, he could dominant the screen. He was magnetic, electrifying, charismatic, suave, intelligent and commanded your attention, he rarely gave a bad performance. Rains established himself as a character actor, playing a variety of roles and was most adapt at playing distinquished villians. The Academy nominated Rains four times for Best Supporting Actor but never awarded this marvelous actor with the award. He was also the first actor to ask for one million dollars for a film and to receive it. Some of his films include an impressive performance as the phantom in The Phantom of the Opera, Louis Renault,the suave precipt police captain in Casablanca, Dr Jaquith in Now Voyager, the wise and enduring Mr Jordan in Here Comes Mr Jordan, the sinister Alexander Sebastin in Notorious,and as James Stewart's nemisis in Mr Smith Goes to Washington(one of his best performance next to Casablanca) These are just a few of Claude Rains roles. Claude Rains rarely disappoints, he is that good.
