One of the best pieces of serious science fiction I have seen. Unfortunatly, this movie is quite long, and some of its scenes are a bit tedious. Because of this, the movie does tend to stagnate in places, and keeps a second viewing from being as entertaining as the first. The first time one sees the film though, one cannot help but find the entire movie quite powerful and engaging. I haven't seen better. The characters are very well developed, and the scientific prinicples used in the film are real. The actors protray their characters almost flawlessly, and even James Woods brings off his character well. The use of Bill Clinton in the film was unnecessary, and some of the special effects used to insert him don't hold well, but the viewer is intrigued by the characters, and is left to ponder his own conclusions about extra terrestial life. A great movie for any fan of Sagen, and all people who like serious and believable science fiction.
