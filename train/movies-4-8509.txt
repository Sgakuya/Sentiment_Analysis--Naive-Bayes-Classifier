For anyone who has been a teen ager, or an overgrown child, will understand this movie if you've worked in one of the following; record store, video store, ART STORE (the worst especially in Irvine), or comic book store... not so much a liquor store even though that's where the movie's based. This story reminds me of many ridiculous people I've known in life. It is surprising sometimes how many goofballs actually occupy this planet, at times you question wether the number system even goes that high. This story touches a lot of sensitive points hidden under the tumultuous comedy of Kevin Smith. For instance, so what if this girl has orally copulated thirty-seven guys, do you think this loser would be fine with that if he had oral sex with thirty-eight women? Because that's what his problem really was. Not the fact that she has had sex with so many guys, but the fact that she has had more partners than he. I think, and this is coming from a heterosexual man, that most women in this new millenium era 'will' have more sex partners then men, and women will probably have more female sex partners then men as well. Men of today need to put their ego in proper gear and accept this. For me I like sleeping with gay women, they're more daring and yet understanding. All they seem to require from me is understanding in return. The type of understanding that they are looking for from me is to respect their self standing, as they respect mine. It is a shared world for everyone, and this movie has a rough way of explaining that. Clerks is a classic, read Kevin Smiths Dare Devil comics the stories are fascinating.
