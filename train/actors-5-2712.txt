Okay, I've posted about him before, but I have just got to add a few more things. Every great movie I see - he is in it. I can't get enough of this man. He makes my mind fly! He has got to be THE greatest actor of all time. I love that when he is acting he leaves his ego at the door. He absolutely becomes every character he is portraying. There isn't an ounce of KS in the character's movements, mannerisms, or even the way they move the hair out of their face. He is what every other actor should strive to be - TALENTED. I could probably write a book about every one of his performances. I also like that he doesn't limit himself to commercial movies (Brad Pitt/Tom Cruise) and he steps outside of the box. I hope he has a long and successful career. He definitely deseverves more than two Oscars. As a screenwriter I am grateful for Triggerstreet. If we ever meet in Hollywood I will definitely try to seduce him. MEOW
