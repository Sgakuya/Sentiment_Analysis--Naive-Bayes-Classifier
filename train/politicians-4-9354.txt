Although he failed to win re-election, the Administration of Benjamin Harrison proved to function efficiently during his tenure in office. Several key pieces of legislation which were passed with his backing were landmark bills to say the least. However, Harrison's Presidency and his economic decisions directly contributed to the economic callapse of 1893. [1. Leadership: **** out of *****] Benjamin Harrison proved to be the greatest leader since Lincoln. Few presidents between 1865 and 1900 stood on firmer ground or tried to accomplish more. His economic leadership was ill-fated, but that's for another category. As President, Harrison was a great visionary who actively pursued all of his aspirations. He was one of the few Presidents in this era who used his executive authority to improve the lot of African Americans. Two landmark bills, although failing in Congress and costing him support in the South, proved his dedication to civil rights. These two bills were focused on ensuring the right of African Americans to vote. The Force Bill attempted to establish federal supervision of congressional elections as a way of preventing the disfranchisement of southern blacks. The Blair Education Bill advocated the use of federal aid for education to hamper southern whites from employing literacy tests to prevent blacks from voting. These two bills failed in the Congress, but Harrison campaigned vigorously for them. Harrison also successfully campaigned for the Land Revision act of 1891. This act created the nation's first National Forest at Yellowstone, and inspired later President Theodore Roosevelt to pursue an active conservation agenda. In foriegn policy, Harrison proved just as aggressive. On several occasions, he demonstrated that he was willing to go to war when American interests were at stakes. He took the nation to the brink of war with Chile after an incident involving harm done to U.S. sailors there. In the end, due to Harrison's boldness, Chile apologized and paid the U.S. $75,000. Harrison also unsuccessfully campaigned heavily for the annexation of the Hawaiin Islands. Harrison also set the stage for future Presidents by campaigning for and endorsing the Sherman Anti Trust Act which called for regulation of huge business monopolies. Although the bill proved ineffective, it did inspire future Presidents to take similar actions against big business monopolies. In the final analysis, Harrison, by actions rather than words, proved to be the best leader since Abraham Lincoln. [2. Foreign Affairs: **** out of ***** Stars] Harrison pursued the most active foreign agenda policy since Lincoln. As mentioned before, he took the nation to the brink of war with Chile, which resulted in $75,000 directly into the treasury. Although failing to achieve his goal, he campaigned heavily for the annexation of Hawaii. He also campaigned heavily for federal funding for the construction of a canal in Central America, which he was unable to achieve. He boldly negotiated the establishment of a protectorate over the Samoan Islands with Germany and Great Britain. Harrison also organized the first modern Pan-American Conference in 1889 to promote goodwill among American nations. Harrison's actions as President in foreign affairs inspired Teddy Roosevelt's big stick policy and set the nation on the road to empire. [3. Economic Management: ** out of ***** Stars] Unfortunately, Harrison was unable to see through things in the economy. He unwisely supported and signed the McKinley Tariff Act, which raised rates 48%. This was directly responsible for the economic collapse in 1893 when Harrison left office. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act which was basically a ploy to gather western support for the McKinley Tariff stipulated that U.S. mint would be derived mainly from silver rather than gold. Thus, the gold production decreased, and silver production increased. Despite his flaws on the domestic front, Harrison pursued an active trade agenda, signing agreement after agreement with nations which greatly increased America's imports and exports. His vigorous trade policies set the pattern for trade in the 20th century. [4. Vision For The Country/Accomplishments: **** out of ***** Stars] As I mentioned earlier, Harrison was probably the most active President since Lincoln. He had clear ideas of where he wanted to take the country, and although he was unable to achieve those goals, his actions set America on the course in which those goals would eventually be achieved: The annexation of Hawaii; Civil Rights; Conservation; and the Panama Canal. [Final Score: 3.5- **** out of ***** Stars] In the final analysis, it can be debated that the true transition into the 20th century began with Benjamin Harrison, who arguably inspired William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt and set the nation on the road to empire.
