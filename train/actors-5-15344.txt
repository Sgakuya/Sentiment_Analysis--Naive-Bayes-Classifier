I have been in love with Kristy McNichol since 1976, when I first saw her face in the picture on the mantle during the opening credits of the tv show FAMILY. It was one of the shows I watched religiously, even though the plots were dumb and predictable. I wish I had had a VCR back then to tape her appearences on shows like STARSKEY AND HUTCH (where she played a run-away on at least two different episodes) and LOVE BOAT. She also starred in several televison movies. My personal favorite is THE SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER where she plays a midwestern girl during World War Two who falls in love with an escaped German POW. Brilliant acting. She has also made several Hollywood flicks, including THE END with Burt Reynolds. My personal favorite Kristy McNichol movie is the rarely seen WHITE DOG, abouta dog that is trained to hate and kill black people. She gives a trully remarkable preformance as the dogs new owner, and tries to reform the dog. She made the totally insipid and otherwise unwatchable PIRATE MOVIE a joy to behold. Multitalented, she also released a record with her brother Jimmy. She is without a doubt the most underated talent of the 1970's and 80's. Due to a strange sequence of events, I have never seen the movie she is most remembered for, LITTLE DARLINGS featuring Tatum O'Neill. Whenever the opprotunity to see this movie comes up, something always prevents me from seeing it. Really strange, but true. I will always have a special place in my heart for Miss McNichol, and in this one case, I am proud to call myself a Kristy-ian!!
