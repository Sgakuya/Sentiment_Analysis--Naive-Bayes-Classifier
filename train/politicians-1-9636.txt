True story about LBJ......While running for congress in his home state of Texas in 1947, he devised a scheme to humiliate his opponent. He was to have his campaign henchman leak a made-up story in the local rag about his opponents fetish for farm animals(Boy, talk about your October suprises!). When his campaign manager confronted him with this awful intention, he said to LBJ, We can't do this. You know it's not true. To which LBJ replied, Yea, but let's make the bastard HAVE to deny it!....... In the history of the blood sport known as politics there has never been a more ruthless and coniving individual like Lyndon Baines Johnson...I admire that trait... It was just the OTHER stuff that bothered me. He possesed the defective gene that made him second only to FDR and Bush as being one the most twisted thieving warmongoring blood lusting vestibules of a human being that has ever scarred the office of the Presidency......Oh, plus he killed JFK....Bye now!
