As a director, Spike is overrated and hasnt done a good movie in years. His best movies were his early ones where he was taking on subjects that hadnt been addressed head-on in Hollywood for African-Americans in films. It's been downhill after that. Spike's larger contribution has been the movies that have been vehicles for dozens of actors and actresses that were not getting work before he came about: Think about who as been in his movies and it's remarkable: Denzel Washington, Samual L. Jackson, Halle Berry, Wesley Snipes,John Turturro, Danny Aeillo, Laurence Fishburne, Jasmine Guy, Rosario Dawson, Giancarlo Esposito, Tommy Davidson, Jada Pinkett Smith,and many many more we've seen and know. He's also been a pioneer in leading the way for many African-American directors to develop and direct movies and tell their stories. The spin off effect has been Hollywood recognizing African-Americans talents and the power a Black audience can have in the Box Office.
