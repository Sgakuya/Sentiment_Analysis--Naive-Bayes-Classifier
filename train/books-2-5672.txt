I was perplexed after reading Waiting, and I have no idea why it won the National Book Award. Overall, the writing was not great, and in many ways it was awful. The dialogue, for example, was stilted and awkward. People don't talk like that in real life! Every once in a while Ha Jin threw in a big vocabulary word that seemed out of place, which I found incredibly annoying. Second, the book is touted as a love story, and it has absolutely nothing to do with love. The story is about a self-centered, passive, weak man who strings along a mistress for years while he tries to divorce his old-fashioned wife. The only love he demonstrates is a love of himself. If that's not bad enough, the plot moves at a snail's pace. In fact, Waiting is exactly what I found myself doing throughout the book- waiting to turn the last page! It was an excruciatingly long wait. The only thing I did appreciate about the book was getting a glimpse into Chinese society (assuming it was an accurate portrayal). Two thumbs down!
