As an employee of this division of The Limited, Intimate Brands, I feel that the prices fit what the clients are paying for in many cases. There are high priced items such as our current $350, but it is hand embroidered with silk and made outside of the USA. There are alot of great deals such as the five for $19.50 cotton panties. I am tired of clients returning items, which they have worn stating that it did not last. This is because the care instructions for the garment are not being followed. All of our bras must be handwashed or put in a ligerie bag on gentle cycle. I believe that Victoria's Secret is a great store with quality items.
