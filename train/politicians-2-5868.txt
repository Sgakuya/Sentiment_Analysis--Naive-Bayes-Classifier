I am from PA and will give him a 2 based on a few of the initiatives that he has voted for. That being said, I believe that he is a narrow-minded far-right wing person that uses religion as a weapon. There was/is a reason that our founding fathers wanted to keep a seperation of church and state. That reason was to discourage the religious fanatics from forcing their will and beliefs upon the rest of us and basically destroying democracy as we know it. A democracy is based on the principal that we not be persecuted for what we believe as long as it is legal in the eyes of the law, not God. Just about every state has a law that disallows persecution because of sexual orientation which makes his remark ignorant as well as incorrect. It is this type of belief that religion should guide us in politics and as a nation that also guides groups like the Taliban and Al Qaeda.It is also the reason that we developed this great country in the first place...to escape religious persecution.
