This decent man, who reluctantly raised arms against those whom he duly admired and was subsequently made leader of the Continental Army in an ultimately winning cause, would have rated a 5 were it not for the fact that he owned slaves (who were given their freedom after the war, I believe). I don't know if I would rate him as the father of our country --I would be more inclined to bestow that title upon James Madison or Thomas Jefferson. I think that Washington was in the right place at the right time, and while it is certainly important to bestow upon him his proper place in United States' history, let us remember he was a human being who was like many white, Southern men of his time who happened to occupy a privileged place in the social strata of Virginian gentleman (not women---men) based upon his father's family being connected with the House of Burgesses. Washington is a great man in American history and should be remembered as an outstanding figure in the fledgling years of the Republic.
