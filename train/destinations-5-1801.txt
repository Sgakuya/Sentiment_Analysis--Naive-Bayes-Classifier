I'm sorry to see all this political animosity. Truth be told I've met people from abroad who bitch about their own homeland polictics to the same degree. Why must people be so cynical? Yes the US also has a reputation for religious fanatisism but there seem to be some very disturbing comments below knocking Jews and how the whole country should be catholic that came from overseas. The proof is right here on this website how biggoted the world can be. Truth is no matter where we are, we are at the mercy of our governments no matter how much we agree or disagree. I'd like to hear some feedback from people abroad about how wonderful their government is and how they are living in political bliss. Anyone out there? I seriously doubt it. Now I'm not very happy with the political position America is in currently but I'm not worried either because I know this country always perseveres. There are many reasons to be proud to be an American. You can choose to live in any climate, any landscape, practice any religion, you can be conservative or liberal or in the middle which I find the vast majority of Americans are in the middle and the extremes on both sides seem to stick out in the media like those talking heads you see on CNN during election years. I grew up in Boston then up and left for the west coast to Seattle to start a new life and indeed I did start a new. At free will I roamed across the continent, no questions asked. I can't think of any other country that offers the diversity and such a wide array of choices for new oppurtunities in life than the United States.
