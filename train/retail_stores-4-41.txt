Fairly good place to shop; it's certainly got a decent selection of books and magazines (I can't attest for the music selection, all I know is that they have a selection). People literally hang out there ALL DAY (trust me, my fiance' used to work there and I would visit him only to see the same people on the couches day in, day out. They come in upon opening, leave either midday or some even after five! It's just not healthy.); they've got food, drink, and books, what else do you need? For the cafe', if you're on a diet, DON'T order anything at the cafe'--the caloric content of the desserts there is unbelievable, but if you don't mind that, then it might be worth an indulgence. And, for employment, I know quite a few people that work at the local B N, and perhaps it's just that one store, but everyone seems to hate working there.
