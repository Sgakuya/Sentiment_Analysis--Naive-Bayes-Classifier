Twice, in 1985, I spent a day there for some R&R while stationed on a ship in Gaeta. I recall the following things: - On the train ride to Rome, I met two beautiful Italian college girls who lived in Latina, but went to school in Rome. Their English (and my Itlian) were adequate enough to have an interesting conversation. One of the girls was reading an excerpt from my copy of Ian Fleming's Casino Royale that I took along to read. She sounded quite sensual reading about the scene where Bond is in the car with 2 thugs and sweet Vesper Lynd. We spent 15 minutes trying to comprehend the Itlian translation for "outskirts" (though I was thinking more about "in-skirts.") - Rome is not a clean town (but cleaner than Naples). And it has a fairly large contingent of foreigners (e.g., Africans, Arabs, Orientals). - Some of the best Chinese food I ever had was in Rome. I think I was so tired of Italian food, that the Chinese was such a refreshing change of pace. - The only site of interest I had a chance to see (I did not have a car) was the Coloseum. It was about the same size as Philadelphia Veteran's Stadium (and about the same condition). - The nightlife was fair. I was in a part of town near the University and there were some good looking British Girls at one bar. I also hung out with a couple of Greek girls who sponged me for some drinks and smokes, then walked out. The best proposition I got that night was from an old and rich Italian Dude from Milano (Sorry Signorno, No Brokeback Mountain stuff for me). - The hotel did not have a bathtub. You had a shower head and the water went all over the bathroom floor. The floor was sloped for rapid drainage. It doesn't work that well because I got everything wet. - I took a whole bunch of pictures. But my camera did not have any film in it.
