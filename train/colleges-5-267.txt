I am enrolled in the MBA program and it is an amazing program. The instructors bring real world experience to the table. I work approx. 20-30 hours per week on homework and it is very beneficial. This University is cutting edge and give you what most schools do not and that is real life experience. Working in teams really makes you function like you would in a work place with delegation and with dealing with a wide variety of personalities. The simulations that are given are great as well and give you real life situations that you would face in the workplace. I think this school prepares students for real life work situations and gives you all the means to learn how to apply what you learn. It's also a great way to learn from other students. Everyone comes with different experience to the table and it is so interesting to get everyones perspective on topics. The students in my classes are business owners, accountants, architects, and engineers. These are highly educated classmates!!! This is unlike any other university. For those who rate it poorly, you don't know what youre missing! It's a great education and experience.
