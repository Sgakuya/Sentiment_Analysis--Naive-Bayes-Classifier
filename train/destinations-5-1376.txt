a lovely little country. The people there were suprised to see american tourists, it seemed. The country definitely has it's french influence, but Luxembourg has a vibe all it's own. The new modern downtown area is bustling with the traffic of everyday business. While the old town area is much quieter and peaceful. The old town looks like a bavarian fairytale setting. Big, lofty brick buildings decorate the walls of the strategic valley like layout of the city. It's like a huge park, with hidden stairways and numerous fountains. The food scene was rough for a vegetarian, but I got by. The people were very pleasant, and the weather that July was superb. Check this place out, it's truly beautiful.
