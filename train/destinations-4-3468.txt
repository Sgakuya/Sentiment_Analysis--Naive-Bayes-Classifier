One of my favorite cities and I am so surprised that it is not higher on the list. As a loyal lover of history, Boston is like a haven for me. Three notable Presidents were born in this area, JFK, John Quincey Adams and John Adams, and its really interesting to visit historical sites in their memory. I have yet to visit the JFK Presidential Library- but plan to on my next visit. A lot of museums to visit, good places to eat, and a lot of recreational centers, most notably the Fleet Center. Minus a star for a whole bunch of snobby rude people (not all, but most), and a bad highway system at least for the time being.
