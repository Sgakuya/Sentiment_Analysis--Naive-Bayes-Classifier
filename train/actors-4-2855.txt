I am waiting to see more and more of him. I found myself looking for his scenes more than Russell Crowe's in Gladiator. I was thoroughly surprised even though I enjoyed him in To Die For. After watching Gladiator where he struggled with his demons so damn well, I rented Clay Pigeons and Buffalo Soldiers just to see him in other roles and was not the least bit disappointed. But one of my truly favorite roles to see him in is a movie that I accidentally stumbled across and was not aware he was in...U-Turn. He has a small role but I went crazy for it. Maybe I am being ridiculous, but when he throws his hand up and starts his speech with a stuttering, "Now, now, now.." I literally fall out.
