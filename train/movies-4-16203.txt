I enjoyed Lost in Translation, and I bet many people could relate in some way to the storyline. Basically, the movie is about two people (an older guy and a younger woman, both married) who meet in an upscale Tokyo hotel and strike up a strange friendship fueled by jet lag and a lack of direction in life. Bill Murray's performance as the older man was the best I've seen of him, and Scarlett Johansson was strong enough to play opposite Murray in a believable way. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that I was pleased it wasn't the predictable conclusion I expected. Lost in Translation is worth a trip to the theater.
