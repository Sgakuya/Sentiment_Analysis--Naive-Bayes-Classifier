Good stuff. Never dropped a call, never had a problem with billing, customer service bends over backwards to help and would probably massage my balls if I asked them nicely, and the two-way radio is the shizzle. My fiance and I save so much time using the radio, plus it is STILL the coolest thing going to flip open the phone and pretend you're an FBI agent going in on a sting. I had an i1000 that wouldn't die- washed it with my clothes, dropped it out of a car moving 25+ mph, set it on fire with gasoline and..ok, I made that last thing up. It was tough, though. My new i60 is a little more fragile, a little delicate, not as sturdy as my manly, testosterone-charged i1000, but works fine. Nextel has always taken good care of me and I've been with them for over a year now. I live in mid-coastal New Hampshire and travel 200+ miles North or South of Portsmouth on a monthly basis, and the service still rocks my balls. Can't complain. Highest recommendation. Sprint PCS can lick my gank.
