I thought that this movie, while not the best I've seen from both Helen Hunt or Mel Gibson, was overall good and had some funny and memoriable scenes. Gibson and Hunt have a great chemistry together. It was hilarious watching Mel Gibson try on all of his products . And let's not forget about the scene where he is having sex with the cafe' worker. You were more inside me than anyone. .... Thanks doll, I try . LOL. And then when she confronts him after he did not call her: Come on, you're totally and completely gay. This film was funny from start to end, and was clever with a great cast. I'd reccomend it to anyone who enjoyed As Good As It Gets .
