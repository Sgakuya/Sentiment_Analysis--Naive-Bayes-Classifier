Wow, did this movie surprise me! I saw this in a theater with my friend, all prepared for a stupid film that we could make fun of. But it seems that the creators WANTED us to make fun of it. The puppeteering was actually really good, although it has scenes where it looks stupid, but they do it on purpose. I love how the movie would appeal to smart and dumb people alike. And of course, in typical South Park fashion, it turns into a satire making fun of political events and hollywood actors and the world around them. Hell, the Soundtrack of the movie is worth going to see. Try not to think of this as a serious film (practically impossible to do) and you'll be fine. Go see it and have fun!
