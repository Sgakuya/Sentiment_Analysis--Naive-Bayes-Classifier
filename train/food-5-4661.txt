This varies for me. First of all, I only like two major brands. My first and only choice was once Michigan brand (small curd, 4% milk fat). I still like it but it tends to vary in taste these days for some odd reason so it s hit or miss with them. Then a few years ago I discovered Breakstone brand. This one is just as tasty as Michigan (small curd 4% milk fat). The low fat in either brand is obviously better for you but it lacks taste for me in a big way so I buy the 4% and eat smaller amounts of it. Since childhood I have learned to avoid the store generic brands, (large curd and very loose looking) at all costs. They are usually extremely tasteless, bland and the soupy texture is unpleasant. If this had been the only cottage cheese I had ever had I know I would be rating this a 1 rather than a 5. Compared to the two top brands I mentioned it doesn t even seem like the same food.
