Gorgeous campus, wonderful academics, friendly faculty and staff, and a fairly close-knit community relative to most universities. While Williamsburg is far from an urban setting, it is ideal for college life--especially with such a difficult grading system. All in all, the location of the College at the corner of historic colonial Williamsburg provides for a very peaceful and surreal educational experience unlike any other this side of the atlantic. I'd like to add that the 2nd highest suicide rate comment is far from the truth, as a number of well-documented studies suggest that suicide rate at W M is roughly 1/4 that of other major universities.
