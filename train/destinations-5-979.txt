Yes, the Brits have bad teeth. And they whine a lot. But if you can get over that, and the weather, it's a lovely place to visit, and in some ways nicer to live than the US. For one thing, there's far less violence and poverty than in the USA. It's small enough that everything is accessible, and there's a zillion cultural attractions. Devon and Cornwall, in the far southwest, are especially nice; since they've experienced less migration and economic development than the rest of England, the culture is still pretty traditional. Outside Exeter (the only really big city in the region) it's like going back into medieval times (except the farmers are EU subsidized!)If you only speak English, this is the best place to go to see an old (pre-industrial) culture. And if you get sick of the English, Scotland and Wales are very near by, and far more different from England than Canada is from the US.
