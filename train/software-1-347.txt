First of all, Windows XP is not professional looking at all. If you are into cartoons and you want your company to look cartoonish, this is the operating system to do it with. Unfortunately, this cartoonish look can cause a problem. In order for the romper room title bar, which is bigger than 2000, the forms get cut off on the bottom. The second problem I have with Windows XP after only 3 weeks of use, is the search in files. It doesn't recognize an extension that isn't for a Microsoft sanctioned file. Thank you Microsoft for thinking you are the only one that writes software! At least the Microsoft web site gives you a way around this. The biggest complaint I have about XP is what happens when the error reporting program (dumprep.exe) starts to execute. Everything starts running with stone-age speed. I had this happen to me 3 times the first day. All I can say is if you want to stay sane, turn off the error reporting!
