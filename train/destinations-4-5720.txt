Florida has so many great vacations spots, you can't possibly patronize them all. A few of my old (snowbird) friends have moved there, it seems ok to them. My in-laws moved there for the winters, first owning a condo, then their own house. It was great to have a place to take the kids and visit for a week, the state is much larger and more diverse than it appears from "up north". To rate the state low and call all its residents bigots because of a law that affects less than 1 percent of its population seems out of focus to me. Society evolves, it doesn't change on a dime. There is a deliberative process that usually must be followed to change laws. Is that so horrible and backward? We used to call it democracy.
