I have a 94 bought with 90,000 on it it now has 115,000 running strong, only work it needed was a head gasket. I noticed that most of the negative comments attack the truck as not being 'domestic' well gm, for, and german owned dodge make lots of stuff in mexico. Who is building plants in the USA and who is closing them? Anyway these trucks are tuff as nails, sure the ride is not great, the inside is a bit crude, but it is a *truck* not some cushy cowboy cadilac (see F150) look at news footage of the 3rd world and what do you see 10 guys packed into the back of a old toyota going up some rocky road in the mountains. My manhood is just fine, and I don't need no stinking truck to augment it (see dodge diesel)
