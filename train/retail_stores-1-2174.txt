I already know that frys sucks. but i figured if i buy a SONY laptop from them, i'd be in the safe zone. So i buy the sony laptop and also the extended warranty. 8 months later... the hard drive crashes (defective hard drive) not characteristic of sony. perhaps they remove the sonly HD and replace it with a cheaper one and sell the sony HD. But anyway. The tech realizes its a bad hard drive and he tells me we'll replace the hard drive and load an operating system. it will take 3 days... first of all, im thinking "why 3 days?" i can replace the hard drive and load an operating system in a few hours. But i wanted to take advantage of my warranty, so i say ok... its been 10 days now and they still havn't finished installing a new hard drive, and loading an operating system. HONESTLY, HOW HARD IS IT TO DO THAT??!?! it would only take minutes to replace the hard drive, then an hour or two to load the operating system. FRYS electronics SUCKS i will never buy ANYTHING from there ever again. Thanks.
