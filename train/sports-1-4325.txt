Anyone who gives this coach more than one star must be on crack. In a short period of time he has taken something that most Kentuckians use to live and die for, and turned it into a complete joke. Most fans no longer even care to watch them play anymore. How can a person who calls themself a coach take the amount of talent he has and go 8+ minutes and not score a point. Some may say, well he did win a national championship , but I venture to say that a 5-year kids soccer coach could have won with that team. They were already coached and conditioned. It would be hard to count the people I know that used to bleed blue, who know root for them to loose games. Just in hopes that he may be fired. I Think this scale needs a zero starrating just for this coach. Its time (PAST TIME) for Tubby to go.
