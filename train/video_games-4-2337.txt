This game is a pretty good game it is one of those games where the time flies by while your playing it. You start out on this farm that was left to you by your Grandfather you have to clean up the farm and you can grow vegetables and other stuff like flowers. If you are nice to the girls you can pick which one you want to marry{ their heart has to be at pink first}. Along with a dog you can go to the Green Ranch and get your horse. When you have enough money you can buy cows, sheep, and chickens. There are a lot of festivals you can go to I would say the funner ones are the dog and horse races. Overall this game is fun to play.
