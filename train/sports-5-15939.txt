Tom Brady is a legend, this guy comes in out of no where and wins to friggen superbowls. And he is the youngest to ever do so. This man is making a name for himself. He has the best winning record in Overtime, never lost a playoff game, and plays so well under pressure. I know he doesn't have anything spectacular in arm strength etc. but neither did Joe Montana and Montana is arguable the best QB of all time. I know Tom Brady is just starting to play ball and it may be too soon to compare him to the all time great, but come on... 2 superbowl wins and MVP's out of 3 years?!?!?!?!?! this guy is doing some serious damage in the NFL, I'd keep my eye on this guy.
