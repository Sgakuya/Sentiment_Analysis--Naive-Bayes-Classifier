This was my all-time favorite cereal. It had so much brown sugar, you could feel the enamel of your teeth melting away. Quake and Cap'n Crunch are essentially the same. Quake disappeared years ago (either a mining accident or Black Lung). I though Quisp was kidnapped and locked in a freezer in Roswell, NM. But if these posts are right, it is actually still made. Of course, wifeypoo will not allow sweetened cereals in our house. We have dreck in our cupboard like Pine Needles and tree bark, Euro-trash Muselix and Bran Blowing Out your Butt (So much roughage, you're better off just pouring the cereal down the crapper).
