Whataburger, as it is when you happen upon a store with caring employees, is the best of the best of "fast food" burgers, at any price. [What company puts MAYO on a burger! Answer: Wendy's and Burger King..LOL This ain't Canada!!] Like any fast food burger joint, the beef is feedlot grainfed and tasteless [thankfully], but Whataburger can cover that up like nobody else can :-) Fresh veges and a toasted bun and Mustard!!! Not mayo! They used to grill the buns, but now use a toaster which destroys the original flavor!!! If all I had to live on was McD, BK, Wendy's, I would soon perish. Like any place, some are managed better than others and your burger will be prepared accordingly. P.S. ASK FOR EXTRA LETTUCE. Otherwise you'll get only a couple shreds.
