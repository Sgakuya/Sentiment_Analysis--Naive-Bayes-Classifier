Just to clear everything up. Chipotle was started in 1992 by one man named Steve Ells. McDonalds came in years later as an investor. Chipotle was not McDonalds idea. They have no control over the food, philosphy, marketing, etc. They have however helped Chipotle expand into many different markets. Many of the meats in certain markets are naturally raised - which means the animals Chipotle uses receive no hormones or steroids in their lifetime. Chipotle's culture is based on "Food with itegrity" and sustainable farming. They inspect their farmers themselves to ensure standards are met and the animals are treated humanely.
