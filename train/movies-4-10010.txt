Yes, I'll admit it. I'm a woman in my mid-thirties and I went to see Freaky Friday. I'd seen and liked the original as a kid and thought I'd give the remake a try. To my pleasant suprise it was very entertaining. Now, mind you I wouldn't suggest that you take your boyfriend to see it on a night out but I wouldn't relegate it to the just mom's with kids catagory of appeal either. I actually laughed out loud several times. Jamie Lee Curtis was by far the stand out performance as the body of the mother with the soul of her 15 year old daughter trapped inside. Being a thirtysomething myself and sitting smack dab inbetween my twenties and fourties it was fun to watch this adult body experience the joys of being a teenager again, cute sexy clothes, cute sexy boys, motorcycles, the art of creative piercing. It was fun to see her character transform from overburdened career woman, juggling too many to-do's and too much technology to a spontaneous,freedom cherishing, rock star. I think the other adult women in the audience enjoyed it much more than their pre-teen daughters did. I heard them laugh and the daughters - not so much. Being Disney, the film was ultra clean but not insanely so, like I said there are a couple of piercings and some cute little jokes for the older audience. It reminded me of my relationship with my mom and dealt with some of the generalities of the mother/teenage daughter relationship and now that I'm no longer a teenager it was fun to look back on that time and laugh.
