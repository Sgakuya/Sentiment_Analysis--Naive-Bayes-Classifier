I actually liked the first "Saw" movie, but when I saw the previews for this sequel, it had "bad idea" written all over it. With a premise like this, the first movie should have taken out every bit of suspense and mystery that made it worthwhile in the first place. But, I figured that I've been proven wrong before, so I'll take a risk for a matinee price . . . SYNOPSIS: The Jigsaw killer is at it again, killing those who he feels is "underserving of life". A police officer must race against time to save his son, who is trapped in a deadly game with a group of people, blah, blah, blah . . . oh, and there's a "twist" at the end. Whoopee. PROS: This is one of those things that will make you cringe as each "player" is eliminated by gruesome tasks which make "Fear Factor" look even lamer in comparison (not that that's saying much, but anyway,), from cutting off pieces of oneself to swimming in a pit of hypodermic needles that are clearly not sterilized . . . CONS: . . . but even that doesn't make for a good movie, no matter how much of a response it illicits. The storyline has a few unexpected turns, but nothing thought-provoking. This is a movie isn't much of a "pyschological thriller"; it's just got a creep-factor. OVERALL: Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not good, either. They came up with some pretty creative demented ways of inflicting pain on oneself, but other than that this movie didn't have much to offer. You're probably better off skipping this one.
