i think that maurice benard is one of the most incredible actors i have ever seen. how many other people can play sonny so perfectly. from his accent to his body language. he's the perfect idea of a mobster. i have read a lot of the comments and i found some of them quite disturbing. his acting is wonderful and those who think he's terrible probably never acted or tried to act a day in their lives. it's not easy to act and to act such a difficult character & always be perfect. if he was horrible, he wouldn't be on the show. his character is multi-dimensional character & is one of the best ones in gh. maurice has done a wonderful job and i can't wait to see more from him on gh and in other productions.
