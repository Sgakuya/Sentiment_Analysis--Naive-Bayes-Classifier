Wilt was the best, bar none. Wilt scored more than 58 points in a game 49 times. EVERYONE else in NBA history, combined, have done it 24 times. Rules were changed to make it easier for MJ to score (e.g., no hand checking, three seconds on defense). With Wilt, rules were changed to STOP him from scoring. He lettered in track before basketball at Kansas, running the 440, high jumping, and shot putting. He's in the VOLLEYBALL Hall of Fame. Bill Russell did win more championships than Wilt, but, using that criteria, K.C. Jones would have to be called the greatest guard ever, since he won more titles than MJ, Magic, or West. It makes as much sense as claiming Don Nelson was a better forward than Elgin Baylor or Karl Malone, or arguing that Steve Kerr won more championships than Oscar Robertson. Wilt's accomplishments are too numerous to list, and in many cases, are so mind-blowing that its hard to even imagine how dominant he was. I once saw him block five consecutive Abdul-Jabbar shots, including a dunk and a sky hook. Simply put, there was never, ever, an athlete like Wilt.
