I'm not sure how to rate a movie director who, despite a string of very good movies, releases a film so spectacularly awful that you're forced to question his judgment. Howard cranked out harmless, feel-good movies like Night Shift, Splash, Cocoon, and Parenthood, only to hit us with Far and Away, one of the most laughable big-budget movies I've ever seen. I guess everyone makes mistakes, huh? My favorite Howard movie may be Parenthood, which was quirky, amusing, and less formulaic than most of his other movies. Plus it must take an extremely talented director to coax a decent acting performance out of Keanu Reeves.
