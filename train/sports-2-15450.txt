His last NFL season will be 2006. Real class act in the playoffs against Green Bay, simulating mooning the fans, even Joe Buck could not ignore it. He is not bigger than the game and the Commissioner will eventually grow the cajones to put a stop to his stupidity, and the Vikings (who Moss apparently cares not a whit about) will be the poorer for the loss of him. Mike Tice seems to have saved his (Tice's) job for the time being but he has only assured NFL fans of more embarrassing antics from this idiot who should be great but is a distraction to his teammates. It will make it more difficult if the Vikings make it to the Super Bowl, which could actually occur as shamefully inferior has the NFC become. In one game, anything can happen, what a nightmare for the league which usually does an outstanding job of maintaining the polish on its image. Tagliabue has let it go on much too far.
