JSteele... I am VERY familar with Moving Staffers process since we're (our Co.) the partner that wrote the engine that they use to facilitate the moves. If you think you personally can do a regional, let alone a national move (load,unload,pack) with the speed, accuracy and assurance of a good moving 'crew' feel free to try. Moving Staffers has hundreds of moving crews that are screened and rated. Is it a perfect system.. no... but how could anyone possibly manage hundreds of crews and thousands of moves with 100% assurance.. there's no company that could nor a 100% guaranteeed process to do that. for example if a mover does 85 PERFECT moves and then a primary workcrew manager gets ill and someone else fills in for them how can anyone assure that person will be as capable as the primary...? What is the option? Don't send the crew? That doesn't work for myriad reasons.. So do they asdd value? We certainly think so and so do the 'key' industry players who have been working with their team for years..
