This jerk of a person is rated ahead of Hakim Warrick? I wonder what the NBA scouts think? This kid actually said the other day, I am the best to ever play in the ACC. What an idiotic jerk! Think about that statement, and tell me this is a good kid. He can play, but I smell Ricky Davis pt. 2. I see the kind of kid that would throw it off his own backboard, in order to get his 10th rebound. I wonder what Len Bias, Jordan, David Thompson, Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, James Worthy, Antawn Jamison, Phil Ford, etc. would think about this idiot proclaiming he is the best in ACC history? JESUS!- don't you have to at least make it to the Sweet 16 to be the greatest ever. If you want to see what a moron he is, just listen to him running his mouth about Carolina - A TEAM STATE CAN'T SEEM TO BEAT! State got tore up by Carolina, and after the game, HE KEPT RUNNING HIS MOUTH! HELL, AFTER BOTH GAMES! Classic example of writng checks your a** can't cash. This kid actually called McCants a p*ssy while being completely blown up for 30 by McCants!&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& *******UPDATE: What did I tell ya, Mr.on his way to stardom? Next time, you better make damn sure your team is damn good, before you start running your mouth about the University of North Carolina. Moron, what now? How come you ain't talking all of a sudden? Yeah, boy, say something else. PLEEEEEEASE!
