Many fine critics consider Hawks one of the top 3 American directors,and the French adore him.The number and range of classic films to his credit speak for themselves.The Gangster film:Scarface(1932),The Big Sleep(my personal favourite of his). The Western:Red River,Rio Bravo. The Screwball comedy:Bringing up Baby,His Girl Friday,Twentieth Century. The Musical:Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The Action adventure:Only Angels have Wings.An unpretentious director,whose visual style rarely drew attention to itself,he nevertheless created many of the most interesting Hollywood films,exploiting the system for his own unmistakeable purposes(For instance,in his comedies -in particular those starring Cary Grant- he often relished inverting the usual gender relations).But he was always first and foremost an entertainer,whose work has certainly stood the test of time.
