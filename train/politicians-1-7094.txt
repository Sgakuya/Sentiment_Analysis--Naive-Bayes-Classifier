Jesse Jackson is a minister of hate, not a minister of the Bible. He stands against what the Word of God says. He stands for the killing of the innocent, and marches with the gays. He preaches hate, not love. If a white person ever came close to making the statements that he does, they would be cal all sorts of vial things. My prayer is that if Jesse Jackson is saved that he repent and get right with the Lord. Someday we shall all stand before the Lord and we shall all give an account of things that we have said and done. God have mercy on us all. Jesse is a disgrace, and should not use the title Rev. As the Bible says: By their fruits you shall know them. Martin Luther King would distance himself from such a man as Jesse. This man is the biggest racist in America.
