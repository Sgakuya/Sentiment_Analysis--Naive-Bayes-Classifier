Let's bring back Clinton. He was a good President. When he was President, the economy was great, and we had a saner foreign policy. Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton was correct when she asserted that she and her husband were victims of a right-wing conspiracy. Now we have a Republican president who is single-handedly destroying the country;our economy is in a mess and we are in another Vietnam. But the right wingers are happy,and I guess that's what's important. UPDATE: I have to agree with C.C. Ridder that Bubba has joined the pantheon of engaging American rascals. Watching him recount his struggles with his demons on 60 Minutes last weekend was priceless. Don't get me wrong;I still think Clinton was a good president, but I am now realizing his great comedic gifts. UPDATE: Oh, I just love to hear Jaws comment. He sounds so intelligent. ANOTHER UPDATE: To say Clinton was the "worst president in modern history next to Carter" is not an exaggeration, it's untrue. Maybe he couldn't stop chasing the women, but when he was President, we had a booming economy and a coherent foreign policy. Clinton was also capable of thinking for himself and didn't need a cadre of advisers and hand-holders to tell him what to do.
