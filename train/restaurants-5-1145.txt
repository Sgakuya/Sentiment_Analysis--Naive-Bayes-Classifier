Definately my favorite fried chicken place! I enjoy the crispness and seasonings that they use, and they've almost always got a good deal going on (usually 10-15 pcs. of chicken, 5-10 buscuits, 2 lrg. sides for $12.99-$17.99, so it's not too bad; not sure about individual meal prices, though). The wait is usually long, but it's worth it! The establishment I frequent is pretty clean, just always busy. I love the mashed potatoes and gravy, too. Word of caution: For vegetarians, there seems to be bits of meat in the gravy, so if you don't want meat, you might want to skip the gravy on the mashed potatoes. I'm not sure if there are any vegetarian items, actually, you might want to check.
