We have made 4 payments on our 2000 Windstar LX and everything is going wrong at once. The interior lights have a mind of there own. They decide when they want to work and when they don't. The back window respond the same way. Now it has a rough idle. Put in on Diagnostic and pulled codes PO171 & PO174. I'm not the first to have this problem. From what I have researched this is a engneering defect and because of year Ford says oh well. Fixing this problem will run us about $600.00 and that is not permenate. History with these vehicles have a way of repeating it selves. I don't know who to be more upset with Ford or the trusted dealer we bought it from. Ford needs to fix this problem before it gets worse. Years 96-2001 all seem to be suffering form the same problems. Which scares me more, I'm expecting the transmission to go next. Don't take my word for is search Windstar Problem, there are thousands of anger people with the same problems. Last Ford I will ever own, even makes you thank twice about you favorite Nascar racing teams.
