My first flying experience was last year, from Glasgow (UK) to Newark. We had to go on a small British Airways plane to London before the American Airlines to the States. The BA plane was quite cramped and low-budget (although the food and service was good), and I thought I'd have trouble if the 7-hour flight by AA was going to have such little legroom, me being 6ft tall. I was happy to learn that AA was known for having a lot of legroom for their passengers on all classes, and even happier when I was surprisingly offered the spacious seat beside the escape door (good for the legs, bad for the paranoia)! The journey consisted of a good, friendly service, with nice meals and enjoyable shows on the screen. I think we watched It Could Happen To You (starring Angelina Jolie) which wasn't to be released in the UK for some time to come. Plus some promo material for CBS like Everybody Loves Raymond. Pity the radio wasn't up to scratch - AOR isn't my thing... Overall, a great experience and I would have no problem in flying with them again in the future.
