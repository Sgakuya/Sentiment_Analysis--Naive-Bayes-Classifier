This is where Democracy started. The ruins are beautiful. Don't miss the shopping at the Plaka, the store owners will make special offers to you. You'll never have to pay regular price for anything and here's a tip: if you pay with U.S. Dollars the deals get better, so don't exchange all your money. The city is crowded, no doubt and be careful crossing streets. The Olympics are coming there in 2004 so construction now is hot and heavy. Go to the top of Mount Lycabettos and see a spectacular view and grab a bite while you're up there. Many outdoor restaurants with great food. Enjoy this great old city then go to the islands to relax.
