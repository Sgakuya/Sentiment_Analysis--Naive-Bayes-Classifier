Kennesaw State is an excellent school. I graduated from the school in 2001 with a degree in psychology. The faculty is top-notch and truely committed to the student's success. The campus is very diverse. If you want to stay on campus they have some of the best campus housing in the southeast. If you are a working professional, they have courses to accomadate that as well. Best of all they have an excellent career staff that assists with job searches, career development, grad school applications. This helped me get a $10,000 bump in salary. If you're looking for a a great school without the exbortitant costs, I would recommend it. I can honestly say I have no complaints.
