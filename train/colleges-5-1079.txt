i went there, and trust me, if you discard long islanders as spoiled brats and upstate new yorkers as hicks, you are the one missing out on a ton of fun at a great college. the university is huge, 30,000+ people. if i found friends, you can. great surroundings, hikes, nature, great outdoor education courses that are very cheap for students. i received good financial aid. almost twice as big as any other top school, like CMU. at the time, ithaca and collegetown seemed like very expensive places to live, but now i know that's nothing compared to boston or new york, or philly, or even rhode island. this school is well worth checking out. i recommend visiting around dragon day (the week before spring break). the university is secluded in a small town, but the environment is great. well connected with other big schools nearby. great academics. never had a problem competing with harvard and mit grads at interviews (i am math/cs undergrad and cs - masters). tons of opportunities to help professors with research or classes (i did both), or work on interesting stuff on campus. there are always 5-10 tech startups at the engineering school, very often joint with business school, which is also highly ranked. there are tons of student activities as well. can't mention all here. people are not all smart, but that's the case with any college. yes, the SAT rankings are lower for CU, and alas I was one of the people with SAT in the bottom half ('1300) but the scores are scewed by lots of international students and immigrants (like myself). i wouldn't pay too much attention. i never felt i was smarter than everyone else. 8 )
