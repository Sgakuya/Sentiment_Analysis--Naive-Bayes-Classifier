LaRussa and Torre are better. Cox is good but not great. I credit him for taking the Blue Jays as well as the Braves to the Post-season. But the Braves have had a constant influx of incredible talent since 1991. Yet all he has to show for it is ONE World title in a strike-marred season. The Braves have become so pathetic in the post-season, that I call them Baseball's Bye Week. They let every stinky-dink team Beyotch-slap them in the NLDS. The Cubs actually won their first post-season since 1908 at Braves expense. The 'Stros won their only post-season at Braves expense. I saw them literally not even show up one NLDS where St. Louis creamed them in 3 straight. The Braves are in striking range for another division title this year. But I guarantee every other playoff team prays they play the Braves in the NLDS. Great Regular Season Manager. Hah. Ask Eagle Fans what they think of Andy Reid -- the NFL's equivalent to Bobby Cox.
