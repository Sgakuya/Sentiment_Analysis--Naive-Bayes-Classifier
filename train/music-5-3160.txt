Excellent! Jazz is an obvious influence here. The title track, Help Me, Free Man in Paris (the best song on the album, with Crosby Nash on backing vocals, I believe), Car on a Hill, and Raised on Robbery are all strong. People's Parties shows off Joni's amazing ability to paint a picture with her songwriting. Twisted is good for comedic relief, with Cheech and Chong as a nice surprise. And listening to that last paragraph of The Same Situation ( Still I sent up my prayer/wondering who was there to hear/I said 'Send me somebody/who's strong and somehwat sincere,' /With the millions of the lost and lonely ones, I called out to be released, Caught in my struggle for higher achievements and my search for love that don't seem to cease ) I thought well, that just about covers every doubt and significant thought I have in my mind. High quality music.
