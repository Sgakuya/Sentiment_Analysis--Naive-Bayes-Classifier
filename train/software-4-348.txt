When I first got my new computer with WinXP, I was put off by it. It seemed that is was too user-friendly and too resistant to manual control. After about the first few months, it has kinda grown on me. I wanted to try Red Hat Linux, but my system rejected it for some reason. Aside from Windows, I haven't ever used another operating system. With that said, I'm rating this in the context of other Windows only, not all operating systems. It's faster and more stable than any previous Windows (although, the fact that I'm running it on a better computer does influence the stability and speed). Inspite of its good qualities, I'm only giving it a 4 because of its lack of support for MS-DOS programs.
