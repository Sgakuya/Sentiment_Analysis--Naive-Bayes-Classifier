I have taking a beating for years over my unpopular opinion of this film. It's wildly overrated. . .Denzel has given much better performances although he wasn't bad in this film. Ditto for Tom Hanks. I hate to say it, but this was a stone-cold example of a PC Oscar- Hanks won the award because he played a dying AIDS patient. I wasn't moved by the dying-in-the-courtroom sequence because I felt it was too obvious and manipulative. "Philadelphia" isn't a bad film, just wildly overrated. . .I felt the subject of AIDS deserved something else. . .something a little more cerebral instead of painting characters as 'accepting, loving people' or 'homophobic'.
