A nice performer, cargo space and well appointed with a pleasant ride. I also had the hard tonneau installed, a really great option! I have 4 teenagers at home, snowboarders, skateboarders, bicycles, etc. that make good use of the bed capacity, as well as trips to the dump and Home Depot. It's great for homeowner/commuting purposes. I drive 500 miles a week for my work commute in New England and it makes winter driving easy as pie. At 13,000 miles, it's doing fine, although I did have the dealer replace the Firestones with Michelins after all the hullabaloo about them. The trailer light connector mount is pretty wimpy under the bumper, so I'll probably replace it with something a little beefier, that backing into a snowbank won't bend out of shape. Oh, the owner's manual AND the dealer parts department has the WRONG oil filter number listed. It's an FL-1A. Don't get caught with the old filter off and the wrong new one in your hands!
