This is a great book, as you come to expect from McCullough. What I took away from the book was a sense of how differently we choose our Vice-Presidents today compared with only 50 years ago (FDR hardly knew him and when Roosevelt died, Truman was in the dark about almost everything) and what a different array of personalities gravitated to politics back then. HST struck me as a street-fighter who had a deep respect for the office he held. He often justified his anger at someone by saying, he can do/say/imply that to Harry Truman, but NOT to the President of the United States! History has been kind to Truman, and so was McCullough, but you got a real sense of his humanity: his impetuousness, his anger, his petulance, his impatience. He didn't care about being portrayed as perfect. It's funny that some still call the sequence of wars against creeping communism (Korea, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Afghanistan) the Truman Doctrine.
