My boyfriend had taken me shopping for a early christmas gift. I picked out a moderate priced pair of beautiful blue ear rings.After getting them home and looking them over i noticed that the backs on the ear rings were completely different, one was too small that was forced onto the one post and the other was too big that it was just laying in the box it came in. I called the store,explained we had just bought the ear ring 3 days ago and i would like to bring them in to get proper backs for them, i wasnt asking for a refund or to exchange ,all i wanted was proper backs to wear my ear rings. The man on the phone told me " well bring them in and we will see what we can do." I advised him if i drive a hour and half back to the store i want proper back and he said " well we will have to see what the condition of the earrings are when you get here." That place is terrible! talk about bad customer service, im calling to speak to the manager this after noon about this matter.
