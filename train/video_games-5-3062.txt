I haven't played Madden since the SNES days. So when I received Madden 2001 with my new PS2 I couldn't believe it was the same game. Yes the visuals are great, but if the gameplay stinks then you may as well throw it away. Well the gameplay rocks. Sluggishness? Cartoonish? Where? The motion is very fluid. The players have been digitally captured and they look REAL. The playbooks are very solid. You can actually feel the crunch of your runningback pushing his way thru the pile. The computer AI is good, but tends to cheat in final quarter when it's losing. The controls reflect actual player physics thus it may appear to be sluggish when in reality you cannot stop or turn a 250lb player on a dime. It's implemented well and factual. The franchise mode in my opinion is the heart of this game, allowing you to build your NFL dynasty. Trading and resigning players then organizing your depth charts becomes as important as the gameplay itself. And the small details shine too, such as the dwindling crowd and noise when playing a team that has a poor record. There are many gripes about the commentary by John and Pat, but this can be turned off. Personally it doesn't bother me and after playing three seasons I still hear some new dialog. If you like football, don't wait-get this game today and have your own team SuperBowl party!
