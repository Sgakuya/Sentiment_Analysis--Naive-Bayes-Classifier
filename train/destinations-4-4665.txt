Oh come on people, St. Louis aint that bad. It's not an A-lister city so it should not be rated or compared to any. Yes it is scary in some parts but there are a lot of great neighborhoods to visit here. St. Louis has a lot of character and rich history. I found it to be a very genuine city and not too overgentrified like a lot of the overpriced coastal cities. The people I encountered were very friendly and not pretentious which I found refreshing. Visiting the arch is a lot of fun and this is a great town to catch a ball game in as they are very passionate about their Cardinals. The bars here are a lot of fun and many have a great atmousphere. Union Station is probably one of the nicest restored train stations I've seen anywhere and there are archetectual gems all over the city like the painted lady victorians in Lafayette Square. Getting on a riverboat is a lot of fun and a unique experience. The parkland around the arch and on the riverfront is very attractive and nicely landscaped. Check out The Hill which is St. Louis' version of Little Italy. Very satisfying restaurants in this area. Soulard is a very charming neighborhood that is a throwback to the 1800's with an abundance of restored brick townhouses with a bit of a New Orleans feel to it. Yes the city does have a lot of seedy areas and it seems evident the glory days were celebrated in the past but there are still a lot of remnants of the good old days here reflecting that is was once a very prosperous city. I think this city needs a miracle mayor like Chicago's Daley to oversee urban renwal as this city has so much potential that it is not living up to. I came to St. Louis not expecting a whole lot but was very pleasantly surprised and if you come here with an open mind there are a lot of good times to be had here.
