I walked in the theater expecting this movie to suck horribly. After the completley un entertaining crap film The Cable Guy also directed by Stiller, I had little hope for this picture based off a skit that appeared on The VH1 Fashion Awards. To my surprise, I laughed my ass off. I had such a good time watching ths film Iwas astonished. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are absolutly brilliant as the two nimbskulled fashion model heros of the picture. The rest of the huge ensemble cast, which is filled with more cameos than an episode of South Park, is equally great. At one part of the film an angry protester throws an egg at Will Ferril's character. If you watch the egg cracks his pet poodle right in the face. The only reaction from the dog is a stunned lok. I almost fell over.A very well recieved penis joke that Ben must have gotten from the set of Something About Mary is histarical. The orgy scene, the unveiling of blue steel, the gasoline fight, I could go on and on about how funny this movie is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Very funny stuff. Much better than Meet the Parents
