A solid effort by Golden. Written just after the 2nd World War, the author's main premise is that there isn't much holding society together, and that in reality we are all really savages. When civilization melts away, man's true savage nature reflects itself. Golden's goal is to point out how the social contract which holds civilization together can melt away with ease much like it has throughout history, like in the French Revolution. The story begins when a group of kids become stranded on an island without adults. Almost instantly, the protocalls defining civilized behavior begin melting off and tribalism begins. The main polarities in this story revolve around the contrasts between democracy as embodied in the character Ralph, who took a vote when arriving on the island, versus Jack, who is a totalitarian who leads by force of will. Piggy represents rationalism. His death at the hands of Jack's tribe represents the death of rationalism in the face of totalitarianism and the ultimate stagnation that such forms of political organization brings about. This story is all about contrasts. The moral of the story is that man's moral, benevolent side has to successfully overcome the savagery of totalitarianism in order to keep society moving forward.
