I've always like Kevin Spacey...so I'm giving it 2 stars...but the film itself was disappointing and deserves a 1. I know it was trendy to like it...but really...what new ground did this film cover? It tried to take a darkly funny yet hurtful view of the American family...great. It's been done to death. We KNOW life isn't like Leave It To Beaver. And I felt like the pervy aspect was graphically displayed-- not for the sake of the film plot-- but to titilate the audience. In the end, this film lacks integrity, but somehow people have bought into the hype. I don't think the makers were trying to make a higher point at all. I think they were trying to win awards and cash their checks. If it had taken us to some new place-- then I would respect it. But it didn't. BOO!
