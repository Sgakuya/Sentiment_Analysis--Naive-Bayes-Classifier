If you love star trek- If you hate star trek- you will like this one. If you like to watch grade B sci-fi/horror films to look for the strings and wires and costume/stage screwups, (Remember Dr. McCoy's sparkley salt shaker?) you will think this is a scream! The whole premise of the movies works because so many people have had the same idea: what would 'aliens' from another planet think about us from watching the TV signals that supposedly make it out into the depths of outer space--never mind that it would take centuries... and ignoring all the other broken laws of physics! This movie is pure mindless brain rot but I still like it. My wife refused to watch it untill she fell in love with Harry Potter- then she watched it ostensably for the Alan Rickman conection.
