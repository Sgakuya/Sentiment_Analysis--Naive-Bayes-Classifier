Since taking office, her top priorities have been education, the economy, and the environment. Under her leadership, the state's 2004 budget passed without cuts to education, and she continues to focus on early childhood literacy programs as prevention for high illiteracy and high school dropout rates. She recently created the CoppeRx Card, a free prescription drug discount card mailed to every Medicare-eligible senior in Arizona, offering discounts of 15 to 55 percent. The governor also is working to re-direct Arizona's economy toward high-tech, knowledge-based industry to ensure that graduates continue to have quality job opportunities. She is considered a rising star in the democratic party, and was on the list of possible vice president candidates.
