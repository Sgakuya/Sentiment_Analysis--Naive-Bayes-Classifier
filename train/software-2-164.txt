I switched to Firefox when 1.0 was released, having upgraded to the latest release I have noticed that each update made Firefox slower and slower, it may be a safe browser and for the most part it works good, but if you have a broadband connection you won't be enjoying the full benefit of it and it will feel like you have dial-up. Takes forever to load, dumps web pages and overall is slow. Tried changing the about:config settings but had no improvement in speed. Mozilla support forums are a joke and they don't like when you post a comment on the speed of Firefox, they will delete your post thinking your out to bash the software without helping you or improving the software. Better then IE but not the best or fastest.
