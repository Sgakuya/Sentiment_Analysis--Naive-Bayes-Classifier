SPOILER ALERT! I've noticed that Rowling has brought a theme to the Potter books in the last three - a good guy dies. I wasn't torn up about Cedric, but Sirius and Dumbledore? Wow. Didn't see those coming. This book was well written and it was nice to see a little more on Voldamort's background. Some pretty cool stuff. To those who've accepted Snape as being evil, don't give up on him yet. Think about it. Dumbledore and Snape were found in a heated argument. My guess is that Snape revealed to Dumbledore of his unbreakable vow. Not wanting to kill him, he argued his case but Dumbledore insisted it must be done in order to get closer to killing Voldamort. Right before Snape killed him, Dumbledore seemed to be begging for his life. On the contrary, he was ordering a reluctant Snape to kill him. Also, when Snape was fighting with Harry, he used the excuse that no one can kill him. He must be saved for Voldamort. I found that a rather ingenious way to protect Harry. On top of that, he refused to let Harry use an unforgivable curse (to avoid prosecution/expulsion from Hogwarts perhaps?) AND, in a very slick manner, taught Harry the importance of non-verbal spell casting. He kept telling him to keep his mouth shut. No, Snape isn't evil. He's a little rough around the edges, but I think he'll be a key player in Voldamort's demise. Besides, he knew right away that Harry was lying about the potions book and could have given him a much worse punishment. I think he had a sense of pride that Harry was using HIS spells and potion knowledge that he couldn't help but be a bit proud of the fact that Harry did everything he could to keep it. Oh yeah, for something to think about - R.A.B ----> Regulus Black? (who died back when Harry was born). The real Horcrux is probably another locket - perhaps the one the Order found in the Black's House and didn't know whose it was or what to do with it? Crazy Crazy
