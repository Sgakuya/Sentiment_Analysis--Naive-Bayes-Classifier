Getting a cup of coffee should not be as stressful as this. There is no logic to how they design their counters. The staff there EXPECTS you to know where to go to place your order, where to go to pay and where to go to get cream, sugar, etc.....and they expect you to know IMMEDIATELY what you want. Forget about gazing at the convoluted menu. You're a number to this organization, not a person. Just pay and get away from them. Plus, they have replaced neighborhood pubs----people used to go to the corner pub for a beer. Now it's Starbucks, for coffee. At night. Final nail in the coffin--Starbucks took over The Seaport Inn, a tavern dating back to Washington's time in my hometown of Alexandria, VA (Old Town). The Seaport Inn was a landmark up until the mid '90s. It's now a Starbucks. They will never get my money again. And I have a bunch of $5 gift cards I got as a prize. I will be handing them out to people on the street.
