I spent time researching and quite a few fellow employees told me the UOP was great. Well, I have not attended a class yet, and I am thinking of not, tomorrow night is orientation night. The reason why is because of the lack of response from the counselor's and how they avoid any questions you may have in regards to the items they are charging you for. I was suppose to have the application fee waived. Well, the online counslor pissed me off so bad, I refused to attend. Then we deducted the application fee from my tutition fee and did not refund the entire amount to me. So I spoke to an on-campus representive, who doesn't answer my e-mails/and a financial counselor who calls me at home when I am at work. Now, I can finally see that I am enrolled in a class, but of course they want $1345 now. There is a resource charge of $70.00 and I have to ask what that is for. They were suppose to give me a credit for the $110.00 and they have not. Of course. I think that they are only after everyone's hard earned money. They don't care. My goodness, why would I need to take a general class when I already have a AA degree. They offer same classes for their BS degree as what I took for my AA and transferable units. I am thinking that I need to look around more.
