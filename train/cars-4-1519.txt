I bought a Saturn SL (cheapest model) in 1994. It has saved me lots of money over the past 10 years and 108,000 miles. It's reliable and has low maintenance. Mine is gold and looks so good still that people can't believe it's that old. It's a stick shift, so I get great gas mileage. This is a very good commuter car for half-hour trips. The Saturn people try very hard to give outstanding service. On the down side, it's always been noisy and road sensitive and a tight fit: not good for long trips. I had to replace an alternator after about 18 months (under warranty). It took a while to discover the oxygen sensor was going out causing stalling until the motor warmed up.
