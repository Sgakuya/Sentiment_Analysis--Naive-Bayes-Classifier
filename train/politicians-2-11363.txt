UPDATE: It's her liberal views and voting record! Conservatives kneel at the feet of strong, outspoken, independent women like Margaret Thatcher, Linda Chavez, Ann Coulter! Anybody got a chisel? ORIGINAL COMMENT 11/16/04: It hurt me deeply, 3 years ago, when several of my snowbird friends (who now live in Florida) all seemed to send the same hurtful message to me. It went something like, Yeah, we're incompetent, incapable of voting properly, can't follow directions too good, can't count the votes very accurately, etc., etc., but, Eschew, we didn't elect Hillary Clinton! Now, that hurt. That really cut me to the quick. Now I enjoy a good touchdown dance as much as the next guy, but . . . So, now, I wait.
