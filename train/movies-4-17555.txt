Probably the most popular and admired film to come from South America;winner of the Berlin Festival Golden Bear,Golden Globes' and British Academy awards for best foreign language film of the year.A retired schoolteacher,eking a living by writing letters for the illiterate at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station,finds herself saddled with a 9 year old boy whose mother has been killed.Initially grumpy and world-weary,she accompanies him through the Brazilian hinterland in search of his father.Engrossing,compassionate and uplifting:a vastly rewarding odyssey,enhanced by two tremendously touching performances and expressive,eloquent cinematography.
