It makes my heat sad because of what he has done to this country. We are all sinners and fall short of God's Glory. But this man continues in his muddy lifestyle. He caused this country to become, not just secound class but no class and all the people that are like him and want to continue in their corrupt lifestyles vote for his running mate. I pray that they are only blind and do not understand what they do. But in my heart after watching what has happened in the last week it is evedent that we are destined to become a country with no honor. That kills their unborn and approves of turning this country into Sodom and Gomorrah. These Men have failed bitterly and it takes us all down. Shame on us.Shame on Clinton and Mercy on his soul and this country.
