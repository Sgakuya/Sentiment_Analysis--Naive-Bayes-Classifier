For anyone who wants to try and understand the perspective of a black man struggling to overcome the systematic destruction of his biological family (his father was lynched, social services sent Malcolm Little and his siblings to foster homes in Michigan and Massachusetts) and his niche within a racist society that still exists, this is a great book to read. He is an angry man made angry by an injust, hideously racist society that denied him hope and optimism, which understandably made him feel he had no choice but to go among his own people to survive. As a white man, I feel this book is still pertinent and should be mandatory reading for white people who have little understanding of black culture and society. White people should feel disturbed by Malcolm X. His rage resonates in many young blacks who have been dealing with adversity their entire lives. It is not enough to say to black people, I'm sorry. White people must initiate contact with blacks and go beyond the superficial Hi, how are you? and must earn black people's trust for both peoples to truly feel comfortable and candid with one another to discuss racism that is still strong in our society. I respected his candor and his right to be angry and to vent his anger at the white, blue-eyed devils. He admits later in the book that after making pilgrimage to Mecca and meeting Muslims of all colors and sizes, he grew in wisdom and lessened his victriol. A man who can learn from his anger and teach his experience to other people, regardless of color, is worthy of high esteem. A classic. Other good books are Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, Richard Wright's Black Boy and Native Son, Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and Mildred Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry.
