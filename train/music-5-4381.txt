Okay, right off the bat here, I am not trying to be sacreligous or offend anyone of any religion, I am just using the most powerful analogy I can think of to describe an unbelieveable album! Picture a crowd of millions swarming into Madison Square Garden (in this case, the equivelant of a church). There are posters honoring the legendary E Street Band to remind the spectators of why they are here. Once HE walks onstage, the crowd goes wild, virtually worshipping the ground this man and his band walks on. They applaud every song, often singing along, as well. The band is as up to par as it can be, and even though the image I've described comes only with a soundtrack to imagine it by, you feel the same way as everyone in that crowd just listening to it! The songs take on an almost religious quality (not in a literal sense, there are some swears and innuendos) but in the E Street Religion . From the opening of the ceremony (My Love Will Not let You Down) to the testaments to love, life, and struggle described so painstakingly throughout the show. 41 Shots teaches a moral lesson by chilling example. The long awaited Jungleland and essential Born to Run convey the feelings so often associated with the Boss and his music. 10th Ave. Freeze Out even includes a gospel style worship, if you will, of the power of rock and roll and the glorious E Street Band! Every song leads the listener to believe they are in fact attending a 'religious' ceremony, just based on the fans reactions in the crowd alone! But there is one song that describes the promise of Bruce Springsteen as well as any can... Land of Hope and Dreams ! Listen to the words of that song, and it almost reads like a religious one! It almost outright states how all the fans feel, and the way we all look up to Bruce, almost as a father figure (which I know he would be proud to see) but as a man who stands for what we believe in and how we live and want to live. This is an amazing item, and those who want Bruce's blessings to really ring true in their hearts need only to put this on at top volume, and prepare to lose themselves in heavenly music and fun! I love you Bruce, forever, we all do, and we always will, even if this was your last album ever, we'd still feel this way!
