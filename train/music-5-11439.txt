Holy crow! What a band, what an album! There is nothing that one cancompare to the Clash. What the hell are they? Punk? Ska? Pop? Reggae? One thing that I know that they are is one hell of a band. Melodic, rocking, in-your-face musical magicians and a group of guys that bowed out at the right time and refuse to re-unite. This is a post-punk era record. Don't let that word 'punk' scare you away. Sure Joe Strummer sported a Mohawk and the members of the band wore suspenders and combat boots, but the word punk is so intimidating and improper to describe the music of The Clash. Sheer energy and raw emotion is more like it. Start off slow with 'The Story of the Clash' and dig deeper into the archives to find the gems like 'London Calling' to discover a band and a record that is a must-have for anybody who considers themselves a well-rounded music connaisseur.
