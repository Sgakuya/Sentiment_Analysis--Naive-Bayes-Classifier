I hate the Braves with a passion. Ever since I discovered the most irritating baseball invention ever when the Yankees played them in the '96 series (the Tomahawk chop), I've always loathed this team. It is unimaginably annoying watching a game and hearing these fans chanting and doing the freakin' chop. Then with all the comments Rocker made just made my hatred much more vast. They, without merit, called themselves the Team of the '90s, even though they only won one world series and choked every single year in the postseason (except for '95). The Blue Jays won 2 world series championships in the '90s. The Yankees won 3 world championships in the '90s. The Braves-1. The facts back up that the Braves aren't prolific at winning titles.
