I've used Quicken for years and used to think it the best software bargain out there. But customer service has gone through the floor. You must now register on-line in order to use the product beyond a handful of times, or the product will stop working. Who it the H___ do they think they are? And the last straw, Quicken 2000 changes the interface to require twice as much mouse movement and clicking just to move from one account to another. It used to be easy - just clicked on a nice, big, easy-to-see tab. Now you must navigate to a little, tiny target to open a list and then select the account name from a drop-down list. How tedious. I sent it back and switched to a competitive product. Should have done it long ago.
