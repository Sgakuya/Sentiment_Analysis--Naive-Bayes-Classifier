Sorry guys I can't agree with most of you. Sure he's not perfect but he tries to do a good job - whats more: he does. Iraqis will always be grateful. If you doubt this, just ask a soldier who's been over there and they'll tell you they're appreciated. Believe me you can trust a soldier more than a biased reporter with little time spent in Iraq who is only trying to make a buck by selling another shocking story about doom and gloom. Don't close your eyes the trajedies, but don't close them to the successes either. To name a few: schools built, water supplied, electricity supplied, threat of unjust execution eliminated.
