First off, let's discuss the unimportant stuff... the pizza is good, not great, but it's comparable to Domino's, I think... Domino's is a little better, but it's comparable. So whether or not you'd like the pizza might have to do with your opinion on Domino's. However, the dining experience you get here is just plain FUN! At least at the local Chuck E. Cheese that used to be here, there were two dining areas--one that had a singing tiger, and another with several comedic puppets in window-like things. Either is entertaining while you're eating. And of couse, there's a play area and lots of games. I remember when I was little, there was even a tiny 18-inch tall door that you could enter from (which I did... guess I didn't think about getting germs crawling through the door). A great place for pizza for the young--and the young at heart.
