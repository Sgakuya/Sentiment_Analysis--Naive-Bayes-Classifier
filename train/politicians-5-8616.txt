When Reagan became president, the economy was a horror (inflation over 12%, prime rate around 15%, staflation), the Cold War raged, and the national psyche was depressed ( malaise according to President Carter). Reagan showed what a leader could do by pursuing a vision despite polls and negativism among the media. The result: we WON the Cold War (without firing a shot) and an unprecedented economic expansion and rising standard of living was started (continuing to this day). And we eventually grew our economy out of the deficits that pundits said would persist forever. Ronald Wilson Reagan: best president of my lifetime; best president of the 20th century (in my opinion).
