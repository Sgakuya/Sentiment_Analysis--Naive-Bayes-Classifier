I had the distinct pleasure of flying to Chicago back in '96 to see Malkovich at his home theatre of Steppenwolf when he had top billing in The Libertine, which he bought the film rights to. He was absolutely faultless! He was also very funny when I met him at the opening night in the lobby, and allowed me to have a photo taken with him after signing my (then-expired) VA license plate that bore his name, Malkovch. It was the night after 'Mary Reilly' opened in theatres, and I was still quivering! LOL! He is brilliant, cool, highly intelligent, incisive and truly mesmerizing in anything he puts his mind to. I never tire of his talent, presence and entire persona. Viva la MALKOVICH! And yes...In The Line of Fire was chilling, and 'Dangerous Liasons' was...umm...how you say? Arousing? Absolutely! :)
