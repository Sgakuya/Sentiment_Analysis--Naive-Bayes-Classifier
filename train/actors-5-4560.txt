In my humble opinion, the cardinal sin for a lead actor to commit is to give a half-arsed performance. This subconsciously effects all the other actors and drags the whole performance down into a turgid swamp of blandness. However, this cardinal sin is something Carrey could never be accused of. Carrey lends an infectious and, some would say, slightly insane, energy to all his movies. This pulsating, crazed energy, far from being a hindrance, is entirely apt for the parts he plays. Who else could play his role in a film like Liar Liar where Carrey plays, to perfection, the part of a pathological liar driven insane by a truth-inducing curse? Who else could play his part in The Cable Guy, where Carrey ably portrays a TV-reared psychopath whose knowledge of life was garnered by watching exaggerated caricatures of it? Who else could be Ace Ventura, a man who's wild and animalistic in his ways because he relates better to beasts than humans? Who else could be Jim Carrey? For many, overacting is an unfortunate affliction; for Carey, it's an art form.
