Here, you have a program that is currently on the rise. Lou Holtz has done a masterful job of motivating his players and helping them play and conduct themselves to their fullest potential. The Gamecock fan base is, without a doubt, the best and most loyal in the nation--they stood by this team and continued to sell out their stadium even while mired in a 21-game losing streak. They have turned the corner and are beating the teams they should, and now hold the edge over their closest rivals (Clemson and Georgia). I would now like to see this team learn how to win the proverbial Big Game , that being Tennessee and/or Florida. Success breeds higher expectations, and I expect big things out of this team in the near future!
