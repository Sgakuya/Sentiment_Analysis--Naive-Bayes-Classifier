Nothing aggrevates me more than seeing someone like unothename post such vile slander toward a country he knows so little about (not surprisingly, he posted wonderful praises about Canada). Does America have an obesity problem? Yes, of course we do and we also have an anorexia problem...does that make us a nation of third world skinny people? Mentioned in the previous post was Michael Jordan. Now I don't know much about sports but I do know that Jordon was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth and worked hard to get where he is today. I also know that Jordan is just one of many *many* examples of how anyone can become the receipient of fame and fortune and in turn serve as a prime example for millions of today's youth. I also find it interesting that the previous reviewer found the more liberal parts of the United States as decent (keep in mind that Canada is, self-admittedly, a liberal nation). Many of the foreign countries who attack our foreign/domestic policy's and our culture do so simply because we have a different way of handeling things. I understand the need to cooperate with other countries but not to the point where we are ruled by others and their views. Hate to break it to you unothename but that's not called arrogance- it's called common sense. And that common sense is what has lead this country down the path of success (with bumps, of course) in such a short time...it's also something we inherited from our Founding Fathers.
