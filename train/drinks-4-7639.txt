Jim Beam Brand's second-best effort, in my opinion. It's a complex, tasty, and all-around top-notch bourbon. The test of good bourbon is this: can you drink it neat? This you can. It's got some bite to it, and could stand to be a bit smoother, but you do need to try this. Knob Creek is the source for the water uses in distillation, and not coincidentally is the stream Abraham Lincoln grew up beside. If you haven't tasted Knob Creek, you don't know much about American Greats. IF you don't know who Abe Lincoln was, ditto. Jim Beam Brand's best in my opinion is Jim Black, which is a slight bit more affordable and very true to the Bourbon style. But you can't miss Knob Creek. That would be a sin.
