I finally saw The Green Mile this weekend on Pay per view. I had held out a long time on seeing this since I thought it was going to be the same old story done over again. I was expecting the worst and was pleasantly surprised. It was actually a good movie. The acting was really good. I am a Tom Hanks fan and he proved himself again in this movie as a fine actor. The story was moving and it was put together really well. I don't by any means think this is the best movie I have ever seen but it is definately better than I expected. I guess I shouldn't have doubted Stephan King as much as I did. I like most all of his work.
