As someone who lives in West Virginia, let me explain why we love Senator Byrd so much. West Virginia is a very poor state, in some instances approaching third world status. Robert Byrd has done everything in his power to bring programs, roads and jobs to West Virginia. We can count on him to do the right thing for his state, and it will be a great loss when he retires or dies. With the decreasing supply and demand for coal, and the ability to mine it without as much labor, West Virginia needs all the help it can get in bringing new industry to the state. I am a registered Republican, but I always vote for Robert Byrd. Any West Virginian would be a fool not too.
