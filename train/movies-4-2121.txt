Anyone who wants to chart the degeneration of the action picture over the past 20-30 years has only to compare this minor masterpiece with the current/recent crop of pap being churned out by Norris or Van Damme or Segal or Stallone or...whomever. Dirty Harry was essentially a Republican conservative's wet dream but, for all that, it was entertaining and effective. Eastwood was never an actor of any great range or ability, but he had exactly the right charisma and skill for the parts he specialized in, and he's perfect here as the ruthless, iconoclastic cop. The action never flags, and the supporting actors are wonderful too (I agree with Callitdowntheline75 that Andy Robinson is outstanding as the killer). Add into the mixture the beautiful scenery of San Francisco, a healthy measure of 70's cynicism and humor, the direction of Don Siegel, and a screenplay based in part on the true-crime killing spree of the Zodiac Killer of the late 60's, and you have a superlative action thriller, whatever your political leanings may be (mine are decidedly liberal). You also have to take off your hat to Eastwood, whose career has survived and thrived over the years. He's become, if not a great actor, then an actor well worthy of respect (I thought he was great in Unforgiven) and a very accomplished director. Compare this picture with anything comparable coming out now, and all you can do is shake your head and think, How far we have descended.
