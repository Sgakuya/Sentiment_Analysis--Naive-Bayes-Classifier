As a film, The Passion of the Christ gives a pretty accurate depiction of the last twelve hours of Jesus Christ. The entire cast does a tremendous job at portraying their individual characters. Even reading the subtitles did not feel like a chore (and I despise animes and other feature films that are not dubbed. The only problem I have with the film is it's supernatural influenced depiction of the death of Judas. His death had to have had some liberties taken into consideration because I don't remember little kids getting possessed, biting and attacking him, and finally chasing him until he hung himself. Other than that, the film is very moving for anyone who admires a good triumphs over evil story. It definitely stands on it's own feet.
