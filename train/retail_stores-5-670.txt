I love this store! And GAP is the parent company so I wouldn't think the quality could be that much worse than GAP. I have 2 young daughters and buy the largest portion of their clothes from here each season and I find nothing wrong with the quality. Actually the clothes get passed from my oldest to the youngest and then to my niece and are still in great shape. I also find some good deals there for myself too. I do find that I have to try on all of the pants because they don't fit the same and I have had to take back one or two items because of a small hole or something (returns are very easy) but I've had to do that with some of the more expensive merchandise I've purchased too.
