I really don't give a crap if Michael Moore wants to say what he wants to say. This country protects the rights of those who choose to speak what's in their minds, even for garbage like this sadistic ogre. In any case, Moore ought to know that what he has to say may have serious repercussions not only for himself, but for everyone around him. Speaking of unprofessionality, why did this piece of trash refer to the Bush Administration in reference to the break up of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston recently? Does he know he's EXTREMELY ANNOYING for bringing this up constantly? Moore honestly needs to get a life.
