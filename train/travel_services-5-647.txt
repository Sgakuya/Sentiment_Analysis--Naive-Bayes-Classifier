I don't understand what people have against Logan. There are no long walks to anywhere, everything is clearly labelled, and the airport runs smoothly. What else matters? So it isn't all linear and grid-like. Neither is the rest of Boston!! Who really cares about the architecture, honestly? I have flown into and out of BOS dozens of times and only had one canellation and maybe 1-2 delays due to weather. Now that the Silver Line goes right up to the terminals, getting there on the T is really easy, too. For the record, the 9/11 terrorists passed through security at Bangor, not at Logan. So you can't say Logan has a poor security record.
