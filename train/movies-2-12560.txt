Coming off of Dawn of the Dead, I was expecting a similairly good movie that was interesting and entertaining. I was disappointed that this one wasnt as good. The premise of the movie, that the survivors of the zombie transformation have barricaded themselves in a protected city and the zombies are evolving, was interesting. The movie just didnt deliver the same level of suspense and humor that Dawn Of the Dead did. What really got me was how the genius gas attendant zombie was always figuring everything out. I wasnt buying it and apparently neither were anyone else. This movie has slipped out of the theaters. It just wasnt that good. Dennis Hopper did a decent job as the Trump-like leader of the city though.
