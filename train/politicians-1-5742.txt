Undoubtedly Hillary Clinton is both intelligent and shrewd. She knows her way around politics and knows what it takes to do a good job-- However, I can't get past the facts. She has been involved in too many corrupt schemes. She has her own best interests at heart. I look BIll and Hillary and am awed by the fact that they have made it this far given their crooked history. They are crooked, Self-serving, and, in my opinion, of such low moral standing that neither deserves the respect, let alone any authority, over any population of the american people. I hope that Bill is brought up on charges after he is out of office and I hope Hillary suffers the consequences of all her corrupt dealings in a very public manner.
