I have a professional job that demands a suit maybe once a week and somewhat conservative, professional clothing on other days. The skirts and slacks from Ann Taylor are often excellent options for this kind of workplace, and I appreciate the quality (nice fabrics, well-made lining). But I have one recurring problem: the sweaters and especially the blouses are cut for less voluptuous women. I'm not fat (size 10) but my bra size is a D-cup and I have never found a blouse I could button up without a gap in the front. So for now I look for bottoms. I'm still on the lookout for a classy source that offers professional clothes for busty women!
