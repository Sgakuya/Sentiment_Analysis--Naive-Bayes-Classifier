King Kong is an epic good for what it is. Being over 3 hours it was a bit of a commitment for any film; and while I was amused through the duration of the film, I really didn't dwell on it too much that night. However, the special effects were seemless and worked very well in the movie. The story was solid and avoided boring us with a story we have heard a thousand times. The acting was really good and I was impressed at how well everyones character was displayed. It was even excellent at showing the bond develop between kong and his captive (ms. darril?). See this movie if you want a fun adventure type thrill...and have time on your hands.
