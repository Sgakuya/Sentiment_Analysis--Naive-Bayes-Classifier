95 Windstar with 67000 m.had a head gasket job done in Jan.2000, 2wks later the engine blew.The local Ford dealership serv. mgr is helpful but not good enough, after much complaining the area mgr for FORD CA. is offering to replace the engine for half the cost 2000.00. We're still out 1800.00 from the head gasket job and now 2000.00 for the engine. I won't rest until FORD accepts responsibilityCONT'D ...and reimburses us the 4000.00 back. The newspapers,TV, radio, will here about this.This is unacceptable. Does FORD realize the power that consumers have,now with the internet it's so easy to communicate. I consider this problem a safety issue;(we have KIDS what if the van broke down on a family trip in the middle of nowhere)If any Canadians read this please e mail me we need to group together. I e mailed FORD of CANADA on Jan.22,2000 and got back nothing but a automatic generic reply stating they would contact me within 3 days...well it's been more than that and I haven't heard anything from them so I e mailed them twice since and still haven't heard anything. I talked to Tessa a rep at FORD cust. service in Toronto and all she could say is NO COMMENT at least 20 times during ourconversation. CHECK OUT http://home.att.net/'ccatanese/ford/mainx.htm
