I just bought a used Aztec, and I so love it! Although some people have called it fugly I prefer things that are out of the norm, and we also have, what others have called, a fugly dog, an English bull terrier (looks like Spuds Mackenzie)...Anyhow, I always found cars dull and the minivan I used to drive just didn't seem to represent me since I am not a suburban soccer mom. This vehicle, besides being unique, has proven to be utilitarian..our dogs love it..and I can carry 5 adults plus our dogs and/or lots of luggage. My minivan used to be more awkward since it didn't have four doors or much usable space with the hatch in the back. I love the fact that it came with a tent, lots of starage areas/hooks/nets and a slide out cargo tray. It also rides very smoothly and accelerates well. I had read reviews that said it felt tippy, but I disagree. And the LOUD cd/stereo kicks major butt!
