This is my browser of choice. Tabbed browsing, Ad blocking, popup blocking, no crashes, works on all sites, light on resources. Lots of ways to configure it for safe browsing and lots of plug-in options to choose from. Frequent updates - including security updates. This browser is much more functional than FireFox and I have had NO security problems or spyware problems. I have tried other browsers but always return to Maxthon. I highly recommend this browser and cannot say enough good things about it. Try it - you'll like it! Note: No matter which browser you choose, always use a firewall, antivirus and spyware programs like SpyBot S & D or AdAware.
