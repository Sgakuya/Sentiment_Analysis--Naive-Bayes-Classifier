Here is a very fine actor who needs more attention. After going after the film career big time in the past decade and a half I hope he hasn't given up on the celluloid in favor of the more stable lifestyle the tube affords.He's way too talented to devote his considerable talent to the little screen alone.He's been more than competent in supporting roes in Primal Fear , City of Angels , Frequency and in the midst of that maelstrom of ensemble brilliance Glory .He has acquired another respectable credential for his bold,charismatic Henry V performed at the Delacorte in NYC.Lots more of his fans know him from Homicide:Life on the Street and the recent Gideon's Crossing but he has the skills and look for the movie screen. All he needs is the right lead role to bring his brand of sizzle to complete his star cycle. Such a sexy baritone too!
