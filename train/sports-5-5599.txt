Listen, you can dis this kid all you want. I have been a student and fan of this game a very long time, and this kid IS THE SH*T! Nobody can stop him .NOBODY! I mean RON ARTEST can't stop him! He has a negative reputation, but HE IS THE SH*T! I am confused by people who don't see it. This kind of talent comes around once a generation! What is wrong with this country?.....this kid was the best player in the nation as a freshman! I say these things with NO BIAS..........I think it's obvious! HE DOMINATES ALL THIS SH*T, AND NOBODY SEEMS TO NOTICE! TO PUT IT SIMPLY, NOBODY IN THE NNNNBBBBAAAA CAN TOUCH HIM! Is everybody blind...........we haven't seen this kind of domination in college since.............my god, ever!
