You want to talk about intelligence? Here is a man that tells blatant lies on national TV and doesn't has the nerve to act surprised whe he is caught. Here is a man that concedes an election that takes it back like a child who doesn't want to share his toys. Here is a man that lacks the manners it takes to stick to his word and follow the rules that he agreed to beforehand in a debate. This man is a snake and a compulsive liar. He's an opportunist and the thought of him as our next president makes me sick to my stomach. I have to fight the urge to run for Europe to escape exactly what that man represents and people like him. Why don't I? Because I'm enough of an idealist to think that we still have hope for a nation that has survived against all odds when so many others have failed. I can't help but think that even though I am terrified that my little boy will grow up thinking that people like Clinton and Gore are good role models to follow. Most of all, I have a hope that we can once again be a country that has thousands of little boys saying Mommy, when I grow up I want to be president! The presidential position IS about character, it IS about being liked, and it IS about how well you can take advice from people who know better than you do. Bush doesn't pretend to know everything and isn't afraid to ask for help. That shows GREAT intelligence and maturity. Our president sets an example for us and represents us to other nations. Do you really expect to maintain good foreign relations when WE don't even like our OWN president? Don't get me wrong - I think Gore has his place. He is a talented chameleon that has no foundation. He is able to change to fit the situation he is in with no regard to principle or integrity. That is a talent - and belongs on the stage. NOT in our Oval Office.
