In general, I'm a big fan of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a classic adventure movie, and the third one - with Sean Connery as Indy's dad - was pretty good. But what the hell happened with #2 in the series? Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, despite having a great character to work with, a great actor in the leading role, and a huge budget, manages to be really, really bad. First of all, what were they thinking introducing that annoying kid? Tossing a cute kid into an established set of characters is a sure sign of creative stagnation (e.g., Oliver's appearance on the Brady Bunch). But I'm not sure who was worse - that kid or Spielberg's wife, Kate Capshaw, who screams and whines annoyingly throughout the movie. The plot was lame, the dialogue was weak, and the action sequences were silly (come on, how ridiculous was that rubber raft dropping out a plane, landing on a snowy mountaintop, then sliding all the way down to a tropical river?). This movie could and should have been so much better!
