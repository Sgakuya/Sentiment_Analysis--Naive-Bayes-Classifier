Here's my story and I swear it's true. I purchased a Radio Shack telephone/answering system in May of 2002 for $99 + tax. The telephone stopped working in November of 2002. Because Radio Shack's policy is to not refund money or replace a defective item after 30 days of purchase they sent it in for repair. 3 weeks later I got the telephone/answering system back. This was covered under the 1 yr. warranty so it didn't cost me anything but 3 weeks without the phone. It did cost Radio Shack $39 for parts and labor + shipping. Radio Shack has now discontinued this item and had it on sale for $59 in December. In January of 2003 the telephone stopped working again. It was doing exactly what it was in November of 2002. The manager at the local Radio Shack insisted that the battery needed to be replaced and that was all that was wrong even though no mention of this was made the first time the phone stopped working. I replaced the battery and charged it for 24 hrs. Needless to say the telephone still didn't work so now Radio Shack is sending it back in for repair. It's incredible to me that their store managers haven't got the ability to at least exchange a defective product. Especially after it's already been 'repaired' once. I'm looking forward to another 3 weeks without my phone/answering system. I will never buy anything at Radio Shack again because the frustration of dealing with them should something go wrong is just way to much.
