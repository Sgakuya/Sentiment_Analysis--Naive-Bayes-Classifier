Samantha Morton is one of my favourite actresses along with Dame Judi and Angela Bassett as shes all about talent and less about looks. She's got taste as the majority of her choices for film roles are independent like Morvern Callar, Pandemonium, Jesus' Son, Sweet and Lowdown and In America so she can avoid the horrible popcorn Hollywood films that would porbably stifle her incredible talent. She's very out-spoken and honest which is refreshing, where stars are promted by their PR people to be nice she says what she knows is the truth. Samantha acts in films that are important to her as every character she has played has the utmost sincerity and that's enough to secure her longivity in her career.
