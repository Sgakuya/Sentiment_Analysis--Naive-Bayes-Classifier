I was originally pretty psyched to see this movie, but I came out disappointed. If you saw the trailers, you pretty much saw all the good parts (though they cut out the I'm prophesizing scene from the movie, which was a real disappointment). The Wayans brothers weren't a part of this movie, which was also a huge disappointment since they had made the first two (though the second one wasn't that great, I still liked that one better than this one). The really scary part of this movie is I hear they had shot a fourth installment of the series (http://entertainment.msn.com/movies/movie.aspx?m=540280) back to back with this one.
