I own two Jeep Grand CherokeeLaredo's. 1994 with 139,000 miles on it. My teenage daughter now drives it and it runs like a clock. NO major problems with it since the day I bought it new. The way it is running it likely will be around for another 139,000 miles. 1998 Grand Cherokee: runs great with 70,000 miles on it again no major problems since the day I bought it. Both provide a smooth comfortable ride. When it is snowing the 4 wheel drive provides a confident driving expereince. They look sharp. Tires last a long time and wear down evenly. I will never stray from Jeep as long as they last and perform like these two have.
