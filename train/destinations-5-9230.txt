The Niagra falls are very beautiful and look really gorgeous in the day time, they are a real good sight for the family to see, They have changed over the years and the cave of the winds tour used to take you under the falls but sadly, there was a fatal accident that caused them to not be able to show you the cave, you just go outside and around the falls. The falls look even better at night! they are illuminated by laser lights and they look all misty and they alternate the colors, that is the best time to see them is at night! The way the mist form the water is colored by the laser lights looks very relaxing and very cool. I had fun there and our trip weas awesome. my dad went there many years ago for his-n-mom's honeymoon and he really thought they've changed, it really is a great vacation spot and Is a great place to go!
