One of the most diverse and interesting states in the country. I live in San Francisco, which by itself is amazing, but it never fails to impress me how much there is to do just a short drive away. You can drive down the coast to camp in Big Sur, you can drive about three hours to hike in Yosemite, you can head up to Tahoe to ski, snowboard, or mountain bike, you can be at the wineries of Sonoma or Napa in under an hour And that s just in northern California. San Diego is beautiful, and LA is like its own little world. There s a reason this state is expensive and crowded it s an extremely desirable place to live.
