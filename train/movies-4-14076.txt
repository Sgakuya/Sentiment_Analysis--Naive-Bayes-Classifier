I really liked this movie.A real feel good kind of movie. Kevin Costner plays a man who hears a voice in his corn field If you build it, he will come It turns out to be a baseball field which he builds in his cornfield. Months later Shoeless Joe Jackson shows up to pay a game soon other famous baseball players from the past show up. He still gets messages which prompts him to go to New York to get a writer played by james Earl Jones.What I love about this movie is it is about second chances and reconciliation that Ray has with his late dad. A chance to patch up a past with his dad. There are some great actors in this movie.I am not a huge baseball fan but i found myself cheering for the the past baseball players who had a chance to play the game they loved so much. Burt Lanchaster was also great in his role.I would really give this about a 4.5.
