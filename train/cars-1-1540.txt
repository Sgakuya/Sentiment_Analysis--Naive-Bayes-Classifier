I was so excited to be buying my beetle (October 2000, I have a 2001). They were just the most appealing car I had seen. After owning my car for 3 years I can honestly say t's been nothing but trouble! Complete nightmare actually. My list of repairs: 1. New disc changer (warrantee) 2. Middle console broke off in my hand! $30 3. The switch on the door to open the gas tank broke $100 4. Did NOT pass it's very first safety inspection due to the mass airflow meter. Talked the dealership into paying for that. But... 5. Mass airflow meter blew out the O2 sensors $172 6. Car burns oil like crazy! Dealership eventually decided (after 3 years of trouble) I needed a WHOLE NEW ENGINE! The pistons are the wrong size (my car was built wrong!). Glad it was under warrantee but as soon as I got it back it wouldn't start! Got it back to the dealership...now needs a new battery and alternator for the bargain price of $990! Here are a few other new beetle problems. Headlights burn out constantly...I've had 3. You HAVE to go to the dealership to get them replaced. Will cost anywhere between $60 and $80 each. Also you are expected to never you soap or hand lotion because it warps and peals the paint on the inside door handles. Not to mention if you have a sunroof you have to open a window or pay extra for a wind deflector. Other wise the car make a terrible pressure beating noise! My advice as an owner...RUN FAR FAR AWAY FROM THE DEALERSHIP! GET ANYTHING ELSE...EVEN A BICYCLE!
