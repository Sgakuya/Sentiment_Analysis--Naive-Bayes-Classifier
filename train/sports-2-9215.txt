I'm amazed that, even on this board, people are still convinced that Rose is a quality player, even though he stopped even giving that illusion years ago. He used to be able to score some, which made him of at least decent value, but now he has slipped into the depths of utter mediocrity: possibly the worst shot selction in the league, moribund passing and ballhandling, pedestrian rebounding, a poor attitude... and that's just his offense! Defensively, Rose is the most apathetic and appallingly lazy defender in basketball, frequently not even deigning to run back on defense, leaving his poor teammates to fend for themselves. Even when he was scoring, it didn't make up for his sad defense, so now... well, let's just say Toronto would be better off if he didn't play at all.
