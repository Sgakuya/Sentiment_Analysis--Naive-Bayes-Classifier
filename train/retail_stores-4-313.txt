I absolutely love the lingerie from Victoria's Secret. The bras (Body by Victoria) are very durable and comfortable. The more exotic pieces are very sexy and fit nicely. As for those who complain about lingerie quality, learn how to launder lingerie properly (usually spelled: hand wash ). Do you really think that the delicate and lacy lingerie can actually survive the washing machine and dryer? I remember learning the hard way when I first went to college and ruined some lingerie by machine laundering. Oops! Be careful with some casual clothing, though; they wash but don't dry well. The clothes made of rayon or cotton+spandex can shrink a noticable amount (one inch for every fifteen to twenty) if you tumble dry them with the normal cycle. They've started labeling many of the dressier pieces Dry clean only to avoid this shrinkage problem. This leaves me guessing which ones I can wash without shrinking ...
