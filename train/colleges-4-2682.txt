Good program, but I hear its administration is lacking. For a small private school as this one, I hear the students don't get the individual attention they deserve. There aren't any systematic processes in place to assist students to keep track of their credits. In fact, students are told up to a week before graduation whether they have or not the necessary credits to walk! How crazy is that?!! A week before???? Can they try telling them a semester in advance instead? Is that too difficult? The school has 2,500 students... You'd think they'd give a flip about them, especially considering those studens will surely be receiving a nice little letter on the mail each year asking for donations. Boy, I sure hope they get their act together in that arena. The music program, on the other hand, is great.
