The apex of American brewing. I can still remember my first Sammy A, on a cold New Years in central Maine, on special for $12 bucks a case, Scotch Ale XXX. I'm not sure weather I started buying and drinking it because I enjoyed the flavor or because my friends couldn't stand to drink it; leaving it ALL for me. Although I prefer Newcastle, Bass, Black and Tans at the bar, I still consider Sammy A my fav, because it is so much better than the pretend beers, Bud, Miller etc. (How can anyone drink that swill?). I've even gone so far as to ship a 6-pack half way across the world (Bahrain) to satisfy the cravings of a Sammy A fan. Give it up Budweiser, you are and remain the King of swill, God how can anyone drink the stuff...is there any correlation between the number of brain cells and taste buds?
