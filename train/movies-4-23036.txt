Now for you big fans i don't mean to dampen the fabulous hype if Spiderman, but after seeing it, i was a bit disappointed. All of the hype about it fails to mention the big soppy bits in it that drag down the movies appealing tone. The characters and acting are great and i commend them on their performances especially Willem Defoe who plays a great physco-mutant-man. The effects were astonishing and overall made the movie what it is. But, i do find that the let down was the soppy love story and its intervention with the story. Their is more focus on the damsel in distress than on the task at hand. Overall, a good movie that shines through, but don't be suprised at the let down of the story when it comes to love.
