I work at MCI for a major airline and I hear the complaints everyday about how horrible the airport is...and I understand. The airport just completed a $258 million renovation, but they didn't solve any of the problems, but pretty much gave it a sleek, modern face-lift. There are no concessions or restrooms in the gate hold rooms, so each time a passenger inside the gate area wants something to eat, has to use the bathroom, or even wants to pick up a magazine, they must gather all their belongings (can't leave 'em unattended), and proceed outside of the security checkpoint and re-enter and be screened again. MCI was a great airport when it first opened in 1971 before security was a major concern... The city of KC calls this the most passenger friendly airport in the country. I have a hard time believing this when I hear complaints everyday about how bad the airport is laid out. Really, KC is loosing business b/c I've heard that customers will avoid KC at all cost when they have to make a connection. I don't blame them. However, things will change (hopefully). I wrote a letter to several media outlets and copied KCI airport administration...and my coworkers and myself encouraged each customer who complained about the airport design to write to the administration. After completing the renovation, they were under budget, so they will retrofit all the gate areas for restrooms and possibly snack stands. KCI could be a great airport, but the design really henders any growth.
