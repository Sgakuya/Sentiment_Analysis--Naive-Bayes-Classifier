Madison handled the crisis that was the War of 1812 rather well. He exhausted all options before declaring war, and even then was reluctant to do so. The troops, while suffering a few losses, were eventually victorious and thus settled the disputes in the ocean with Great Britain for the time being. Madison was respected by the people of his time and would measure up well against today's standards (well, of course, it is given that we seem to have a certain disgrace in the White House at the moment, whose name I dare not say lest it curse me with bad luck). He was a master of domestic enhancement, and contrary to popular belief, he did not OPPOSE the Bonus Bill of 1816 that would have set up a needed road system; he frequently promoted such an idea. However, the bill was considered unconstitutional, and thus he was driven to veto it. Madison, with some tough shoes to fill of the presidents before him, performed rather well in the office of president. *Note, this is leaving out the fact that he IS the Father of the Constitution, which, if included in my opinion, could have easily justified a 5-star rating.
