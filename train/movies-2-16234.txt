wait did i miss something? after the sixth sense and the previews for this one, i had extremely high expectations. however, as i sat through the movie i had the sensation that i was being cheated out of $6.25. the writer had basically come up with enough plot to fuel a quarter of a movie, and then dr-a-a-a-a-a-agged it out for a while. each scene was too slow and over contrived, making the random moments of violence the only break in the monotony. the part that they showed in the pilot was noteworthy, but the rest of the movie failed to maintain the same speed. i felt like i didn't know the main characters well enough to really care, and some parts just didn't add up: for instance, bruce willis had to go around asking people if he'd ever been sick or not, don't you think you would remember whethher or not you'd ever had that sensation? overall, i feel this movie could have been a lot better. the acting and dramatic ending were wasted on a half assed story.
