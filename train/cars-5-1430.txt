This car is great for people who want a low-stress, low-maintenance, reliable ride. It doesn't have a lot of frills and its looks are a bit peculiar...but the low price and Toyota seal of quality more than make up for that. Cars are a poor money investment...they depreciate no matter what accessories you add to them. So if you're going to put money into a car, you should invest in getting a reliable car and in maintaining it mechanically. Don't waste money on a car with a purple spoiler or vibrating ash tray. A smart car consumer knows this. The ECHO delivers dependability without the unnecessary frills, and I highly recommend giving the Echo a test-drive.
