I am so sick of the notion that Carolina somehow wronged this Curry kid. 'Oh, he's such a great kid! Why wouldn't Roy give him a chance?' 6 DRUG FELONIES, people! Anybody that is surprised by a kid with 6 DRUG FELONIES, not being welcomed to the UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, is an idiot. On top of those felonies, the kid , as well as his parents are LIARS! He and his family were asked several questions about what kind of people he hung out with, what he did on weekends, had he ever been involved in any drug activities, etc. They obviously blew smoke up our butts. Lying alone would get his scholarship revoked - forget the felonies. He is hell of a player. You don't break the record for scoring in the state of North Carolina if you're not - there have been some great ones. But OK State can take him. That ain't the type of ship we're running here. It's sad. I know he dreamed of becoming a Tarheel, and it makes me sad. But he should be sorry and sad to us as well. Ya know, Roy had a premonition about the kid: Matt Dougherty recruited him, and after Matt was gone and long before the charges against Curry, Roy was asked if he would be honoring Matt's scholarship of Curry. Roy said, If he doesn't get in trouble. We'll see. Roy knew what kind of kid he was. 1 star for OK State for not caring. I'm glad Curry gets a second chance, but I'm even more glad he ain't in Chapel Hill. We've had enough problems. And dookie V can flap his lips all he wants about us revoking his scholarship, about second chances, but Roy did the smart thing. Hell, that kid couldn't even get in the game for us anyway. Who's he gonna play ahead? Sheeeit, he would not have gotten off the bench until his junior year, so, really he made a good decision, felonies or not.
