I read the comments with great interest. I did my MBA at U of P. The course material was the same as with any other program. You went to the same web sites for the projects. You know this as you have to log in and you see every other school there. Their approach is simple. They allow access to an area where the traditional student can not go due to location or schedule. Just like any other school, you get what you put into it. There will always be free loaders. I could have gone anywhere, I picked it by schedule. If you need a school name to get further ahead, well then good luck, however I work with the Ivy League grads, many are very bright, but I could care less where they got their degree from. It's what you do with it that matters. I also had my mix of good and bad instructors. Is it really any different anywhere? I had that going back to grade school. Of course they are interested in making money, most private schools have endowments and state schools have the tax payer. Paying more for an instructor does not guarantee you better instructors. An alternate motive would be they want people there who want to do this, not who need the money. If my recruiter would not interview anyone because of where they went to school, I would fire them. That is silly statement. Just because they do it differently, does not mean it is inferior. If you want to get something out of it, simply put something into it.
