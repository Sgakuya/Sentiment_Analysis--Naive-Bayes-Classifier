One of the priceless tiny jewels from the Beatrix Potter box of treasures;the illustrations are enchanting,impeccable.As an artist,(not just storyteller), she is now gaining due appreciation.Peter Rabbit will appeal immensely to infants.As a junior, i loved the longer,somehow enigmatic and mysterious,though still witty,Tale of Mr Tod,in which an older Peter and cousin Benjamin Bunny appear.All of these immensely popular books have great individual merit.(The original setting for Mr McGregor's garden was at Tenby,Wales,though most of the other tales were in the Lake District countryside in England,where the author lived.)
