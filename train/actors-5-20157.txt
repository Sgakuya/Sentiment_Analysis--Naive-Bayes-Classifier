I love courteney!! I think she is such a great actress!! She is funny on friends and acts great in scream (damn dude can she scream loud). i have seen like all her movies (the shrink is in, screams, 3000 miles to graceland, get well soon, ect) and she is great in all of them!! I also love david and i think they make a great couple!! I think courteney looks great, and if she gets pregnant she will look good with a belly too. Dont judge her if you dont kno her!! I really liked the 20/20 interveiw with barbara walters!! Her and david are so cute i love them!! And have you seen her dogs they are so cute. I wish courteney the best of luck with everything and i love ya!! im ur #1 fan!!
