I have lived in the city of Minneapolis for five years, and would consider it the finest city in the midwest, and one of the best in the nation. The architecture is superb--name one other metro of 3 million or less in the U.S. with a skyline that even comes close to Minneapolis. The arts scene here is second to none, tons of theater, and also one of the finest contemporary art museums (Walker) and sculpture gardens in the nation. Downtown is vibrant, with 180,000 workers, and 30,000 residents; and the restaurants and hotels there are truly becoming world class. Le Meridian Art+Tech has been rated one of the top 100 hotels in the world by Conde Nast, and Solera has been rated one of the top 100 restaurants in the world by Food+Wine Magazine. To the person who said Minneapolis has almost no diversity: The city is almost 40% minority. Compare this to Portland, OR and Boston, MA.
