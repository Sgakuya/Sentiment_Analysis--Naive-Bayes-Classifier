I live in the Bay Area and have grown accustomed to trash in the streets, aggressive homeless people and panhandlers in Santa Cruz and San Francisco, and diversity to the extreme (The malls and clubs are packed with Asian and Indian people. That is fine for most folks here, but I prefer more variety.) The place has as much class and culture as the trash in the streets. While San Francisco boasts of the greatest public transportation system in the world, the streets are narrow, one way, and dirty. The city is very compact, tiny yards, neighbors a few feet away, etc. The Bay Area likes to celebrate diversity and multiculturalism. It is the highest value of the area. Everything else is secondary to this sacred value. If you like to stand in line at Starbucks and listen to Chinese, Vietnamese, and a host of many languages, people yammering on cell phones in many third world dialects, then move to the Bay Area. If you like overcrowding, fixer uppers for $800,000, and not a taste but complete immersion in multiculturalism, the Bay Area is for you. It does have nice hiking areas and a some nature nearby - which is why a lot of environmentalists go ga ga over the city.
