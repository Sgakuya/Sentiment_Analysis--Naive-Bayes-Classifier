I would agree with AZexpat. I found Phoenix to be sprawling, smoggy and with traffic becoming as bad as some California cities-without the balmy coastal California climate. Sedona is beautiful- as is the Grand Canyon,minus the growing pollution. Trouble with Phoenix -it has a hot inferno of a climate from late April through late October.Dry heat? Sure, but still damn hot! Crime is bad, schools are mediocre at best, and the influx of people is outstripping the ability of the region to supply decent services. Homebuilding and in migration are what drive this economy. I enjoyed Tucson more- but this cities growth is also predicated on new residents and housing, and there is much crime.
