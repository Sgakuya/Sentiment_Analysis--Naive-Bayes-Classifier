Alan Iverson is a true solder with a lion heart. His game is outstanding! He has lead his team to the NBA finals despite the negative images. I believe that the problem with so many lawyers/doctors/businessmen that watch the games today judge him the same way they judge man people that do not look/act in their manner (even Iverson has done this). Despite his appearance and maybe some immature behavior/lyrics - he is not the person to be afraid of. Hopefully Iverson (maybe unknowingly) will teach fans the game of life and not just the game on the court - Although he still has much room to grow (as we all do) he has come a long ways. I think Iverson is the player of this time (the new type of player) and representing this generation - and his props are due!
