After seeing the Green Mile, I am abosolutely in awe and mesmorized by this man. I have seen him on so many talk shows and I just love a man who has so much respect and love for his mother. She did a wonderful job raising her kids, but especially him. I loved this movie also because it makes you look at life and what is really important. Life is all about making good memories for those you leave behind. I would love to be Michael's friend. I am sure that all the old girlfriends he has had are all looking him up now. I would love to sit down and have dinner and just talk to him. He seems to be a truly nice and thoughtful human being. If ever I hit the lottery, the I will find a way to get to him so that I could buy him dinner!!!
