beware the hype! this is the worst of all the john hughes movies, ever! hughes seems to betray himself by making the teenager the (known) winner in this, his most popular installment of his high-school mythology. (whatever happened to the winner being unknown and downtrodden by the powers that be? sell-out!) the constant beat-downs given to the principal, played perfectly by jeffrey jones, are wonderful, even (and especially into) the end credits, but the underdog spirit of hughes's other movies is trampled in this crassly marketable teen anthem. ferris's message is, make your life as cool as mine , so why does he generate so many followers?
