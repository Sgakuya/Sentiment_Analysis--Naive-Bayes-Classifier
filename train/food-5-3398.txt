After many let downs with so many So Called tastes like delivery, I no longer expect a good frozen pizza. However, after trying Puck's Barbeque Chicken, I will have to say it was the best frozen pizza I've had. The crust was crisp, and tasted like flat bread, not some dough substitute. The ingredients were acceptable, and flavorful, however they were a bit dry. The middle of the pizza dough was to moist, but I believe I may not have cooked it in optimum conditions. (Old Oven)Perhaps frozen pizza companies could place the toppings in baggies for the consumer to top the pizza then place it in the oven,I believe this would enhance overall results. I guess there is not a very high expectation of perfection, After all, we are eating frozen pizza.
