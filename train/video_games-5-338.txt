This game is excellent! If you like Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, or Star Wars, you have to get this game. It is a 3D action adventure, and while it is not very deep, it is a fun game. You blast your way through the new Star Wars, while meeting the annoying Jar Jar Binks, Anakin Skywalker, and other such memorable characters. You play as several different characters, including Obi-Wan, Qui-Gonn, the maid lady played by Natalie Portman, whatever her name is, and Captain Panaka, who had a glorious two scenes in the movie. My gripes: not the greatest graphics, overhead view can get annoying, second level is confusing.
