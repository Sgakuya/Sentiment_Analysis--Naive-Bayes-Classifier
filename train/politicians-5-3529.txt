Mr. Bush is one of the most effective Presidents I have ever seen. He is brave, moral, and is doing with a President should do for this nation...protecting it from those who want to harm us! In his short tenure to date, he has already launched successful military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, layed out a format to broker Mideast peace, identified a leader, Hamid Karzai, for afghanistan, offered reemployment packages and an economic stimulus package for the economy, routed our terrorists, and ordered the hunting down of rogue CEO's of malevolent companies. Bush does more before breakfast that Clinton ever did in his entire political career.
