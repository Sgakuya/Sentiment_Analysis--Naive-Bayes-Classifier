My family was in the ice cream parlor business when I was a teen and we tried many brands before picking one. (Alderney, a local New Jersey brand no longer in business because it was so expensive it couldn't compete with cheaper brands.) My Dad could tell you the milk fat content of ice cream by tasting it. I swear that Blue Bell must have the MINIMUM percentage of milk fat possible to qualify as ice cream. It has no richness or creaminess to it at all. Many supermarket brand ice creams are better. It is possibly the WORST branded ice cream sold anywhere in the United States. It does not compare with Hood (New England), Dryer's (California), or Kemp's (Minnesota). My test of an ice cream is to try the vanilla (though I rarely eat plain vanilla) because that way the true taste isn't disguished with mix-ins. If the ice cream is any good, the vanilla should taste like butter pecan -- minus the pecans. It should be very rich and buttery tasting. Blue Bell isn't like that at all. It tastes more like ice milk and because it's milk fat content is so low it gets icy when stored for awhile. I attribute its popularlity to a triumph of Texas pride over taste. The region of the country with the higheast per-capita consumption of ice cream also has the best ice cream, in my opinion, and that is New England.
