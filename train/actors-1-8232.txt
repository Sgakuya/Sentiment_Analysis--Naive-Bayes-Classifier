Joan Crawford was flawless as an actress. As a human being and as a mother she used people to get what she wanted. When she couldn't manipulate people the way she needed to then she became the tyrant and bully. Her life depicts the mind and psyche of a woman in torment. She carries nearly every attribute of someone with a serious mental illness. A star on the screen she was a horror in real life. What she did on the screen doesn't cancel out her horrendous crimes against other people, and more importantly her own children. She bought her children to increase her image with the press. Imagine what her children have lived through not knowing where they originally came from. They were bought on the black market because Joan couldn't get an adoption agency to qualify her to adopt. She did not want them because she wanted to be a mother. She only wanted them for her own sick motives to advance her career. Dispicable.
