Who am I foolin'? It never really impressed me and my positive rating depended solely on peer pressure--everyone else seemed to crown it as a lurid, pensive masterpiece, so it must be. Unfortunately not. The year was 1972 and when you think about what had already been accomplished in the ways of popular music, it makes this all the less impressive. How could the same band that put out Wish You Were Here come up with this? Time and Brain Damage have perhaps the most maladroit lyric phrasing I've ever come across: No one told you when to run/ You missed the starting gun . Pretentious piece of crap? Right again, Ruby.
