I loved this movie. I'll watch anything about Dracula, or vampires. I was not impressed with Reeves, or Ryder... bad casting. But Oldman... wow. what else can I say. Truly a magnificent actor. Sir Anthony Hopkins's supporting role was great.. couldnt think of seeing anyone else in this role. My favorite part of this movie is the opening sequence. The beginnings of Dracula.. really well done. The costumes were ok, nothing to wave an Oscar at. I haven't seen a great Dracula movie since the 1980's version with Frank Langella... wow, his eyes will hypnotize you. He portrayed Dracula as he should be... Romantic, not Monserous. Otherwise, good movie, worth seeing.
