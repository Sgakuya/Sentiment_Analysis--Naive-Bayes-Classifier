This is a perfect rent a movie. I had seen the previews and thought it was an interesting premises but not interested enough to go to the movies, so I saw this recently on video and it was just what I expected. It was a perfectly entertaining movie. It is about a man who talks to his deceased dad through radio waves (and through time). It is an interesting thought that the past and present are existing at the same time but that is besides the point. The father and son talk through the radio and through their talks change the present because they change the past. It definitely turned more into a drama than I expected. It had suspense and action throughout the whole movie. Rent it, it is worth it.
