Couple things. We are the second most asked about scholl by high school seniors behind Harvard. We are the oldest public university in America. We are the #3 academically ranked school in America. Some of our alums include F Lee Bailey, Tom Robbins, Thomas Wolff, Edward R Murrow, John Edwards, MJ, etc. Our campus is annually ranked in the top 3 most beautiful in america. Our girls are hotter than an Ethiopian barbecue. Our college town is annually ranked among the best places to live in America. Our medical and law schools are annually ranked among the best in America. We have the best of everything. We are borderline PERFECT. And no, we're not snobs, we're realist. I could go on. In other words, they're a lot of basketball fans whose team has gotten stomped by us for Carolina to be ranked #64. HATERS! Some would claim it's the best school in America! #64!? !!!! Whole lotta hatin goin on.
