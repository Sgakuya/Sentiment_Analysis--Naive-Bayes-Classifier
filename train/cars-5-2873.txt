I own a 2001 Sunset Orange Metallic Firebird T/A WS6 and I love it. This car is the meanest looking car on the road today -- and probably for many years to come -- and even though it's no longer in production it still turns heads everywhere it goes. The six-speed gear box is excellent, the torque is amazing, with simple mods you can put this car in the 11s or 10s. Mine goes from 0-60 in 4.7 seconds just with the GMMG exhaust and SLP intake lid. Mustangs are a joke, and keeping up with porsches is fun. Like everyone said, whoever rates this car with less than 5 stars don't know anything about muscle cars. Reaching 80mph in 2nd gear is not for everyone.
