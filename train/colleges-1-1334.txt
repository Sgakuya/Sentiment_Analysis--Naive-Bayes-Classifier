BEWARE COMMUNICATIONS COLLEGE UNDERGRADS: The new Asso. Dean for Undergraduate Studies is an academic of questionable integrity and qualifications. His leadership is certainly not of the high standard of excellence that students in Northwestern's Communications School have enjoyed in previous years. Before committing your academic and professional career on the credentials of this interloper, you would benefit from a little journalistic research behind the his hyped-up academic and professional credentials. It is info worthy of a Master's Thesis in Investigative Journalism for a savvy would-be reporter. Good Luck! http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/programs/undergraduate/new/
