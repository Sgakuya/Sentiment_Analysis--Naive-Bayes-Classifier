I have every reason to think that the Rangers will finish at the bottom of the AL West. The Rangers are rebuilding the team and it may take 2-3 years, some growing pains, before they can consider a .500 plus season. The loss of Palmeiro and Rodriguez will cost Texas at the plate but will free up some dollars to spend on some veteran pitchers and to develop the pitchers in their farm system. Kenny Rogers still pitches for the team (been there since late 1980's,amazing!)and may be able to give some pointers to the younger guys. I do like the addition of Soriano at second base for some power and much needed speed
