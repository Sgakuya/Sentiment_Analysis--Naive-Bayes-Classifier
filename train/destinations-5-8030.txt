I had the opportunity to visit Pearl Harbor in March 2003, coincidentally just as reports were circling that President Bush was about to declare war on Iraq. The experience brought me a sense of reality that no history class had come close to doing for me. The magestic beauty of Hawaii and the serene waters afforded a sense of peacefulness appropriate for a memorial, yet in stark contrast to the horrors of the catastrophe. I was immediately struck by the presence of so many small shrines floating above where each of ship went down, stretching across the distance. After taking in a short documentary film, I took the boat trip with my parents to stand on the gravesite of where half of the 2,390 casualties took place -- The USS Arizona. An uneasy silence loomed over all of us tourists as we looked below at a submerged piece of history. On a wall of the memorial, I gazed up at the long list of names whose futures were stolen. I vividly remember an elderly gentleman standing in front of me, breaking into sobs while his wife tried to comfort him. The irony of the Pearl Harbor tragedy is seeing how harmoniously multicultural residents of Hawaii have become today. A strong presence of Japanese and mainland American tourists interweave with easy friendliness among the native Polynesian Americans. The island is racial unity at its best. Regardless of one's feelings about war, I wholeheartedly recommend gaining the experience of visiting Pearl Harbor for those fortunate enough to visit Hawaii. Not only do you gain a deeper appreciation of veterans of war, you also gain a richer perspective and understanding in regards to the consequences of colossal failures in world relations.
