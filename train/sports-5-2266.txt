This was the greatest World Series in my life time (I am 32)! As a Mets fan I am extremely sad that they lost. Every game could have gone either way, even after Clemens dominated. I was lucky enough to go to games 1 and 3 and I have never experienced anything like it. Even after the Yankees had beaten the Mets in the 12th innings at 1:15 AM in game 1, I was shaking hands with Yankee fans who said that they were sorry, but what a great game it was! Jeter even said this was the best team they played in five years. This was a magical world series that I will never forget, I hope that it happens again, but it won't be the same as the first subway series (the first for millions who didn't see the games in the 40's and 50s). Look out Yankees, next year is payback!
