Some people call Holmes an average back... an average back that only happens to hold the single season touchdown record. In 2004 Holmes got 14 rushing touchdowns, good enough to rank third amongst running backs, trailing only Shaun Alexander (16) and LaDanian Tomlinson (17)... but he managed that in just 8 games. Holmes can get the same production as other marquee NFL rushers in half the time. If he had continued his pace, he would have easily broke the NFL record he himself set of 27 total touchdowns in a single season with an unthinkable 30 total TDs. The Chiefs line is awesome, but if you think it's all them, then you're mistaken. Some point specifically to a game against the Falcons when Priest got 4 touchdowns in the first half before tweaking his knee and sitting out. The doubters notice that his backup, Derrick Blaylock, managed to get 4 touchdowns in the second half. Blaylock got one touchdown when he was spelling for Priest in the first half, so Blaylock really had more of a 3 touchdown game and Priest had more of a 5 touchdown game... in the first half alone. Priest also had alot more yards than Blaylock and in less playing time.
