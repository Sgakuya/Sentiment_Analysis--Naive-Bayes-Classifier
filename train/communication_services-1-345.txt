Please I beg you not to make a terrible mistake and do a contract with this company. It is by far one of the most hideous company in America today. I paid one hundred forty six dallars to begin a plan with this company. I was told that if I did not receive service to the area I live I could return the phone and my money would be refunded. The phone would not work and I returned the phone in three days. I tried over and over to talk with someone about my money only to be transfered from one person to another and then told they would call me back. No one ever did. I ended up loseing the one hundred forty six dollars and paid a thirty nine dollar bill the company sent me just to end the matter and keep anything off my credit report. I'll pray for them because they are truely EVIL. I pray for you if you even think about doing business with them...
