A beuracratic nightmare - I've only been there 1 month and already the college has made 3 pain in the ass mistakes - 1) almost didn't get paid my first month 2) lost my books shipped to the University 3) Just got a bill for a fee I waived 4) Sent the bill to my home/permanent address instead of my current address. If you're from a place like NY (like me) prepare for permanent culture + temperature shock. Constant heat except for the winter and people who know english but answer your questions in spanish because...? Even if the college is good , which I doubt, I can't get past annoyances like constantly messing things up like my bill/books/etc. - I'm curious as to what they will screw up next and how many days I have to wait until it happens.
