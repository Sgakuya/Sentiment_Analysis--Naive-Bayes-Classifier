I used Moving Staffers to unload after thanksgiving...after a long night of driving the last thing i wanted to do was break my back (again) unloading a 26' truck with heavy furniture and appliances!! Having moved many times I've learned that 'full service' movers are too expensive and simply renting a truck is too taxing on me and whatever friends/relatives I can con into helping me. This service bridges that gap perfectly...no one is going to jack-up the prices at the last minute with the threat of hijacking MY stuff on THEIR truck! My experience was extremely positive from the first time I called to get pricing (I spoke to a very friendly woman in Florida) until I paid the movers with a healthy tip for each of them. I was so greatful for this service and impressed with this company that I googled them to see if they were publicly traded. I was so surprised to see a flood of posts on this and other sites from what looks like an unhappy vendor that I felt compelled to put in my 2 cents. I will use Moving Staffers again and will recommend them to anyone that cares to ask me...
