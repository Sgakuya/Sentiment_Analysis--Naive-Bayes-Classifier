This state basically sucks. I don't even know where to begin my diatribe. Unfortuanetly, I've commented on most of the positive states so now I'm left with the Deep South and mid-south region. Do not live in Tennessee if you are intelligent, open-minded, or tolerant. The four times I visited I became LESS impressed with each visit. You will not see anyone bicycling or jogging in this state as most of the residents are obese and if they are on a bicycle its because they have lost their license. Most of the residents polish off many cigarettes. Nasty habits abound. Which leads me to the next nightmare visitors will experience: poor customer service. It's almost unavoidable in Tenn. since fast food establishments have permeated the state. And i'm not talking Boston Market or Dunkin'Donuts. Instead, what you will find are the typical BK, McD's, Long Silvers, Huddle Homes, Red Lobsters, and other crappy eateries. Maybe that would explain the weight problem. And after the junk has been consumed, its into the car, down goes the window, and out go the wrappers and cigarette butts polluting the entire landscape. It's unfortunate too because Tennessee would otherwise be a pretty state. This state really needs to clean up its act. Poorly educated citizenry, poor environmental laws, and vehicle inspections are definitely in order. I have never seen so many crapheaps on the road with defective equipment. Folks, lets all start acting like human beings and a little less like animals!
