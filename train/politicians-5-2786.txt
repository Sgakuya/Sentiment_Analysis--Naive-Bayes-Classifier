I have all the admiration and respect in the world for JC! He's the total package! I hope that in 4-8 years, he re-enters the political arena as a U.S. Senator, Governor, Vice President, or President! Some people accuse him of being an Uncle Tom, but he's the furthest thing from a Tom! What could possibly be more racist than saying that because JC's black, he has to be a Democrat? Shouldn't black Americans be accorded the same degree of intellectual freedom as white Americans? Earth to black and other minority Democrats: The Democratic Party is the party that supported slavery (the GOP ended it), segregation and Jim Crow laws for 100 years after slavery ended, were more likely to oppose Civil rights in the 1960s than Republicans were, supported the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War 2 (they could just as easily have interned German Americans, which would have been a bad thing for my paternal grandparents), and today oppose school vouchers (which most blacks support) and support genocide against blacks (black babies are disproportionately aborted). I hope that more black Americans wake up and realize the truth like JC and other black Republicans have: the Democratic Party takes them for granted, the Democratic Party is not their friend, and the Democratic Party does not share their values (if evolution isn't a racist theory, I don't know what is). Come back black Americans to your original home, the party of Lincoln and the emancipation, the Republican Party!
