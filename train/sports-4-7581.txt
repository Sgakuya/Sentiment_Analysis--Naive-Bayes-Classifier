The Hawk was one of the most spectacular players ever, with unlimited offensive skills. The guy passed like a point guard, shot like a small foward, hit the boards, and invented new moves the way Elgin Baylor did before him and Dr. J and MJ afterwards. And he could LEAP. It's a shame his greatness was never fully seen or realized due to the NBA's blackballing of him. Consequently, his work habits suffered. The greatest move I ever saw was NOT Dr. J's sweeping reverse layup vs. the Lakers, but a move Connie made at the end of his career, where he pulled back a dunk attempt in mid-air, then pulled back a fingeroll and ended up scooping in a triple pump reverse layup. Amazing.
