Not only is D'Angelo a very talented (and gifted) individual, but he has one characteristic that shines through in what he does - his respect for music! He has taken it upon himself to experiment with sounds that would appear average if left to another artist/band. His growth and maturity are evident all over Voodoo, and although Brown Sugar too was a beautiful album, his current work reflects the fact that this artist is still growing, still learning and isn't afraid to be or sound different, even if it means being criticised. Yes, Voodoo is deep, but D'angelo isn't telling us anything (some of us) didn't already know. His music is inspirational uplifting and as an individual he appears very humble, which re-inforces my admiration and respect for him even more. Seeing him perform (in the UK) was for me, without doubt the highlight of Y2K. His stage presence was as electrifying as I imagined it would be, and more (and damn, he is so fine!). Much respect to his band too, a tight performance was given all round. D'Angelo has a gift, there's no two ways about it. Be glad he chose to share it with us. I will continue to follow his career with unashamed admiration - D'Angelo keep the good work! Much Love!
