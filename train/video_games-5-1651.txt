These are neat and fun. I like the challenge of getting just a little information and being able to solve the whole thing. There is a magazine out there that publishes British versions here in America that I am addicted to. I ecspecially like the ones that are best solved without the grid, but from a small drawing, like with HOUSE A, HOUSE B, and a list of animals and kids. The clues generally run like: The Great Dane lives in the house directly across from the house with the three children (only 1 child is a boy). The Dalmatian lives with two children in the blue house, etc. It once took me two weeks (about 45 mintes a day!) to figure out one complicated puzzle, but I got it done!!
