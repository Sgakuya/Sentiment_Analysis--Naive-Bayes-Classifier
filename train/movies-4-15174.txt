I have mixed feelings about Jerry Maguire. It was pretty entertaining, and the acting was great overall, but there was one thing that really bugged me about it- Renee Zellweger's lips. What was going on there? (I'm guessing that it was a lip injection job gone haywire.) Her lips were huge and distorted. She appeared to have some difficulty manipulating them at times, too, and the camera zoomed in for close-ups at every turn. Seeing those bloated, bizarre-looking lips in such detail over and over made me feel kind of nauseous, and they were definitely a distraction. Beyond that, the movie was entertaining, and the performances given by Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. were excellent. There were several memorable scenes (Show me the money!), which added a lot to the show, too. If you can ignore Renee Zellweger's monstrous lips, you'll probably enjoy Jerry Maguire.
