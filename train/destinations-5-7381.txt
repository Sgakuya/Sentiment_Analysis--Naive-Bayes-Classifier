It is amazing how obsessed many Americans have become with insulting anything French, even if that anything happens to be the number one tourist destination on the planet. Admittedly I haven't been to Paris so I can't rate it - but it seems to me that there must be a reason why Paris is so popular. Why, then is it, pray tell, that many Americans loathe this city? The truth is they don't - they loathe the French government and an unfortunately large number of Americans think that if you like or dislike a government you must like or dislike every single element of the country in question. Thus we have a situation where Americans seem to think that not supporting their president is unpatriotic and disliking their president is 'anti-American'. Or for that matter that liking something French is anti-American. Please, people, be reasonable and express your political beliefs in the politics section and not the travel section (and, yes, I'm aware of the hypocrisy of that statement). The rating I gave the city was based on what relatives who have been there have told me.
