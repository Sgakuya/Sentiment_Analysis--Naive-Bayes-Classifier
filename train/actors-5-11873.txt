I LOVE ANGELINA JOLIE VOIGHT-Thorton! I like to mention the voight part,since not everyone knows that jolie is actually her middle name. But since she prefers to go by Angelina Jolie,lets just leave it at that. She is very beautiful to say the least. how could n e one believe that she has had injections put in her lips.if u look at younger pics of her, believe me, they r natural! just look it up! and those who say that she has no talent. have u seen her movies? please! she definetly has talent!!! more than jennifer lopez or other stars out there. she is just so captivating. and about her being freaky, well thats one of the best things about her. she is true to who she is, unlike so many celebs out there who try to present an image, just so they can stay on top.and the greasy hair thing, her hair isnt greasy. just in movies like girl,interrupted for obvious reasons! and ok, so shes a bit skinny and pale, but atleast shes not out there getting skin cancer. i think its very good that she stays natural, nevermind the hair, but hair is hair. and even if she did get a tan, who cares. and the skinny part, now that she had to train for tomb raider, she has to be buff! and about her playing the sameroles, she does not! lara croft and lisa rowe r two COMPLETELY differ. ppl. action here type and socio path. i dont think so. all in all angie rocks, and screw the rumorS! bottom line is the only ones that know her r the ones that r with herand actually know her and have been with her. so who r we to judge? ok i know this is long and maybe a little obssesive, but seriously this is the only celebrity i am like this w/ no one else, and ive never been. but i guess its better than being obssesed with a teeny bopper like brit spears.ugh
