He's a good player. An oustanding shooter with tremendous range, Kapono has consistently shot over 45% from the floor in his college career. He can shoot off screens, but he's at his best when he's facing the basket and gets his feet set. That said, he is nothing more than a pure shooter. He lacks the athleticism, quickness, and ballhandling ability to get his own shot, particularly in the lane. He's one of those guys that has to have shots created for him. If he were a better penetrator, he could add 4 or 5 points to his average, too, simply from the foul line. He's an excellent free throw shooter, but he can't get into a position to be fouled nearly as much as he should. He's a solid college player, but I would be surprised if he did anything in the NBA.
