STAY AWAY FROM DIRECTV!!! I bought the service two years ago for the NFL Sunday Ticket, and it has been a nightmare from the start. First, before the installation actually happened there were five no-show appointments where I was stuck waiting home all day for an installer who never showed. Finally it was installed but the tech left gaping holes in my walls and a wire running right across the middle of my porch. After two more service calls, one where the installer had never heard of "picture-in-picture", it was up and running until I moved. Sure, the billing was always an adventure and I had to challenge the bill each month, but this was a small price to pay to watch TV, right? Well, I moved and the nightmare came up again. It took four installers to get the dish right, then another three to get the High Definition upgrade right. Regarding the high definition upgrade, DirectTV lied to me and sold me the upgrade based on the high def local chanels coming in through the dish, somethin I was told later on was not true at all. Anyway, I now have a mega system with many useless channels, no local high def, and no interest in watching for anything other than the NFL Sunday Ticket. By the way, this year I am paying triple what I paid last year for the same programming. Something fishy, right? On top of that, I went to watch the re-scheduled Dolphins/Chiefs game on the Sunday Ticket and am now told that it will NOT be shown live but will be on tape delay. This is not what I paid tons of money for, to watch NFL games on tape delay. Stay away from DirectTV. They are criminals and are not ashamed of stealing your money and not providing any product that is paid for.
