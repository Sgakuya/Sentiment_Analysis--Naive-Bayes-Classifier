Most, if not all of my ratings deal only in food quality. Red Lobster, like Bill Gates, (brought computers to the masses including my grandma) dominates in bringing some seafood selection to the midwest for lower prices. In the world of seafood Red Lobster food quality fails to measure up to average. However, Red Lobster is perhaps the most successful restaurant chain in history because they figured out a way to make their menu quite cheaper than other more legit seafood places. This is their secret or non-secret. The menu is very limited to mostly shrimp and whitefish. In the Mid-West they do well because the prices at the few good seafood places are extremely high. Red Lobster is not supposed to be great but just good enough. Food still below average.
