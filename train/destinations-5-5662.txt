I lived in MA for the first 19 years of my life before going to school in upstate NY and living in NYC during the summer. Everyone who rates the state highly has already covered the beautiful scenery, etc. However, its the negative comments that are the funniest. We ARE the country's worst drivers, and we love it. Talk to any true masshole, and they'll tell you that they are proud of their no blinker, minimum of 15 mph over the speed limit, and cutting across 3 lanes of traffic to get to an exit, driving habits. And we aren't that friendly, to ANYONE though. Not just outsiders. Massholes are massholes to each other too. We are all used to it, and proud of it. So you just get used to it. It is the best state in the nation.
