Acting? She can get the job done. But her voice really starts to weigh heavy after a while- I think it's because she went from acting as a kid and as a teen right into acting in her adult years, so she never took a break to figure out how to let her voice come out- it just sounds whiny to me, and you'll notice that the more escalated a scene or situation gets the more whiny her voice gets. I think she is a good actress though, but a little dull- I can think of a handful of other actresses who could have also played the part of the lead in As Good As It Gets- and made the character stand out more. But by her it was not a bad performance- just the voice part bugs me.
