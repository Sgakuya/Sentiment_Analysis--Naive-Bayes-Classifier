The guy is a God in cleats. I have never scene a guy hit the ball harder consistently than him when he was in his prime. Yes he's in the twilight now but he still is a threat whenever he drags the lumber to the box. His career batting average, slugging percentages and homeruns are all tops among catchers. He calls a great game and is under rated behind the plate. Yes his throwing to second has been adventurous at times but the run production he produces from that position far exceed the few extra runs he may allow with a stolen base here or there. He's also a great guy off the field- a class act all around!
