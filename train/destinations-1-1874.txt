I've been to the United States 4 times for business and pleasure, and I'll say this- If you go to Universal Studios or any other of the great Movie Houses and see the many varied sets and backdrops, you marvel at how big and realistic and wonderful they look- but go behind the facade and you find nothing of any substance- The United States is like that- big, impressive, even awe inspiring on the outside- but decrepit and decaying on the inside. Like a gaudily painted prostitute that looks real pretty until you get up close. Then again- what do you expect from a country that was populated with criminals when it was a Penal Colony, was kickstarted economically on the bloody backs of slaves, murdered it's native inhabitants en masse, had the world's bloodiest civil war, only got involved in the First and Second World wars when it suited the United States (and when it looked like the British had controlled the situation)- Not to mention Saturating the world with it's plastic Coca Cola culture (if you can call it a culture).. I think the world would be a MUCH better place if the British had won the War of Independence.. the whole idea of the right of everyone to carry firearms is just pure lunacy in a more civilised society... and giving people the choice to vote or not to vote just encourages apathy.. the great American past-time. The US will eventually tear itself apart, and take everyone else down with it. I just hope that the EEC becomes powerful enough to stop the lunatic American control of the planet.
