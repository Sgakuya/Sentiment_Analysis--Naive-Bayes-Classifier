I'm still trying to figure out what to make of this one. The storyline is spectacular: a young Indian boy is moving to Canada with his family, and being transported on a boat with his family's zoo. The boat capsizes. The boy, Pi, finds himself in a lifeboat with a dying Zebra, a Hyena, an Orangutang, and a 450 lb Bengal tiger. Nature plays its course, and soon its just the zookeeper's son and the tiger. For the rest of the voyage, Pi must use everything at his disposal to avoid being lunch. Intertwined with every page of this book is Pi's Faith in God, and his profound understanding of how animals think and react. I'm not sure if I've read a book like this, and I won't give up the staggering twist this book takes. Despite :) it's best seller status, Life of Pi is worth a read by atheists, agnostics, and believers.
