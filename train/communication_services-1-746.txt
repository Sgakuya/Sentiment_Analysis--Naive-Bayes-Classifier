After four+ years of dealing with Sprint I am calling it quits. I am counting the days left (3.5) until my time is expired with Sprint PCS and it willbe a great relief to be rid of this monster. Total lack of customer support, menu options that drive you wild when you do have needs and you call Customer Care (care? you must be kidding...), long waits after you maneuver the menu options, then incompetence of personnel time and time again. Most recently after fours hours of waiting on the phone line trying to get a tangled mess straighetned out due to highly skeptical and untehical dealings by Sprint, I simply had had enough. Bottom line is, they will take you for a ride with all their contract agreements and it takes lots of heated arguging before they admit that there was never a contract. Simply put, life is too short for their games. While service as far as phone lines was ok ( I repeat, ONLY OK) the customer service and support is not there. Sprint should be investigated by the authorities for not having customer support. Why is it fair that anyone has to wait long periods of time to get through Claire, then to a person with a brain. In general, all the cellular phone companies have us right where they want us. If we continue to pay the escalating prices they demand and put up with the lack of service, they will keep giving us the same. For me, I am finding alternative ways to keep in touch as I will not be held hostage by any cellular phone company.
