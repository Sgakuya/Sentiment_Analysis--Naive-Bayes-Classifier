Durbin got castrated? I didn't know we did that sort of thing. UPDATE: If Durbin is a good, decent man who was attacked for stating (clearly, without much emotion) what he believed to be true and accurate, then who isn't a good, decent man. If you give him a pass for making inflammatory, accusatory statements comparing the US military to the most evil regimes of the past, how could you possibly criticize any statement by a KKK Imperial Wizard? Or the recent race-baiting by any contemporary black leader? Or any terrorist calling for death to all Americans? What possible patriotic purpose could be gleaned from his comment comparing the conduct of the US military personnel to the gulags of the Soviet Union. What could he have said that would indicate more hatred of the American Military than that? And liberals defend his "right" to make such treasonous and insidious remarks, and attack conservatives for being upset about their content and intent. Those of us with children in the military can't think of anything painful enough to do to this empty suit (with our bare hands) to show our hatred for the MESSAGE he delivers. We don't hate him, we abhor a deliberate, hurtful, false accusations posited against our sons and daughters, by any man. But this pinhead is a US Senator. Compare this remark, which the US press hardly covered, with the outcry against Trent Lott's comments in SUPPORT of Strom Thurmond, at a retirement party (not on the Senate floor). Compare Lott's comments (ver batim) against Durbin's and tell me who deserved to resign. Tell me again why Lott resigned and not Durbin. Durbin actually refused to even apologize, at first.
