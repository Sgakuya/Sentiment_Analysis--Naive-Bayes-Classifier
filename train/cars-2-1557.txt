My 1999 Cadillac DeVille has had numerous problems since I purchased it with 16k miles. 1. Brakes pulsating, requires repair at approx 12k intervals, Cadillac says this is ok, however, dealer has been advised that the rotors are warping due to a number of adjustment reasons, but Cadillac will not reimburse. 2. oil consumption problems, using 3 to 4 quarts in 3k miles, at first Cadillac said this is normal, then then told dealer to put in a quart less than they recommend, finally Cadillac issued a special pump/cleaner indicating that the rings were carboned (32 valve Northstar), has slowed the problem to about 1 to 2 quarts every 3k miles. 3. Side airbag deployed when I started the car, airbag has been replaced under recall. 4. Car would suddenly shut down, no indication of failure, dealer after 2 attemtps solved problem with electrical system. 5. Exhaust converter gone bad at 100,000 miles along with oxygen sensor. 6. Rear suspension has failed, both sides, some kind of ball joint, estimated parts cost $1,500. Currently awaiting responsee from Cadillac to see if they will provide any assistance with recent problems. Based upon past experience it is doubtful. Have a 1994 Bonnyville with 264,000 miles on it and it has been a far better car then the 99 Deville. Very disappointed.
