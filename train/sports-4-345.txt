He's good. I'm not going to say he's not, but he seems a little too snobby. But people aren't reading this to know about what I think about his personality, they want to know how he plays the game. His bat is nothing short of spectacular! His glove is up there too. He is 25 and among the 3 best shortstops in MLB today. (Derek Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra being the other 2)It just shows how much talent young athletes have. Rodriguez at 25 has set the stage for a very strong baseball career. Jeter at 26 has won 4 World Series, All Star MVP, Rookie of the Year, and World Series MVP. Garciaparra at 27, has won Rookie of the Year and been an all star. Rodriguez has the best bat, and probably always will.
