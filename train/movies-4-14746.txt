I am a big fan of war movies and sniper stories,so I am subjective on this one.The 4-th star is for the subjectivity.Production and settings-great.Acting-great.Casting-great(ed harris and bob hoskins are among my favorite actors).A lot of criticism went to the love scene, but I thought it is good taste and realistic.the screenplay-average,historical inaccuracies are there, and there are elements which are clearly ment to sell the movie(Hollywood crap).I didnt mind so much that major Koenig didnt exist,cuz i that one is allowed to play with history a bit (if it wasnt, it would suffice to watch Discovery, you would not need a film)but what really bothered me were dialogues intended to artificially inform the audience what the action is about(you know what I mean-characters explaining stuff to other characters which was already OBVIOUS). I guess it is really hard to make very good war or other type of movies in Hollywood these days, because of the commercial constraints.Overall, a great effort,it is one of those films that I would watch many times.
