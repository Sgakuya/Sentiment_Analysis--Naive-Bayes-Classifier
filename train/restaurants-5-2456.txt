Store # 0703 in Shreveport, La. has the rudest, most unprofessional people (not servers) I have ever encountered. On Friday, 07/01/05, I visited this store to buy dinner. I order four wings at the drive thru. When I got to the window a rather large woman told me I would have to wait 20 min. for my wings. I reluctantly agreed to pull around front to wait. After 20 minutes I walked up to the window to purchase my meal. A young man who appeared to be the manager, started to fill my order when the woman told him, while removing the wings from my box, she ain't paid for no damn wings so she ain't gittin none till everybody else who paid gets theirs. The man, thinking I didn't hear her, told me it would take another 20 min. because they ran out just that quickly. I told him, never mind, KFC will get this money. I saw a couple of cars from Church's down at KFC. These clowns are causing you to lose money. I talked to several people who have had similar experiences. Suzan Mercadel- Lewis
