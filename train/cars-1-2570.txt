Swarzkopf... your dream car? This car is ugly. It looks cool, don't get me wrong, but it's not the best looking car by any means. The best looking car in the world is and always will be (possibly) the mkiv toyota Supra. The Supra is faster than a McLaren. Not stock, but who cares? If you are paying 1 million bucks for a mclaren, who cares what is stock or not? You pay a million for your car, I get to spend a million on my Supra. If I spent a million on my Supra, I'd have the best looking car in the world, and it would go 0-60 in two seconds, top speed of 300 mph, and it would fly. And I'd still have money left over to buy a house by the beach. Unless a million bucks is absolute sofa change for you, you are a moron to buy this ugly, slow car. The McLaren only goes 11 seconds in the quarter mile! People are regularly getting their Supras in the 10's. Anyway, my rating is 1. For what it is, every aspect of this car deserves a 5. Except value. It's value is such a pile of stinking crap, that it takes the whole car down to a ONE. A million bucks. C'mon..... it's a car for christ sake... no real NEW technology here... stupid. It's all hype. If a million bucks to me was what thousands of dollars are to you... would I get one? HELL YES!!!! -solrac- soon 2 b mkiv tt 6 spd
