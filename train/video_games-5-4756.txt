This is the exact same game as the PC version except the graphics are better on the PC. However, it seems as if Valve tried to squeeze every ounce of power out of the Xbox because the graphics for the console version are stunning. The story of the game is rich and filled with memorable characters who seem very real because of the excellent voice acting and facial expressions. Throughout the game, you are constantly challenged to survive on your own and when you finally make contact with a friendly NPC you feel happy and glad to see them. The best part of the game may be the physics. Everything follows the laws of gravity. Water splashes when you push a wooden crate into it, a zombie is covered in white paint when you throw a bucket of white paint at it. This makes the game feel realistic, and it seems as if you are really a part of the Half Life world. The gameplay is excellent. The need to learn more about the story persuades you to keep going and as you progress, you will encounter special moments and some great scripted events. My favorite part may have to be the time where I first encountered the Striders (think of the gigantic, long-legged alien machines in the movie War of the Worlds). Half Life 2 feels like a big budget, quality movie (except it's a videogame), and after I finished the game, I knew I had experienced one of the best games ever made.
