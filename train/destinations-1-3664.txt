I live in a Kansas City suburb. Some of the more distant Missouri suburbs are good places to live. But KC itself stinks. There are large, minority-dominated areas which are too dangerous for whites to enter (unless you're armed and willing to fire). KC drivers are major jerks. The tailgaters are totally impatient and rude, but are cowards when confronted. I've pulled alongside rude drivers to have a word with them, and they've all been too chicken to stay put and hold a discussion. The guy who acted so tough just a few minutes before, wets his pants, and guns his accelerator to get away. Punks! I'm just not impressed with my fellow Kansas Citians. In general, they lack manners, they're unfriendly. But go down to Springfield, MO, and you will find some truly first rate people.
