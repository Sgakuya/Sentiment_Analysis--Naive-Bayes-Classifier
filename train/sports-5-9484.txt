No way in hell did McKie deserve the NBA's 6th Man of the Year award. Nope -- He should have been a STARTER and the Sixers number two option and defensive stopper all year long. McKie has quietly positioned himself as one of the Sixers 4 untouchable players (along with Iverson, Mutumbo, Speedy Claxton) by doing everything Larry Brown has asked of him all year long -- and doing it with the quiet professionalism that has made him a favorite of his teammates and Philly fans alike. He may be the best defender the Sixers have. When handed the starting role due to Eric Snow's injury he stepped up in a huge way, earning player of the week honors and establishing himself as the Sixers second legitimite offensive threat.
