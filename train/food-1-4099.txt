OKAY HERE GOES WE HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A HORRIBLE EXPERIANCE WITH POPCORN AS WE HAVE WITH YOURS LATELY.EVERYTIME WE BUY MICROWAVE POPCORN IT SEEMS TO FAIL US. WE EITHER GET A 1/4 BAG OF POPPED CORN AND THE REST KERNALS OR IT BURNS.WE HAVE FOLLLOWED YOUR DIRECTIONS ON THE BAG TO A T AND STILL WE HAVE BAD RESULTS FIRST I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS JUST A BAD BATCH OF POPCORN AND WE BOUGHT MORE BUT IT HAPPENED AGAIN.THIS IS UNSATISFACTORY TO ME . I HAVE 4 CHILDREN AND WE DO A LOT OF AT HOME MOVIE VIEWING AND POPCORN NOW A DAYS IS HARD TO FIND THAT IS WORTH THE EFFORT TO MAKE .AND THAT MY DEAR FELLLOWS IS A TERRIBLE THING WHEN YOU CANT HAVE POPCORN AND MOVIES AT THE SAME TIME. A LOT OF THE TIMES WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PURCHASE THE 3 BAGS OF POPCORN AND 2 MOVIES AND LATELY WE JUST DONT BOTHER WITH THE POPCORN. YOUR TRUELY LESLIE MARCIA
