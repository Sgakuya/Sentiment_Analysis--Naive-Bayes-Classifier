His strong point seems to be the ability to present his audience with a film containing more historical accuracy than his own personal opinion. For instance, the 1977 mini-series Jesus of Nazareth was one of the most lovingly handled yet Biblically accurate and honest portrayals of Jesus that I have ever seen or will probably ever see again. This convinced me that Zeffirelli was obviously less concerned with giving you his own religious views than he was in just presenting Christ as his life was recorded in the New Testament. It was as if Zeffirelli himself were on a spiritual quest and was inviting the rest of us to accompany him. Others may disagree, but I see this as a masterpiece when it comes to Biblical films in concept, presentation and casting. Another great Zeffirelli film that will always remain close to my heart is the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet . The casting of the two teenagers was a kind of cinematic breakthrough in and of itself and I feel he found two actors who filled the bill perfectly. It made such a tremendous impression on me that no matter who I may hear repeat those famous lines, I will always hear the voices of Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting.
