Although he doesn't get my vote for the greatest, he's certainly up there. He was one of the 2 greatest hitters of all time, both in average and power. He was also much like Barry Bonds today, striking so much fear into pitchers that it would help the entire lineup. He was also the best young pitcher in the league when he was a Red Sock. My only knock on him was that he wasn't a 5-tool player, but full 5-toolers are pretty rare. Hitters, and pitchers, of Ruth's caliber are even rarer. The greats change the game, and Ruth ushered in the modern power era. When he hit 60 home runs in 1927 that was more than any other TEAM combined.
