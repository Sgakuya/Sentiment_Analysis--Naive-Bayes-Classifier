There's good things about Pennsylvania (aka Philly) but it's a weird state in general. I think the Amish people bias my opinion because I have a phobia of them. But one time I got really pissed off when I was driving through the state to get to a conference in Ohio. I was driving on some major highway looking for exit 54B. When I was an hour past where I was supposed to get off and still only on exit 22, I figured I'd better stop and ask for directions. The girl at the gas station, with her thick Penn accent, said Ohh, you must be lookin for Ode (old) exit 54B. Pennsylvania apparently changed all their exits - who does that? So I went an hour in the other direction to exit 9, and sure enough their was a tiny note in the bottom of the exit sign that said Old exit 54B. I have been bitter at Pennsylvania ever since.
