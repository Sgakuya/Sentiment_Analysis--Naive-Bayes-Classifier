It is more than a little bit ironic that the black sheep of the Acura line-up sits at the very top of the sedan pyramid. The RL is a vehicle desparately in need of a complete makeover. This fact was rendered most glaringly obvious with the introduction of the revamped TL a few years back. The fact that Acura wants to charge you MORE money for the RL when it offers so much LESS than the TL is an embarrassment. For that extra dough, you get an underpowered vehicle with entirely forgettable styling and handling dynamics that won't have the chassis engineers at Buick worried, much less those at BMW. We all know Acura CAN do a lot better, the question is when WILL they?
