Red Sox fans pratically define the antithesis of fairweather fans . Here is a team that hasn't won the World Series since 1918, but often gets pretty close, so it's obvious they have SOME talent. And their fans will always remain loyal through thick and thin. The every dog has his day law stipulates that one day the Bosox will win the Series; I mean, look who won the last two Series. It wasn't the Yanks. When that day comes, be it sooner or later, a legion of new bandwagon fans will come out of the woodwork, likely people who were joking about how sucky the Bosox were a year before. Meanwhile the true believers who were with the Fenway Gang all along will know they had been right. Go Sox!
