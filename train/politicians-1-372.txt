Too many things could be said about Mr Blair, none of them good in my book. Letting others come into the country and scrounge off us getting benefits for everything whilst other foreigners who come here to actually work and pay their taxes cannot get British Citizenship. What sense does that make? Hospitals disgraceful, the only way for proper medical care is privately. Has he actually done anything to help this country? The fact that he promised to reduce accidents on the road by half by 2005 and hasnt done it says alot too. What did he actually try and do about that?! I will tell you, he took it out on the learner drivers. Making them do stupid Hazard Perception tests, which will have no relevence to the way you drive when you get a licence anyway. Besides, people who come to live here who took their test in their own country can get a British Licence no problem, no test, when all they have to do to pass in their country is drive up a runway and back again! REDICULOUS! Tony is an absolute pain in the arse who needs to be kicked out next year. I dont care if BoBo the Clown is the next Prime Minister, at least it wont be Mr Tony Crappy Blair!!! 90% of everyone I talk to is ANTI-BLAIR, so I pray he is kicked to the curb next year, where he belongs!! RE-INCARNATE WINTON CHURCHILL!!!!!! The only decent PM yet!
