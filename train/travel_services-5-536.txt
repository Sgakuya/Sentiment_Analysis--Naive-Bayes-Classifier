It's a great airport to fly out of. Anythnig to get away from the heat of Phoenix. The airport has only been closed once because of 120 degree heat, and not because the runway gets soft, that's just silly. They Airplane manuals and specs only went to up to conditions of 120 degrees. After that day, when it reached 123 degrees (FARENHIET!) in Phoenix, they changed the specs. It is more likely the airport would be closed in Mid-August and September due to the Monsoons which blow through town nightly, often with heavy dust storms and about 20 minutes of the heaviest rain you have ever seen. Ten minutes later, it's like it never happened. I remember that day it hit 123 Degrees. You wouldn't think that you could tell the difference between 123 and 120, or even 115, but you can. I had just came back from my brother's wedding in California where it was a nice 88 degrees, only to face triple digits! Not a fun experience! As for the airport itself, (after all, this is a review of the airport!), they always seem to be doing some sort of construction somewhere on the grounds. There are three Terminals, and the newest is TERMINAL 4 (!!), and is dominited by SOUTHWEST and AMERICA WEST, niether of which is a premier airline (in my opinion!). British Air has begun flyng non-stop to LONDON from Sky Harbor, which pushes the plane to it's limits. It is interesting to see small twin-engine planes waiting between two giant jets for take-off on the runways. An interesting airport.
