Only EA can get away with shipping out a game so buggy that it's impossible to play. I have never had a trouble with any other type of game but the sims2 is bad. I remember superstar and vacation in original sims being buggy also but at least it was playable. I buy this game about a month after it's release and it was buggy. Finally about 2 months later I think they posted a patch on their website but even so, it did not take care of all of the bugs.But it WAS playable. Then like an idiot, I buy university. This game is IMPOSSIBLE to play due to all it's bugs. I finally determined that if I don't get my sims a cell phone, a lot of the bugs aren't there but every once in a while the little career icons disappear and when that happens, my sims can no longer get a promotion in work. I will never buy a sims game again. It's too bad too, because I really used to enjoy them.
