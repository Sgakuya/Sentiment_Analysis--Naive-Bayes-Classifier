At one time, Newcastle Brown Ale was food AND drink for me. I loved it. About 6 months ago I noticed changes. First the new "red" colored 12 pack box as sold in the USA. Next, the striking similiarities with Bass Ale packaging. The killing blow took place the night I noticed the famous scotch 'aftertaste' was no longer a part of what once was, for hundreds of years, one of the best brown ales on the planet Earth. God Bless America and how our culture, values, rigid mind set, and literalism has corrupted the entire globe. Someone 'over there' has taken the good ol American way and ruined a great ale. SHAME ! Shame on all those that took part in this disgusting rape of the original brewer's loving appreciation for a great brown ale brewed from the grains and herbs of the earth in exchange for the greed of the god almighty mammon. I am NOT kidding. 23-October-2005
