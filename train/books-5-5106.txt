I think that it was a very interesting book. It is not the kind of book that I usually read, but I enjoyed it because it really made you think. I think that Ayn Rand was bery smart, to write a book with so much depth. But I also agree that you really can't take her philosophy straight to heart. Unlike her book it really wouldn't work in real everyday live. She focused on the extreme of individuality and compromise I believe that what Ayn Rand wanted us to take from the book was that we are are own person and that we need to be true to ourself. As for everybody else that commented and had no logical reason why they said that the book sucked, with poor grammer I might add, next time read the book.
