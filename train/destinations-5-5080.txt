The tragity was a down time in new york , and it still is. I must say a couple words to you: God Bless America. Let Gods hand of glory and faith touch every one of you who were effected! Let him give you the faith, strength and confidence that you need topull through let me tell you that I have done all I can do for the red cross. I've donated money, I've sent letters of comfert and support. I wish that all of you who are out there will agree that we arein a time of need. and we won't put up with the tarrorism that has taken place. In other news I think New York is great in other ways, the statue of liberty is historical. The empire state Building is a sign of achivement. Niagra falls is the beautey of the state, And now new York has a more monumental place then ever. The trade center which is definatly worthy of a statue or monument or something! I like the people in new york too. sure some of them are hicks but not all of them are. Most are nice and genorouse! I'd like to say once more God bless new york, God bless america. *Meow!*
