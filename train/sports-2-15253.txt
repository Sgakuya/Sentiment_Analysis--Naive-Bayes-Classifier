If I was rating the Favre of yesteryear, it'd be a 4 or a 5. He's always been overhyped, but still not too far away from the hype. For example, Trent Green has a higher career passer rating, and not many people claim him to be the best QB ever, unlike Favre. That's what they call hype. Rating the Favre of today, not as hot, but still miles from sucking. If he were a young, developing QB putting up his numbers, he'd be a 4. However, he's a veteran who's probably on his last year, so there's less upside. At least he'll be around to give Aaron Rogers some pointers and quality time on the bench before he leaves. He's decided to very openly and smugly say that he isn't going to mentor Aaron Rogers... so much for the team leader image everybody portrays him having. UPDATE: Wow... Favre did God awful this year. He threw a total of 29 interceptions on the season, easily leadign the league. In his last 10 games he threw 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, and 1 interception, a total of 20 in that stretch. Mind you those 20 INTS would be enough to lead the NFL by itself. Hell, it was just as many INTs as Jake Plummer and Kerry Collins had all of last season. I don't think it's unreasonable to say Favre's better days are behind him.
