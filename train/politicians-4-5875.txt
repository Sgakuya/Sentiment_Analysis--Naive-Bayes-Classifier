You know, I have read every statement made about Rick Santorum here, and am suprised to see that EVERYONE has misinterpereted what Santorum actually said. Santorum didnt say he hated gays, nor did he say that being gay is just as bad as bigomy or poligamy. Rather, he said that if sticking ones penis up another's anus is legal, that bigomy, poligamy, and other illegal sex acts should be legal too. That doesnt sound like a homophobic statement to me, that sounds like a Libertarian statement, as if he doesnt care as to what people do behind closed doors. How people thought that that was a homophobic statement, I dont know. Anyways, he is a good politician. He lost a star due to that statement, the thought of man/woman being able to marry twice being legal is scary, considering that neither practice is at all healthy. But overall, he is respectable.
