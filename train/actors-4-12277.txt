Halle Berry to me is overrated, but she is still a talented actor. Was she worthy of The Best Actress Award? I'm not too sure if it was the right time to give the carrot to the rabbit yet. I've only seen her give a few truly compelling performances that impressed me. And that was in Why Do Fools Fall in Love? . I really, really loved that movie, and I thought that she and her co-stars were wonderful. Other films I've seen her in have been so-so, such as Executive Decision and X-Men (the film was great, but not because of her acting). I'm looking forward to seeing more of Halle because I think that she truly has the talent and if given the right role can prove herself to her many critics.
