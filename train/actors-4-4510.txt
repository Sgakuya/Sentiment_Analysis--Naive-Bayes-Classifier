Elijah Wood is a very good actor who fortunately did not fall victim to The Child Star Syndrome and went on to become a successful actor after a string of roles during his younger years. I'm not too big a fan of Lord of the Rings , but it has nothing to do with his acting. However, he has always impressed me in every role that he has taken on ever since Radio Flyer . He gave a wonderful performance in Radio Flyer as a boy who along with his younger brother must encur the wrath of his stepfather, The King . He also gave a good performance along with Mel Gibson in Forever Young . He also gave a good performance as Huck Finn in The Adventures of Huck Finn . His best performance was probably in The Good Son . His role in that film was so believable. He also gave a good performance recently in The Faculty . Now that he is older and has an impressive acting resume I'd like to see him again try his hand at acting in a drama. If he commits himself towards the goal of undertaking every single type of role that he can, he would be much higher up on this list.
