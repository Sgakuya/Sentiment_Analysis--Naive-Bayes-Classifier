Ok, I'm a chick. My husband has always love Harleys and the mistique. At first, I said there's NO WAY we are spending thousands of dollars on a Harley (we are newlyweds and were saving up for our first home). We compromised on a Jap bike. The Jap bike ran great and we had a lot of really great rides. It was also inexpensive and had better technology than a Harley. My husband wouldn't stop his relentless quest for his Harley. After a year of saving, we bought our first house and he then got his Harley. I thought it was a waste of money because I read that Harleys weren't as good as Jap bikes as far as not breaking down, etc... The Harley is great! It hasn't broken down yet, but if rumour has it it will break down eventually. It's extremely comfortable. So maybe Jap bikes have better technology, cheaper plastic parts and ride longer without breaking down (and are cheaper). The one thing that Harley has that the Jap bikes don't (besides higher resale) is a following and a comraderie. What does this mean??? Harley riders are more satisfied (as tourers) because Harley is a club/organization/way of life. I can meet up with 50 complete strangers tomorrow in any county in my state and go on a great tour, together, as a pack! We all have a bond due to our common interest in Harleys. I can rent Harleys all over the world and tour. The Jap bikes don't have this...it's an empty ownership. When you buy a Harley, it's like you pay extra for a better overall experience. If you are a loner, one who never wants to ride with others, one who doesn't want the comraderie/socialization --then stick with the Jap bikes. If you want not only a motorcycle - but a way of life - an opportunity to socialize with others - then get a Harley. Both types of bikes serve their purposes. I don't denounce Jap bikes. I respect them for the purpose they serve. Harleys are great bikes - if you understand why...
