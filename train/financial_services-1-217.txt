In order to cash a check drawn from bank of america, you need two(2) forms of I.D. how ridiculous is that. All I have is a drivers license. I don't believe in credit cards and I don't have a checkinbg account because I hate banks period. When I questioned this policy I was told it was to protect against fraud. I said someone could easily present the check with a fake i.d and a fake a second fake form of i.d. i was then told that this would be very unlikely. I then replied just like it is "unlikely" someone's identity can get stolen. The point is it happens and this 2 forms of i.d. is a hassle that keeps people from getting easily at their money. Bank of america can rot in hell.
