The only thing Dean Smith didn't have a lot of that people still to this very day discredit him for is the NCAA TITLES.What if DEAN had dominated the game like John Wooden & had won 10 championships at UNC.The game of College BB would not have been what it became in March.Put it this way,maybe Dean left that part unfinished in his illustrious career so people would have that title thing to debate about.I grew up in the 1980's watching every team in the freakin nation shoot for the Heels every year at Tourney time & watched as UNC often choked when everyone knew they had the best team.So I believe whole heartedly if Dean Smith had made it a must to win NCAA Titles like he did in the 76 Olympics when he coached the USA back to Gold,UNC would have many NCAA trophies.I never saw Kentucky ripping down F4 banners from the rafters,but they hang them right beside their 7 NCAA Titles.And that goes for the 11 F4 banners hanging beside the 3 NCAA Titles in Duke's little oven they call a BB arena.Dean Smith was great, just ask his greatest player,the man who can still dunk on your head.
