My rating is based on the experiences with the Kmarts in my area only; About seventeen years ago, when I was about 5, Kmart seemed alright, but it has DEFINATELY gone downhill. For cheap products, they charge more than they probably should; the merchanise was more often found in the aisles on palletes than on the shelves, what was left on the shelves was often misplaced, disheveled and oftentimes damaged or dirty. The sales associates there, for the most part, don't care (then again, if I were stuck there, I'd probably feel like giving up, too), and the food handling practices (again, this is from the last several experiences I've had with them about 2 years ago--they may have changed since, but I'm not going back there to find out) were less than appealing. I'd avoid this store unless absolutely necessary.
