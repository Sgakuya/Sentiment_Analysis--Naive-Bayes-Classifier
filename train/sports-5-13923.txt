Probably the best that will ever grace the gridiron. I have such a mancrush on him it's not even funny. I won't bash other backs (you know who) but how many pro-bowlers did Barry have blocking for him and how many did that other guy have. That's what I thought. I don't get why people give him 1 star for quitting, who here hasn't got fed up with a crappy job or company and wanted to walk out. I'm fairly certain that if the Lions had actually put forth some effort to win instead of relying on him every year to sell tkts and get them 8 or 9 wins he might have stuck around longer. Long live Barry and my Barry Sanders figurine collection.
