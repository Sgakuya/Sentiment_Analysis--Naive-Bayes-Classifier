Is someone pulling the Shapes leg? Why on earth is THE LOST BOYS even on this stinking list? Anyway,on with the review. In his campy vamp time capsule of Eighties chic, Schumacher uses a cast jam-packed with TEEN BEAT bigshots along with gory comic book goofiness to tell his story of rock roll nightstalkers in the fictional murder capital of the world Santa Carla (real-life Santa Cruz). For these wayward cool kids of the night, it's all mesh tops and mousse, long hair and leather jackets (plus one dangling earring). But equally as interesting is looking at these actors in terms of their career tracks: Watch then-unknown Jason Patric debut his chiseled jaw and ram heads with then-cool Kiefer Sutherland years before they were rivals for Julia Roberts' love; watch Jami Gertz in her brief stint as a screen siren; watch the two Coreys at the 14-minute mark; and who knew Dianne Wiest was in this thing? Unlike more complicated takes in the vampire canon, Lost Boys maintains a fairly blue-collar attitude toward the mythology: It's just holy water, blood sucking, and stakes through the heart here. But like the memorable INXS soundtrack song of the same name, Schumacher is more interested in giving us a good time tonight, as he intersperses shots of the glitzy, towering rollercoasters, with the shrill cries of those riding it out.This slice of cinema is more a Sutherland, Patric curio than a classic horror movie.Oh and he'd be remiss if the Shape didn't mention that he noticed that this movie garnered a 3.78 from a total of 8 others.Really? That's just swell, as a public service announcement the Shape would like to suggest that those of you who deemed this movie worthy of said rating take a long hard look at just why it is that you consider yourself a Horror fan for he feels that maybe your a bit confused.
