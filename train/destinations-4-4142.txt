I've lived in Baltimore for three years now, and while I have no regrets about moving here and I love my own neighborhood, I am still saddened by the poverty and the many blighted buildings and indeed whole neighborhoods that dot the city. Baltimore has a huge underclass (both black and white) but it also has some great educational institutions (Johns Hopkins, Maryland Institute College of Art) and excellent galleries and museums. It really does have some beautiful areas, despite what you may think when you see the ugliness while driving through on I-95. The best parts of Baltimore form the letter "I" on a map, going south to north, from Federal Hill in the South to Mt. Washington in the North. If you stick to these areas, you'll meet educated, liberal-minded people and find lovely, sometimes historic old neighborhoods. And the best parts of Baltimore are genuinely urban, unlike sprawled-out non-places like Charlotte or Raleigh. One final thought, for the first time in my adult life I've met most of my neighbors. There is a strong emphasis on community involvement here.
