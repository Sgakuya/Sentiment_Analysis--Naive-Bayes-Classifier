I will try to be as diplomatic as possible. I consider myself to be an "Independent" and have voted for both Democrats and Republicans in my lifetime. (Bush Sr in 1988, Dole in 1996, heck I voted for W in 2000; Clinton in 1992, Kerry in 2004). But the rundown of the facts (pros and cons) speaks for itself, as do the approval ratings (39% overall rating as of today). PROS: His ability to gain support for the war after 9/11. At least I thought this at the time. Unfortunately, the cons below have eclipsed any other "pros" I can think of, even the reasons why I voted for him in 2000. CONS: Where do I begin? He's divided the country in the worst way since the Vietnam era. Criminals in his administration. Easy on corporation corruption, but let you or me try to file for bankruptcy protection in a few months with those wonderful new laws. He could care less about the environment (drilling in Alaska instead of offering car manufacturers incentives to produce more hybrid cars?) Leading us into a war that most Americans, except for the kick a-- types who are grown-up bullies and have seen too many Schwarzegger, Stallone, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris movies, do not support nor understand (simple question--tell us why we are there. All of the reasons provided--links to Osama Bin Laden, WMDs, a safe haven for terrorists--are not believable at this point). Reaction to Katrina was shameful and I do believe possibly racist (as someone pointed out, what would've his reaction been if his "base," that is the "have mores" he's been quoted as saying, would have been in the path of the storm--people from wealthy sections of Texas, the Hamptons, etc.) Reaction to Rita, which briefly brought his ratings up, was fake. Would he have reacted that way had Katrina not been such a disaster, natural and otherwise? Why can't people see through this? Perhaps the fact that Rita was straight on course for Houston, in Texas, was the reason. I could go on but plenty of other people on this board feel the same way. I am perplexed at the positive comments. I am convinced it's the same person with numerous identities on this website.
