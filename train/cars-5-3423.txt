I like the new RAV4. Its better looking than its competitors at Suzuki and Honda as a Toyota its bound to be bullet proof. As for Bob2's comments, he seems to conveniently forget that the imports also have manufacturing plants set up in North America. So there's no excuse for buying 'American' just for the sake of 'protecting' local jobs. Toyotas and Hondas assembled in North America contribute to the US and Canadian economies. So don't bad mouth the imports just because the domestics let themselves get behind Bob2. You can keep your Chevette! By the way if you pull your head out of the sand you'll notice that the RAV4 doesn't even look like the Santa Fe, idiot.
