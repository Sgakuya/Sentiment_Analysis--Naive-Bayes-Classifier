What is this, pick on Red Sox page? So we've had some bad breaks over the years, that doesn't mean this is a bad team. Anyone who thinks so obviously has their head up their a- uh, bum (don't want to offend Wes with awful language). Check the standings. And what's this about Duquette? Albeit the GM could use some discretion, did anyone actually stop and look at the team he has fielded? To wit: a serious triple crown threat, two time AL batting champion, and the best pitcher in baseball. If that's not enough, add Everett, Varitek - one of the best catchers (all around) in the game, and a pitching staff that even without Pedro holds the lowest combined era in the league. You have a ROY candidate, a guy who has thrown a no-no and a couple more one hitters in Nomo, Dante Bichette, who... okay, I'll stop for lack of space, but did I mention this team is currently in first place? Get the picture? Like him or not, Duquette has done the job, and done it well. See you in October.
