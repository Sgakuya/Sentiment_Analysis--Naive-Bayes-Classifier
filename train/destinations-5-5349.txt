I don't think people give Washington a chance. All you have to do to love this place is to go to the coast (the real cost, not seattle) See the olympic rainforest, Go see seattle, drive the cascades, and see the largest volcanic plateau in the world. We are a state of diversity. Currently I'm living in the North Sound, about 30 min. from the border to Canada, but I have lived in the South Sound (seattle area) and North Central Washington (the start of the plateau) and it all has it's beauty in it's own way. The cost line is goregous, even when it's stormy (which it is alot, admitingly) seattle is a wondefull city, the cascades are breathtaking, and the plateau has many natual rock formations and farming land. Washatonians are seen as being cocky about being from washington, but that's because in the 90's we had a huge influx of people due to the Grunge movement (which btw isn't dead in washington, just the rest of the country) We like Washington, when you live here for so long you fall in love with it. Yes, it rains, alot. But you have to deal with that sometimes. The summers are beautifull, and it doesn't rain nearly as much in the east. In fact it's a high desert with 300+ days of sun a year. We have some of the best public universities arround. Most are relitively small compared to other public universities, and all have wonderfull programs. I'm proud to be getting my education in Washington (at a school that has been rated as second in masters-granting (non-phd granting) schools west of the mississippi for the last three years) If you don't like washington, you can go ahead and stay out, we don't want you here
