I bought my Santa Fe brand new in 2004. Right now it has 39,000 miles on it and I have not had ONE single problem with it. I drove it across the country and back last year with no problems. It is a great car, reliable, comfortable, and I LOVE the way it looks too. I have the moonlit blue color and it is a gorgeous deep shade of blue. This is the most reliable car I have ever owned and I have owned several including Ford, Dodge, Buick, Geo, Acura, Jeep and Nissan. This is my second Hyundai, the first was a 2000 Accent. Which was a great car too. I traded it in for my Santa Fe at 65,000 miles and it never caused me ONE problem either. I highly recommend the Hyundai Santa Fe and I see so many of them on the road that obviously other people recommnend them too. This is a great vehicle for those not wanting to spend a small fortune on an automobile. It is reliable, good on gas and is fun to drive.
