hey don't pick on my home state. we're not hicks, we come from all over the nation you idiot. i'm from seattle originially, and most people i know moved in from somewhere else. so don't be a northeast prick about it. dallas is amazing, houston blows, austin is awesome, same with san antonio. the energy and pride in the state is electric, and it's where it's happening. lots of smart people (with all their teeth), lots of fun young people, and lots of things to do. granted it's huge and it takes awhile to get to all of the places you'd like to go, and i know it sucks to drive through the whole thing because it's so big, but it's TEXAS! when you travel overseas after living in texas you say you're from texas and people immediately know where you're from (and not in a bad way). and those who say it's conservative heaven, then i say look at the cities. just like everywhere else, the rural areas for more conservative, but the cities are all liberal, and so am i. i love my state. don't mess with it.
