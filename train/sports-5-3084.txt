Set 90 major league records, still holds 30. .367 is one of the most incredible records in all of sports (especially doing it mostly in a DEFENSIVE era against the deadball), along with his 53 steals of home plate. What most people don't realize is that nearly everyone who saw Ty Cobb play said he was the greatest player. And most of these people saw Ruth play (some are even Babe's own teammates), as well. I have an Excel research file from a fellow SABR member on this very topic. So far, he has found 250 supporters for Cobb as the greatest player ever, 30 for Ruth, and 30 for Honus Wagner. It is pretty clear that there is much in baseball that DOES NOT show up in statistics; and as good as Cobb's numbers were, they only tell part of the story.
