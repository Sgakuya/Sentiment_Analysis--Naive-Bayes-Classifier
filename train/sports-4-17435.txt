I have been a bills fan ever since the 1990 season. Yes, they earned the biggest comeback in football history, went to 4 consecutive super bowls and lost. Just because they lost doesn't mean they're failures. The fact that they got up and kept going only proved that they had the will to go. That's something you didn't see teams like the raiders who lost their super bowl, only to be last in the AFC the year after because franky, they didn't have the will to go any further. My prediction for buffalo's 2004 season: 10-6, and 12-4 in 2005 with a possible super bowl shot since they finally found out what plauged them since the firing of Wade Phillips in 2000..Greg Williams.
