A classic, so much better than the official sequels to the famous Civilization series of turn-based strategy games, which comes as no surprise since it was done by the series creator Sid Meier. Along with improved graphics comes a refined diplomacy engine, as well as an amazing unit editor that lets you create an almost endless amount of weaponry that you can build to suit your playing style. We also get a bunch of different factions with very distinct philosophies and abilities. This is a tragically underrated game, which simplifies the turn-based genre with options for automating the usual drudgery these games sometimes bog down in, while providing an incredibly deep strategy experience you will find yourself returning to again and again. While you're waiting for Meier's return to his gamechild with Civilization III , fill the void with this terrific achievement.
