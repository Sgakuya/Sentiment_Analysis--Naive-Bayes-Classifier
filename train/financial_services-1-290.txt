I agree with almost all of the comments I've read here. The bank has a habit of holding deposits (they even held a state disability pay check for 11 days b/c they claimed it "might not clear") while processing debits so that I incur NSF or overdraft fees (no apparent rhyme or reason as to which kind of fee they will charge and both fees are $31 so they get their money either way). When I called the "corporate call center" to complain about the incurred charges (the posted bank balance is positive and MORE THAN COVERS the amount of the checks I've written) they offered to "meet me part way" and refund half of the NSF fees. I declined and argued that they must return all of the funds they have STOLEN from my account and, after "talking to my manager" (I feel like I'm buying a used car here!) they returned with an offer to refund 2/3 of the fees. Again I declined and argued that all of the fees must be credited back to my account. When I finally got to speak to a "manager" (after waiting over an hour and requesting to speak to a manager more than 4 times) he was arrogant, rude and patronising and suggested that if I truly feel Wachovia has stolen from my account I should "call the police and file a report". Incredible! It's my money but they have managed to find a way to just help themselves to it at will. Get away from them as quickly as you can -- they could care no less about their customers and they will do all they can to rob you blind!
