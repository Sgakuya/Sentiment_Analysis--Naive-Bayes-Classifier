I have a Sony CDP Series 200-disc CD changer, and this thing is excellent. First of all, I know a lot of people think it's completely unnecessary to have a CD player that holds that many CDs, but I love it. I have enough CDs to fill it, so when I play the whole thing on shuffle mode, it's like listening to a radio station that only plays music I like. Plus if I want to work at my desk for a long time, it's nice that I can listen to music without getting up to change the CDs all the time. So I'm a big fan of the 200 CD deal, and I've been very happy with the Sony CDP model. This thing has been through a lot in the three years I've owned it (it's been moved and dropped more times than I can count and my dog has drooled all over it), but it still works as well as it did the day I bought it. And it changes CDs surprisingly quickly, although that process makes a little bit more noise than I would like. I would definitely recommend this CD player to anyone.
