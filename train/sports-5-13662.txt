I don't know that there's a better coach in the NFL right now at motivating players. Players play hard FOR HIM! His love for the game and love for his players are all real and you can tell with each emotion-filled speech he gives. Argue all you want his record (just 39-41), but if you don't include the Jet's injury plagued 4-12 season this last year, you'll see much more of the true Herminator (35-29 in his first coaching gig with a terrible owner). This is the type of coach that can consistently bring his team to the playoffs. Getting playoff appearances 3 times out of the last 5 years in what had been a tough conference is impressive. Whenever a player like John Abraham who has spent his career as a Jet, realizes that his coach is moving says "anywhere he goes, I'd love to go with him", it shows you his value as a coach. I've been a die-hard Chiefs fan since I could open my eyes and am estatic that he's probably coming to our team. Hell, I've also been a Jets fan for the last few years BECAUSE of him. That's how highly I regard Herm Edwards.
