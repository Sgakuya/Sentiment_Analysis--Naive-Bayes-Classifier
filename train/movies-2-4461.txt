As a lifelong fan of the original animated version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas I was skeptical that it could be stretched into a 2 hour movie. Then I discovered that Ron Howard had directed it, I considered his good record and that gave me new hope. However, about 45 minutes in my hopes were dashed. This is just a cheesy overblown version of the original and one in which the original, tight story has simply been pulled and stretched until it is barely recognizable. For obvious reasons, Jim Carrey was without a doubt the best choice for the part of the Grinch (although a very close second could easily have been Tim Curry who would have also been wasted on this). As you would expect, Carrey manages his usual spastic, scenery-chewing interpretation to perfection. Still the whole premise that the Grinch isn t so much mean as he is maladjusted due to problems in his early childhood is just a tad too PC for me to accept. I also think that the show would be pretty frightening to really young children especially some of the snarling close-ups of the Grinch early in the film. Another point I noticed was the cheap, rude humor involved - such as when the Grinch pins misletoe to his rear and shakes it at the crowd. There was also the time he fell on a woman and ended up (predictably) landing face down on her chest. This kind of stuff may be hilarious in frat boy flicks like Animal House , but I don t think it has a place in something widely touted as a children s Christmas movie. I will add an extra star for the great makeup alone. Even with that, it didn t take me long to lose interest in this fiasco and long for the voice of Boris Karloff and that classic little animated film with the simple, to the point message.
