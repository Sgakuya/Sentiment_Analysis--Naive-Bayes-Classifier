For a compilation release, Elton John's Greatest Hits is one of the classics that will please most any music fan. The track list covers Elton's earliest work through 1974 (ie Your Song, Daniel, Honky Cat, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting, Rocket Man, Bennie And The Jets, Candle In The Wind, Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, Border Song, and Crocodile Rock). There are some notable omissions from that time frame (presumably due to the limitations of vinyl), including Take Me To The Pilot, Country Comfort, Burn Down The Mission, Friends, Tiny Dancer, Levon, Madman Across The Water, Elderberry Wine, Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Harmony, and The Bitch Is Back. Of course most, if not all of these omitted singles can be obtained on other compilations from Elton. Moreover, Greatest Hits 1970-2002 (2002) includes all the tracks from Greatest Hits (except Border Song) plus 24 other singles. Nevertheless, in my opinion, no greatest hits package should be on this list, as those releases do not represent the concept of the full-length effort.
