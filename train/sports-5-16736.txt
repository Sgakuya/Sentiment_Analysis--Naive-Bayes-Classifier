This is the biggest threat, at halfway through the season, to Kansas City's AFC superiority. True, you can make an argument that the Titans are right up there as well, but Indianapolis is finally hitting on all cylinders this year. Peyton Manning is living up to his billing as one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and Marvin Harrison is playing phenomenally. Edgerrin James is a solid all-around back and Tony Dungy has changed a crappy defense into an opportunistic and solid one. I do know that this team could go blow-for-blow with Kansas City for the majority of a game, and it would be very close. The Colts proved something with that 4th quarter comeback against Tampa Bay earlier in the year, and they have only a few tough games left on their schedule. If they can go to Tennessee on December 7th and whip the Titans, they will make a serious Super Bowl run this year.
