Vince Young deserves a 5. Vince Young had a great game on January 2nd. But lets put some things into perspective. Matt Leinart indeed has great talent around him, but Vince Young does too. He has an all world O-Line just like Leinart. His WR's and RB's were VERY highly ranked players coming out of high school, just like Leinart. The difference in talent is not that far off. I bet its safe to say both Texas and USC have had top 5 ranked recruiting classes over the past 4 years. The difference is Matt does not have to be the focal point of his offense. Its not designed around him. Where as the Texas offense is designed essentially around Youngs running and passing talents. Thats why he gets all the pub for his team and most people couldnt name another starter or two from that offense. So the argument that Leinart is only good because of the talent around him is bogus. Someone even mentioned Heath Shuler in the same sentence as Leinart. Yeah right, I know they lost but c'mon. Give the guy some credit. That being said I think all 3 players: Young, Bush, and Leinart are going to be good pros. I might be in the minority but Leinart still played a pretty good game there last night, especially in the second half. He seems to always put the ball on the money. I think initially he'll be the better pro until someone teaches Young how to take a snap from center. But give Young about 3/4 years and his passing and running ability will make him an unbelievable force in the NFL. And YES, he should come out. Although who can blame a kid for wanting to stay a kid for a while. But just like Leinart last year, if he stays he has a good chance of losing money if things dont work out the way they did this year. Not even the Heisman trophy itself will eclispe the buzz he has around him right now. He might've surpassed Reggie Bush for the #1 overall pick in the draft with that performance.
