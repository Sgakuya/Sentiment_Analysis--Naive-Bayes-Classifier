Keyes is America's greatest orator and the most dedicated to values needed in American government. We need him to be President! However, if he is ever to have any realistic chance to make a real difference in our government, he must pick a congressional district currently occupied by a vulnerable democrat and defeat him in the election even if he has to get situated in another state. Keyes must establish a beachhead in congress and then scratch his way to the top. This is a big dream, but hey, I'm a dreamer! After congress, his big break could be VP, although he would probably have to teamed up with a more moderate Republican. Of course, if he got that far he could go all the way.
