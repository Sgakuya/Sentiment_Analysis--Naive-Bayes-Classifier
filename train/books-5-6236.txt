Michael Moore is brilliant, funny, witty and thank God for his outspoken nature. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in participating in their government. Why such an uproar over the title? Is it racist? In absolute terms, possibly. In relative terms, HELL NO. Stupid white men have been in charge of this country since it's founding. It was stupid white men that allowed slavery to be codified into the Constitution, it was stupid white men that disallowed Chinese, Japanese, and various other ethnic groups from becoming citizens, it was stupid whte men that FORCED AMERICAN CITIZENS of Japaense decent into CONCENTRATION CAMPS during World War II. Individuals should be judged by the content of their hearts and not the color of their skin . However, as a group, it's time for White people to listen to a little criticism about their ethnic group's treatment of others in this country. In case anyone is wondering, I'm Portuguese and German (just about as white as you can get).
