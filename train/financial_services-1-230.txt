I HAVE HAD THE WORSE EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD WITH BANK OF AMERICA, I JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A LADY AND SHE WAS SO CRUDE AND MEAN, LITTERALLY I ALMOST CRIED. I HAD A PROBLEM GETTING 2 OVERDRAFT CHARGES TOOK OFF MY ACCOUNT THAT I DONT FEEL IS MY FAULT, I HAVE GOOD REASONS. SHE TOLD ME TO LOOK AT MY TERMS OF AGREEMENT WHEN I SIGNED UP AND SHE DIDN'T SEEMED LIKE SHE CARED AT ALL. BANK OF AMERICA HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE WORLD, DON'T BE FOOLED WITH THEIR HIGH DOLLAR ADVERTISMENT, I TALKED TO ARDEN FOR OVER AN HOUR AND SHE DIDN'T CARE ONE BIT AND SEEMED SNOBBY AND RUDE, I HAVE SEEN TO MANY CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS LIKE THAT AT BANK OF AMERICA. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO CALL THEM FOR ANYTHING, DONT BE LIKE ME STUCK PAYING 5.95 A MONTH FOR BANKING, PAYING HIGH DOLLAR FOR CHECKS AND THATS ABOUT ALL THAT YOU GET FROM BANK OF AMERICA. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM DON'T GO TO THEM THEY WANT HELP YOU. I HAVE NEVER BEEN OVERDRAFT ON MY ACCOUNT BEFORE THIS AND I HAVE LEGIT REASONS, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DO MORE FOR BANK OF AMERICA THEN THEY DO FOR YOU. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR CHECKING EVERY MONTH AND GET NOTHING IN RETURN. I HAVE ALSO HAD A PROBLEM, WHERE SOMEONE WAS USING MY DEBIT CARD THROUGH INFORMATION THAT I HAD ONLINE, BECAUSE MY MONEY IN MY ACCT WAS SHORT. SO I CALLED BANK OF AMERICA AND THEY WERE YET RUDE AGAIN, BEFORE I EVEN GOT THROUGH TALKING THE LADY INTERUPTED ME AND SAID TO ME....YOU'LL HAVE TO CALL BACK AFTER IT GETS POSTED TO FILE A DISPUTE TO CLAIMS. I SAID WELL COULD YOU AT LEAST CLOSE MY DEBIT CARD AND SEND ME ANOTHER ONE, SHE SAID YES...SHE SAID THAT SHE COULDN'T VIEW ANYTHING COMING INTO MY ACCT AT THAT TIME, BUT I KNEW SOMETHING WAS BEING CHARGED BECAUSE I HAD MORE MONEY IN THE BANK THEN MY BALANCE SHOWED. I FOUND OUT A COUPLE DAYS LATER THAT SOMEONE WAS USING MY ACCT AND I FILED A REPORT WITH CLAIMS AND GOT MY MONEY BACK...SHE DID NOT EVEN SOUND APOLOGETIC OR ANYTHING, AND EVERYTIME I CALL AND TALK TO A REP I AM VERY NICE AND POLITE AND IN RETURN THEY ARE RUDE, NOT ALL THE TIME BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. BEFORE I USED TO LIKE BANK OF AMERICA BECAUSE I NEVER HAD TO CALL THEM FOR ANYTHING, BUT NOW THAT I FOUND OUT HOW BAD THIS BANK IS I KNOW NOT TO DO BUSINESS ANYMORE. I HAVE BEEN TOLD WRONG INFORMATION WHEN CALLING THEM ABOUT MY ACCT INFO, WHICH IS VERY IMPT TO ME AND I HAVE BEEN OVERDRAFTED 2 TIMES FOR NO REASON, I GET BLAMED FOR THEIR MISTAKES. THEIR CUSTAMER SERVICE REPS HAVE TO BE INEXPERIENCED, WITH THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THEM. I ALSO HAD A PROBLEM WHERE I TRIED TO GET MONEY OUT OF THE ATM, I JUST DEPOSITED MONEY THAT SAME DAY, WELL GUESS WHAT IT DIDN'T GET CREDITED TO MY ACCT UNTIL A WEEK LATER, WHICH WAS ANOTHER COMPUTER ERROR. SO WHEN I TRIED TO GET MONEY OUT OF THE ATM IT WAS DECLINED SO I THOUGHT THE ATM WAS BROKE, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T GIVE ME A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING. I TRIED TWICE AT THAT ATM, SO THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER ATM AND TRIED AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT GAVE ME A RECEIPT BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE BALANCE IT JUST SAID DECLINED, SO I TRIED ONCE MORE AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED. SO I THEN GAVE UP, WENT HOME AND CALLED THE BANK. THEY SAID THAT I HAD NOT DEPOSITED ANY MONEY, I ARGUED AND SAID THAT I JUST DID AND SHE SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MY PROOF OF RECEIPT TO THE BANK. SO ANYWAY I DID THAT AND IT WAS FINALLY CREDITED TO MY ACCT. LATER ON THAT MONTH WHEN I GOT MY STATEMENT I FOUND OUT THAT THEY CHARGED ME FOR OVERDRAFTS ADDING UP TO OVER 100 DOLLARS AND I WAS CHARGED FOR THE ATM FEES, EVEBN THOUGH I DID NOT GET ANY MONEY OUT OF THE ATM I WAS CHARGED FOR ALL 4 TIMES. I CALLED THE BANK TO DISPUTE THIS AND THEY SAID THAT THE COMPANY IS THE ONE THAT CHARGES FOR THE ATM THAT IT WASN'T THEM, SO THEY WOULD NOT REFUND ME THE MONEY, I DID EXPLAIN MY SITUATION AND THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I THAN WANTED MY MONEY FROM THE OVERDRAFTS BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR FAULT THAT I WAS OVERDRAFT BECAUSE THEY HAD COMPUTER ERRORS, AND MY DEPOSIT WAS NOT PUT IN TO A WEEK LATER. THEY SAID THAT THE MONEY HAS TO BE IN THE ACCT FOR ME NOT TO BE CHARGED, AND THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE SORRY BUT THEY CAN'T HELP ME AND THAT IS MY FAULT. THEY GAVE ME A BUNCH OF LIES NOT WANTING TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK, SO I WAS RIPPED OFF...IM SORRY THAT I MADE THIS FEEDBACK QUITE LONG BUT I WANTED TO LET EVERYONE KNOW TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY, THEIR GOING DOWNHILL, I USED TO LIKE THEM WHEN I HAD NO PROBLEMS BUT NOW THEIR A HASSLE NOW........THANKS, BRANDY
