Chicago is the best big city in the US, so Illinois automatically ranks pretty high for me. My biggest complaint as a state comes from a road trip I took from Sacramento to Chicago. When we crossed the border on Hwy 80 from Iowa into Illinois, the road quality became markedly worse. Illinois has some of the worst roads in the nation, and it's a crime because Illinois LOVES their toll-roads. Take that money and pave the roads instead of lining some bureaucrat's pockets. Still, the greatness of Chicago outweighs the state's road problems for me. Wrigley Field, Soldier Field, Comiskey Park, The Field Museum, The Meuseum of Science and Industry, The Sears Tower, The Hancock Building, a thousand great restaurants, you name it it's there. Chicago residents are generally good, hard working people, and you'll notice how they don't riot like other large US cities do, which is notable becuase Chicago is easily as much of a melting pot as New York or Los Angeles.
