I have had Cellular One for almost four years ... One must remember that Cellular One is a franchise name, so they aren't all the same company. The Cellular One I deal with is owned by DOBSON. I live in Northeastern Ohio but the company's home office is in OKC. My service (reception) has always been excellent. However, the customer service is TERRIBLE. The call center is rude, unhelpful and bitter. I have had tons of billing problems. Moreover, I have found that Dobson Cellular One is dishonest. Please investigate the NY market attorney generals office if you would like more information on their illegal billing practices. Hope this helps!
