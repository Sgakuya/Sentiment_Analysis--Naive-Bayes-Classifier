I've been living here for 4 years. When you first arrive, you are amazed by how developed the city is and by the advancement the business sector, schools, hospitals, etc. Santiago is very well developed - even more so than the US in one or two sectors. After a while, however, you realize that a large number of people are clinically depressed and taking medication. You also realize that for some reason, which I still do not fully understand (maybe the pollution, maybe the traffic, maybe the classism/racism, etc.), everyone is constantly stressed - including myself and this is new for me. Chile is a great country for eco-tourism, for studying Spanish, and for business, but living here has hidden negatives that make it somewhat unappealing for the long-term.
