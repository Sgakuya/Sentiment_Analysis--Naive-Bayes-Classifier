A decent enough brandy, considering the fact that once you've tasted VS or VSOP cognac you'll find it hard to settle for the characteristics of brandy. Not trying to sound snobbish, because I always look for bargain liquors. But, true as ever, you get what you pay for. Example: tonight I tried 'Vendome Brandy', VSOP, aged 3 years, 80 proof, supposedly 'Imperial Cognac' laced in, all packaged with two brandy snifters for the special price of 13.95 (!!). It will get you drunk, but probably also sick, because a light sniff and taste will reveal the trace characteristic of vomit. I am not exaggerating. So let the buyer beware.
