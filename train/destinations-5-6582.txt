Kansas is beautiful, the cost of living is dirt cheap, the pay is good, and the living is easy. FYI-Wichita, KS and Boston, Ma have fairly the same population and average wage but in Ks the wage goes 3 times as far. Medical care is cheap and top notch to. There is a never-ending list of things to do in KS depending on what you like, there are lots of museums, theatres, sports events, parks, amusement parks, concerts, fishing, hunting, 4 star restaurants, clubs etc..I love jumping on a plan and going in any direction for dirt cheap to. KS is great. Only second to maybe Chicago. Oh yeah and it's clean, very clean and nice. Real Estate is Cheeeeaaapppp! Oh yeah about the evolution thing....evolution is a theory right? Why cant other theories be taught to?
