I read this story a loong time ago and thought it was pretty good. The basic idea revolves around a young boy finding himself in a parallel USA making his way across the country. His travels take him between our world and the parallel world, and The Talisman makes for some bizaree and enjoyable reading. I won't rate this a masterpiece though, mostly because my memory says this book dragged quite a bit. This is probably due to Straub's influence; Straub writes with a slower and more deliberate pace than King does, and it was hard for me to accept the different style at that time. These days I've read several Straub novels and chances are I would enjoy this book much more considering my current tastes. Knowing what I know of Straub's style vs. King's, I find it very strange that many people out there compare the two as if they could be one and the same . Nothing could be farther from the truth in my opinion because their styles are radically different from one another. The Talisman is loaded with imagination and unique ideas and is well worth reading. I rate it 3 1/2 stars rounding up to 4.
