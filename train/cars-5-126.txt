I purchased a trx450r last week. I broke it in properly and headed for the sand dunes on the Oregon coast. Here is my initial feedback: 1. The motor revs quickly and responsively. I really enjoyed the ability to get RPMs up in a hurry. 2. This motor does not like to be lugged. The valve train gets noisey and there is little power at the bottom of the RPM range. If you are used to a 400ex, this will be a somewhat different ride. Many riders are gearing this quad down some to allow for slower, more technical riding. 3. Despite some weight savings, having an electric starter really would be a huge benefit to this atv. 4. This quad is pretty tuned-down out of the box. Compared to other 450Rs that had basic cam, jetting intake and exhaust mods (about $250 worth)mine was lacking on top-end power. 5. The brakes are amazing! I have never found a better set of brakes, these are german sportscar quality units. 6. With some adjustment, the shocks are very nice and make for a great ride. 7. The seat is a little hard, my posterior was a bit sore after an hour of riding. This was something that I did not experience on my 400ex. I know this is a performance quad but please, would a little more foam really hurt anything? 8. The stock rubber did a pretty good job on dirt and wet sand. These are better tires than the stock 400ex tires. In summary, this seems to be a fantastic quad that, with minor modification, will really have all the power most folks need.
