The Magic sure gambled on him last year, but it really paid dividends. Consider the numbers: 26.8 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 4.6 APG, .457 FGP, and 59 3-Point shots. His eruption shouldn't have been a surprise, though. Although 6-8, they played him at the 2, 3, and 1 spots, a true testament to his versatility. A devastating slasher, he can penetrate into the paint and use his size to score over big 4's and 5's. His defense is tenacious as well. He needs to improve his outside touch, especially with Hill returning to take the driving duties. He added some bulk, but at times he still looked thin and weak last year. But you can't argue with the results.
