Ole Miss is a good team in a great conference. The Rebels have one of the best quarterbacks in the nation in Eli Manning and he has talented recievers. However, the lack of a running game has allowed defenses to concentrate more on stopping the air game. Pittman and McClendon need to make an impact at tailback. Defensively, Ole Miss now has size but it remains to be seen how well that size will affect their recent inability to stop the run. As an Ole Miss alumnus, I would like to see an even tougher schedule for the Red & Blue, who have no business scheduling some of the light-weights on their schedule. Sure, it results in more wins, but at the expense of BCS ratings, it is also very counter productive to taking the next step up into college football's upper echelon, as was evidenced by the lack of a bowl bid after a 7-4 season the year before last. Still, Ole Miss is a good team and with improvement in the above mentioned areas (and some breaks along the way), might finally win the SEC West
