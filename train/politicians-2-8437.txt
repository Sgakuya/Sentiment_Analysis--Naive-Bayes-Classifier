He sold out his fellow actors during the 50's McCarthism. Sounds like he was only looking out for himself. What about Iran-Contra? He may deny involvment but then that says he had nothing to do with his presidency in the first place. Those that love the man claim that he ended the cold war...I ask doing what? It just happened. Simply put any economist say that the U.S.S.R. was broke. I noticed someone mentioned the trickle down theory in thier response. They must have confused their high school history class...The trickle down effect happens when you give tax cuts to the rich so they will invest in the people and products below them. This does not work. That is why F.D.R went away from it and started social services at the bottom...this is where the money should go if you want to help people. Another person talks about Regans stance on abortion, this person obviously fits in the catagory of average american who uses one issue politics to elect a president. The whole point of this is that Regan was a charasmatic speaker who related to the people, but when it came down to it he did not accomplish things like many of the other charismatic presidents like J.F.K. and Clinton.
