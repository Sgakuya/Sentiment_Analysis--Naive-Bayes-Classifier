This is a disturbing movie. I walked out of the theater feeling a little nauseated. Traffic examines the issue of drugs from a series of overlapping perspectives, and each main character's story is compelling in its own right. I liked the fact that the movie offered no easy answers, and I thought the acting of Benicio del Toro, especially, was Oscar-worthy. But for some reason I find myself giving Traffic four stars instead of five. Maybe it's because I found it a little too convenient that the U.S. drug czar (played by Michael Douglas) just happened to have a daughter with a drug problem and that she just happened to reach a moment of crisis as he was beginning his job. Maybe it's because the movie seemed to drag (no pun intended) every now and then. Or maybe it's just because I'm making the mistake of associating the quality of the movie with the nauseated feeling it left me with. Regardless, even if it's not perfect, I think Traffic is well worth seeing.
