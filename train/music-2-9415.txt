Some of Britney Spears' music is bearable. Some I even like (maybe be 1 song). But this song, along with the music video, just plain sucked. Britney attempts to be mature, but she just looks like a slut. Her pink thong over jeans ensemble was hideous, and i could not stand the atmosphere. I had to turn away when a dancer licked her stomach! The song itself doesn't really sound like singing, either. It's a bunch of humbo-jumbo whisper stuff. I also think it's pretty shallow, judging what else is going on in the world. Britney, you're losing your loyal fans to becoming I'm not a girl, not yet a woman... . You're right on that point. You're a prostitute! My advice? Lay low on all the belly bearing and become a role model. Remember, you're a SiNgEr, not a SEX KITTEN! I don't care if you are totaly against my opinions, but I totally agree with every word I said.
