This movie affected me enormously when I first saw it in the late 70's. Like "Last House on the Left," it had a grainy, documentary feel to it, and both the victims and the killers seemed unnervingly authentic. Perhaps part of my discomfort was a Northeasterner's ingrained antipathy towards anything relating to Texas. The whole film was imbued with a clammy, claustrophic aura that never lessened in intensity for an instant, and the flat, harsh landscape might as well have been that of alien planet (I wasn't the only one who felt this way; one professional review I read expressed similar sentiments). Although there was a minimum of gore and blood, there were images of utter depravity in this film that never completely left me, particularly the nightmarish scenes where the hillbilly killers attempt to help their decrepid grandfather bludgeon Marilyn Burns with a hammer and then suck out her blood. Also chilling is the final image of Leatherface swinging his chainsaw around above his head dementedly as the first rays of dawn become morning. Forget the re-make and the sequels. This was Tobe Hooper's one and only near-masterpiece. Although, after the grim reality of Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy, the fictionalized atrocities of the hillbillies in this film may seem tame indeed by today's standards.
