While I enjoyed about 75% of the material on this album, I'm not rating it a 5 since I bought some of Sara's earlier stuff. Her earlier stuff (translation: pre-chart-topping), in my opinion, is far superior to the pop-friendly stuff on her new album. One exception is the title track, Born to Fly , which Sara sings with a twang in her voice; it also features one of the most intricately beautiful fiddle parts I've ever heard. I also really like her remake of Bruce Hornsby and the Mange (er - I mean Range)'s hit Every Little Kiss , which also has a nice country feel to it and some pretty cool fiddle. Most of the rest of the album, however, sits squarely across the line into pop-country. It's OK, but once you hear Sara's earlier rockabilly-country stuff, her newer stuff kind of falls flat. I can't wait to hear her stuff in the future though - now that she's hit it big, maybe she'll come back to stuff that's similar to her earlier material.
