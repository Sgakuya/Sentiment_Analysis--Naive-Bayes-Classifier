I have tried the rest, and I have found no comparison to MailWasher. Simple to use, you can build your lists of friends (allowed email addresses) as well as your blacklist, or you can use already populated lists and build from there. The filtering tools that come with the software make it easy to identify new junk mail before you even open a thing. The software acts as a shield for your email (Hotmail, IMAP, POP3 all supported) and will not run scripts or download images where viruses can be hidden. You can scale up or down the protection depending on your comfort level. This was originally freeware with an optional contribution of $3 if you liked it. I never usually pay optional fees, but I liked it so much that I decided to pay. Now this guy has made huge improvements and is offering it for about $30, which is STILL worth it. Great software, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stop getting junk mail and viruses.
