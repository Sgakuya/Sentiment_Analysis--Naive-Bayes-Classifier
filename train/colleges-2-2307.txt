I didn't get my undergraduate degree from Villanova; rather, attended its summer Paralegal Certification program. In fairness, I think that paralegal studies is one of those fields that you learn a lot more on the job than you do in the classroom, regardless of what classroom you come from. For over $5000 though, and to complete in a summer what was also offered as a two year program, I expected to be challenged. I didn't find discussing the answers to the final exam as a class, DURING the final exam, much of a challenge, to say the least. I would have been better off to have just bought the books and studied them on my own time, it's what I did anyhow and I would have saved $4500. Villanova University does add a little prestige to the resume however...
