What the hell is going on? Were these clowns just throwing out a Hail Mary of a pass by hoping that no one had ever heard of the RAMONES? That's what it looks like. Since revivalism seems to be the way to go amidst this epidemic shortage of originality, I can hardly wait for the new-school Lawrence Welk generation to be blastin' Perry Como out of their Escalades and Civics. And Thorne, the ability to kick any boy bands ass is about as dubious an honor as the title of Best-Looking Child Molester - it's not really saying a whole lot. Just the other day, I watched my Grandma curb stomp Justin Timberlake for no reason at all. So I'm not all that impresesed by the Strokes' boy band-beating skills. It's lightweight, old hat, etc.
