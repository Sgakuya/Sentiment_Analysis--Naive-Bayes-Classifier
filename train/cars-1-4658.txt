The biggest piece of junk I have ever owned!! Thank goodness for warranties! I had 2 transmisions in the first year of ownership!! And the 3rd was never right either. The drivers side window got stuck down and exploded sending glass everywhere when it finally decided to release itself. The seats would sink down after about 30 min. in them. Cushions would lose firmness. The Triton engine was okay but was noisy. The heater leaked in the cab. The radio quite on one side. Terrible wind noise from improper windshield trim installation. Paint was bad. Other than that, it was perfect! I would rather buy a moped than but another Ford product. I bought a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado after getting rid of the Ford. I've had it almost a year and it had been nothing but a pure pleasure to drive and own. Do yourself a favor, Save yourself, don't buy that JUNK!!!
