If I was rating him as a head coach only I would give him 3 1/2-4...but as a football coach I give him 5. One of the great offensive minds of his time who was O coordinatior on a superbowl team and a national championship team. Over the years he has constantly coached his talent to play to full potential and more. His offensive teams put points on the ball and are fun to watch. Brought Maryland back from the dead...something few humans could have done. As a head coach his teams have over achieved each year. Dramatically out coached Tennessee in the Peach Bowl. The Big Guy can flat out coach and he has done it at every level.
