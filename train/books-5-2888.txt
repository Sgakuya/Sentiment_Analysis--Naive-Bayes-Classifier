After ellajedlicka21 recommended this book to me, I went out for a walk to earXtacy, and on the way, stopped by the library to see if they had the book in stock. How can I express my gratitude, ellajedlicka? Thank you. This was the most true book I have ever read...everything from Christopher Colomubus's brutal treatment of American Indians that nobody ever talks about because they don't want to to Ronald Reagan's countless, endless misddeds and wrongdoings to the world's people. Sure, musicfan, it was disturbing, but you can't expect EVERYTHING to have a happy ending. There are so many ignorant people out there who think the United States is and always was some kind of utopian paradise. Well, this book can let them know that they are a little misinformed. I, with ellajedlicka, recommend this book to EVERYONE, because it could force you to open your eyes. Lyric of the Day (time to get back to frequently ading these): What could He think of what we've done to this world that He created?
