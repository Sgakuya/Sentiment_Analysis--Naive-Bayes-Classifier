Something I've learned about movies based on books, or in this case comic books, is that if you go in expecting all the details to be the same, you'll be disappointed. Luckily, I knew nothing about X-Men before seeing this movie so I didn't catch some of the inconsistencies that X-Men officianados may have. I found this movie to be entertaining. Sure it could have been done better, but all in all I'd say that they did a good job of introducing the characters to the audience and weaving a storyline in along the way. Now that we know about the characters, the next one will be free to plumb the depths of our imagination with an actual plot and some great special effects. (Maybe we'll even see Mystique without the blue body condom).
