A majority of people believe that if Alex Rodriguez never existed, the greatest SS today would be Derek Jeter. But, one could make the argument that he actually IS GREATER than AROD. . .When it comes to offense, Jeter and AROD have different roles on their teams: Jeter hits second and is a table-setter; AROD hits fourth and he's the cleanup man. They are both GREAT in their offensive roles. Now, as for defense--well Jeter blows AROD away. . .D.J. dives, jumps in the air, and can grab a ball back-handed, turn in mid-air, and throw a perfect strike to 1B for an out. So, offensively, AROD and Jeter are push--but when it comes down to defense--Jeter wins and that's why he's the best SS in the game. Oh, by the way, how many World Series rings does AROD have? And how about that little thing about Jeter being the only man to be the MVP of the All-Star game and the World Series in the same year? He is the Great One that's why he's a 4-time champ!
