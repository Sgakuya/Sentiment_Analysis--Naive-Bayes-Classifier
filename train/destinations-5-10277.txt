I've smoked both flavors of Benson and Hedges. Needless to say, both flavors taste great, especially the Benson and Hedges full-flavored menthols. These menthols have a big menthol taste if you prefer your cigarettes in a soft pack. I hear some B&H Menthol smokers think they taste like the Salems from the 70's and 80's. I can't agree or disagree since I wasn't smoking in those decades. The B&H full flavored regulars are rich and smooth. Some call them a stronger version of a Marlboro Light. Well, to me, they taste more like an all-white version of a Marlboro Red 100. The B&H Golds make a nice alternative to Reds. And if you're a menthol fan who prefers tasting more of the menthol than the tobacco (while taking puffs on your smoke), then B&H Menthols are the brand for you. Both flavors of Benson and Hedges are two of the best-tasting cigarettes.
