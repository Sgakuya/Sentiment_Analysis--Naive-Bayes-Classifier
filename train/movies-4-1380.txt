Released in 1994 and directed by James Cameron, True Lies is a completely over the top spy thriller/comedy. For the uninitiated, the story surrounds super secret agents Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who handles all the grunt work and Albert Gib Gibson (Tom Arnold) who handles the tech and support side of the duo's operations. The two get assigned to recover stolen nuclear warheads from a Middle Eastern terrorist group. As a subplot, Tasker's ignored wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks that Harry is a simple computer salesman and wishes for a more exciting life, resulting in her getting duped by a salesman who claims that he is a spy (Bill Paxton). The supporting cast of actors include sexy Tia Carrere who plays the legitimate front for the terrorists. The film is so extreme and relies so heavily on comedy, that the movie becomes almost a satire of the action genre which is just fine. While Schwarzenegger fits the typical mold, the movie was made by Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton (and I can usually only handle the former is small doses). The bottom line is the True Lies is excessive, yet entertaining and above all funny.
