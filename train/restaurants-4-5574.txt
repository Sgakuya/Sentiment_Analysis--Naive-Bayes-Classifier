I used to love this place. Whenever we came home late after dancing, working, whatever and were hungry we'd either go here or a local diner. Man, the food is delicious! Now in Texas we went 2 times. First time, the waiter was a jerk. Second time, the lady told my husband she would get him hash browns without onions and they had onions in them and she said well what do you expect when the stuff being fried all around has onions in it? Stupid. Not to mention the food wasn't the best I ever had either. Always thought I could count on Denny's for a good meal. Have been all over the US and ate at many Denny's but this one in Sherman, it is the pits!
