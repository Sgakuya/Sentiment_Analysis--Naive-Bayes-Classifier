Bond fans had to wait 6 years from Licence To Kill (1989) for the first appearance of Pierce Brosnan as 007 in GoldenEye (1995) and for the most part the delay was worth it. Brosnan injected some freshness and new blood into the series, and his portrayal of Bond is considered by many to be a combination of Sean Connery and Roger Moore. The beginning of the film works great to open with a flurry of action, set up the latter plot twists, and segue the franchise to the post Cold War era. The evil scheme is believable, the villains are tangible, and the Bond Girls are exotic. The movie also marks the debut of Judi Dench as Q. I have mixed feelings about casting a female in this role. On the upside, a female Q brings the franchise more in line with modern gender norms, but on the other hand, Bond was never meant to be politically correct (and there is something not quite British about it either). On another downside, GoldenEye has the series moving towards more special effects and action, and less intrigue and dialogue. Relying too much on special effects and action brings the Bond franchise dangerously close to generic action films. Nevertheless, GoldenEye remains one of the stronger films in the Bond series and holds up well against the competition on this list.
