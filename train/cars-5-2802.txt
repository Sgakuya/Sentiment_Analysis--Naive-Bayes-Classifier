The true heart of RX7 is the rotary motor. The car was built specifically for the rotary motor and there are no other production vehicles in the world that have had this sort of distinction. The car is light, fast, and agile even in stock configuration. Matching performance cars that cost 2 or 3 times as much! I have over 1 million miles under my belt and I have owned 8 different versions of the RX7. In my humble opinion there is simply no better bang for the buck these days. It's a real shame that the rotary is not being imported to the U.S. currently, but hopes are high :) As for reliability, all you have to do is maintain them with the same care you would a true sports car. I have had very few problems and I have owned 4 cyl, 6 cyl, and 8 cyl vehicles as well. Yes, a twin-turbo rotary does take more attention to detail, but it's no more difficult to maintain than the typical performance V8. If the car is well maintained there are many rewards in performance and longevity! The RX7 is the best affordable performance car ever sold in the U.S. Just my .02 cents......
