I see a few comments that it was the arrival of Brady made Belichick great. Well, fair enough, up to a point. Great coaches frequently have great quarterbacks through some or all of their careers. The same could be said of Lombardi/Starr, Madden/Stabler, Shula/Griese, Landry/Staubach, Walsh/Montana, Ewbanks/Unitas, Noll/Bradshaw, to name just a few. Did those coaches make those quarterbacks great? I would argue that they honed an already fine weapon, and pointed it in the right direction, and used it properly. As to defense, Belichick has always lived by the old adage about defense winning championships, and his defenses are among the best and most imaginative and flexible in the NFL.
