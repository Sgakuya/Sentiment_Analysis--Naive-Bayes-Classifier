Being the guy who -as vice-president- prevented civil war (not mandela as everybody tends to believe)gives him a lot of credibility. Being left with a huge national debt, both financially and socially gives him credit regarding the current problems. Daring to question the hiv/aids link is an act of tremendous audacity. i do not necessarily think there is no link, but appreciate that somebody finally stood up and called for a investigation & debate before more lives are lost. Minor points are his position in the zimbabwean story and perhaps his opinion about hiv could have been communicated with more tacticl consideration.
