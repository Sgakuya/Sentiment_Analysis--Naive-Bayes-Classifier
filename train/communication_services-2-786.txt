I have been a Sprint cusotmer in the Clear Lake area of Houston for over a year. I bought 2 Sanyo phones; one for myself and one for my wife. I wanted to buy my wife a new Samsung phone for Christmas and upgrade our service plan. So I went to the local Sprint store at near I-45 and Bay Area Blvd and got the attention of a young post-high school customer service robot. I told her what I was trying to do and that I saw that they were advertising a rebate for the phone I wanted. I was told that this was for NEW customers ONLY and since I was already a subscriber I would have to see another customer service robot and wait in line. After waiting in line for about 45 min I finally learned that I could buy the phone and they would give me a rebate coupon but, according to his manager, they might not pay it (the rebate) . So much for rewarding customer/brand loyalty!!
