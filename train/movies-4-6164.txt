this is a good movie. Stella Dallas is a woman who comes from the wrong side of the tracks she is not very classy she marries a well to do man has a daughter and breaks up when the girl is young she loves her daughter dearly and raises her alone until she is about 14. the girls dad remarries and takes an interest in having the girl back. STella may be considered low classbut she adores her daughter and wants the best for her. in the end she makes the ultimate sacrifice and lets the girl live with the dad. the very ending is a tear jerker with Stella standing outside of the window of the dad's house,and watching her girl get married.Sob.!!!Very well acted by Barbara Stanwyk. a bit too soap operish at times but good.
