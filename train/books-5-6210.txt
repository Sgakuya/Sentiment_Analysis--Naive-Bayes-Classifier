Once I started reading Final Days, I just couldn't put it down! What I most appreciated about Barbara on her appearances on CNN and other talk shows, was her wit, intelligence, and integrity. Her analytical and clever mind shines through in Final Days. I mourn for her husband and her family and friends, and although we have lost her in the physical sense, I am thankful that we still have her in the spirit, through her words in this book. The story told in this book is really 'Living History' and as Lord Acton, in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, 1887 said: 'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men'.
