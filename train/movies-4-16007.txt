This is one of my all-time favorites. Thick and heavy drama at times. Slick screenplay. Made me want to go out and buy a sweater... (if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean). Mary Tyler Moore is excellent as the ice-cold mother hoping for the family to be normal again after her first born son Buck's drowning, when, evidently, there are still issues to be dealt with at home. The confrontation scene between Beth and her husband at the golf course is a classic! But there are many memorable scenes. I have never seen a young actor like Timothy Hutton portray such open emotion toward the end with his analyst Except for maybe in The Champ from the 30s. That's where Hutton won his oscar. Everyone in the theatre was moved by that performance. Still can't believe there are people out there that haven't seen this movie. You younger people, check it out!!
