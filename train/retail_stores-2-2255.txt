I was a fan of Trader Joe's until today. I was there a few days ago with my wife, and had commented to her about how their fruit flavored yogurt drinks are very close to the expiration date, which was January 6th. So you can imagine my utter shock when I went back there today, January 7th, and saw THE SAME yogurt drinks STILL on their shelves, a day past expiration!!! Not only that, but many of their milk products were being sold only 3 days away from expiration. This is dangerous, to say the least, given how common food poisoning is becoming. My last food poisoning incident, not having to do with anything I had at TJ's, cost me around $2,000, an overnight stay in the hospital, and it nearly shut my kidneys down! Given the fact that many products I had purchased at TJ's in the past were quite tasty and unique, I was highly dissapointed by my trip there today. I don't think I will ever shop there again.
