No D, no win, period.........ah ah ah ah ah I said PERIOD. It's amazing how some NBA coaches STILL don't understand this. .............HELLO DALLAS! Christ, Dallas has more talent than any team I've evr seen. They should've won the last 5 NBA titles. Looks like Phoenix is going down the same path. Look, those guys are going to score - don't sweat that. Take a page from Roy Williams' playbook, and take the rims off the boards before practice. Let it be known that defense is the main priority. With lots of talent, it's easy to get those guys scoring. So, take the rims off the damn boards during practice, and REFUSE to let them get a slack defensive mindset. When Roy decided to do that, the next game, I felt like NC State wasn't going to score one damn basket. They were AWESOME on defense after that. Try it, Suns. OR, run like hell with no Defense in sight again next year, and get knocked out early..............AGAIN! Take a team like Detroit against Phoenix, and they'll slaughter them. They're thinking, well, we have trouble scoring usually, but not tonight. And we know we can stop ya'll from scoring 150. Hey, what a simple game! Check my clutch shooters weblist.
