This game is a lot of fun. You get to choose which character you want to be and all of them have different cars. There are maybe 20 total to choose from. You drive around Springfield and pick up other characters and drive them to your destination. There are also 6 different levels of Springfield you can drive around. You are timed, and the faster you get them there, the more money you get. You also can get bonus points for a safe drive, or one where you destroy as many things as you can before you get there. It has some funny quotes from the shows, and it has the feature where you need to earn money to unlock new features of the game, which gives you reason to keep playing. The only thing that I don't like is that it has incredibly long load times between different scenes of the game.
