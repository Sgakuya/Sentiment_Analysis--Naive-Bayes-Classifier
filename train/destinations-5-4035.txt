According to the just-released Zagat Survey of more than 11,000 travelers across the United States, the greater Cincinnati area offers a suprising number of top-ranked national attractions. Topping the list of malls and shopping centers was Newport on the Levee. The Cincinnati Art Museum tied for first place with four other museums (including the prestigious Metropolitan in NYC) for best art museum in the survey, which emphasizes family-friendliness. Paramount's Kings Island was ranked the second-best amusement park. Also, the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Gardens tied for second with four other American zoos. Great American Ball Park, the new home of the Cincinnati Reds, tied with three ballparks for second place. The Newport Aquarium tied for second-best aquarium with two others. Those who visit Cincinnati for its club scene might be disappointed, but those who like quiet, suburban life can find many excellent and afforable communities for raising a family. Compared to other large metropolitan areas (Greater Cincinnati has 2 million residents), the crime rate is lower than the norm. Popular homegrown eateries include Graeters Ice Cream, Montgomery Inn Ribs, Skyline Chili, LaRosas Pizzeria and Deweys Pizzeria.
