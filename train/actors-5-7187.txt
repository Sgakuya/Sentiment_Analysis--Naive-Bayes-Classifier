If someone had asked me a year ago if I ever thought that I would like Ben Affleck as an actor, I would probably say no. Sure, he was great in Armageddon and Good Will Hunting , but he always came across--to me, at least--as cocky, arrogant, and full of himself. I thought he was just another pretty face; until I saw him in the epic Pearl Harbor and realized his true talent. He was a major player in that movie, making it so very moving. When he laughed, you laughed with him. When he cried, you pulled out the Kleenex. Ben is a wonderfully talented actor. If you don't see it in him, you should go see Pearl Harbor to witness that special something in Ben that makes you realize that he's more than just a hottie --he's an honest-to-God person that just happens to be a fantastic actor. His looks are just the icing on the cake.
