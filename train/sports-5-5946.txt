I am hoping to attend Duke next year and I have watched all of the Duke games ovr the years! I respect evry player in the ACC and I believe that JJ is one of the top players. But JJ realizes he is not the only person on the team and that is important. To be a great teammate you do not always have to be good at the sport as long as you show leadership qualities and share the ball. No great player was ever made overnight or born will innate powers to play. All these kids worked really hard to get as far as they have come. I do not care if everyone hates Duke because there are rich people, I'm not rich, my parents are teachers. All I am saying is you do not know everyone who goes to Duke and everyones fans act lke that. Also, I would agree that condor is an awkward word, but it did make sense and was actually kind of clever. Altogether, I love college basketball and JJ Redick is my favorite player! I do not know exactly why, but I think it has to do with his shot, I emulate it so similarly when I shoot! I went to the Final Four in San Antone and he was amazing, it is like some spiritual blessing from God that gave him power to be a scrawny white boy with so much talent! Anyway, good lck with the rest of your season JJ and hope to when I go there next year, if you give me 15 minutes, I will give you some pointers on how to play defense better and show you some of my poetry!
