The Gipper saved America. After the pathetic and weak Jimmy Carter turned the USA into the laughingstock of the world (Iran hostage crisis), ran our economy into the ground (21% interest rates and 11% inflation), screwed up our energy supply (gas lines), and gutted the military and CIA, along came Reagan and with him... morning in America. In two short years, Reagan re-invigorated our military, got the economy moving again which started the greatest economic expansion in history, put the Soviets on notice which led to the eventual end of the cold war, inspired us all with his amazing communication skills, and made us all proud to be Americans again. He was the right man at the right time.
