Pretty well done movie.Rosalind Russell is great as Mama Rose the dominering stage movie of June and Louise{gypsy} it takes place toward the end of the vaudville years and mama Rose dragging her girls around the country doing acts. June eventually runs away from her mother and tries to make Louise the older less talented daughter into a star. Around this time burlesque has become popular. When act bows out mama Rose forces Louise on stage to do a strip act,from there on Gypsy Rose Lee is born and becomes one of the more famous strip acts of the time. Althoug the movie is called Gypsy after Gypsy rose Lee it is really a lot about Mama Rose and he obsession into turning her daughters into stars. Well done movei with some great actors especially Rosalind Russell and Natalie Wood. Also there are some great songs too.such as Small World, All I need is the girl. You gotta have a Gimmick.etc.Bette Midlers version is pretty good as well but not as good as this one.
