Of course, I expected the first movie to be better. After all, it was a truly unique and groundbreaking movie, which was very refreashing at the time it came out. The sequal was enjoyable, if you are really a fan of the first, simply because it is more of the Matrix. Although the specail effects are awesome, to a point it feels like overuse. The first movie had a balance of everything; good story line, specail effects thrown in at the perfect time, and a tiny bit of a love story thrown in for good measure. The Matrix Reloaded overuses the love theme, and you wonder if some middle-aged Executive made it be a bigger theme in this movie since love and sex sell! If I want to see romance, I will go rent a Meg Ryan movie.
