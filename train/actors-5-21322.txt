hilary is a great actress and singer. for those of you who dislike her and say sh*t about her well your wrong. if you don't like hilary then why the h*ll are you here for? have you ever ask yourself what talents have you got? maybe none, those who say sh*t about others are low life. can't you find anything else better to do then just say mean things to people. how would you feel if your in her position and people say bad things about you. anyhting i say at this very moment will be hated by some of you all the more but i don't care. how can people say such hateful thing? what does that accomplish? how does it make you feel? believe me words hurt.honesty is great but theres a fine line between being truthful and being plain, old mean. if you want to be mean then go to h*ll i guess you will enjoy it there. show some respect doesn't your mother ever teach you anything. how rude and immature can you get, if you don't like hilary don't watch her, don't listen to her and just shut your freaken pie hole.
