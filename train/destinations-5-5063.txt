I am in LOVE with New York! I am from New Orleans and to me, New Orleans is a mini New York. It is sooooooo busy and billions of people just walk up the strret all day. I love the way the houses are made in Harlem. I go to New York twice a year and I have no complaints yet. When I first went, it was a definite culture shock. There's white, blacks, phillipines, asians, mexican, puerto-ricans, spanish,etc. Ther's muslim, catholics, jews, buddhist, athiest,etc. It is so amazing. You can learn many things in only one day. I must add that it is a dirty city, but since I'm from New Orleans I am used to dirty streets. You have to catch the subway but try to act like you know where you're going because it's kind of embarassing getting on a way-too-packed train and not knowing your exit. DON'T ACT LIKE TOURIST on the subway because people are known for pick pocketing so just beware. Go to CHINA TOWN! It is a big street called Canal where they have bargains and knock off purses and jewlry. The perfume is real and the prices are low. You have to eat at TAD'S STEAKHOUSE! The steaks are juicy and the meal is cheap. The most you may pay is $10.00. If you love shoes, Macy's is the place. They have a shoe Dept. on every floor and there are about 7 floors.Be sure to bring plenty cash, traveler's checks or credit card. You have to walk up broadway because they have little jewlry shops and shoe stores with name brand shoes for cheap. If you're a big timer and like to spend money, you of cousre want to go to saks,tiffany's, bloomingdales, gucci, prada, etc. If you don't like to spend that kind of money you still might want to walk through and browse, you may get tempted. Whatever you do HAVE FUN!
