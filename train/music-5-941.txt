If you like excellent musicianship, there is no greater rock album. Fans of Yngwie, Vai and their ilk will realize guitar brilliance in John Petrucci's performance that will astound them. There is certainly no better bass player in rock than John Myung (all due respect to Dave LaRue, Les Claypool, Geddy Lee, John Entwistle and Chris Squire). This album is a 70+ minute opus, complete with overture, themes that are repeated variously throughout, intricate layered harmonies, beautiful instrumentals, and superb vocal work by James LaBrie, who seems to have shed (thank goodness) the nasty metal edge he had in his Awake days. The plot of this rock opera is worthy of legitimate literary study - readers of Borges will recognize certain similar fantastic elements; and the compositional structure is glorious and decadent, without being ostentatious, like on DT's unweildy first album with their Stryper-sound-alike original singer. Mike Portnoy's drumming on this album moves him clearly to the head of the drummers' pack, and new acquisition Jordan Rudess on keys (imported from Steve Morse's Dixie Dregs) is just plain SICK. (p.s. pick up Jordan Rudess' solo album... it's amazing! Like Chick Corea meets Dream Theater.) If you are a jazz fusion fan (Return to Forever, Mahavishnu Orchestra...) you won't be disappointed either. Anybody who takes their rock seriously, and anyone who has ever picked up a guitar MUST have this album. It is freaking UNBELIEVABLE.
