If you look at Mays from hitting, he is number 3 in home runs and is in the 3000 hit club. Who else is has hit over 600 HR and 3000 hits? The only one is Willie Mays. Who has over 20 stolen bases and 50 homeruns in one year? Mays has it several times. Mays won seven gold gloves. No other ball player could hit, hit with power,catch,throw, and run. Mays was way ahead of his time, he would be able to read the calls of the opposition within minutes. The would say what instictive skills Mays has. He was just to damn smart in America when blacks were still oppressed. He played in the worse ballpark Candlestick and if he played at a real ballpark it would be Mays homerun record. To me he is the greatest player ever and should be number one.
