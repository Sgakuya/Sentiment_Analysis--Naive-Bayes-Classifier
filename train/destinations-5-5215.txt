I find it funny how a lot of bad remarks I've heard about California were from the ignorrant minds of people who haven't been here. One thing, I can't think of any coastal place I don't like, but I just love the ocean. No other state offers the diversity that California has. Where else can you combine golfing in the warm desert sun, world class ski resorts, several cosmopolitan cities, beach after glorious beach with breathtaking sunsets, dense forests with huge trees, striking mountain ranges and lakes, a number of National Parks and some of the worlds finest agriculture. Yes California is expensive, but what I've decribed above only scratches the surface. As cliche as is may sound there really is something here for everyone !
