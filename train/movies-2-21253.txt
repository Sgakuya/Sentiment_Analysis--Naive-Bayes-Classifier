How could such a terrific Broadway musical turn into such a mediocre 1958 movie? The colored gels used in the cinematography are truly terrible, completely washing out the beautiful Maui scenery where it was filmed. The performances are flat, and why not hire a singer like Howard Keel or Gordon MacRae, instead of Rossano Brazzi whose voice had to be dubbed? Doris Day, who was originally cast to play Nellie Forbush, could have brought this musical to life. When Day left after a major disagreement with director Josh Logan, Shirley Jones would have been a fantastic replacement. I've seen this musical on the stage, and the movie is a major disappointment!
