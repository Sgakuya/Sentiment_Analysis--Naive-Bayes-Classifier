History has been unkind and unfair to Andrew Johnson. The story about him coming to his Vice-Presidential inaugeration roaring drunk has been blown out of porportion. He was a temperate drinker, but on that cold March day, he was suffering from a cold and used whiskey as medicine, as it often was in that day. Under normal circumstances, he would have been sober for such an important occassion. He was impeached for violating the TENURE OF OFFICE ACT, which stated that the President could only fire members of his cabinet and other government officials with the advice and consent of the Congress. This law was later declared unconstitutional and repealed. It was enacted only as a measure against Johnson. He was from the south, and that made him unpopular in the eyes of the victorious North, who wanted to punish the South not only for the war, but killing Lincoln. Johnson wanted the south accepted back into the union with very little punishment, something Lincoln himself was in favor of. He tried to do what he believed Lincoln would have done, had he lived. He was not as personable as Lincoln, and he had large shoes to fill. Anyone serving in the office of VP when Lincoln was killed would have been treated the same way. It is sad, as he was propably a very capable leader. Certainly not the best President we ever had, but far from the worst.
