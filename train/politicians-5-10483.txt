The greatest president of the 21st century. At least he is willing to take a stand against terrorism. He makes his decisions based on what is the right thing to do and not what the popular opinion is. Remember our previous president? What did he do when the WTC was bombed in 1993? Or how about the bombing of US embassy's in Kenya and Tansania or even the Oklahoma City bombing? Or the bombing of the USS Cole? He sat around with his thumb up his ass. While he was at it he was cutting funding for the millitary, the CIA and FBI thus making it easier for terrorists to attack our country. With the rest of the free time he had he was boinking interns.
