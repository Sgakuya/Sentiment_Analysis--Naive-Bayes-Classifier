The great lady of film. Sometimes tough and cantankerous, she was just a tremendous actress. A trailblazere in the feminist movement, even though I don't believe she ever claimed to be a part of it. Great in The African Queen and Rooster Cogburn, among many other roles she played. Apparently, she was really pretty doen-to-earth and had few if any airs. One of my neighbors, a former utilities lineman, went to repair a downed power line during a snowstorm in the Philadelphia suburbs many years ago; turned out that it was near Katharine Hepburn's brother's home (I think it was her brother), and she invited Tony in for a cup of hot chocolate when he fixed the break, thanked him profusely, and wanted to talk about his work rather than her being an actress. Sounds like a really great lady to me.
