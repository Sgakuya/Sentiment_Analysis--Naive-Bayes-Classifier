Jean Harlow was a much better actress than she is usually given credit as being. She had a very natural style and she was a superb comedienne. She learned quickly and she was very young. She would have become an even better actress had she lived longer. She left a legacy of timeless performances when she died at the age of 26 on June 7th, 1937. She will always live on through her performances although too many only see her in The Public Enemy which was her worst performance in a major film. She became a very capable actress and her work while under contract at MGM is testament of what a marvelous actress she was.
