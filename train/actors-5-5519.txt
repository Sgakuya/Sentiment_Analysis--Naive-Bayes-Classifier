OK markymarkluva19 , you may have seen all of his movies...but do you own them (even the substitue for $83), o and have all of the posters...or how about all the clippings and behind the scenes photographs he has ever taken? if you were truely his fan, you would know that he hates being called marky mark. But me, thats a differnt story, i have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on pretty much everything even close to mark. ask me any question and i know it off the top of my head. basicly everyone in the school knows i love him, from my wallet to my room covered with a variety of pictures. i dont just love his looks, i love his personality, the way he helps people out, and the way he speaks the truth, not to mention the fact that he has inspired a bunch of young people that used to be in his situation. if mark is reading this (which he most likly isnt because he is not fond of computers) then i would love to tell you that i am your #1 fan, and i will respect you for life, no matter what direction you go, i will always love u!
