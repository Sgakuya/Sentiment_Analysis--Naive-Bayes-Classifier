Beautiful Scenery - Bad Drivers. Bad traffic which will only get worst, because they won't spend the money to improve it. People are courteous, but only on the surface. Actually Try to get to know someone and you will find that they only have time for themselves. Crappy sports town - they are VERY fair-weather fans. At a baseball game, no body cheers at the game, if you stand and yell to support the team, they will give you dirty looks and some will actually tell you to sit down. And College Sports - Forget about it, there is no tradition here. Downtown shuts down at night. The only place to go for nightlife is Pioneer Square, which has a bum on ever corner. Seattle has to be one of the top cities for Bums because they are everywhere. I think that are more people here from somewhere else then from seattle. There is no idenity for this city - Grunge is Dead, Dot Com is bust, Boeing and Microsoft have already moved some divisions out, the only thing left is Starbucks. Maybe that is it's idenity, a City addicted to the new cocaine - Coffee. There are good things - The summers are beautiful and very long days. Excellent Salmon fishing and Crab Potting. Awesome hiking, but it takes 2 to 3 hours(or longer depending on traffic) to get to it. Beautiful Scenery. Rarely gets below freezing. Rains alot, but that what keeps it so green. This would be a great city of wasn't for people that live here.
