Best Family owned amusement park. Has two of the top wooden coasters in the world along with great flat rides. It's mots famous coaster is the Phoenix. and it has quite a background. It was the first wooden coaster to be moved. Moved from Playland Park. Previously known as Rocket . The park has been doing a good job keeping it mroe family oriented. They haven't built any bigger thril rides because they don't want to attract the same people who go to Six Flags parks who ruin the whole expirience. So Knoebels has all the what i call silent thrills . Greatest rides without the jerks knowing about them to coem over and start sticking gum over everything and cutting in line.. SO Knoebels is fresh. Deffiantly recomend going there.
