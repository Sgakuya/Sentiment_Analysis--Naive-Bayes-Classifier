They are getting a bit deceptive on late return fees. Most of the time, we contest and they agree. They better. My biggest gripe with Blockhead is selection. It seems like really good movies (like Lost in Translation) don't even fill up one row, while stinkers like Joe Dirt, Runaway Bride, or Dude Where's My Car occupy whole walls. If you are a working person, you can almost forget about renting any new releases for the first week it's out. On a Saturday night, I'm often wandering around looking for something in stock other than Teen Wolf Too. More often than not, I'm driving home unhappy (i.e. without anything). When I come home, Wifey asks, Whadja get at Blockbuster. I reply, Nuttin. She replies, Well, Trading Spaces is on. I reply, ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz.
