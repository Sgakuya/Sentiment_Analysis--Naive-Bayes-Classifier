POSTIVE ATTRIBUTES: A great place for any American history buff to visit. This state was one of the most important states during the American Revolution and there are so many things to see throughout the states. The western part of the state is my favorite- that long stretch on I-81 where you encounter mountaineous beauty and friendly folks. I also very much enjoy going to my grandfather's cabin which is located in Northeastern Virginia by the bay- really one of the most natural states left around. NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES: I-95 from Richmond to DC has got to be one of the worst highways in this country to travel on. It seems that the traffic jams never end.
