I give him a great because he had great ideas and unfortunatly a Republican congress who voted against everything he tried to pass!! He had his problems, and that was just too bad he could not stop cheating, as it will be his legacy now, a black mark on a brilliant mans career, and unfortunately, led directly to monkey boy being elected--that is probably my worst opinion of him, bush being elected by some moral sweep of the country, when they are all probably cheating too on their spouses! And as one on disability, with NO healthcare other than medicare, which covers almost nothing and NO prescription drugs, I wish he would have gotten a health care system passed thru, maybe those of us 42 million Americans without health coverage can rise up and vote for a Dem Prez this next time because this administration and repub controlled congress has proven they are in the drug companies pockets!
