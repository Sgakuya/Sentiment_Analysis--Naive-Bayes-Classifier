While not all the movies Patrick Swayze has been were great, most of them were atleast OK. Dirty Dancing, Ghost & To Wong Fu, Thanks for everything, Julie Newmar were all good examples of this mans talent. He is obviously a very accomplished dancer, which you can plainly see in Dirty Dancing and One Last Dance. While his acting might have room for improvement (in my opinion, a slight room for improvement), many people agree that he brings knowledge, enthusiasm and imagination to all films he's involved in. Many of his co-workers have described him a driving force behind the scenes, who encourages them to push themselves to their best. How many other Actors/Actresses have had these kinds of remarks made about them? A few, yes, but not as many as you would think. It's clear he takes a personal interest in everything he works on, and it shows. I give this actor an overall rating of Great, as he has inspired others, contributed greatly in many ways to his films, on screen and behind the scenes, and his dedication to all he does.
