So Rumsfeld, when you told Saddam that the use of Chemical weapons in Iran would not hinder US aid to him (under orders from Reagan) is that when you knew he had weapons of mass distruction, or was it when you sold him those same chemicals 5 yrs earlier through the pharmaceutical company you ran as CEO? OK, that put aside. Next point, what the hell kind of military strategic planning experience does he have? Hell, none whatsoever! Thats why he thought he could invade iraq & be welcomed as a liberator.Hahahahaha Moron. He also has no understanding of the Middle East (he may have been a special envoy, but that was because he had business dealings with Saddam & other dictators in the area -specifically selling pharmaceutical chemicals aka duel use chemicals) And last but not least, this guy didn't think that if someone invades people are going to fight? Did he think we were invading France?
