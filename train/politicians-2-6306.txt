I would agree with John McCain's assertion about Ross Perot: The guy's nuttier than a fruitcake. A lot of the things Perot said were right on about the federal budget deficits, an overly interventionist foreign policy, and corruption in government. He talked about things that Bush, Clinton or Dole didn't talk about. On a lot of other things he was wrong. Perot wouldn't have made a good President, being a businessman is very different than being a politician and I don't think he ever got that. As President, he would have stepped on a lot of toes unnecessarily and made stupid mistakes. Perot had a very large ego to boot. He managed to reach out to a lot of Americans however because he did speak to the people in an uncomplicated and folksy manner.
