Will is a 36 year old who does nothing - well not much worth mentioning - and Marcus is a bullied 12 year old who looks to him for guidance. Together they try to figure out how it's all supposed to be. Although far from the satisfaction I got out of High Fidelity, About a Boy is an enjoyable way to pass the time and the pages just fly by. Probably the biggest complaints I have about this book is Marcus' uncanny abillity to never understand sarcasm, which to me is the most natural thing in the world. The most interesting scenarios came from Will's side of the story. What lowers the grade is, of course the ending as I am not a sucker for happy ones and for Marcus being so incredibly naive which wasn't too entertaining. It is a good book nonetheless and I'd give it 3 if I could.
