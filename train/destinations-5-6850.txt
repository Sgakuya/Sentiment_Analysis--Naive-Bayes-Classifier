As a destination in comparison to other states, there are other places you should see in your life before North Dakota. I wouldn't recommend for a foreign visitor on a whirlwind tour of the states to make an extra effort to check out N.D.; however, there are things here worth seeing. The Badlands are gorgeous and much less touristy than the South Dakota Black Hills. Teddy Roosevelt State Park has wide-open skies and beautiful camping: I once was camping here and went for a walk as the sun rose on the river bank. No one was around, and I encountered a FLOCK of great blue herons bathing in the river... incredible. Devils Lake has excellent fishing and an interesting high school mascot (where else can you cheer the Satans to victory?). College hockey lives in Grand Forks. Watching the sun rise or set in ND, spraying red/orange/pink rays across the biggest, clearest sky you've ever seen is reason enough to go. You'll never see more stars in a night sky elsewhere in the contiguous 48 states. In many ways, North Dakota is a hidden treasure.
