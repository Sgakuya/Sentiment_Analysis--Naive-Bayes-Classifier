I was only there once about 2 or 3 years ago, but I enjoyed it immensely. It's the only place I've been to that sort of captures the ambiance I remember from my childhood at Palisades Park. The art deco aura of the place has been admirably maintained, and venturing there is like stepping back into time. I don't know if the rides are any better or any worse here than they are anyplace else, but, thanks to the nostalgic atmosphere, they're much more enjoyable, and you won't have to wait on line as long (and they're not as obscenely expensive as, say, Great Adventure). Also, you can walk a short distance away and gaze upon the Long Island Sound, which is absolutely lovely in the evening. This place has been around forever too...my mother came here way back in the 1930's. Hopefully, it will be around for a long, long time to come.
