I love this team. Starting in the late 1980's with the "Bad Boys", they saved us from the LA Faker dynasty that was polluting professional basketball. Back to back World Champions in 1989 and 1990, this was one of the better teams around. Led by Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, Joe Dumars, Vinnie Johnson, Isiah Thomas and Coach Chuck Daly, the Pistons redefined the NBA with their stellar defense and outstanding rebounding. Their short domination fizzled out after that, but they made a comeback in the early 2000's with greats like Ben Wallace (fear the 'fro), Chauncey Billups, Tayshaun Prince and most notably, Rasheed Wallace (I love him). They saved us once again from a Faker dynasty by defeating L.A. in five games to win the 2004 NBA championship and third overall. This year, 2006, should see Motown claim it's fourth championship thereby re-establishing the Detroit Pistons at the very top of one of pro sports' top leagues. GO PISTONS!
