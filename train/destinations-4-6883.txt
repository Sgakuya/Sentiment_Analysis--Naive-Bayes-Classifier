Due to Alabama's controversial place in American history, both with the Civil War and then with the Civil Rights Movement, I can see why some may criticize the state. However, it's amazing to me how bigoted the rest of the country is in assessing the peoples of the South, especially Alabama and Mississippi. Some people are so adamant that ALL Alabamians are cowpokin' country rednecks that their attitudes remind me of the racism that was rampant in this country during the Civil Rights Era. I have relatives from out West who won't set foot in Alabama because they're convinced we still all pick cotton and burn crosses. (Puh-leeze.) However, talk to most anyone who lives here and they'll say that they love it. We have beautiful beaches, some cool cities each with their own distinctive flavor (Mobile, Birmingham and Huntsville), enough culture to make things interesting, and guess what? People of African descent and European descent are getting along just fine here, thanks. Birmingham's City Council has been primarily African-American since the 70's! Alabama is moving on. Not to mention that the cost of living here, even in the metro areas, is low relative to other parts of the country. Yes, our school system has problems and yes, our state government is corrupt. And yes, it gets extremely freakin' hot here in the summer (it's not the heat, but the humidity, darlin'!) But having been born and raised in Alabama, and also having traveled to many other states as well as countries, I have a good life here and plan to stay. If you visit, definitely check out the Nasa center in Huntsville, the beautiful beaches on the Gulf, the antiques throughout Central Alabama, and the antebellum mansions in Mobile. And, the art museum in Birmingham is a pretty good one...and, the Civil Rights museum in Montgomery is worth a visit too.
