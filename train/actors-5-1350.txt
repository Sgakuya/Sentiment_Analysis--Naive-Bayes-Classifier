Among the finest of the film actors he can immerse himself in the roles and commands his characters from within. It surprised me that he could work so well in ensemble in Jackie Brown at a stage of his career when he could just as easily have taken only roles front center; devouring the scenery and thundering around. In Godfather II , Casino , Midnight Run and Cape Fear he is exceptionally fun to watch. Recently he seems to be in search of roles in which he can exhibit his comedic skills and characters to inhabit who aren't quite so intense. In Analyze This and Meet the Parents he is very successful at getting us to chuckle along with these new personas. This is one movie star whose portrayals have trewmendous variety:A Bronx Tale(which he ably directs as well as playing the bus driver dad), Sleepers , New York New York , Awakenings , Wag the Dog and Taxi Driver prove that he is a very complex man and actor who's not just another JoeThespian changing costumes and reprising himself through various eras.I'm partial to Young Vito as one of the great acting achievements of the last century.P.S. If you have never seen Johnny Boy in Mean Streets it's there where you find out how he propelled himself into the ranks of the stars.
