As usual the matrix series pushes the envelope when it comes to CGI. These to movies are fun and enjoyable to watch. I think the Whichowski Brothers where trying to draw in a new croud of matrix fans in this movie. I belive that they over did the love part of this movie. People go to see the matrix movies for the action, if they wanted to see a love story they could go rent Sweet Home Alabama, or something like that. I enjoyed watching this in theaters but it lacked a bit of what the first Matrix had. And for the middle part of the movie i was slightly board. I am still a big matrix fan and i am anticipating the sequal. Im sure that will be slightly more impressive.
