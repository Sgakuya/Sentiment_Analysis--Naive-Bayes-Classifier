I'm always taken aback by how well this film has held up over the years. Right from the opening cab sequence, you know you're going for a dippy ride you might not recover from. The Zuckers realized that such a broad satire cannot afford to let up for a single second, and they packed it with so many one-liners and sight gags that the audience had little choice but to laugh hysterically. Brilliant also for its use of a very-familiar cast of traditional players delivering dead-pan zingers and obvious comedic elements with facile style. Take your pick of scenes (Robert Hays' "what a pisser", the confusing last names of the cockpit crew, the wharf-bar disco, the captain's bizarre litany of questions aimed at the youngster, the demented Johnny (who nearly stole the show), Leslie Nielsen's overly-calm Dr. Rumack, Lloyd Bridges as the everything-addled airport director, the island Peace Corps assignment, Robert Stack's brusquely-tough-as-nails Rex Kramer, Jimmie Walker's turn as an airline mechanic, Ethel Merman in the psych ward, etc.); they're all classics you can't help but recall. The sequel tried mining the same gems years later, but fell flat (Shatner's scenes notwithstanding) with a public that'd been successfully and permanently jaded by the original. For those who dig the rapid-fire slapdash, it doesn't get much better than this slice of sunshine.
