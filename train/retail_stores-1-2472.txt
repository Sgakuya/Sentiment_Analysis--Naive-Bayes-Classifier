I have been working for this company for about two years. It actually use to be a good company but they are becoming like everybody else. They use to pay there employees good and have great benefits. No more!! Oh and safeway has this thing where they want their employees to have world class customer service. But they over work there employees because they don't have enough employees to run the store because corporate is trying to save money by taking hours. Then they wonder why customer service is bad! Duh because there working the employees to the bone. Plus corporate whites shirts of this company are a buch of jerks. They show up in a safeway store every once in a while not to motivate the worker but to chew there butts out. This company has lost my respect.
