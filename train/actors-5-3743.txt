Gary Oldman has got to be my favorite character actor since Kevin Spacey has been booted up to leading man status. Oldman doesn't play the part, he is the part! He never ceases to amaze me. Every time I see him in a film, I am blown away!!! Words can not express what his Sid Vicious means to me or what he and Chloe Webb did for the film, Sid and Nancy ! His Dracula put Lugosi and Christopher Lee to shame. And how often can you a see a working class Brit sport dreadlocks and speak like a homeboy like he did in True Romance ? How many Brits do you think could pass it off and be effectively frightening as well? None that I could think of.... except for Gary Oldman!
