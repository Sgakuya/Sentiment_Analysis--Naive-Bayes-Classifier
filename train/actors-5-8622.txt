For a very long time and ironically due to her later success in television, Donna Reed was easy to overlook as an actress. Though skillfully and believably done, her role as the good-natured TV mom in the early 60's Donna Reed Show gave very little hint of the deeper talent beneath the affectionate docile smile. To experience what she was really capable of as an actress you have to go back a few years when her film career was at its peak. Her list of film credits is long and as impressive as many of the parts she played and the subtle acting skill she brought to them. They included the well-known role of Mary in It's a Wonderful Life , an embittered prostitute in From Here to Eternity , and Gladys Hallward whose love provides the only redeeming characteristic for the title character in The Picture of Dorian Gray . Looking back on her career, it is obvious that she was willing to take chances and explore new territory as an actress very often veering from what was considered the norm. Watching her films, it is also obvious she had the talent to pull it off.
