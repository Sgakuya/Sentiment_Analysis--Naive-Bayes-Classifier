I have only seen her in three movies. She was good in Shakespeare in Love. I am not so sure she deserved an oscar though. She was okay in Duets, but her role was kind of bland. I found Bounce to be boring, I kept waiting for more to happen. I can see she has some acting ability.I think she is a bit overrated. I guess I would say I like her work but I wouldn't race to the theater to see every movie she either.UPDATE. I have seen a couple more of her movies since my last post, such as Shallow Hal, and Sylvia. I would still say she is pretty good. I would not race to the theater to see all of her movies.Every now and then I would watch one of her movies.
