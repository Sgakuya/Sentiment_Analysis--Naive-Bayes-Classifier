Wow is the Cheesecake Factory ever good. I've loved every meal I've had there, even though I usually leave feeling stuffed. It is a bit on the pricey side for a chain restaurant, but it's definitely worth it. It can get a bit crowded, but if you get there around 5 or so, you can get right in. When I first went to this place, I went for the cheesecake, and I was pleasantly surprised that the food was so wonderful. The portions are really big, so plan on taking some food home with you. The menu selection is huge too, so you can go back multiple times and try different things. The cheesecake selection is very impressive as well, and is to die for. I recommend splitting a piece with someone though, because again, the portions are very big.
