This guy is dangerous.Al Gore doesn't give a dam about the voter. If he did he would not have tried to block the Veterans vote before the election.This was a planned program to stop these votes.But then he goes crying to the media saying that all the votes were not counted. What were those 3 democratic counties doing after being told to find the votes that would put him over the top? The fallacy is that if Dade-Miami was fully counted then Al would win. Does anyone remember why the miami canvassing board stopped. They actually said that Gore didn't pickup as many as they thought. They stopped right before the hispanic precincts, and everyone knows how much they love AL Gore and Janet Reno after Elian Gonzalez. GORE LOST AND HE SHOULD GIVE IT UP...
