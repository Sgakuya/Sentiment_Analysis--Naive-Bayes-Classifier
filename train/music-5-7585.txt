Ratings, please? RATINGS? I want to see this video at the top of the list in no time at all! Even though the only place I ever saw the video for Radio Ga Ga (which, by the way, is THE best song ever written; I have proclaimed it and thus it is so) was my blurred computer file, thisn video was the craziest, most imaginative, and overall most loveable music video I've ever seen. Do y'all remeber those insane outfits Queen was wearing? Radio-programmed illusion ga ga, if you ask me. Freddie's voice could once again not be described in words; even if I said divine, I'd not be allowing him complete justice. And as for the others, how they play those instruments the way they do is beyond my mortal imagination! If Brian, John or Roger ever comes on here (I wish they would!) I'd like some serious tips for playing my own electric bass! The bass music in Radio Ga Ga was something from heaven. Just a little more proof that the four of them are gods! Of course, we all knew that already, didn't we? If anyone here has direct connection to heaven, whtever the hell that is, please tell Freddie I love him Take care, everyone!
