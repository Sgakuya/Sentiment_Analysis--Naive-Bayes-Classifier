Although I think that Sylvester Stallone has run his course (judging from his performances in Driven and Get Carter ), I still think that he was a good actor in his earlier days. Rocky is a classic and I don't think anyone could've played that role better than Stallone. The same thing goes for Rambo . He had so much chemistry with Kurt Russell in Tango and Cash . I also thought that he gave a good performance as the tough cop in Cobra . I also though that Stop or My Mom Will Shoot with Estelle Getty was cute and I appreciate Stallone's attempt to branch out into comedy. Demolition Man and Judge Dredd started the downfall for this actor who is one of the best action stars of all time.
