Another brilliant and spiritual album from the leaders in hardcore music for the frustration in life, Nine Inch Nails. After five years of abcents from the music world,NIN comes back big time with this jaw dropping two C.D. album The Fragile. This album is much more possitive than Nin's earlyer work and even has one or two songs that could even be desribed as...love songs? Unlike the past albums where Trent Reznors lyrics mirrored his frustration and anger at the decaying and crumbling sack of poo world around him or the girl that ripped his heart out and pissed on it, this album is a much more mature look at growing older,disillusionment,dessnsitization and all around life in general. One of the greatest albums of all time and by far one of the greatest albums of the 90's. A deep meditation of the hurt and strength it takes to be human. How hard it is at times to look at the beauty in this world when we seem to be force fed ugliness. NIN also takes a crack at the quickly declining music industry standards with the fast and thrash inducing single, Starf*ckers.(The one that pissed Fred Durst of for pinning him for the publicity pig he truley is in the video. At least Marilyn Manson didn't whine like a little school girl.) NIN has made a classic album. A true Gem. Something that I will pass down to my son. With this album, who needs therapy? You've got Trent Reznor! A truely remarkable album.
