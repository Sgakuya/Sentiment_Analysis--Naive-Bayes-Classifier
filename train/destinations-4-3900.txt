u bashers that come on here putting down pittsburgh are really retarded & most of u are very young stupid people who have no clue of what this city has.If its not a bunch of stupid young people under 20 or of legal age running around going to bars & clubs getting more stupider than its not cool & its boring. u all got issues!!! pittsburgh is very eruopean in different ways especially by style of the old buildings & different cultures.It could be a little san fran, or seattle, or toronto. i'm from the west coast & have done lots of travel. All those so call cool so great cities ain't so great or cool, very expensive, more fools on the street & crime ,weather ain't all that either, more job problems etc. There is more to do in pittsburgh than u got money. It all depends on what u want. Creative minds know how to have fun, while bozos are all ways complaining.pittsburgh is up & coming, & will be a city to reckon with in time. pittsburgh needs more positive people here living & visiting. people who tell the truth on positive.By the way do ever stop & point out the negatives in those so call cool cities, probably not , becuase you're to stupid see real truth & nothing ,but the truth. when u visit other cities don't u have to figure out whats it to do there too? go figure morons!
