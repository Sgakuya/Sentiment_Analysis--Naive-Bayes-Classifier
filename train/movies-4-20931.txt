I liked Moulin Rouge better than I thought I would. this is a multi-category movie.It can be a comedy, a musical, romance, and drama. the movie takes place in 1899 in Moulin Rouge, SAtine is the main entertainer at the Moulin rouge and she is also a prostitute.Ewan McGregors character is a writer who just came to town and is hired as a writer for the Moulin rouge to write a play.He quickly falls in love with SAtine. Of course there is a bad guy who is rich and wants Satine for himself. to add to the plot Satine is also dying.What is kind of neat is it takes place in 1899 yet the music is songs from the 1940s throught 1990s. so you hear Lady Marmalade, Diamonds are a Girls best friend, and Nature boy etc. It has sad ending. the actors are all good. This is an unusual inique movie. It all comes together quite well.
