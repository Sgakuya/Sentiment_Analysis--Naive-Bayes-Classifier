A modern day Cinderella story about a 30 year old Greek-American woman who has become so absorbed yet intimidated by her sometimes overwhelming ancestry that, over the years, she s managed to fade slowly into the woodwork of her family s restaurant business. And fade is definitely the operative word in this case. She finally begins to wake up to her situation when one bright day a very fine looking guy strolls into the restaurant. It is then that she finally takes a hard look at her gone to seed situation and decides to ditch the frumpy clothes, practical shoes and stringy hair and reinvent herself. Good cast with strong, endearing performances and excellent writing. My Big Fat Greek Wedding is funny, cheerful, sweet, and family oriented. I think my sister summed up the family recommendation for this film nicely when we were leaving and she commented, They could take this one directly to (network) television and not have to cut a single thing . I totally agree.
