I know how well this restaurant operates because I work there, I'm not going to forever. I'm only 17. But I can tell you there is alot they give to you for healthy foods. Ever since I started working there I saw how incredibly well managed a business they are. They really do strive for perfection in every way possible. They have suprise health inspections done by the company on the individual McDonalds. Where the manager is not informed of when they're going to happen. Mcdonalds is really strict on there employees. Joking around in the back too much is almost impossible. Every update on the menu I see seems to be catering to all the customers needs while still making things work as a fast-food burger joint. (you have to remember you gotta assemble it QUICK). Remember that each state has a different menu. But here in Texas, these are the changes I saw. They got rid of chocolate ice cream because our vanilla is low fat. And replaced it with dipped cones which has chocolate coating. And they got rid of Chef Salad because it had ham in it. They also recently told us to start asking if they wanted to super-size less. Only do that with the Big Mac. Offer Apple pies more. And at least three times a day someone orders something without meat, or adds lettuce and tomato to a happy meal. I suggest you do that too. I have seen horible service mistakes on people though. Very simply because the wrong burger is given to the wrong people. But on an ending note, The Mcdonalds Texas homestyle burger is the best burger ever made. (and you can't get it if you don't live here) :P
