The only reason I gave this movie a good rating is that I hope people see it for what it is. When I am finished with grad school and am teaching psych classes in college, I would use this movie as an illustration of the type of child abuse that most people don't pay any attention to, yet it is equally as destructive. The character Bev played by Drew Barrymore was stuck in an era that I thank God we have moved on from. She should have never been forced to marry at 15 in order to save face for the family, especially to a complete loser, which he obviously was. She should have given that baby up for adoption so he wouldn't have been blamed for the disappointments in his mother's life. I found it sickening when she told him several times that his actions at a particular moment ruined their lives. Even if it is true, you never say that to your own child. I wasn't sure what to think in the end because I still thought she was a total bitch, yet it seemed like Penny Marshall was going for some sort of forgiveness from the audience, since it seemed like things were repaired with her father. Whatever, I just hope that it is seen as a major advertisment promoting adoption as the right thing to do if this happens.
