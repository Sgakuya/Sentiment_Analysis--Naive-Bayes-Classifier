When I first saw this movie a couple of years ago in the theters, I thought it was really good. You really can go out there after something that your heart truly wants and desire and love will make it happen. I saw it on cable a couple of years later and like most movies, it had lost some of its allure with the passage of time. Another thing that the movie had lost with me was believability. There is no sense in chasing after a girl that is a lost cause. That is how the movie should have proceeded and wrapped up. No matter how bad you may want her, there is not a chance in hell that you will attain her thanks to outside circumstances that will prohibit that from happening. Movie should have started off with guy meeting girl and getting to know her, likes her, makes a heart felt play for her and then he is rejected. End the movie right there. The sequel could show the guy miserable, still pining away for the girl and being led along by her while she gets to have her cake and eat it.
