This was a very good series. I enjoyed it very much. I love how they wrote it. When I was reading it it felt as though I was in the action. It is very good and I think everybody should read it. I m constantly picking up the books and having to make myself say no wait till you're done with your work. I can't wait for book three! The only thing I would say is that book 2 was a bit sharper of a read than book 1. You should probably read The Kingdoms and the Elves books from Keeper Martin's Tales before reading this series. There's four Keeper Martin Tales books. Its a bit slow in the first book because it introduces everything. The books after it make it worth it.
