I've been visiting RateItAll for a while, I enjoying reading opinions on a vast assortment of subjects. Whether I agree with them or not, that's part of the fun, I take them with a grain of salt. To have an opinion is great, but to post just silly untrue comments is uncalled for. I grew up in Nebraska, and anyone who's really ever spent time here knows its probably the most decent place to live in the country. To say Nebraska is full of slackers living off handouts from the hard workers on the East Coast????? ROFL Nebraska has the lowest unemployment rate in the country, the lowest rate of welfare recipients. Please check the welfare rolls of New York state or California. To say Nebraska is suffering from depopulation ?? Check the census, every Northeastern citys' population is much smaller today than it was 50 years ago. That of course is primarily because most people have moved to the suburbs to avoid the social and economic decay that permeates most citys in the East, with the exception maybe of NYC. To say small towns in Nebraska are full of poor deprived people ??? What town were you in??? LOL Are you sure you weren't in Mississippi ? New Jersey ? I don't know any poor people, all my friends are college-educated, 2 cars, beautiful house etc. Nebraska also has the highest rated public education system, one of the highest rates of college graduates. What is the high school dropout rate in NYC or LA ? Does anyone actually graduate from high school? Crime rates? NYC, DC, and LA have more murders in a year than Nebraska has had in its 100 year history. Anyway, I apologize for the soapbox, but I just wanted to give an honest depiction of Nebraska. Agreed, Nebraska may not be the most exciting place to visit. But a state that ranks at the top of every social and economic statistic, without the blighted citys, drug abuse, crime, unemployment, social decay prevalent in the major citys of the Northeast and California.
