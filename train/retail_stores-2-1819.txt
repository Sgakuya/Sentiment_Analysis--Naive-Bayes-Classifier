The other day while I was here pricing revolvers, I was thinking , why the hell am I here ? Oh yeah, because every other family store in my area has been put out of business by this megachain. I mean we all have to go here once in a while, its like cleaning the toilet, its something you have to do. I work weird hours and it's the cheapest and the only store open at these hours. It is not pleasant, I always get waited on by some 30 something woman with that glossy-eyed minimum wage look, who I know is thinking why did I get pregnant at 16 and not go to college, then I would not be working at this place from hell !!!
