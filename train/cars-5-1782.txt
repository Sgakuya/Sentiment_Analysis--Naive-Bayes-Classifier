this is an excellent car. it's way roomier than most of the other cars in it's price range, (lots of leg room and a HUGE trunk), it gets good gas mileage, it has nice handling, and it's a lot more luxurious than you'd expect of a typical sedan. the interior and exterior are both asthetically appealing and well designed. it's not too big to handle comfortably, but definitly not too small. everything right down to the (2!) ashtrays seem to have been well thought out and designed for comfort and convenience. my only complaint is that the cupholders are too small for some drinks. but, its something i can easily overlook. a very nice car, and a very nice price.
