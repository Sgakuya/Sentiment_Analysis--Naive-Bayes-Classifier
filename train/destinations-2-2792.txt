I'm not sure if the city itself deserves a truly bad rating--but I'm going to register my truly bad experience with some of the bigoted French-only speakers here. Quite ignorant about the tensions between Francophiles and the Anglos when I arrived, I quickly found out how nasty the French only speakers can be. While trying to depart a metro train one day during our visit, my 1 year old baby and I were literally blocked from exiting, because I had asked a French only speaking man to move by saying Excuse me. After several attempts to get him to move by tapping him on the back, he finally stepped aside and yelled, SPEAK FRENCH! to me and my baby as we passed by. If the Quebec separatists are trying to gain international favor in their efforts to secede, they certainly aren't making any progress by alienating and insulting their international visitors.
