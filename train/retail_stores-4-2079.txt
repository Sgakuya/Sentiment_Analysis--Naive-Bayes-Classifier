Alot like Best Buy when it comes to product and prices, Circuit city is a smaller store then Best Buy so they don't have as much product, but you can find great deals at Circuit city just like anywhere else, and find what you need most of the time..... I was sold on Circuit City back in 1999 when I bought my first Notebook Computer, was impressed with the performance of the machine and the price was as low or lower than everywhere else selling the same notebook....How can you go wrong. Over the years they went down hill some, just like Best Buy...As far as Computers, Software and Tv's, Dvd Players go and all of that, they are comparable to Best buy, quality and price wise......
