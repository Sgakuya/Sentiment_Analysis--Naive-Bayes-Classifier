You've got to admit Hugh Grant fills a certain void in film today. We have so many big, hunky action stars (hey, they even turned Keanu into one for Speed an The Matrix!). Seems in old Hollywood there were more sensitive, soft actors (hard to picture Jimmy Stewart in speeding bus on the L.A. freeway - though I'm sure he could have pulled it off). Grant fits the stereotype of the stuffy British male, a stereotype that I find holds a certain charm. I am not sure why the Devine Brown comment comes up so often in the ratings - I'm sure he's not the first man to frequent prostitutes. I think it's just because Hurley is so beautiful that people are shocked that he would go elsewhere. Who's to say what drives a man to make decisions in his personal life, stupid or not his career should not be judged by them. Grant has an impressive body of work, did anybody see Impromptu - if not, you should.
