This woman embodied all the attributes of not only a wonderful actress but also a lovely and gracious human being. I remember watching many of her old movies as a little girl great old movies like Roman Holiday , A Nun s Story , Funny Face , and My Fair Lady . I thought WOW, I would really love to look like that. But her appeal went way beyond the surface. Audrey Hepburn exuded an almost ethereal gracefulness in her personality. It was a combination of many things, classic elegance, charm, gentleness, intelligence, and sweetness. You knew she was acting. But somehow it was very easy to believe that she was taking a lot of her characterizations from her own personality. This lack of complete separation from her inner self may have been most obvious and best illustrated by her deep personal involvement in charity work for children - which I am sure grew out of her earlier horrendous childhood experiences during WWII.
