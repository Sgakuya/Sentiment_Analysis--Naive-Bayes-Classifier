I just came back from an experience I do not want to repeat - a visit to the local Blockbuster. After hobbling into the store - the local store has one handicapped spot only - I was told by a clerk who was about 12 with an IQ to match that Blockbuster does not rent VHS, has NEVER rented VHS,and I ought to "get with the program". I walked out. Blockbuster was the only local video store listed in the yellow pages so I called a West Coast Video store some miles away. The clerk who answered was EXTREMELY helpful, not only with info on his store, but also offering to look up to see if there were another store closer, and there was. I went to the store he recommended, and WHAT A CHANGE FROM BLOCKBUSTER! The salespeople were knowledgeable. They were helpful. The selection in both DVD and VHS formats was wide. They even offered to help me carry my selections to the car. What a pleasant experience compared to my experience with that other video store. They made my New Year's Eve!
