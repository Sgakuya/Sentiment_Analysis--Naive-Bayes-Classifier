Not for all tastes, if you really hate the likes of ELP, Gentle Giant, or Yes, you'll probably hate this too, and yes, most of the songs are lengthy, there's only 5, and in fact, the shortest one is still 6 minutes long. Considered by some to be the first progressive rock album, though IMO it was probably The Moody Blues "Days of Future Passed" or something far more obscure than this one. This album was their debut, and their finest disc in my view. All of the songs work, though " Moonchild" is too long. The band, comprised of future ELP member Greg Lake on bass and vocals, guitar legend Robert Fripp, underrated drummer Mike Giles, and woodwinds guy Ian McDonald, are all killers on their instruments, despite the somewhat valid label of pretentiousness by their many critics. Allegedly, according to a biography of the band, none other than Jimi Hendrix himself jumped up and shouted "This is the best band in the world!" at an early London gig of theirs. The epic fantasy title track is the best known cut of theirs, and probably the only song you'll still hear of theirs on classic rock channels, but the antiwar "Epitaph," the mellow, folk rockish "I Talk To the Wind" and the GREAT, unbelievably complex, jazz rock track dealing with paranoia and destruction: "21st Century Schizoid Man" are also highlights of this important, groundbreaking record.
