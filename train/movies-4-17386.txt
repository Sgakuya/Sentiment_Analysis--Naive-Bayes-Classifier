Set to a pounding techno beat, Run Lola Run is a fast moving, sub-titled thriller that explores how our destinies are shaped by small decisions and events. While there is nothing groundbreaking about this theme (see Sliding Doors, Groundhog Day, etc.), what makes the movie interesting is the intensity of Franka Potente as a girlfriend desperate to come up with 100,000 Marks to save the life of her boyfriend. Director Tom Tykwer uses several innovative film making techniques such as mixing in animated sequences, and using snapshots to summarize bit characters' lives in a matter of seconds, that fit in nicely with the themes and pace of the movie. Much of the movie feels like a music video, and there is minimal acting / dialogue - however, something about Run Lola Run just works. I recommend it.
