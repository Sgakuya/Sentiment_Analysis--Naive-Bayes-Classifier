I am very pleased with the service at Kay Jewelers in Evansville, IN. They showed me all about quality of diamond, helping me to pick out a stone in my price range that was worth every penny I spent on it. They allowed me to pay half of the 20% on the spot and the other half in a week in a half when I recieved my paycheck, still allowing me the opportunity of free financing for a year. They let me swap bands and have resized the ring twice, since the first time ended up way too tight on my fiance. This was our fault, we wanted it to go on and stay on. Now it fits perfect. She likes to show everyone how beautiful it is. I feel like every store has bad services now and then, and every store has bad staff. It is up to us to let them know so they can fix it. If one jewelery store goes out of business, that means the rest can raise prices because there is less competition. Instead of going behind their back shunning them and vowing to never go back in there again, how you do something about it. Let corporate know. Trust me, when you take away sales from one of their stores, you're taking away a golf trip, or a bonus from corporate big wigs, and money is not something to mess around with for them. They will fix it at all costs to see to it that they don't lose a business. Obviously, all the Kay's are not bad. Just the few that you see on this page.
