The Yankees will be dominant, no question, but they will have one of the weakest teams of their recent run in 2002... I have to wonder how not winning it all will affect this team; will they come out harder or have doubts about themselves?... I wonder about their outfield this year, with Vander Wal and Rondell White; neither of these guys will instill fear into a pitcher's heart, and they've both been pretty brutal defensively over the last few years... Robin Ventura was a good addition, maybe better than Giambi; Giambi's only a few steps above Tino Martinez production-wise in that park, but Ventura is a huge jump forward from Brosius.
