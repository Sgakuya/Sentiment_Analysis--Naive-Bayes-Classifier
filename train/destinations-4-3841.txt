Columbus, while certainly not the best or largest city in America, has a TON of potential. In just 30 years it has catapulted to being the largest city Ohio and the 2nd largest city (behind Indianapolis) in the tri-state area (KY, OH, IN). Despite this rush of growth, Columbus has maintained a good economy, a good university, and a pretty low crime rate. Having one of the country's top public universities in the center of your city helps a lot. With nearly 7,000 people receiving diplomas from the Ohio State University each year, Columbus is a great place to start a business (not to mention to find people qualified to work in a white collar environment). Abercrombie & Fitch discovered this a few years ago. There are downsides to Columbus, however, and the biggest downside is definitely traffic & construction. Traffic is VERY unbearable at most times of the day. The Interstate loop (I-270) built to make travel easier around Columbus is a big problem. It is busier than I-70, which runs directly through the city. There is constant construction, especially around the University, which also adds to the traffic problems. All in all, if you want to live in an up and coming city with lots of opportunity, I would take a close look at Columbus. It's come a long way from its beginning and is on its way to becoming one of the largest cities in the US.
