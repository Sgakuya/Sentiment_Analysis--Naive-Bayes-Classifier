What an amazing city. Istanbul is a bridge between East and West, Asia and Europe, and the Middle East and the Western world. The architecture is stunning. The Bosphorous is lined with beautiful palaces, mosques, cafes, and quaint little neighborhoods with winding little streets. Among the incredible must-see attractions are the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, the Grand Bazaar, and a Turkish Bath. Surprisingly, I didn't feel any anti-American sentiment while I was in Turkey (though there was plenty of anti-Bush sentiment). I did feel the influence of Islam however. The calls for prayer seemed constant, and fantastic mosques are visible from almost anywhere in the city. Also, my girlfriend, who could pass for Turkish, got the evil eye from a fundamentalist looking Muslim, most likely for walking hand in hand with an obvious gringo like myself. In her words: It looked like he wanted to stone me. That being said, if you haven't had the chance to travel to this odd mix of the worlds, do it soon - chances are with politics as they are today, Turkey is going to have to choose sides between Europe and Islam - and whatever they decide to do, will lose the amazing bridge culture that it has today.
