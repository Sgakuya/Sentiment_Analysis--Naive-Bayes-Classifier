I recently stepped up to a 2003 Electra Glide Classic from my 1989 HD Sportster 1200. My Glide is a fantastic ride. I opted for the EFI this year. I picked it up on Oct 12 and have ridden about 1500 miles so far. This is the most comfortable bike I have ever ridden. Once summer comes, I will really be racking up the miles. The phrase If I have to explain, you wouldn't understand says it all. Anyone who doesn't like Harley's just cant understand it. Granted, they might not get the best gas milage, but I am averageing about 40 miles per gallon. This year, CD players come stock and it has a great sound system--40 watts per channel. HD is an American icon. To last 100 years and dominate a market, they must be doing something right.
