It's truly frightening this guy was a heartbeat away from the Presidency for eight long years. As lame and pinheaded as Ronnie Rectum was, I thank my lucky stars that the old fossil didn't keel over while in office and leave stewardship of the nuclear stockpile to this golf-playing, coke-sniffing imbecile. And I disagree with some of the posters here who affirm that it was the dishonest, arrogant and leftwing media that made this guy out to be the total moron and a-wipe that he truly is: sorry to wake you droolers up, but Quayle himself was reponsible for his unsavory public reputation by merit of his idiotic pronouncements, dickweed values and freedom-hating ideology. Another draftdodging phony with substance abuse problems who tried to pass himself off as a stalwart exemplar of moral probity. What a laugh!!! Only the droolers were taken in by this transparent ruse, while those of us with at least two brain cells saw this jerk for what he was: a candyass son of a rich man who couldn't put together a sentence, but was quite adept at the childish and stultifyingly boring diversion known as golf. Glad to see this guy has been retired to the fairway and clubhouse while he was still young: this means that the threat he posed to our nation was nipped in the bud before he became fossilized and truly dangerous like the rest of those dinosaurs in the GOP.
