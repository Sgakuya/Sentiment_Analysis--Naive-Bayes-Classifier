I don't have a clue how most of you guys figured out your opinion, but it surely is wrong. some of you should be turning the books they read around the right way and stop buying books like george bushs favourite childhood book about a very hungry catterpillar, which suprisingly was published in his last year at college. You would do yourselves a great job in turning of FOX-News which acctually is closly connected to Georgyboy and read some work of an independent journalist who describes the pressure set on him by the american army while he was trying to tell te truth. You could try it with Michael Moore, too ( stupid white man ). Gerhard Schroeder did a great job in standing up against the U.S-government, because there was no real proof for what America told the rest of the world - you should all know that by now. Germany was doing a hell of a job in Afghanistan and is therefore keeping america's back free for new idiotic attacks agains other countries. Germany suspected America of beeing mostly interested in iraqi.oil. If this isn't true why did the us army then only guarded the ministry of oil in bagdad while everything else was robbed by street gangs. Probably not because it was full of information about where and how much oil was to be found in iraq, but just because it was the nearest to secure. Schroeder sure not is the best chancellor Germany ever had, but he surely tries to without beeing corrupt - getting seldom, you know. Germany and most of the other coutries in the world are facing hard times with a braking down economy and the social security is going down the hills. I Hope Schroeder will be able to keep it up as good as they can and stop going american standards, where poor people lose most of their socila protection threw new laws and a government supporting the richest.
