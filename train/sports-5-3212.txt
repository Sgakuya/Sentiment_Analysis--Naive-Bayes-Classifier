How can a guy be the hit more homeruns than anyone in the history of the game, retire with the second highest hit and RBI totals, play in about twenty allstar games and still be the most underrated player of all time? The answer certainly eludes me but the facts bear it out. The very idea that there are bozos among us tht would dare to give this great player less than a five proves my point to the nth degree. You cannot be that great of a player, for that many years, cruise through an "unbreakable" record in the twilight of your career while still continuing to set the pace for players ten to fifteen years your junior and not be recognized among the all time greats. The phrase, "no-brainer" definately applies here. Hammerin' Hank was the equal or better of any man who ever played the game of professional baseball. Period.
