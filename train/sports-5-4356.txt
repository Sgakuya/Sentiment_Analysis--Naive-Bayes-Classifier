Best recruiter in the business. Two top 30 kids signed letters of intent on Wednesday, WITHOUT TAKING AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO CHAPEL HILL! Felton's new backup, Quentin Thomas, never took an official visit! In total, 4 studs signed letters of intent this past wednesday - ( Hansbruogh, Green, Frasor, Ginyard.) No matter what happens this year, Carolina is back! All thanks to 'Ol Roy. I love Roy, and I have faith in him. I don't think most Carolina fans truly understand how lucky we are to have him. I don't think we truly comprehend how good he is. Well, don't worry, we will. It was definitely scary when Dean retired, but I don't know- I'm starting to think we'll be okay. Win big this season or not - we're gonna be okay. That said, I DO think we'll win big this year.
