Just flew back from there yesterday, I'm completely shattered, but happy. I thought that Amsterdam was a vibrant, intense and wonderful city. The whole place is picturesque with all the canals and architecture. From the moment we stepped off the plane till the end of the holiday everyone that we met and talked to were polite and their English was fantastic! We found a really nice restaurant in the centre of town that served affordable but delicious food and got chatting to the owner - so we'll be going back there. Amsterdam is definately more of a place to go if you like getting stoned and/or drunk because there is only so much you can see that doesn't involve that. Next time I go I'm making sure I book time off work for when I come back so I can get some sleep.
