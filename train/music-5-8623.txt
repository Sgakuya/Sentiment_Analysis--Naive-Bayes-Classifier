Many times I have been thinking - what is the main purpose of the music - anykind of it? I am not a music critic, just a normal person, who most of the time openly admmits if I like the song, or an artist.We,average preople,don't read critics, we just listen to the song and feel good, pleasent or sad, whatever it comes and we buy the song and like the artist who sings it.And most of the time the artist who comes the closest to our hearts and souls also sells the most of his songs. And Ricky Martin is the ARTIST of that kind. He doesn't sing or perform for the music critics but for the people of this world and we love him for his honesty and his power on the stage. She Bangs is an excellant video with outstanding music in it.
