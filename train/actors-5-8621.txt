Extremely underrated actress with limitless charm and sexiness. Donna Reed is the most overwhelming beauty to ever tickle my retinas on the silver screen (see 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'They Were Expendable'). But as well as beauty, what really defined Donna Reed was her real life charm, warmth, kindness and grace- qualities which always shone through in her roles. That is why I always find her performances so appealing. It is sad to know that Donna Reed never received the recognition or respect she so deserved (especially from film studios of her heyday). Her versality and depth as an actress was never explored to any great lengths, so we can only hint to what could have been. For example she plays a not so 'wholesome' hostess in 'From Here to Eternity' a role new to her (previous roles had her playing the sweet 'next door type of girl') Nonetheless many were surprised by her outstanding performance, something even Zinneman the director would later attest to. She won an academy award for the role and along with Montogomery Clift put the rest of the cast to shame.
