I'm afraid that I'll have to pull a Springsteen80sbaby here-- rating an artist under the category of their c.d. that I don't even have-- only because Alicia hasn't made her way to a musicians/groups category. I get more annoyed by the hip-hop pianist every time I see her. People think she is a genius because she sings, writes music and sits at a piano. Here's news for you- the piano is really only part of her image. It's her gimmick and if you listen to the piano part of Falling , it's the same three-note riff over and over. I don't enjoy her music and I don't enjoy the fact that she gets to play these great grand pianos. I try not to brag, but I feel I'm more deserving of playing on those Steinways. Don't mean to be too cynical, but sorry, Alicia.
