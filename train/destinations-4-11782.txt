This is another highlight of the place, I went here back in I think September. It's a really fine zoo, with a fair amount of diversity in terms of habitats and types of animals they have there, though I more or less agree with the previous reviewer as far as the necessity of zoos. It's kind of near the downtown.This is one of the ways in which Indianapolis is better than back home- Boston has the worst zoos in the country from what I've seen. I mean awful, I had a better one in a Mountain Dew bottle when I was 7 with blades of grass, ants, and worms rolling around in there. In the Franklin Park Zoo, there are about 3 squirrels, a dead bird and a drunken, shrunken gorilla who's so cynical and jaded from being there for the last 25 years that he's smoking a cheap cigar, got cans of cheap supermarket brand beer all around his cage, wearing a trench coat, flashing people and telling the spectators to go **** themselves. The pits of zoos.
