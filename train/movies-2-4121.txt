Gene Wilder was the only good thing about this movie, I thought he was very convincing as Willy Wonka. Otherwise the movie was so far out there and almost creepy at times. I thought it was totally disgusting how Charlie's family were all crowded on one bed...and felt so sorry for Charlie's mother who I imagine was the only one cleaning those old, nasty people who couldn't or wouldn't get off their lazy asses to clean themselves. Could you just imagine the smell in that house if it was reality? And give me a break with how phony Charlie was compared to all the other evil little brats in the movie. Totally horrific...
