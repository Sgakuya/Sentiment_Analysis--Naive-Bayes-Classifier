It is right for Nancy Pelosi to say that Bush is incompetent. Since his presidency began, this country has lost ground in foreign affairs, global credibility, environmental issues, economic progress for the majority of Americans, sold economic policy for political gain, and most importantly, sacrificed the lives and honor of our armed forces for reasons based on blatant lies. I could go on. Republicans had no issue with criticizing and hating Clinton, and now are incredibly indignant when anyone criticizes this particular Republican administration because of its secrecy and disinformation policies. If he is not incompetent, then it is worse, he is a liar taking America down with him.
