Kmart during the late 1980's had surpassed Sears as the nation's largest retail chain. I wish I knew what happened to the management who got them there, because Kmart has certainly dropped the ball since then. Their stores are cramped, dirty, old, dark, and low prices aren't enough to get me to shop there any longer. Employees are not very helpful, and it's hard to FIND an employee on the sales floor for assistance. Say what you will about WalMart; their stores are spacious, clean, well lit, and most employees are very nice. WalMart didn't destroy Kmart; they did it to themselves. As a retailer, Kmart seemed to forget what got them to the top, and 15 years later they are suffering the consequences: chain-wide bankruptcy. I'd be surprised if this company lasts another five years.
