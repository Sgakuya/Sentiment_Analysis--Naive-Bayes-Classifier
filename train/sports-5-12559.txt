The Wolverines are looking tough this year. It's bad luck that Drew Henson (the highly recuited quarterback who was also drafted to play pro baseball) went down early with an injury that's going to keep him out of at least the first 3-4 games, but back-up quarterback John Navarre has been looking sharp. He certainly has a lot of offensive weapons to choose from - most notably Anthony Thomas pounding the ball up the middle and David Terrell (a Heisman hopeful) making big-play catches. If the Wolverines can hold it together on defense, despite the loss of some key senior players, count on Michigan to have a great year. Given their brutal schedule (the Big 10 is loaded, and one non-conference opponent is a surprisingly tough UCLA team) I won't predict a national championship, but don't be surprised if the Wolverines finish in the top 10.
