MDE.I have a newspaper clipping at home that shows shaq dunking on five New Jersey Nets.He gets swarmed every time he touches the ball.I dont remember a center that has commanded as much attention from opposing defenders as he.It doesnt matter to me whether he can hit a jump shot or not.Can u score?Can u intimidate?Can u make the other team adjust their entire defensive plan because of one person?Can you make those guards and fowards scared to visit you in the paint?To me thats more important than if he can hit a 15ft jumper.He's not supposed to be out that far anyway.Ive also never seen one person change the balance of power everytime he arrives at a new team.Some people who never played at that level (including myself)are critical of his play but you really gotta ask yourself why does everyone else who does play on his level want to play with him?
