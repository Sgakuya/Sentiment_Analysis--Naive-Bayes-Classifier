I have no idea why this corporation is even considered a bank. I swear, all they do is screw you over and you have to pay for it because they only care about the money they make and have no respect for any customers as long as they are making money. I have had nothing but problems with them and they screw over everyone who has a US Bank credit card. You may have your card maxed out with about $20 to spare and yeat, they still charge you account even though you dont use your credit card. I haven't used my US Bank credit card in like 3 months and the last three months I have been charged for overlimit fees and that is bull. US Bank needs to die because they have a horrible reputaion and a lack of consideration for their customers.
