One of these chains recently opened up where I live and so a group of us went downtown to check it out and give it a try. Here's what we found out: Old Chicago is Lousy a capital L . The food was not even average but below average. I find it so discouraging that these huge chains somehow manage to stay in business let alone continue to expand with such mediocre fare. This particular case is even more distressing because they took over a beautiful spot in the historic district where there had been a places called the Seamens Club that had been there forever. So now you have this chain that's trying to disguise itself behind this beautiful brick facade with huge arched windows along a cobble stone street only to get inside and have the whole experience ruined by, as previously stated, Lousy food. Such a shame.
