I would really give this a 4.5. Harry Potter is a great family movie. Taken from the Book by the same name it is a very imaginative story. a young boy who was orphaned as a baby has lived with his horrible aunt, uncle and cousin until at age 11 he finds out he is a wizard. he goes to To Hogwarts to learn to be a wizard and meets new friends Ron, and Hermione. I won't go into anymore detail but I would say this is a great movie to see as a family. There are a few scary scenes, and it is too long. I liked the fact that they stuck with an all british cast especially the child actors. Daniel Radcliff was terrific as Harry.
