Jeb Bush is rated the #2 governor in the country by Cato, next to Bill Owens of Colorado. They were given a grade based on tax policy and spending restraint. Only Owens and Bush got A's! Who was the WORST governor? Surprisingly enough, it was not Davis of California (governor at the time the ratings were last done). Davis got an F all right, but so did three other governors. The gov with the lowest F was Kitzhaber of Oregon. Two Republicans also got F's and one Democrat was #3 (Barnes of Georgia), so it isn't purely a matter of party. However, 11 of the top 13 were Republicans. 10 of the bottom 14 governors were not Republicans, including Howard Dean of Vermont who got a D. I guess that makes sense since most Democrats are thieves. LOL! Click here to see the last ratings. http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa454.pdf
