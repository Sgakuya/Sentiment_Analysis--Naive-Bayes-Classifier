The 1999 draft boos, calls for AJ Feeley, Rush Limbaugh, TO, Whyatt Mondesire; I cannot believe how much gets dumped on this guy. I have never seen McNabb be about anything other than winning football games (and selling the occasional can of soup). First two years they said he ran too much. Now they say he doesn't run enough. He spends every off season voluntarily working out with teammates in Arizona, but since the Super Bowl loss people question his conditioning and composure. Couldn't it be the Pats just had a really great defense? Ask Peyton Manning if you need a second opinion. People who say he hurt his team this year trying to play injured would be the first to accuse him of being soft if he had sat out a few games. The guy has the worst karma in the NFL...
