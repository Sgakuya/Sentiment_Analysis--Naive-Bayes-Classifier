HELLO AND GREETINGS FROM SUNNY ISLANDS OF THE BAHAMAS!! I AM HERE TO COMMENT BECAUSE YOUR SCOOBYDOO BRAND CEREAL THE ORIGINAL FLAVOR NOT THE BERRIES WAS TAKEN OF THE SHELVES IN YOUR USA STORES. HERE THAT ITEM SOLD SO WELL! MANY PEOPLE LOVE THIS CEREAL INCLUDING ADULTS LIKE MYSELF. I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU WOULD MAKE THIS BRAND AGAIN AS THIS WAS THE BEST OF BEST CERALS EVER TO BE MADE. HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE ONE WITHOUT ALL THE MARSHMELLOWS OR ONE WITH VERY FEW AS THEY ARE TOO SWEET. MY ADDRESS IS aladas34@yahoo.com; 242-6778601 Achara Sweeting from Nassau, Bahamas P.S my opinion matters cause my country imports 90% of goods sold for consumption. thank you
