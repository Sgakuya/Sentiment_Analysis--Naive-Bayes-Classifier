There are two kinds Bikers of in the world and gsx-red you are the reason the Crotch-Rocket was invented. They'll be scraping you up off the pavement with a shovel one the days. 0 to 80 in under 7 seconds in plenty fast enough for me and 95 FXDS-Conv. It's not at all about how fast you can go. Owning a Harley is all about the experience! The enjoyment of the environment around you, the wind in your face, the smell of the open road, the feel of that Big Twin thumping through your bones, the deciding of which leaves a better taste on your palette - the June Bug or the Honey Bee. When is the last time that you saw some cute little honey unbuttoning her blouse her waiving her wonders at someone slumped over a Rocket? I wouldn't trade my little Dyna for nuttin'! She'll lay down low in the corners just as nice as anything out there and will run straight and true down the highway at any speed. I can put in a 500 mile day and still get off and walk when its over and then get up in the morning and do it all over again! Shes got over 60,000 miles on her and will still breathe fire within 2 cranks, on even the coolest of mornings. If someone were to give me GSX, I would most likely use it to practice my plasma cutting!
