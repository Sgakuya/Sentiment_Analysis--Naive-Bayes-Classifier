A lot of people rave over this game, which is understandable. It's an amazing game. However, I have to give it a 4 because I have a few small complaints. First of all, maybe it's just me but every once and a while the graphics glitch. Secondly, it can get boring for a little while. You can only do one or two missions at a time. And if you get stuck on one, happily there's a lot to do. However, even with the taxi/fire/police missions and others it can still get boring. For instance, I'm stuck on the big mission in the main area (I think it's the last of the area) where you have to buy a sniper gun and kill all these people on the boat. Well, I swear it's IMPOSSIBLE! I played side missions for awhile, but then got bored. I only play once every month or two just to see if I can do the mission, and I still can't. It's getting annoying! However, these are just little complaints. The GTA series is still one of the best out there. DEFINITELY worth your money!
