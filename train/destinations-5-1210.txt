Ireland has an atmosphere unlike any other place on earth. It is a green, blue and gray swirl of thick grass, craggy rocks, sky, sea and peat bogs. The feelings it inspires and the memories it holds are deep, dramatic - never dull or lukewarm. Like a favorite old sweater, it is somewhat worn but also warm and comforting in a way that new things have no idea how to be. My trip around the Ring of Kerry brought out my deepest fear of heights along with an amazing sense of awe. The spectacular views were well worth the temporary mental stress. Dublin, with its beautiful Georgian doors, ancient pubs, shops and flower vendors, is a wonderful town to explore. If you are drawn to Celtic art, as I am, you should not miss seeing the Book of Kells at Trinity College. The quick look you get will be unforgettable. Afterward, be sure to go upstairs and around the corner to the library's Long Room to have a look at another great Irish treasure; the harp of the famous Irish king, Brian Boru. Traveling to Ireland was the realization of a life-long dream and I found what I somehow always knew I would; a fascinating place where myth and reality blend well, of myriad tales, legends, haunting music, triumphs and tragedies. This isle has so many brilliant facets that you may go to bed exhausted every night, but you will never be bored.
