Another clever , well researched book by a regular guy with a penchant for justice. I have a hard time beleiving that all the people who gave this book a negative reveiw actually read it. To state the books title is racsist is a patheitic cop out. I know he pain of a white man (I am one) we have been persecuted for hundreds of years? Do not state that you have been offended racially you liar. Please refrain from reveiwing books on things that you perceive to be true without even reading page one. Moore fights for the interest of everyday Americans, you would know this to be true if you actually checked him out. Unless you make more than 400k a year you should stop attacking the man. If you question what he says than do your own research, prove him wrong.
