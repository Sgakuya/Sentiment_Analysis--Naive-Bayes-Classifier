bank of america also DOES NOT PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION!!my account is at a bare minimun just so i can have my check deposited and two monthly bills deducted.i noticed this past month that i was overdrawn by 100$ for nsf fees even though i did not use my card. i went into the bank to investigate and a teller told me that i had a deduction come back with insufficient funds.i asked her what it was and was told it was a 8.99 automatic deduction.when i asked her what it was for she had no answer for me, but did provide me with a phone number for the "company" that had posted this. (keep in mind that i had never signed up for any type of other deduction other than the two that i initiated) So i called the "company" and the person that i talked to asked for my name and wanted me to fax over a copy of my soc sec card and my driverse license. mind you, i don't even know who these people are! when i refused and asked the person what kind of company they were, the person hung up on me!so the only info that they had was my name and my BOFA account number which i did not give to them. So, somehow my account number got given to a fraudulent department and my account had been charged a twice monthly 8.99 fee and also encountered a large amount of nsf fees since february.i spoke to a mngr immediatly and informed them that thier bank had let my account information be taken and that fraudulent activity occured. i was pissed! i was so pissed that the mgr agreed to credit me back ALL OF THE CHARGED FEES AND NSF FEES TOTALLING ALMOST 800$! so i come to find out that the fraudulent department was actually a bofa internal department! but yet no one had any idea of what it was! so basically bofa had been stealing my money without consent since february! when i called back to see what the status of my 800$ return the person on the phone said that they would block the deduction being taken out for six months and after that i would have to PAY 20$ TO BLOCK THE FRAUDULENT WITHDRAWL FROM BEING TAKEN OUT OF MY ACCOUNT WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION!!!!!!!!!can you believe that!i never did give them authorization and my account number was given to this department from bofa!WHEN I GET MY $800 I AM IMMEDIATLY CLOSING MY ACCOUNT!BOFA ARE THIEVES AND YOUR INFORMATION IS NOT SAFE!TAKE IT FROM ME-MY LESSSON COST ME OVER $8OO AND NOW THEY HAVE TO PAY!!!
