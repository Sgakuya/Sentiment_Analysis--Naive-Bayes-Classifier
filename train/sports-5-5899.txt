I'll make it short and sweet. To all the dumb noobs out there who obviously haven't watched a game, do you understand why Duke lost or why when Duke loses Redick usually has a sub 20 pt game? Do you even watch these games to understand why? Its pretty simple, THEY TRIPLE TEAM HIM. Of course when they do this and he drops in a 25ft 3, he must suck. Salim is good but lol, he's a wannabe gunner, that shot of his will get destroyed in the NBA, he doesn't have nearly the form of Redick. Put Redick on a team with a good big man and you'll be eating your craptastic banter. weeeeeeeeeeeee hopefully McRoberts doesnt go pro.
