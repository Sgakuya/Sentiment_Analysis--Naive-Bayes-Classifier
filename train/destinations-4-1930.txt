Let me start by saying I'm NOT American. I do love my country and have been to the United States very often. I like America, and it's american way of life. However, I find americans to be just a little bit full of themselves. It bothers me specially, when I hear someone claim oh, the land of the free... . It bothers me, because it generalizes an image that America is above all other countries, and that America is special. Well, let me tell you, that I am Brazilian and we're just as free here as you are up there, if not more... So It doesn't really make sense bragging about freedom at this stage of time, unless you're speaking to a Chinese or a Cuban or the like...
