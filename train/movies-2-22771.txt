We saw this with our toddler when it came out in '82. I couldn't help thinking E.T. looked like Grandma Walton. Also, he seemed to be a parody of Jesus Christ: he could miraculously heal people, he came from above, he died resurrected, he ascended back to where he came from...I wasn't impressed by it. I also didn't like the dirty mouth one of the boys had, or the fact that the mother was so ignorant that she couldn't even see what was happening in her own house most of the time. Worst of all, by the time the movie ended, nearly everyone in the audience was weeping hysterically! No exaggeration...they were walking out the exits bawling right out loud, over that grotesque little creature.
