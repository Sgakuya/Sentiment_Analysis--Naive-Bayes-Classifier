I just finished a great article in the most recent SI about Gibson. His life was in many ways a tragedy and it is amazing that that he isn't mentioned when the greatest players of all-time are discussed. Those who recognize the name remember him for his homeruns. Well, he did more than just hit homeruns. The man hit .517 one year. .517!!!! That is incredible even for kids in Little League. Sure, some people say that no one will ever know how good the players he played against were nor how he would have fared had he played in the Majors. But, he starred in all of the all-star games against the big leaguers. And, by the way, the huge numbers don't lie. Josh Gibson should be remembered as one of the greatest baseball players of all-time.
