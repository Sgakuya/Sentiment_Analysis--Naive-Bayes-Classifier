It amazes me when friends and family up North take Florida vacations and head straight to Orlando. Sure if you want to go home blurry-eyed,broke and stressed out !!! Come to Tampa Bay and spend the most relaxful week you'll ever spend!! Just the beaches alone, i could spend a week at, warm clean water, soft white sand !! Busch Gardens, party in Ybor City at night if you like the night life. Awesome funky restaurants in every price range. Go to Frenchees right on Clearwater Beach, have the grouper reuben, its the best night out you can find. Tampa is inexpensive, laid back, beautiful weather year-round, yes a little hot in the summer If you're lucky enough to have someone who lives here, with a pool LOL they will show you the ultimate Florida lifestyle. And yes, Orlando is just slightly more than an hour away, if you feel the urge to stand in lines for an hour at a time. I could go on and on, but trust me, Tampa is the perfect Florida getaway if you want a taste of all that Florida has to offer, not just theme parks.
