Oh, god! Is California the best or what! I lived there when I was little, and briefly in the 80s, and it was the nicest place I ever lived! I lived in the SF bay area, and yes, you have to be on your toes every single second, but it's such an upbeat place to be! My old town, Woodland was just the prettiest little place, and I can feel the sun and see our house as if it were yesterday! Listening to songs like She-Bop and Hot Night make me cry because I associate them with the 80s, but with the 80s as essentially linked to CA! My life was so good there, and while we were just regular middle-class people, I consider it my brush with the 'good life'! California is so beautiful, diverse, and fast! I loved it more than anything! Maybe I should move back there...
