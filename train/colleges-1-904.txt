My experience at DeVry is by far one of the worst I've had. I went to the financial aids many time requesting information about my loans and scholarship and where my money is going to but the faculty there never wants to give me the information that should belong to me. From experience, if you pester a professor enough, you'll pass..even if you're the dumbest person around.. you just need to talk your way to a good grade. DeVry's employee are lazy and incompetent. The career advisors seemed to always be walking around and not doing what they're being paid to do. No one is ever at the cashier office.. there's always a note saying 'For Cashier, go to Student Finance'.. and when you go there, no one is there to help you either. The professors talk more about themselves then they do the subject they're supposed to teach. If you're a girl, you basically just have to wait 3 yrs for your degree. Every class seems to always be a review of the first day of class that semester, which is basically the syllabus and introduction. Out of all the professor, I'd say two actually cared about the students' well-being.. and yes, they left the school already because they knew what a fraud the school has become.
