Nicholson is one of those celebrated Hollywood Icons that people are afraid to admit the truth about. Everyone is afraid to break rand and give this man an honest review of his talent. Talen of which he is amost devoid. He has two methods which he follows while acting . In the first he yells through out the movie, stopping to whisper when emphasis is required and the other is to whisper through to movie, stopping to yell when emphasis is required. You never see him as the character on screen, it is always blindingly obvious that it is JACK NICHOLSON on screen, attempting to convince the watcher that he is the character. That is not acting, merely being a famous celebrity. The man is WAY overrated.
