American cheese is kind of the default of all cheeses--a usually mild, all-purpose cheese which comes in white or yellow (both are alright, but for aesthetic purposes yellow does it for me). It's a staple for one of the best comfort foods--grilled cheese sandwich! Definately, the pre-packaged stuff that comes wrapped individually typically can't come even close to the deli cheese! The pre-wrapped cheese for many brands is kind of shiny, rubbery, and strangely smooth and weird. Good for kids, but if you're a big fan of cheese, it might be worth the extra money to go to the deli and get the Land o' Lakes American cheese. I tried it once, and never looked back!
