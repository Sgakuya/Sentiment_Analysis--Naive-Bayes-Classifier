Well, folks here I am again. Ready to complain. Partially about Kroger, but mostly about the Union the represents us here in Dallas. Let me start off by saying the Union is a joke. I was fierd last August for getting into it with a customer. This man insulted me first over and over.Then proceeded to drop the N-Word about the two black employees he was complaining to me about.Thinking he crossed a line I let him have it verbally. My D/M, Keith Shoemaker,decided I was in the wrong and fierd me. I think the note I got from Kroger said "Just Cause" was the reason. Even my store manager,who is African American,would'nt stand up against this racist customer and come to my defense.Talk about bowing to The Man ans being a sellout.Then the union rep says I'll get my job back and he'll see to it.It's now been almost 3 months and nothing but crap from my rep and the whole union in general.Stop paying those dues Kroger employees.The Local 1000 won't be there for you.They're stealing your hard earned cash.As for all you customers here in D/FW.Go to Wal-Mart,Save-a-Lot,Fiesta,Albertsons,Super Saver or even Tom Thumb.The prices are better and in most cases the folks are a hell of alot more polite then what Kroger and there low wages are presenting to you.Take it from someone who's been on the inside.Kroger cares nothing for it's customers or empolyees. It's all about a small circle of fat men.Getting richer and fatter off us all
