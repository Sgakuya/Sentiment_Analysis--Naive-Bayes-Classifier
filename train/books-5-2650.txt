Of all the many cookbooks full of lucious Creole and Cajun cuisine, Paul Prudhomee's book Louisiana (Luzianna Kitchen) Is by far the best book to ever be published. It is complete and thorough and historical.Paul takes one through the beginnings of Acadian Cajun and Creole roots and shows how each form of cooking was inspired to its present form. A totally complete must have cook book for anyone who wants to know the best recipes for fundamental Jamabalaya's, Gumbo's, etouffe's, Catfish Courtbillion, and my favorite classic, Sweet Potato Pecan Pie with Chantilly Lace Cream. I have been a chef for 40 years and still say Paul is the Babe Ruth of cuisine !
