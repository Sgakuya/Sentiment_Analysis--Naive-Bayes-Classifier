I live in Maine, the number 2 rated state in the US. In Maine, there IS no racism. Of course, there is NO race here except white people. But we pride ourselves on being open-minded and accepting. An easy thing to do when you don't have to deal with it. I lived in Charleston for 3 years in the early 80's and it was the BEST 3 years of my life. I know, I must be crazy according to the majority of you, but instead of looking at all the negatives, I chose to see the positives. The weather, the springs that I know emulate heaven, the cobblestone streets. It was a wonderful adventure. Since then, I've been all over the state for different reasons and, I'm sorry, but I just haven't seen the awful things a lot of you have seen. Once I got over the culture shock (having been raised in the melting pot of NJ), I was able to look past the negatives (which I have done - go to the Maine site where I blast Maine, but still gave it 4 stars out of loyalty) and focus on the many kindnesses I witnessed. I treated ALL people like I would a friend and never saw some of the things described here. Perhaps because I didn't let one bad incident ruin my entire opinion of this beautiful state. I went to St. Kitts recently and stayed at the Marriott. It was incredible. However, on the beach I had an altercation with a local over some jewelry I was buying that was quite frightening. Nevertheless, I still would give it a 5-star rating because it was ONE incident and maybe I wasn't entirely right, myself. Chin up, South Carolinians. It's a lovely state with the different but still problems of all the other states. Don't let them pull you down. I could write a book about the number 2 state of Maine that would rival anything written here about South Carolina. People are people are people. You'll find good and bad people everywhere, in every state. Frankly, I think YOU should be number 2 and Maine farther down. But, that's just MY opinion :)
