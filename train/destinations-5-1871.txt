Obviously the USA is the greatest country ever ! I love it here and I would never want to live anywhere else. For those of you that whine about this country, but insist on living here, move somewhere else. No one is forcing you to stay here. Get the hell out of here if it is so horrible. Just feel thankful that you have the right to express your feelings. Go USA ! And thank you so much to any soldier that has fought for my freedom and the freedom of every other American. Words cannot express how much I appreciate every soldier this country has had and will have in the future. I love you America ! THANKS. '''Kolby
