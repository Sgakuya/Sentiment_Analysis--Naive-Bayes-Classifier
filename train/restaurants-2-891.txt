I don't eat here very often. For the same money id spend I can go to a restaurant and get a hot cooked meal. Subway has gone down hill alot. You have to force the person making your sub to put on a enough lettice on it and any other topping you may like. I had to ask the lady 4 times more lettice please, then she looked at me like I was a jerk, but in reality for $8.00 for a cold meat sandwich, it is my right to get the toppings I want on it, not like lettice cost alot, the only thing that cost alot is the sandwich. They ask the stupid question would you like cheese on it sir? for the price I am paying it better have cheese on it. Then I get asked for $2 more would you like extra meat? I paid for extra meat onetime, I got the steak sub paid for the extra meat, the sandwich costed me $10 and I was still hungry when I was finished, Even with the double meat on the steak it still is very little portions. Subway taste pretty good, that is why it got 2 stars, but other then that, I am not paying out money for nothing, and that is what you get alot of at Subway, alot of nothing.
