A very good smooth bourbon. It would seem unrealistic to insist on comparing this to the many much more muscular products from Kentucky, as it has more in common with Balvanie than Wild Turkey. It begins sweet, with hints of citrus and chocolate, but hangs on with a long warm finish. While delicate at first, it is certainly not a lightweight, and has a very strong personality. Clean and approachable, it uses finesse rather than strength to make its way, and I think succeeds very well. It is best enjoyed neat, or with a very small splash of water to open up the aroma. Ice has the undesirable effect, as it usually does, of weakening the aroma and flavors.
