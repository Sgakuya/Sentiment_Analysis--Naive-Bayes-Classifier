Vince Vaughn is like one of those guys that were really popular in high school. The kind of guy who was every guy's pal, every girl's crush,etc. In Swingers , Vaughn lit up the screen and I couldn't keep my eyes off of him. He was so charismatic, funny, and he took that role to surprising lengths whenever he showed an ounce of concern for Mikey. I knew he was going to head for bigger, if not necessarily better,(since I'm not sure if it could get any better than Swingers !) things. In movies like The Locusts and A Cool, Dry Place , Vaughn exhibited an undiscovered side of himself- he was no longer the larger-than-life lounge lizard of Swingers , but an interesting and intelligent real person. The best part of seeing him in films like these is to watch him still illuminate the screen even when he's not playing a fascinating character! I gave Vince four stars because although he is an incredibly handsome man and a wonderful actor, I think he still has a lot to offer and personally I would be the first in line to receive!
