I've never been a member of Blockbuster but my sister is and when she visits or I visit her we usually go rent a few movies. If you are interested in a new release or other recent popular movie they will probably have it. If your taste runs a little more esoteric then you're wasting your time. None of the stores I have visited have what I would call a decent selection. There is virtually nothing in the way of foreign films and even Hollywood classics are few and far between. Prices also seem a bit high and the rental periods are too short. Unless you are interested in new releases only, Netflix is probably a better bet.
