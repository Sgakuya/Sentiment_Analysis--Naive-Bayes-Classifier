Got to love the falls... there is so much to do other than stare at the falls, which I could personally do for hours. It is just truely amazing the things to do... make sure you book at least 2 or 3 days at the falls before heading back home or continuing with your vacation. Spend an entire day doing fall activities... including... journey under the falls (you actually go underneath the falls) as well as the Maid of the Mist, great gorge Adventure (highly underated), The Spanish Aero Car is a must, Queenston Park, The Butterfly Gardens, The Skylon (don't do the Minolta Tower) the skylon has an outdoor observatory (still) and they actually clean the glass. Plus you get a much better view of the falls. Minolta is a waste of money. Then there is the restauraunts and attractions of Clifton Hills... plus you will want to spend at least a day at Marine Land (everybody loves Marineland).
