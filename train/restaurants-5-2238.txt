Maybe White Castle burgers are an acquired taste. But I acquired the taste as a kid when my pops, me and two sisters would hop into the car and go get carry-out bags of about 25 burgers. It seems that folks either love or detest these lil' burgers. Sure they ain't health food, but we're talking guilty indulgences. I crave them, especially now that I can't get them. I live in the South where there are no White Castles. But, rather than trying the ersatz regional variety (Crystals), I buy the frozen W.C. burgers and eat them with a pickle. They aren't so bad. They give me gas just like the real things! I prefer the cheese burgers (frozen and fresh kinds). Yep, White Castles' are my little piece of grease-laden, artery-hardening heaven.
