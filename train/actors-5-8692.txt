What name is most famously known for being beautiful, glamorous, lavish, intriguing, and fascinating? That would be the name Gabor Dahling! The famous Gabor trio are among the most beautiful and extravagant ladies in show business history. But Eva was not just any Gabor sister she was THE Gabor sister. She stands out as the embodiment of talent and grace. She holds the torch for her acting abilities and never fails to stand as one of the most gorgeous figures that ever graced the screen. She has a smile that will melt your heart and a charm that will make you return the smile everytime. Her Hungarian upbringing and distinct accent makes her a cultural wonder and a joy to listen to. She has appeared in movies such as Gigi, The Truth About Women, and many more, but she is most famously known for her role in Green Acres. She showed viewers every week for six years that she had talent which created for the viewers a character that will never be forgotten. Her comedic timing and professionalism prove that she was born to entertain. She was once quoted as saying I was the first actress in the family, and I am still the only actress in the family... which shows how important acting was to her and not just the publicity and attention. Even though I adore the entire Gabor family including Magda and Zsa Zsa I find Eva to be the true Gem. She has left an erasable mark on my heart and to a young girl she has left a role model figure of bright, sparkling smiles. Her untimely death has left an undescribable void, but I can hear her saying now, Gabors and diamonds are forever dahling. May Eva rest in peace.
