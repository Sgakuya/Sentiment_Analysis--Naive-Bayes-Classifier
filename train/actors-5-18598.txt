What a controversial guy! It's really too bad about his cooperation with McCarthy's witch hunt back in the 50's which, of course, resulted in unfairly ruining more than a few careers. Though ill advised, you can only assume he had his reasons for testifying and bull-headedly continuing never to regret it. I can still see Amy Madigan's angry fist-like face when Kazan was given his lifetime achievement award on Oscar night a couple of years back. She certainly wasn't the only one upset that night but I'm pretty sure she was in charge of the death stares! On top of the fact that it really wasn't a good look for her, I feel that the overtly angry reaction of today's sinless Hollywood to something that happened almost 50 years ago was a little over the top and even kind of embarrassing. Speak about it, write about it, shout it at a political rally, or walk out - but hateful looks and jeering only show a lack of professionalism. I don't agree with his politics or his actions either - but I think I could have found it in my heart to be civil for a few short moments to honor such an impressive body of work - which, as I recall, was the actual REASON for the award. I know I'm not the only person convinced that it was his very adept direction and approach to films like On the Waterfront , East of Eden , and A Streetcar Named Desire that helped make them the great classics they have become. I have no way to judge his stage direction, which has been said to be highly innovative but I do know for certain that his films have always had the ability to fascinate me on a certain level regardless of their subject matter. Yes, Kazan may deserve a few brickbats - but not for his work. I'm glad at least a few were able to overcome their personal feelings and give him at least a few of the roses he earned as a director. And, since this portion of RateItAll is about movie direction, I will give him the 5 stars I very much feel he deserves as well.
