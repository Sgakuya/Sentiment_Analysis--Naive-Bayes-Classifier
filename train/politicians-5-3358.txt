Bush is a man of steadfast conviction, morals and values and one that believes in staying the course in a land where a stable democratic government is the goal. Despite the selfish, mean spirited leftist hatred thrown at him daily by the main stream media he has clearly made the case for our actions in Iraq. He has made the debate binary, either you wish to win or you're a defeatist. As far as the spying abroad, in my opinion, go for it!! I'm not doing anything nefarious. This begs the question to those so up in arms about it; what are you doing wrong? Or moreso, why would anyone be against the government having the quickest intervention if it means saving lives? Right is right, even if everyone is against it; and wrong is wrong, even if everyone is for it. -William Penn
