Fidelity Investments seems to have that Good, but not Brilliant feel that often goes with huge organizations. I've been a customer there for about 9 years and I can't really think of anything outstanding-- good OR bad-- that has happened during those years. Any time I've gone to an actual Fidelity office, the people have been friendly enough. The web site (which has gone through much tweaking over the years) is perfectly serviceable, although they could use a little usability work. Fees are certainly in the ballpark, compared to competitors. On account of their size, they have a VAST array of in-house financial services and products to offer, in addition to just straight discount brokerage services. I like the fact that this makes them almost a financial supermarket. On the other hand, you also get that I'm just a number feeling. But... they give me what I need, and I have no inclination to go elsewhere-- so that's probably how they got so successful!
