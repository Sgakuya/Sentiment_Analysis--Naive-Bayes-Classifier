A superb choice as head coach. Never been a Head Coach? Irrelevant. Every current Head Coach at one time had NO experience - EVERY single one of them. Even Bear Bryant was once a rookie. Mike Shula is extremely intelligent and a hard worker. He has an impeccable bloodline, background, plenty of experience as an on-the-field, in-the-trenches coach, ties to the Crimson Tide program and youth. Plus, he'll have recruiting ties previously not available to the program. Will he be an instant success - a miracle worker? Probably not. They'll have a good year this year and fall off because of probation for the next two or three. But if we can get him to stay, the Crimson Tide will have a gem of a coach.
