#1 burger of all time. I love sliders, but rarely get them after moving out west. My mother used to buy them and bring them out on the plane. Nothing beats a sack of WC's after being out at night. Used to eat a bagful for breakfast too but that is not advisable - the onions stay with you all day. You don't go to WC for the high quality fries or drinks. The fries are just okay, and the drinks I'd say less than average quality. Being open 24 hours a day is a big advantage. I'm going home to Chicago for a visit next week. My sister already knows dinner the first night I get there will be White Castle. NOTE: For those of you who haven't ever had a White Castle, you can get vaguely the idea of them by going to McDonald's and ordering their regular cheeseburgers WITHOUT ketchup. It's not the same but it's the best I can do without a WC around.
