JCPenney is not bad at all! I work there, and everyone (save for a few of those obnoxious teeneyboppers they just hired for the holidays) is really friendly and helpful. There are a lot of older people who love the clothes in the women's dept., younger people (like me) who can find nice bargains in the misses and juniors depts., and they have great purses, coats, baby clothes, and sheets and towels, too! I know I sound biased because I work there, but the key to our store's success is, in addition to selling the basics, we make customer service our top priority. And we have a catalog, too, so if you want something we don't sell, or if we just don't have your size or color, we can order it for you. We actually play tolerable music (boots associate morale!), and we do gift wrapping at an affordable price! I don't mean to sound like an advertisement! But JCPenney is really a nice store! Give us a chance, people!
