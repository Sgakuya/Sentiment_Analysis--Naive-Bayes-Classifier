I rated this low, not because I have bad reception, it has been pretty good until lately and now it is cutting out on me so that I have to unplug the box for about 15 seconds and then let it reload before I get channels again, that is annoying to say the least and has just started happening after 4 months of really good reception. MY lower rating is that I got a package deal, all the channels including premium for like $50 a month for 3 months, then I was told that I could drop the 'sports' pkg part of it since I don't watch sports, and it would only cost $75 a month for all the rest of the channels including premium channels, well, once that 3 months was over, I called to drop the sports pkg, and would you not know, they said it would be $88 a month to drop it, and $96 a month to keep it!! I told the gal, that is NOT what I was quoted just 3 months ago, she said basically too bad, that is the price now--and, she did NOT drop those channels for me, but I am NOT going to pay for them period!! So my advice is to get it in writing from them because they will tell you ANY lie to get you to sign up and be committed to a years worth of programming now!!! I should have gone dish, as I HATE companies that lie to you, going to write the BBB and attny general about this problem, you would have thot that direct tv would have learned from all the mistakes regular cable has made, but guess they are thieves too.
