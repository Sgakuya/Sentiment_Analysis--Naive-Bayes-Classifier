I don't like the Mets...but what I'm really here to say is that I don't like the fans. The Mets have a sorry excuse for fans. I think they are very immature and I'd be embarassed if I was up there. They try to be rowdy and throug things at players...especially the Atlanta Braves. Sorry that you Mets fans hate the Braves..but you'll have to get over it, because we will beat the Mets every year so brace yourselves. GO BRAVES!! Forget them skanky yankees!! And I'd also like to add, that the Mets fans need to just go ahead and back up off of John Rocker. They are just mad coz' they don't have a pitcher good like them. They tried...keyword here is try....to make him lose control at the games...but that didn't work because he just kept on striking those Mets out! Can't get much better than that!
