This is one unstable young lady who needs some serious professional help. Angelina Jolie is NOT an attractive (read: well-adjusted) person. What she has going for her are breasts, a smile, breasts, cellulose-injected lips, breasts, Billy Bob Thornton, breasts, and timing. She won an Oscar for Girl, Interrupted. Sir Richard Burton was a classically-trained Shakespearean actor, and was nominated seven times for an Oscar, but never won---a tragedy if ever there was one. Burton's career spanned over four decades. Jolie's has lasted maybe 3 years. I highly doubt Lara Croft: Tomb Raider will be found at my local Blockbuster store under Classics anytime soon. Her interviews in Rolling Stone and Jane, once you look past the rambling, self-absorbed monologue and you read between the lines, told me a frightening story about who A.J. is: a scared, horribly emotionally-scarred young woman (no doubt a result of growing up with her father, Jon Here, man, have another toke Voight) who is obsessed with knives, machetes and self-mutilation. What Billy Bob sees in her escapes me. (He doesn't exactly radiate stable, solid family structure and values, either.) Perhaps her role in G,I was not so very far from what she really is experiencing in life. Frankly, that's pretty scary. AJ is certainly smart in that she knows what Hollywood seems to want, but is she strong enough to do what is morally right? If her father could fall apart (and he did, self-destructing and throwing his promising career away), she could do so as well. I hope to God I'm wrong.
