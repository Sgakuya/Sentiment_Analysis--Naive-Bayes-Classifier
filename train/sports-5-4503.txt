Jimmie Boeheim is the total package- an accomplished, top-tier coach, a good man of integity, and an asset to his instituton and community. Sports fans have probably heard a lot about each of these areas. But one thing that is not as well known is that he is an incredible mentor and friend to his former players. I've had the pleasure of talking to Jimmy B. at numerous events over the years. Ask him about any player- obscure bench warmer from 20 years ago, or superstar NBA player from one of his great teams. He can tell you everything about his boys and the fact is, he's helped a lot of them over the years in various ways. He's still their coach. I was at an event a few years ago when someone mentioned Conrad McRae, one of his players who died of a heart malady. Boeheim was nearly moved to tears, but he took the time to reminisce about that former player's infectious smile, enthusiasm, leadership, and other personal qualties. Say what you want about Boeheim, but the guy is an educator, coach, and person of the highest quality. He belongs in the hall of Fame.
