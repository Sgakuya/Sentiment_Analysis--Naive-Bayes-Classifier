Wow, I'm surprised that there are a lot of quality issues with Victoria's Secret! So far, I haven't had a problem at all (except one, but that was a bad judgement call on my part, really), and the bras tend to be pretty durable and confortable (if you get the right line of stuff). Of course bra fitting is variable between different people, but so far VS bras fit me best over any department store-bought ones (oddly enough). I bought a bodysuit there a few years back and it's so comfortable! I appreciate that the dressing rooms feature FULL doors (I get a little self-conscious, so the extra privacy is nice). I have never yet met a staff member who wasn't courteous and helpful. They're a bit on the pricy side, but it's well worth it, at least for me.
