The Spy Who Loved Me is probably my favorite Bond film, and definitely my favorite starring Roger Moore (in his third appearance as 007). The screenplay is well written, the nemeses are creative, the locales are exotic, the gadgets are cool as hell, the main Bond Girl is both attractive and strong, and the theme song is sexy and top-notch. The plot is from the Cold War era (being released in 1977) as the chief bad guy (Stromberg) is trying to start World War III by instigating a nuclear exchange between the Americans and Soviets with stolen submarines. Assigned to determine what's what are both Bond and Soviet Agent XXX (aka Maj. Anya Amasova) who is played by Barbara Bach. The two join forces in Cairo and then move on to adventures in Sardinia, under the seas, and on submarines which keeps the movie moving at a faster pace than some of the other films in the series. Spy is an improvement over Moore's previous Bond films in that it has less comic relief in favor of more appropriate darker and serious tones (though the film still has some of the campiness that has become important to the success of the franchise). One last observation of note is that the opening scene which normally has little (if anything) to do with the remainder of Bond films creates an ongoing sub-plot throughout Spy which was a nice touch.
