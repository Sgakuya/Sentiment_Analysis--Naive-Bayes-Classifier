A good president, and lest we forget a good liberal. He fought to expand the New Deal and protect labor, but was thwarted by conservatives on both sides of the aisle. Also, the first Democratic president to make any effort at enacting civil rights legislation. Revisionist historical attempts to discredit him seem disingenous. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were horrible, but recent Japanese scholarship indicates that higher ups in Japanese government would have almost certainly have fought on if bombs had not been used. He likely saved more Japanese than were killed in bombings (old men, boys, girls, and women were being armed with bamboo spears to fight off American invasion) and he certainly saved the lives of many American soldiers. His moderate anti-communism also seems correct; Stalin was not to be trusted. A little overrated though, while a great president I don't think he was as important as FDR, Lincoln, or Washington.
