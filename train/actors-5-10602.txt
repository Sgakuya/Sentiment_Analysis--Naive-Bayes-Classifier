I think Drew is really sweet. In interviews she is so sincere and what I love about her is that she is constantly striving to be a better person, and always thinking about that. That is not a quality that a lot of people have. It is especially amazing because of the difficult childhood she had, and so admirable that she had the strength to overcome her troubles to become a beautiful and altruistic person. In movies, she lights up the screen...she has brought life to some scripts that would otherwise have been very dull. In some pictures, she looks so stunning that she is the most beautiful person I have ever seen. In others, she looks kinda plain and just like anyone, which I like, but she still has this interesting cute face. I think she has the most perfect body...slim and healthy. I could just smack people who say she is fat...I think her body is beautiful and perfect for herself. She really is tiny, but she keeps a bit of flesh on her, which looks so so much better than people who have their skeleton showing through their skin. (Some actresses are naturally really thin and lanky and they look good, but ones who are naturally a bit curvier like Drew and lose more weight look terrible). Anyway, I think she is a great actress, though she does not think of herself as anything she is not, like an Oscar-winning actress. She is humble and modest, but candid and comfortable with herself. I love that she is an animal rights activist. She has an amazing gift of making those who see her feel cheerful and wonderful. I also love her sense of style...she wears individual but stylish things that end up setting the trends. She is such a gorgeous flower-child who believes in goodness, and I love her.
