What can you expect from MTV studios? A corny, predictable movie that tries too hard to appeal to the teens who want to believe that they aren't brainwashed into Britney and NSYNC worship - but are really still unable to escape the pop culture bubble MTV among others has bombarded them with. This movie had a good concept, and a plot with enough interesting twists that it could have been a great movie under different producers. But the acting and the predictably cliched scenes were a little too Crossroads reminiscent, if you get what I mean. The actors seemed to be talking down to the audience (the target market of 12-14 year olds), instead of really becoming their characters (as the actors in Crazy/Beautiful, for example, managed to do). Above all else, this is more marketed teen fluff. It's trying to be the thinking teen's ultimate movie, but it's really closer to Britney Spears' Crossroads .
