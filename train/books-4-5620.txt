Cute, although I can't relate to being desperate and not having a boyfriend! ; ) Just kidding; all females have felt like Bridget before at one point or another: lonely, desiring male attention but only receiving f***wittage (as Bridget refers to it), dealing with commitment-phobic males, digging through the dirty clothes hamper for something to wear and winding up two hours late to work, monitoring weight and calories on a daily (sometimes hourly) basis...her neuroses are charming and funny, and I can't wait to see the movie. Personally, I think Renee Zellweger is an excellent choice to play Bridget, even though she isn't British. Renee is plain in a good, non-Hollywoodish way, and I can see her taking up Bridget's life wonderfully. Bullocks to anyone who disagrees! : ) (hee hee, it seems the British-speak has rubbed off on me...I love the way they call a box of chocolates a milk tray ...)
