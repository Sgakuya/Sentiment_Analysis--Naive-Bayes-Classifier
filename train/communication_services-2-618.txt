NATIONAL ROAMING FLAWED I switched to the national roaming plan and found NO good signal at the St Louis airport although great service in NEw York City. When I returned home I tried to switch back to my old Pac Bell Cal-Nevada Plan. I was informed that I should keep the National plan for up to 60 days but NOT use it for roaming during that time period as I may be still be billed for roaming use during the last 60 days ofof the plan. WhY? Simply because Pacific Bells' accounting system for roaming is flawed. I waited the time while not using the PAID FOR roaming feature. I then tried to retun to my old Digital Advantage plan only to be informed that as of the previous week it was no longer available. Period. All cell companies have pluses and minuses. Pac Bell's for my uses is now in the negative column. I t may be worth the $150 early termination to switch companies. Others have come up with better deals.
