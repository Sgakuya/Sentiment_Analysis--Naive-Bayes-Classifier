After reading all the comments in regards to the HUMMER I am offened at the idea that it is only for men and for wealth. I have a 1998 wagon with all the bells and whistles. I AM FEMALE and I will tell you why I have it and its not for the reasons listed in other comments. I am a 24 year old single mom who travels Canadian Icey roads all the time with a small child. I own my own buisness which is about 100 miles from my home. I rely on my hummer to get me where I want to go safley and on time. I could go get a 40,000 dollar truck which I would be able to get stuck and or maybe even get killed if hit by the same size of vehical. I use this vehical for advertiing my buisness on and give one of them away frequently because they are such a valuable vehical to own. Where I am there is not alot of hummers for miles and it may draw attention however a 60,000 dollar viper will do the same. I worked hard for my buisness which enables me to drive this kind of vehical. When a person buys any car/truck it is because its the vehical of there choice and whatever they buy they are proud of. I have taken mine in all kinds of contitions and have no complaints about it so far.. The one thing I can garrentee is that I am going to be getting there safley. As for peoples additudes on the comment listed in the negative they are about as ignorant as many people whom I come accross not beleiveing a women would buy a hummer when she could have picked a nice little sports car. Many times I have heard the comment wow can't beleive your husband let you drive this (Im not married and this vehical hasn't helped the situation unless I was looking for someone that was a user and you don't need a hummer to find them) If it wasn't for the saftey and the advertizing I may have bought that 60,000 car that was useless to me and that way I could have had the same amount of attention and people would have beleived it was mine... Anyone who buys one your not going to be dissapointed.
