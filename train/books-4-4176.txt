I didn't mind this book at all. I can see the symbolism,and I think that it is something most of us can relate to at one point or other,but I can also understand how it can be a little bit off-putting and annoying. Myself, I found Holden a bit over bearing,like so many teenage boys I know. But I think the quote used in the book by Wihelm Stekel marks a pivital point in Holdens conscience and the quote goes as follows:'The mark of an immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.' This presents Holden with what he is and what he has to become in order move along in his life. The duck pond is also a fascinating use of symbolism for society. He asks himself, and later the cab driver where they all go,the ducks that is,in winter when the lake has frozen over,which is Holden questioning his place in society. Very interesting really. So many GD's,almost drove me insane!
