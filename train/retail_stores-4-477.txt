I have found myself back in the Gap more often lately. For a while I was shopping at Old Navy for the great prices and fun styles for the whole family..however, after a few months and regular washings, the clothes start to fade and fall apart (and the styles have gotten a bit whacky for me)..so I am back to the Gap. Classic basics, and stylish trends at pretty reasonable prices (I still head to the back of the store to the sales racks and refuse to pay $29.99 for a white T-shirt). I have noticed and been told that, on average, the jeans shrink at least 1-2 sizes after multiple washings..but I can live with that, hopefully it will keep my weight in check.
