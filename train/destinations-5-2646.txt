I moved to Chicago five years ago from Texas, and didn't know what to expect. I didn't expect the people to be as friendly as they are in the south, and they aren't, but they come pretty darn close. The only rude people I find aren't even from here...transplants from the NE or other areas. The city is gorgeous, and for it's size is pretty damn clean. I quickly tired of all the touristy crap, which there is a huge abundance. But Chicago has tons of other stuff to do as well. As I mentioned, I've been here for five years, and there's still so much I've yet to do. For such a big city, it's reasonably affordable and still retains it's small town roots. If you haven't been here, get here soon.
