Released in 2000 and directed by Todd Phillips, Road Trip is a benign yet surprisingly effective teenage comedy. The premise is Barry (Tom Green), a New York college student who is giving a campus tour to some prospective freshman, starts to tell a story of a road trip involving some of his friends. The trip began when Josh (Breckin Meyer) videotapes a liaison with a co-ed (Amy Smart), but the tape gets sent to his girlfriend in Texas (Rachel Blanchard) by mistake. Without a car, Josh and his cohorts (Seann William Scott and Paulo Costanzo) must befriend the dorm geek (D.J. Qualls) to get the use of his car. From there, the four experience several odd and funny moments including absconding a blind school's bus and pretending to be members of a black fraternity. The core cast is supported by notable appearances by Fred Ward and Andy Dick, and Tom Green works given his relatively small dose. The bottom line is that Road Trip is unexpectedly good for a film in its genre and worth a rental.
