this is some of the finest of fantasy fiction that i've ever seen. i don't know how you can rate a whole series with one stroke, but here goes. from what i've read of it (there are books i haven't read, but i've read five of them) you have a cosmology in which every false creator myth proves true: the world is flat (a disc), it has a grim reaper, gods, wizards, etc, and being this way discworld proves the absurdity of every religious idea ever forged, thus becoming inadvertently a skeptic's bible. pratchett uses his world as a forum for serious ideas, which he portrays in a monty python-esque fashion, trying to preserve their importance, while only being able to illustrate how dumb they are. some big questions are dealt with, and some excellent jokes are revealed. since i'm not qualified to recommend the whole series, here are my favorites, which so far seem to be essential reading: small gods, mort, lords and ladies, and the light fantastic. here you have gods, death, fairies, and magic, all well-presented. i personally would recommend avoiding interesting times and soul music but everyone's tastes vary.
