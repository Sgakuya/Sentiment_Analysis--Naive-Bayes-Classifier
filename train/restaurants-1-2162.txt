I go to Tim Horton's daily, in fact the company I work at every day goes in with a minimum $25 order as well. We get disciplined because we do not call the order ahead. We cannot always do that, if we could, it would also benifit us. The last time I went in for lunch, I ordered a bagel NOT toasted with cr. cheese. as always I have to watch carefully, they toast it everytime. Yesterday I inquired as to why that is and was told when they get busy they do not read all the details on the screen. It makes more sense to me to hire more staff than to tell the customers they don't have time to make your order properly. As for the drive thru, NEVER would I order food, they made errors on the coffee orders too many times. After all.....what are we going to do? bring it back? The coffee is great always has been, but the service has gone downhill. PS im Hortons, I would have complained to you directly if there was a way to do so, your suggestion box was full to overflowing
