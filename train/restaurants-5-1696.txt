I m not certain how long this chain has been around, but I do know we got our first one on my side of town about 2 years ago strategically and conveniently located down the street from where I work (o;. - and I ve been hooked ever since! First of all, they have a choice of 2 excellent and very fresh breads - your usual white sub sandwich type and a wonderful thick sliced wheat bread. The menu runs from Italian subs to those great California-style veggie combo sandwiches. My personal favorite is one called The Beach Club which consists of the previously mentioned thick wheat bread with avocado, turkey, Swiss cheese, sprouts, tomato and a bit of Mayo. The Beach Comber is closely followed by another little wonder called The Vito which includes a very nice selection of Italian meats and cheeses on the white sub bun. Sides are kind of a mild low point huge dill pickle or chips being your only two choices. They don t have any outstanding special beverages either just the usual line up of sodas and iced tea. The sandwiches, however, IMO, really make up for the weak points because they are so huge (easily shared by two if you aren t starving) they are a meal in themselves.
