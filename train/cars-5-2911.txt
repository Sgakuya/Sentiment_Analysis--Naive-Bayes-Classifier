Comments based on 1999 Camaro SS convertible. I enjoy this car more than any the Corvettes, Supras, or Mustangs I've had. The engine control is superb. You can floor the accelerator in 6th gear at 700 RPM and the car accelerates smoothly (though slowly 8-). Yet their are no flat spots all the way to redline. The available traction control actually makes it drivable in poor weather, though if I know it's going to snow, I'd rather drive a truck. The wind protection is phenomenal. You can hold a conversation without shouting at 90 (uh... wait... I mean 70) without shouting (at least if you turn down the stereo). It all boils down to 0-60 in 6 sec and 25 mpg.
