I can understand if you think that GWB is not as bad as Gore and you plan to vote for him, but how can anyone consider him the savior for America? All the conservatives who ridiculed Clinton for his lack of a military record are quiet about Bush serving in the National Guard during Vietnam...in Texas. Those who laughed at Clinton for saying that he tried pot, but didn't inhale are commending Bush for not speaking about his past drug usage (which everyone knows was pretty extensive). Here is a guy who was brought up with a silver spoon in his mouth, who can barely speak in complete sentences, who will fill the Supreme Court openings with right wing conservatives, and who selects his VP on the basis of maturity. If only Dubya was mature himself, then maybe he could have chosen someone with some vision. And, does anyone buy the Bush party line about the debates? If they would just admit that Bush feels a lot more comfortable in the more controlled environment of a tv show than a normal debate, than people would have more respect for him. I am disgusted every time I hear one of those yahoos say that Gore is going back on his word of anyplace, anytime. Don't get me wrong, I think Gore is a jackass, too, but as my dad says, I plan to base my vote on who is the evil of two lessers.
