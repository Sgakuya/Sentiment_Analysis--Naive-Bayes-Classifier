One of the best, and certainly the funniest, sports game of all time, NHL 2002 is the stuff video-game-legends are made of. The graphics are slick, even on low-end computers, but fly with great detail on high-end ones. The commentary is going to be immortal. Don Taylor and Jim Hughson provide the humor with the commentary, and we're talking stuff that rivals TV sitcoms in quality. Jokes, puns, crazy happenings, wordplay and more! The game also controls well and game modes are up there and it even supports internet play! The opening cutscene and menu music are mediocore, but you can import your own of both. So, buy this game and get your personal laugh track ready!
