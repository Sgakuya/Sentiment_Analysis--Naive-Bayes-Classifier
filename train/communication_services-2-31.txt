Unhappy. PCS gets dropped calls all the time. Runaround when phone broke. Pay 4 bucks a month for replacement plan AND hafta pay an additional $35 deductible. Carrier based in Manchester so every call from home to cell is lond distance. Every call from cell to cell on same plane deducts minutes off both. Must obtain super-secret customer retention number to get a decent package deal. Incentives for new customers...nothing for the poor slobs who've been customers for years. Long distance service overcharged. I've had enough. Going to Nextel where all incoming calls are free and no charge to phones on same plan. Plus walkie-talkie feature.
