iPods suck! Go for a Dell DJ! i had one and it dropped on the ground and the screen broke but it would still work then all of a sudden a couple of weeks later it stopped working all together so i go to ipod.com to get a number call it am put on hold so then after 15-20 mins of waiting to talk to someone i talk to them and tell them the code number on my ipod and then after about 10minutes of trouble the guy says do you have an hp ipod? well you have to call them... so i go throuhg the same process and they tell me that they cant be fixed so ur automatically out 300 bux and it scratches super easy and itunes takes forever to load ur music it sucks and its a rediculas price a dell dj is 2/3 the price of an ipod and thats a 100 bux... oh yea and also you have to use itunes to put music on it so if you downoad music form a company other then i tunes or have music saved to you computer on a different program you have to burn them then upload them in to itunes and uploading music in to itunes takes forever you also cant transfer music outa itunes unless you burn it then upload it inn another program and itunes is the only complany that does that they suck ! ipods suck!!!!!!!!
