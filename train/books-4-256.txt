This book is so sad. The author takes you into the world of depression. Through this book you really see that depression is a chemical imbalance that is uncontrollable. It is sad to hear the story of someone going through so much pain and there isn't anything that can help cure her. It is hard for the family too. The book was written right when Prozac was being tested and just coming out. It shows how Prozac and other drugs helped the author deal with her depression and live in this world without constantly comptemplating suicide. She could finally get out of bed, she finally stopped crying and she finally could live a normal life. It is a book that made me see that depression isn't just made up in someone's head but a serious medical condition. It is helped educate me on a subject I didn't know much about.
