I dont smoke anymore, I quit, but if I did, then ML would be my choice. I got married recently. My wife is a respiratory therapist. She would tell me horrific stories about her past and present patients. Almost all of her patients smoked or had smoked cigaretts. I wish the government would quit hiding the dangers of smoking from people and tell the truth about just how dangerous cigarettes are. Well, I wont get into that part of the discussion. I quit easily...well it was a hard thing to do really, but with my life at stake...I quit easily. Hope you understand that it was VERY hard going through withdrawal. It must be the most powerful drug in the world. Another thing, my neighbor told me a while back that his youngest son. I think he is around 14 was sent samples of cigarettes in the mail by a company in North Caroling. Not Phillip Morris, but the other one who makes Winstons. I forget their name. Dont tell me that cigarette companies dont target kids. They do!
