I guess this book has been out for a couple years, i just finished reading it. Augusten Burroughs tells of his unusual childhood he spent the first 12 years with his family His parents fought all of the time. Eventually the father left for good. His mother starts going to this psychiatrist called Dr. Finch. he looks just like Santa Claus.after about a years worth of meeting the mother sends Augusten to live with the Finch family.the family is unusual. many sisters still live there, Augusten is adoptedby Finch and lives there since 12.the oldest daughter still lives there at 28.He allows others to stay there as well. one being a 30 something man who takes an interest in Augusten.the Christmas tree stays up all year, valium is readily available.It is hard to believe that there is such a life, but Augusten Burroughs lived. it. pretty good reading but can be very disturbing.I guess it is going to be turned into a movie soon.
