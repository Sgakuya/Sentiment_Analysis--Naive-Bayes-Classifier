I felt really satisfied with my experience at Teachers College, where I got a graduate degree in education of the gifted. I found the coursework to be very challenging and stimulating, and almost every professor I had was excellent. The curriculum was carefully balanced with educational theory and practical applications. The program was very rigorous, though, and required a serious commitment and a great deal of hard work. Luckily, most of the classes I took were offered in the evening, so I was able to teach and go to school at the same time. The extra effort paid off because I was very well-prepared when I got my first job in the field.
