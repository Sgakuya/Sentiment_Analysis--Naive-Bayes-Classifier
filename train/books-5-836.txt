What a truly wonderful first novel. I had been hearing about Harry Potter all over the t.v. and was frankly getting a little tired of it. Kids were waiting in line for hours just to get copies of the new book, and I figured this was another goofy fad to get kids' money. Then, all the talk about Satanism started because he was going to wizard school. Well, that gets me when people start throwing that kind of talk around. Some people don't like his popularity, so let's throw some Satanism into it and see what happens. There were already three books out when I spoke with some friends who had small children, and they told me that they had read/screened all the books and felt that the Satanism was unfounded, and that they felt the books were not only entertaining reading, but also extremely well written. I decided to give Harry a chance and went and purchased the paperback of Sorcerer's Stone. I was not even finished with it when I went out and bought the next two. I agreed with my friends--this is not only an entertaining book, but also extremely well written. It doesn't talk down to kids, and that's very important to me. You get more creative and smart from reading material above your level, not from stuff below it. I couldn't wait to go from page to page finding out all about Harry and his friends as they explored Hogwarts, the wizarding school. Of course, there is good versus evil, but how many other stories are that way? The Wizard of Oz and Star Wars are both movies featuring good versus evil, but did anyone ever accuse these movies of trying to convert their children to Satanism? Not Hardly. I would not hesitate one second to let my kids read any of the Harry Potter series.
