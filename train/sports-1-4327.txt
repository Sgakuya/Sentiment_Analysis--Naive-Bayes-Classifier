Tubby Smith is one of the worst coaches in D-1 ball. Hell, look at this team and last years team. The entire team is very talented, exception on of 1 or 2 players, and could play for any of the top coaches in the nation. Such a deep bench, but does he use it, hell no! He doesn't know how to switch out when he should. He is up yelling and actually coaching when UK is winning and sits on his ass and gives the dumbest stare when UK is losing. He can't coach talent! Maybe one or two players on a team of scrubs, but not a team fuul of him. He never won a national title that title goes to Rick Pitino! Smith needs to quit now before he really gets embarassed!
