I think everybody over-rates NYC. If we look at it from a realistic point of view instead of the lillte fantasy world, a lot of people would realize that NYC is full of rude and snobby people. And people who think they are so much ebtter than others. Nobody is better than anyone, that is one lesson that needs to be taught in that big ego state. I have seen better sites than NYC. And I also have to say that John Rocker was right....New York is sooo stupid that they voted for Hilary Clinton. What is the country coming too? I think they also need to chill out with all their lillte porn shacks around there. If thats what they wanna represent, then so be iti...but it just shows what they are about.....NOTHING!!
