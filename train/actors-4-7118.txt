Bill Pullman will probably never win an Oscar, but he is a very talented actor whose style is unique. I thought he was phenominal in the thrillers The Guilty and Malice . The latter was probably my favorite of all his films. However, the roles that he played in his thrillers are quite different. In The Guilty , he plays a darker, more villianous role, and in Malice , he plays the clueless husband who finds his world turned upside down after he agrees to let his friend , Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) move into his house which he and his wife (Nicole Kidman) live in. He was pretty believable as the President of the United States in Independence Day , even to the point that when he went to South America to promote the film, some Latin Americans actually thought that he was the President. I thought that he was hilarious in Zero Effect . He showed his real comedic side there as the world's most private detective . In the final analysis, Bill Pullman is a good actor who is all too often underrated and deserves to be much higher up on this list.
