I'm not questioning Ashcroft's integrity because I don't know a whole lot about him. I imagine that he is no better or no worse than most politicians. I just don't understand how Bush can nominate a man with Ashcroft's ardent conservative views. Here is a guy who is charged with enforcing the laws of our country and he doesn't believe in many of them. Obviously, this is going to happen with anyone who is put in this position. However, it is incredible to me that Bush, who has staked his claim as a man who will work to bring both parties together, has chosen him. The rest of his key nominations are much more moderate and Bush would have been a lot wiser to have done the same with Attorney General.
