Shame to those have no idea about what they are talking about. I am South African. I know where my country comes from and where it is today. Our great grandparents and us have endured opression for many years, a lot of young people were tortured, persecuted and brutally killed in the days of apartheid. I am not asking to feel sorry what has happened to South Africa in the past but you have no idea what our country has been through. Let me tell you that South Africa is free and democratic today because of the people like Nelson Mandela and other who devoted their lives to the liberation struggle of our people. If whatever he is doing was for selfish reasons he could have taken the offer that the apartheid government gave him. A luxurious home, a car, money, holidays etc. But because he believe in the freedom of his people he laid his life. For 27 years he stayed in jail he and other great men nearly faced death sentence for fighting for what is right. Freedom of the people. I know that some Americans are upset about Mr. Mandela's take against Mr. Bush. It has nothing to do about being ungrateful but about what is right. What he has always fought for. The Iraqis should not be deprived their rights. Mr. Bush was infringing Iraqis rights by invading their country even after the UN showed disgreement to his plans but no he insisted. America is one of the strongest countries in the world, we respect that. But it should also respect other countries and territories to maintain its respect and reputation. I am not anti-America but I am anti-terrorist.
