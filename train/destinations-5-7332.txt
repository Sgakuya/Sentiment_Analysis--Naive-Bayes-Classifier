Just got back from a Med Cruise and a visit to Madrid and Toledo. If you are going to Spain, don't miss the opportunity of going to this great historical town. The cathedral is beautiful (there was an exhibit of Queen Isabel's treasures) and is full of so much history. The quaint cobblestone streets are lined with shops and cafes. Swords and pottery are the specialties, especially the masquinado, black with gold leaf pounded in. The machine made is much cheaper than the hand made, but you'll see the difference. Go to the Parador at the top of the hill on the way to Argas to get the best photo opportunity. Have a limon while you're there to cool off. Or a glass of sangria. The Hostal Del Cardenal is a great place to stay. Very quiet and surrounded by flowers and patios. It's close to everything, near the escalator to the old city. You won't be disappointed!!!!!
