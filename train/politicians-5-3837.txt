I live in Texas and have seen the things Governor Bush has done. He has enabled my daughter to attend a public Charter school that is providing a private school education. My Daughter is in the 7th grade doing 8th to 9th grade work. The wonderful thing about this is, she is a special education student with a reading disability. She is making a's and b's. He has come in and made our state's school administrators responsible for providing an appropriate education by having standardized test from 3rd grade up. The schools are classified and therefore the teachers and curriculum are exposed. This is a wonderful thing. ALso the man has integrity. You will never here him declare things that are blantanly untrue. He is human and has made mistakes. He also admits to these mistakes and doesn't hide from them. He is someone that will not accept illegal campaign finances or support someone who desecrates the Oval Office. HE willnot say what you want to here for votes. He has been consistent with his message with no variation. He is what we need for at least the next 4 years.
