I would have to say that St. Louis is a city with a lot of potential that most cities dream of having. Its true that the city has lost most of its middle class residence to the suburbs and that has left the inner city empty appearing to the outsider not having much to offer. However on the flip side, St. Louis is a very cosmopolitain city with a lot of cultural advantages that you can not find in other cities in the Midwest and southeast with the exception of Chicago. Such cultural institutions include forest park with several museums and lakes. Some of the popular neighborhoods include Central West End, Soulard, South Grand, University City, Clayton and Lafayette Park. Each individual neighborhood has its own distinct flavor. This adds to the other advantages living in St. Louis has such as good employment opportunity and a good air port and a new pro business attitude. Driving through St. Louis one would not be able to see what the city offers. One would have to visit or live in the area to appreciate the culture and sophistication of the city.
