Montgomery Clift also turned down Sunset Boulevard. When it came time to film the end of A Place in the Sun, director, George Stevens wanted him to play it as a man going to pieces, but Clift did it his way. He and Burt Lancaster cancelled each other out for the Oscar, for From Here to Eternity. And Frank Sinatra was always the first to give Clift the credit for his acting in that oscar-winning movie. Here's irony for you: Clift was the first choice of director, Billy Wilder, for Sunset Boulevard. He turned it down, and in stepped Bill Holden, who revived his career, and was now taken seriously as an actor. Then in 1953, Holden defeated Clift for the oscar, in another movie directed by Billy Wilder. Whether Clift was Wilder's first choice for Stalag 17, as I've read, is hard to imagine!
