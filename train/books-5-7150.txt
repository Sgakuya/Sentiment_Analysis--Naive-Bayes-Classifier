Zelazney says on the cover of a recent release of this book that it's considered by many to be the single greatest science fiction novel of all time. It's up there. Before I describe it in my own words, let me say that the protagonist, Gulliver Foyle, is a great deal like Batman from Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns : physically a wall with eyes, utterly sociopathic, demonically driven, almost invincible. This book is based on Dumas's Count of Monte Cristo ; it is a quest for revenge in the 23rd century, in which the fate of our solar system is inadvertently made the prize. If you read a review of it on Amazon, or elsewhere, you might be swarmed with complaints that the hero is a monster: a rapist, a murderer, a treasonous, genocidal maniac. He is. I personally rate a lot of things according to how well the feelings they convey are expressed, and not according to the moral value I place on them, or fail to find in them, and I'd urge everyone to do the same. Bester is a great writer: I've read a good many of his short stories, and a few of his novels, and this is his masterpiece. He drifts in and out of dialects, has an ear for action, for romance; wrote comics, radio; a lot. As Neil Gaiman says in intro to the recent edition, though the future tends to date easily, this book's conception of the future, though it was made in 1956, is as timeless as its hero's hatred, and rage at having been betrayed in the novel's opening pages. Though Gully Foyle is a monster, he ultimately becomes a god, and watching him swat the characters in his world around like flies is nothing short of awe-inspiring. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough; most everyone who's read it will know exactly what I mean.
