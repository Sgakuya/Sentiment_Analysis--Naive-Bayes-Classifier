My all-time favorite city. Grew up 50 miles away, and have visited many, many times. What's not to love? It has a nice climate, is close to wonderful beaches such as Santa Cruz Beach (and the incredibly beautiful Muir Woods redwood forest), and natural beauty such as Balboa Park. It's also got lovely architecture (don't miss North Beach), nightlife (so many clubs, bars, concert halls I can't enumerate). I still like taking a cable car up Powell St., getting a shrimp cocktail at Fisherman's Wharf, going to Ghiradelli Square, or going to Camera Obscura. There's also a lovely tolerance of odd people: not only LGBT but also just the eccentric or freaky--like R. Crumb. SF is high in political awareness and activism and education (evidenced by City Lights, wonderful bookstore). The only flaw in this paradise is of course the unbelievably high cost of housing, which is enough to discourage all but the fabulously wealthy from living there.
