I bought the soundtrack this weekend- I've always really liked the Faith Hill song There You'll Be, and enjoyed Hans Zimmer's musical scores from previous films like The Lion King and Backdraft. His scores are very emotional and heartfelt, and put you right there in the film even if you aren't watching it. The main thing that disappoints me about the album is the lack of music overall! There are only six tracks total and it only totals 42 minutes- I know for a fact there was a LOT more music in a 3-hour plus movie. I would've liked it if they'd had some of the big band 1940s swing music from the dance scene in the movie plus some of the other music that for whatever reason, was left off the CD. The album should have had at least 20 additional minutes of music to really give the album a full, satisfying listen.
