These things are phenomonal. Of course it is an acquired taste. And most people will say this is terrible just because they dont like coconut or are allergic to it. The Zagnut comes in a retro looking red package with neon-looking writing. The bar itself is like a crisp peanut butter (or Butterfinger peanut butter) covered with toasted coconut. So it is like a Butterfinger with coconut instead of chocolate. The result is a unique and fresh fusion of coconut and peanut butter. These things are uncommon. They occasionally pop in and out of sight and I urge you if you like the above to grab a few of these gems.
