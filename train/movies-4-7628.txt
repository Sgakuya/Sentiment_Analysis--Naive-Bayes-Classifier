This was an enjoyable, unpredictable, completely silly, and somewhat vague parody of Homer's Odyssey. While the film did not feature back-to-back laughs, it still had a few stellar moments of oddball way-out-there humor. With few exceptions, George Clooney, who proves he is really adept at playing this eccentrically intelligent but goofy escaped convict/adventurer, provides most of the real laughs for me. Another surprise was when I found myself really enjoying music of a type I would normally not have expected to like. I went into this one without any forewarning but, once I started to catch the literary allusions scattered throughout, the movie became enjoyable on a kind of seek and find level as well. This added depth would probably make it worth catching again sometime for that reason alone.
