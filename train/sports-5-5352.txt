Kirk is the best! And he is by far my favorite basketball player. I also know he will do great in the NBA and I am looking forward to see all that he accomplishes and cheer him on. He is such a great player . He definitely shows all the talent and devotion he puts into the sport when he is on the floor.He has wonderful technique and advances the ball down the court. He also shows that he is the best because he is able to shoot from anywhere on the floor. I go to the same high school as he did!Go West!and he influences everyone there. I've watched him play b-ball for quite a while now. I see him alot during the summer. He is such a hottie! I love Mr. Basketball! p.s. next time I see him shootin hoops there I will try and mention something about this board.
