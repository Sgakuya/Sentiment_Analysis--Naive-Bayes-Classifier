At a first glance SOAD appear to be another of the diabolical nu-metal dicks out there, on closer inspection it transpires; they are not. They have the same tona qualities of a band like, say KoRn or papa roach except its quality. the riffs ar of an arabian metal type- something quite bizzare, phenonminal drumming with pricison and creativity and the vocals are full of innovation and originality ranging from elegent flowing beauty, to stomping raging shouts- and nobody shouts like system: an angry political shout. oh yeah and the bass is cool. this is a stunning album, songs like chop suey! and toxicity hint at just how great this band are, whilst deer dance and science prove thier politics still in tact and as powerful as ever. system are a great thing, lets hope they keep making music as fresh and wonderful as this.
