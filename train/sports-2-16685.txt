The reason why Tommy Maddox is one of the lowest-paid quarterbacks in the league is pretty obvious now. Surly Bill Cowher paid a bunch of these guys, mainly on defense, wayyyyy to much money and you can tell by their defensive stats. Plaxico Burress and Hines Ward are good receivers, but Maddox is getting killed, and lacks the legs to get out of the pocket and make plays to these guys. The Bus should have been cut in the off-season, but Amos Zeroue (if I spelled it wrong, sorry) is not durable enough to be an every-down back. I also hear that this team will be in salary cap trouble next year. Not good. But we Cowboy fans will be laughing as we make the playoffs and the sorry Steelers play golf and are even worse next season.
