This guy should stow it already because he's causing more than significant damage to the Democratic Party and the last vestiges of liberalism than anyone on the GOP/rightwing side of the political fence, more than any talkinghead ideologue on cable TV or AM radio. Jackson is just another civil rights dinosaur of the 1960s who's desperately trying to remain relevant in a world that's passing him by. I have a difficult time according credibility to someone who presents himself as a Man of God, but fathers children our of wedlock. I have a difficult time taking seriously a guy who defends shady nightclub-owning businessmen who are buddies of his when dozens of people are trampled during a fire in said buddy's nightspot. The sad thing is that the Democratic Party, liberal element and African-American community really hasn't come up with someone to replace him, which tells you a great deal about the talent pool available to those three entities.
