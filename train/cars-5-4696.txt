The best small truck money can buy. I owned a '91 Toyota pickup, 3.0 V-6 auto, Xtra cab, 4 x 2, bought used in '95, at the time it had 118,000 miles on it. In Dec of last year when that stupid b**ch from Tennesee hit me, with her peice of chit Chevy, it had 271,000 miles on it. Other than the usual oil changes, brake and tire changes, I had to do nothing else to it. Meanwhile most of my freinds who own Ford's or Dodge's or Chevy's, have had to replace tranny's, and other major parts. So here I am with $6500 in my poctet, and what do I do... I go and buy a '98 Dodge Dakota, as of May it only had 76,000 miles but has needed the following work done to it repair tranny, replace tranny, replace AC unit, replace rear rotors, replace front rotors and replace starter. Thank god most of this happened under warranty. After the tranny went for the third (wonder how many times befor I owned it???) time, I gave up, so I traded it in on a '95 Toyota 4 x 4, 4 cyl, manual, 174,000 miles and I've not had one problem. As soon as Toyota adds the four door feature to the Tacoma, I'll be purchaseing a new one, but in the meantime, I know I'll have a truck that'll last another 5 years. Domestic bedamned, never again!!! Cozy Ones
