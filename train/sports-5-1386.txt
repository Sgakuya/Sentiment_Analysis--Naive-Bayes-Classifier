As a Yankee fan, I am saddened to see Tino Martinez go, but overjoyed to know that the Yankees will pick up one of the best players in the league in Jason Giambi. When Giambi comes up, he is feared by every pitcher. He is a left-handed hitter with astounding power and will flourish with the 314-foot fence in Yankee Stadium's right field. He doesn't only have power, he hits for average at an alarming rate and walks at a league-leading rate as well. His on-base percentage is one of the best in the AL. Overall, a top-notch player that any team would want. My only problem is that when the Yankees met Oakland in the playoffs, he seemed to not be the greatest fielder in the world, definitely not as good as Tino. I hope that will not be a negative factor in his game.
