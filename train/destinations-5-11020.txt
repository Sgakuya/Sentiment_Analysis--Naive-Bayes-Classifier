Great America is your stereotypical theme park. It is straight from the early eighties, so cheesy. I went there when the Edge frist came out with my dad and sister. We got to cut in the line for the Edge because the guy running it thought my sister was cute. That ride was unbelievable. Well, it is not there anymore since someone died. I recently went back to Great America this past Sept. and it was so fun. It feels like a time warp when you go there because the atomosphere, the shows, the people all are from another place, just so out of date. Not like I'm cool and hip but these people were out of 1983. It was so hilarious and just added to the scene. We were lucky enough to go on a day when it was a perfect 80degrees, and no lines. There are some really good new rides that good like Top Gun, The Demon, and The Log Ride. I have to tell you about the best part of Great America. It is called The Stelth! It is so fun. They strap you in, you are lying on your back facing the sky until that whip it around and you are riding this ride up, down, around loops, on your belly. At one point my boyfriend screamed, I'm flying.... I was laughing to hard to say anything but it really does feel like you are flying. Then as we came to a stop, we looked at each other and we both had drool. We were laughing so hard and you can't move your arms to wipe it off. I really almost peed in my pants it was so fun. I would go back just for that ride.
