Should he be in the Hall Of Fame? Of course he should. His achievements far outweigh the questionable judgment he showed when gambling on the games. When you think of other sports, and who is in those Halls of Fame, gambling doesn't seem so bad. O.J. Simpson (need I say more?), in tennis you have several gay people, etc. Who cares if he gambled? That's not nearly as offensive to me as the other stuff I just named. The point is, what they do off the field is completely different than what they do on it. Now, I have never been a big fan of Pete Rose. But give him what he deserves and put him in the Hall of Fame.
