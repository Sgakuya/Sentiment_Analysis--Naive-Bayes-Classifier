I'm not a natural shop-aholic. In fact the few times I even put my foot in a clothing store is when I'm physically forced to do so. But if I do have to by clothes H M are #1 on my list. They never go directly out there and scream 'We're the best, shop here' but approach the customer gently. You don't have to be fashionable to wear their clothes, but you don't have to be a 'slacker' either. Their designs are predicated on the notion that fashion is fleeding. That clothes go out of style fast, so why not make it acceptable and affordable for the public? They have 730 stores in 14 countries and sell approximently 400 million items a year. They jump on the trend wagon but still have clothes for the people who don't want to look like walking mannequins. They offer cheap, nice clothes with remarkable quality. And that's pretty much all I'm asking for.
