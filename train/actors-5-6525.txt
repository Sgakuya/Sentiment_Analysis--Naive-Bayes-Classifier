Jackie Chan is an outstanding actor! He is 1 of mi favorite actors...I would think it would be a lil hard 4 him to act because he is from a different country and he has another language, but it doesnt seem like it for him. He speaks English very well.... He is one of the best fighters in televiosion..I think it is awesome to c this man fight. He really can kick @$$..hehe...He was soo hilarious is Rush Hour and I cant wait 4 the next 1 to come out!! ;) and well...I own Shanghai Noon and I watch that at least once a week when I find time....He and Owen Wilson are great 2getha...Jackie was histerical in Shanghai Noon...as being well the Shanghai Kid ..! After the movie they show the bloopers and I noticed that he seems like a really sweet person...He is so cute wen he smiles....He looks so young n..awwww..hehe! I luved it wen he n Owen were in the bathtub and they were playing the drinking game awww did yall c him and Owen...they were so precious...Especially wen they got into the same tub and had all the foam over their faces..haha...and wen Jackie goes Uno Mas blowin the bubble!!! haha that was great! Neway..all I can say is that he really is one of the best actors around and i will alwayz be a fan of his! : o )
