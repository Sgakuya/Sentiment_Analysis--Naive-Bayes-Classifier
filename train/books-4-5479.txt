I have read all 4 of Dan Brown's books. All are exceptional and I recommend any and all. DF is a pretty good yarn. But I got to rank it below the far superior DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons, though a tad better than Deception Point which was just too predictable. Digital Fortress is pretty predictible too. Dan Brown is the KING of Hacting where the protagonist can deduce a password (given 69 Trillion combinations) in 1 or 2 shots. Once again, I figured out the ending with 50 pages to go and was skimming through the ending. I was a bit perplexed about the number sequence at the end of the book (e-mail me if you know).
