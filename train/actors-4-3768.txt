While I certainly would not consider Bruce Willis a top notch actor, one cannot deny that he has enormous loads of talent. Aside from being incredibly versatile, he has amazing amounts of charisma and charm that he carries with him on screen. His resume is quite impressive, consisting of action, thriller and comedy films. Die Hard is probably one of the classic shoot em' up movies of the last 20 years. Willis has played the hero in quite a few films (Armageddon and the Die Hard sequels). The end of Armageddon was very moving, thanks in no small part to Willis' depth as an actor. Willis has proven, however, that he can play unheroic roles as well (the ruthless assassin in The Jackal and the corrup General in the Siege). Willis has also successfully tried his hand at comedy, twice doing the voice for the young toddler Mikey in Look Who's Talking and it's sequel. He was also surprisingly amusing in Death Becomes Her, The Whole Nine Yards, along with a moving performance in The Kid. Willis turned in a surprisingly exemplary performance with The Sixth Sense as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a troubled man who attempts to reach a young boy who is haunted by supernatural beings. In the final analysis, although Bruce Willis' forte is definitely action roles, he has proven that he can hold his own in comedy and drama as well. He certainly is not one of the greatest actors of our time, but he is definitely an above average actor with loads of charisma and charm.
