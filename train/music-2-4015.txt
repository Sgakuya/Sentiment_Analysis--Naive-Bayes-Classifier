Fleetwood Mac is one of my favorite bands, but this album is outright boring. The titular opener is indicative of the rest of the album. The best song is the rock-ish Edge of Seventeen (which is annoying until you get used to it, and rather repetitive). There are two duets (Leather and Lace with Eagles' Don Henley and the overplayed Stop Draggin' My Heart Around with The Heartbreakers' Tom Petty), but the chemistry between the two vocalists in both songs is zero. Mostly a collection of Fleetwood Mac- and Rumours-era rejects and soft-rock ballads. The only thing Stevie Nicks proved with this album is that she can sell an album entirely off of her popularity and not the album's merits, and that she needs Fleetwood Mac to sound good.
