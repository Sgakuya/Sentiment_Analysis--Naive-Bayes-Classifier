THIS BOY STRIKES CORDS IN PEOPLES HEARTS WITH THIS SONG. I THINK IF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THIS OPINION ABOUT LIFE EVERY DAY THEN EVERYONE WOULD SEE WE COULD GET ALONG AND HELP EACH OTHER EASILY AND WITHOUT SELFISHNESS.BILLY DON'T STOP BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED THE INSPIRATION AND INCENTIVE EVEN IF IT ONLY TOUCHES ONE PERSON THEN ONE VOICE WAS HEARD . THATS ALL WE CAN HOPE FOR. I THINK THE ENTIRE ALBUM CAN BE LOOKED AT FROM A CHILDS VIEW AS WELL AS AN ADULTS VIEW. THE SONGS INVOLVED ARE SO CENTERED AROUND LIFE AS COUNTRY MUSIC ALWAYS IS THAT PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO THE ENTIRE ALBUM. BOTH YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE. THANK YOU BILLY FROM I HOPE THE BIGGEST FAN.
