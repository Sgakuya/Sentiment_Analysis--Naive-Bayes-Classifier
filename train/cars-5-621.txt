I have been riding for over thirty years, mostly Harley Davidson, but in that time have owned a Norton, BSA, Triumph, and some assorted Japanese bikes. I realized early that motorcycling was at least two different worlds. It was never more evident when I took my H2 750 Kawasaki on a Harley run in the seventies. It was a lot faster and handled better than my old Sportster, however I still found that around the watering hole I was still in last place. I see a lot of Harley look-a-likes on the road now. Complete with look-alike bikers. I think most of them understand it is not the same; it's the ones that don't who give me a chuckle. Someone and I don't know who, said it best about Harley-Davidson, If I had to explain it, you wouldn't understand. And you can malign the motorcycle and the lifestyle if you want, we don't really care, for we have never really promoted it anyway, just lived it, and loved it. And just remember, If I had to explain it, you wouldn't understand. Because without being trite, I am sure this is as close as anyone who doesn t understand, will come to understand. I now have over eighty thousand miles on my current Electra Glide, and my brother has over a hundred and thirty five thousand, and between us we probably have a million miles combined. And at least as many fond memories.
