I recently tried the Swanson's Hungryman Chicken Pot Pie. I am disabled and need somethig that is nutritious and easy to prepare. I was very disappointed in this product. It is advertised as being one pound, one ounce. That may be right, but it is one pound of crust and gravy with just a few pieces of meat and vegetables added.( that must be the extra one ounce). It bears no resemblance to the picture on the box which shows meat and vegetables overflowing with a golden brownish gravy. The gravy I encountered was yellow and very salty. In fact, it has a whopping 37% sodium. 37 percent!!! The crust was heavy and soddened on the bottom. I had no problems getting it cooked however, I set my microwave on 5 minutes at med high heat, turned the meal, and cooked for another 5 minutes at med. high heat. The picture on the box shows celery is encluded. I found no celery at all. If I had taken out all of the solid parts I doubt that it would have made one half cup. This is for a one pound one ounce potpie. It also shows potatoes. I found none. I counted five carrot pieces,tiny cubed pieces, approximately ten peas, four pieces of chicken chunks, which were small, and the rest was something that passed as gravy. I am not a picky eater. But, after paying almost $2.50 for one potpie, I will be picky from now on. If I am going to pay that much for one meal I will choose something I KNOW to be a good buy and tastes good. Swansons is made by Tyson, the chicken people. They certainly are not putting much chicken in this product. Salt is listed 4 times on the list of ingredients. If you are on a salt restricted diet you will be well advised to avoid this at all cost. I cannot recommend this product to anyone. Check out Marie Callender. Much better for about the same price.
