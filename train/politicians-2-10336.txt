OK, I have alot of respect for George W Bush, ONLY because he is the president and leader of the country in which I live. This does not mean I believe in his mission of war, or his mission of death. But I will always have respect in general. I would like to know where all the George W Bush supporters were when every tom, dick and harry was badmouthing Bill Clinton in the streets of our country? I have read review after review of anger from these people whining about the Dixie Chicks badmouthing the PRESIDENT of our country. Like how dare they? Why isn't this ok? But had the Dixie Chicks said something negative about President Clinton, I will bet any amount of money nothing would be said. In fact, they would probably be called PRETTY and SMART, instead of STUPID and FAT....you can bet your bottom dollar on that one. I believe maybe some of you are as really patriotic as you say, but on the other hand, the majority of you are just trouble makers trying start problems for other people cause you have nothing else better to do. But this is not uncommon.....very typical actually.
