Don Q is by far a jewel, no wonder it bares the name of the great novel by Cervantes. If you are from Puerto Rico like myself, you will know there's no other rum in the world that stands a chance. And it is true that if you go to Puerto Rico, everybody will tell you that Don Q is our rum of choice. Actually Bacardi is not originally from PR, it is cuban, but they moved their production to PR. Don Q is the real native rum, what a rum should really taste, and Serrales has been producing it since 1861 without changing anything. So if you haven't tried it yet do so, because for me it's like the 8th wonder of the world. Suggestion: When visiting Puerto Rico buy DonQ on the airport on your way out, hey!!! this way you wouldn't have drank it before arriving to your homes. (this is what I do everytime I leave the island) So SALUD, and Enjoy!!!!!
