A great coach who 1) has consistently graduated most of his players for over two decades, and 2) fielded winning teams that invariably have lesser talent than the opponents in Air Force's conference. And now, the PC Police (i.e. raging liberal Nazis) want to string this man up for daring to say something that everyone (blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, poor, old, wealthy, young, Republicans, Libertarians, Democrats, Jews, Muslims, Seventh Day Adventists, etc.) knows is true. And anyone who says he is either wrong or a racist is simply dealing in fiction. It is a reality that African-American football players are, on the average, fleeter of foot than football players of other racial backgrounds. Period. Black athletes generally run faster than other athletes. You know it's true and so does any other normal person possessed of basic powers of observation. And there is nothing "racist" or "insensitive" about speaking a non-derogatory truth. USNA71, you truly need to reevaluate your sense of values. Since when are honesty and candor infractions for which a person should "step down"?
