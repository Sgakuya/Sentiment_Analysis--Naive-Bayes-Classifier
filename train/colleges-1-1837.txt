To begin with, it's located in that crappy third world country that calls itself Texas. Secondly, Aggies are weak-minded, brainwashed dupes whose worldview is posited back in 1953. Thirdly, this diploma mill only has a few decent academic departments. Finally, any school where students are killed for the sake of something so trivial and retarded as a football bonfire, and student and alumni sentiment runs counter to discontinuing this practice in the name of public safety, has to be the biggest jackass institution imaginable. Rah rah programmed zombies wanting to maintain their proud tradition of mutant jock worship as their dead, and apparently expendable former collegues are taking dirt naps as a result of an unsafe, ecologically irresponsible and totally unnecessary public spectacle that is extremely suggestive of Klu Klux Klan cross burnings. What a sick joke. The university, its students, staff and alumni ought to be deathly ashamed of themselves. But they're not, which speaks volumes about what douchewads they are down in the Lone Star State.
