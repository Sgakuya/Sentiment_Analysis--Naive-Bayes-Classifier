Although I graduated from college in Oregon, I have a special place in my heart for Oklahoma State. I've visited football basketball games there, and sometimes have just visited the campus. It's no wonder this is the largest-attended university in the state. There's a special feeling at OSU. I enjoy knowing the people I've met who went there. The school doesn't always have good years in sports, and the Press obviously favors OU instead. But I've gone to ball games at a number of other colleges both in and out of the state. There's no other place I enjoy as much as Oklahoma State. I haven't lived in Oklahoma for several years, which is fine with me, for the most part. But I still miss OSU.
