I have been with AT T for 2 years and I have been horribly dissatisfied! They have ZERO coverage and when I do get a signal the calls are dropped before I can even say hello. As a college student travelling back and forth between New York and San Francisco, I expected more reception, especially in an urban environment but no, I almost never get a signal and it never stays constant when I do get one. I have walked all over San Francisco trying to get a signal and the only place I could get one was the very top floor of a tall building. There have been countless times when I really needed to make a call and have been sorely dissopointed with AT T's service. Suffice it to say I'm not going back when it comes time to sign a new contract.
