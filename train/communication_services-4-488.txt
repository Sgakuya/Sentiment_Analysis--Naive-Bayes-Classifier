I have had Alltel for a year now, and recently signed a new two-year agreement when I bought the new Kyocera Slider. They do have some customer service problems, however, I've found that if you keep your cool, and don't get angry (or show that you are) you'll get very good customer service. It's a case of treat the customer service reps as you'd like to be treated. Their coverage is unmatched, however you DO need to make sure you buy a phone that will have decent reception. Alltel does not have a large phone selection, and some are pricey, but they're worth it. I've heard several people complain about their plans ($$ - minutes) but, if you consider the coverage you're getting it's a good trade-off. Especially if you want something reliable. In short, if you're the type of person to fly off the handle over the inevitable problems that you'll have with -any- wireless service, you'll certainly have problems with Alltel. But if you'll use your head, you'll have the best experience ever.
