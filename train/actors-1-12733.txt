A limited performer, rapidly becoming a stereotype of herself. While I quite enjoyed her in 'Emma', I have not been impressed by any of her other roles. Her English accent is, frankly, not at all authentic-sounding in Sliding Doors and Possession. On the contrary, it sounds very stilted. She is too liable to use a physical tick as a substitute for an emotion [eg the furrowed brow / the pout / the swaying of the neck, in order to convey puzzlement / disappointment / annoyance etc]. She lacks substance. She calls herself an actor but I see very little evidence of significant acting skills in her work, much less any real talent. [Is she the product of an acting school, or is she 'natural', 'insticntive'?] I do believe her connections have given her the opportunities she has had in the profession and, not to put too fine a point on it, I am exasperated that she is seen as somebody who can carry a big film / a subtle plot / a film that needs breadth and depth from its cast. IMO, these do not spell Gwyneth. I read yesterday that she has been named to play the lead in the film-of-the-play, 'Proof'. I've seen the play. The lead needs somebody of far more acting skill, range, subtlty and intelligence that this woman has ever shown, to me at least. I have at times read comments from her directors and co stars, several of whom have asserted that she has both technical skill and intelligence. All I can say is that it is a pity that so little evidence of either turn up in the finished product. As for that Oscar - what a trevesty of justice and fair play. But then, apart from the hype, the Oscars imo have scant regard for rewarding the real 'Best', in probably all categories. and to do her some justice, perhaps, it has sometimes seemed to me that she may be a little embarrassed by the award.
