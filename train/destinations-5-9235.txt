I think the falls are a must see, truly incredible sight and I would certainl recommend going if you have the chance. Although I don't think I would suggest that anyone go JUST to see the falls. I mean they're great and all but they aren't so much of a destination trip, there really isn't a whole lot else to do and see. If you are willing to drive there are plenty of places to go withine Canada and Western New York but in Niagara Falls itself there isn't a ton. The Canadian side certainly offers the best views and is much cleaner and well kept than the American side (and probably safer as well) but it's still just too touristy for my tastes.
