Heeeey, remember when No Doubt was a band? One that came up with catchy, but not irritating songs, ones that would withstand time to still sound great today? A time before everyone and everything was bananas. B-a-n-a-n-a-s? Tragic Kingdom was a great album, the perfect pop-punk-ska-whateveryouwannacallit sound that swept the nation. Gwen told us about her thoughts and feelings in plain English without leaving millions of kids to call their cooler friends to find out exactly what a Hollaback Girl is. You know, I really do miss the 90's. Oh, and if you wanna know what No Doubt was before she was a rich girl, nanananananananana...check this album out. It'll be good for you.
