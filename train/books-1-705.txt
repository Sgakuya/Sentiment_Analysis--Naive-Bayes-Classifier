I really think that the Harry Potter books are terrible. The function of a children's book is to give a good influence to kids. To build a child's imagination and still keep it pure. Harry Potter books are giving children an implicit influence, because its story about magic and the devil, are lying to kids. It draws them away from God to believe in the devil, as in the survey. Children should be built on a prefoundation and if you put an influence on them that will make them believe in magic and the devil, maybe they will grow up to be still under that influence. We have to remember that children are very easily influenced.
