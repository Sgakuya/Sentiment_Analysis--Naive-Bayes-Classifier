I've had my 83 FXR over 11 years now. I love it. Changed over to a wide front end w/a big honking front tire, ape hangers, S S carb, cam, forward controls, chrome to the max and a pearl blue flamed paint job complete w/semi-hidden skulls (must be in right light to see skulls and colors change on flames depending on light as well). I know I have logged over 50,000 miles on it, w/longest ride from New England to Cleveland, OH. In 2002 I checked out 2003 Road King, Fatboy and a Deuce and while each of them were great, none of them were good enough to warrant getting rid of my 83 FXR, a bike that is paid for and looks as good, if not better than any of the newer models. I would like to be able to say that my ride has never left me stranded, but..... :-) Still would never switch! My .02
