one of the better teenage movies. usually I avoid teen type movies since they are aimed at teens on down only.this one is nice for adults to watch too. Lindsay Lohan did a nice job as the 16 year old girl who had been home schooled in Africa and was enduring her first year in a high school. She quickly learns of all the cliques there are amongst the girls.She experiences how mean girls can be to each other with all the gossip, excluding others and how they can manipulate each other. she goes from nice girl to temporary not so nice girl, learns a few lessons and goes back to nice girl. my teenage daughter and i saw this and liked it. Brings back memories of high school and really school is not so different now then when it was 25 plus years ago.
