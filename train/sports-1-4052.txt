He looks to me like he would be a pervert,and I dont say that because I hate Dook. He really does give off that vibe to me......like he would have a peephole from his office to the showers or something.I bet you anything he has gone down on Wojo before....or, at least on Laetner. He's got that pool party at my house! vibe.))))))))))))))) )))))))))UPDATE. Carolina-5, Dook-3 (with tighter boy anus). BTW, you're right, we do get the best TALENT! I wonder why! HA HA, somebody just tried to burn me by saying Carolina gets all the TALENT! HA HA, NO SH&T, SHERLOCK!))) )))))))))))UPDATE. I read that American Express may be trying to get out of their contract with him, because so many people are cancelling their cards due to the affiliation with him. And for those that would like him as a mentor for their kids, I suggest you stop being so naive and easily influenced by the media. He is no choir boy. There have been several instances of less than honorable behavior. I want go into them, but if you want to know some of them, check out truthaboutduke.com, or message me. He is a good coach, but his public image is misleading. As it might be for many other coaches. I'm not disputing that. But Coach K is far from what the media would have you believe. Curious? Then check it out or message me.
