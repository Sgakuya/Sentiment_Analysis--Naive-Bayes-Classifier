2003 Honda Rancher 4x4 350cc purchased new in 2002. I find this vehicle inferior our my old Suzuki 230. The older Suzuki did not need parts until 5 -6 years, just pm maintenance. So far on the Rancher I have replaced a starter and muffler at almost 3 years old. Squeeks occur in body movement which requires constant lubracation. The rancher is kept inside and driven daily along with my other machine. I was suprised to see at almost three years old that the Honda Rancher needed so much up keep. I currently have owned three machines in the last 14 years due to my rural location. I would NOT recommend a Honda ATV for my next purchase. Hope this helps.
