Does anyone out there remember 1980, with it's double digit unemployment and inflation, 20% interest rates, hostages, gas lines, misery indexes, a military in disarray, and a president who said the job was too big for him? Here are a few brief facts, folks: 1. DEFICITS. To end the cold war with its possibility of nuclear catastrophe - we needed to negotiate with the Russians from a position of strength. That meant to increase defense spending. The Democrat-controlled Congress agreed and appropriated the money to do so. But in return, they reniged on their promise to freeze or at least slow the growth of domestic spending. Hence the deficits. (But you'll notice that when a fiscally responsible REPUBLICAN Congress took over in '94, the deficits disappeared. Of course, Clinton took credit for it.) 2. AIDS - During the Reagan years, more money was spent on AIDS than any other disease except Cancer. And since Cancer has far more victims, it deserved top priority. 3. HOMELESSNESS. Your liberal friends at the ACLU were responsible for the wave of homelessness in the 80's. It was against their civil rights to be detained in an institution - even though most had mental problems and substance abuse issues and needed the security of an institution. So don't blame it on Reagan. Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. In other words, shut up, quit complaining, and get a job.
