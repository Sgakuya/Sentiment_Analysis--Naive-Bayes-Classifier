All the power to this lady! Everyone seems to be dissing her about her sexuality but if she can admit to it and still be happy and people still be happy with her (at least most of you) than you go girl! Her acting skills are another story. Ellen was an alright show although the episode when she came out of the closet was hilarious. EDtv was an alright movie and she didn't have that big of a role in it. She did perform well with Sharon Stone in If These Walls Could Talk 2. She's a great stand-up comedian and only gets points off for her one mistake. Three words. The Love Letter. Absolutely one of the WORST movies of the year but other than that, keep it up Ellen.
