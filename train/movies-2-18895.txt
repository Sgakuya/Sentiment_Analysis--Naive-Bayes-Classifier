Who made this movie? This is like something I would have made in middle school. Despite the honest and rather good performances from James Brolin and Margot Kidder, this film just doesn't hold up. The scares are very mellow and it lacks a genuine feel. I feel no dread, no fright, no entertainment. Unless you count laughing at really bad effects. (Ex. Thost two Christmas lights outside the window that are supposed to be eyes? Give me a break.) The film itself is cheap looking. Like they had a budget but spent it on the caterer. As I write this I am racking my brain for a scary moment. A truely chilling part. There is none! This movie lacks something as far as a horror movie. THE HORROR! Where did it go? Ghost Busters had scarier moments than this. Over all this is not a scary movie, but a laughable attempt to score some quick cash on what was a very popular story at the time. Fun to laugh at though...
