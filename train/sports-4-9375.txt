Theo Ratliff is an extremely important piece of the team with the best record in pro basketball, and is the best center in the Eastern Conference. At every level he has played - High School, College, NBA - Theo has been the dominant shot blocker. For the Sixers, Theo's ability to block shots its second only to Iverson's ability to score in overall importance. His presence in the middle allows the ball-hawking Sixers to swarm the ball, play the passing lanes, and in general, play aggressive, gambling defense. If someone gets beat, there is a good chance that pogo stick Theo is going to erase the shot. When you combine this ability with a rapidly improving offensive game, Theo deserves his spot on the All Star team.
