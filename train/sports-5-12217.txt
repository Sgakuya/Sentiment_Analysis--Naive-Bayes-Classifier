I've been watching this incredible talent since he was in the seventh grade and carrying the defense on his big back. In high school, he was on varsity and starting by the opening game. Same thing at Ohio State. He is always the game breaker because when the opposing team doesn't run or pass at him, they are avoiding him - yet he's never more than 1-2 steps away from making the tackle. But that's not the best thing about this young man. He's a genuinely humble person dedicated to football as a team sport. A true team player and always a leader on and off the field. Character counts, even in the NFL. Hall of Famer for sure, after a long career.
