The very fact that there are no comments listed for this vehicle after 29 so-called ratings were entered before mine speaks volumes for the complete lack of credibility of these raters. I seriously doubt a single one has even sat in, let alone driven, the new Sonata. I own two Sonatas---a '95 base and a '00 GLS. The new Sonata is the best midsize sedan you can buy today. Of course it is just a coincidence that Sonata sales have risen over 250% since the re-design in '99. Surely there couldn't be any other reason. If truthful information and opinion is what people are seeking, they would do well to disbelieve everything except their own impressions when they visit the dealer of choice.
