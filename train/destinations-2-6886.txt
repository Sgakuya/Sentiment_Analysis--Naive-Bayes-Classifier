not a good place at all to find a girlfriend! especially if you like women that are thin, skinny and attractive in any way. from research on american obesity, do not let mississippi's location in the deep south fool you; mississippi has been found to in fact be the fattest state in the nation. (approximately 30 percent of mississippi residents are overweight/obese.) and why are so many people obese in mississippi, i do not know. yes, i agree with you, because at first i really did think that alaska was the fattest state in the nation, and i was absolutely shocked to have read that the title of fattest state goes to mississippi.
