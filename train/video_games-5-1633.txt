Easily blowing away the boring Madden, Sega Sports has it where it truly counts--gameplay and commentary. The gameplay is more arcade-like that Madden's in that is more fast paced and more reminiscent of Sega's classic Sportstalk series. The graphics are great--complete with a slick ESPN presentation and well-rendered players and stadiums. The sound is the true All-Star of this game, however. The commentary team--voiced by professional voice actors--blows away the completely dull commentary of the Madden series. It starts out with Clark Dishman in the ESPN studio with pre-game, half-time, post-game, and weekly wrap up reports. In the booth are the best commentary team of all time (although both NHL 2002's Jim Hughson and Don Taylor and NBC's Badminton/Table Tennis Olympic team of Don Chevier and Bill Clement come very close), Dan Stevens and Peter O'Keefe. They are upbeat, chipper, constantly talking, and hilarious! Some of their exchanges are truly creative and inspired! Why can't more commentators be like this in real life? Finally, Michelle Westpaul reports from the sideline on weather and injuries. All in all, NFL2K3 is the complete package!
