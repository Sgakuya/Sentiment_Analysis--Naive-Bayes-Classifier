Since all this crap about pre-emptive this and pre-emptive that it has suddenly become ok to shoot first and ask questions later. In the case of Michael Moore, he is a good man, and all of his movies/documentaries are great! I have never been to a movie where the entire audience cries and seconds later is laughing their asses off! Bowling for columbine is a great movie, people should really know something about this man before they draw their conclusions. Finally, everyone who has heard of Michael Moore knows what he is about. Everyone in the audience knew what he was about, they still gave him a standing O when he won the oscar. But when he did what everyone knew he would do, everyone was shocked and awed, crazy.
