Metroid Prime is one of the most original first person adventure games ever to be released and one of the prettiest looking games to appear on the Gamecube, pushing the hardware to it's limits and showcasing some of the best looking lighting effects and texture work on any console. It has an addictive quality from start to finish and the moody soundtrack helps keep the atmosphere taught throughout. The puzzle solving is probably the highlight of Metroid Prime and the designer's have kept it varied so that you'll never find yourself feeling that deja vu or bored at any point, as morphing Samus into a ball is required in to complete a number of puzzles, some of which are quite challening, along with figuring out how to defeat some of the end level bosses, all of which are all impressively detailed. It's really hard to fault Metroid Prime except maybe that having to backtrack through some of the levels later on in the game, feels rather tedious at times, although a cool 3D map of the environment makes navigating around a breeze. Despite this though, this is a must have title for anybody who owns a Gamecube.
