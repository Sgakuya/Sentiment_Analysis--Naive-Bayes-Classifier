Chamberlain is undoubtedly one of the greatest players in the history of the game. He, in one season, averaged over 50 points! That's right, 50. On March 2, 1962 at in Hershey, Pennsylvania, he scored an unprecedented 100 points in a game against the New York Knicks. Chamberlain even led the league in assists one year! What a great all-around player. He never fouled out of a game, which is amazing. Wilt was a woeful free throw shooter, however. He is currently third on the all-time scoring list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone (Jordan is currently 4th). He was a great playoff contender with the Lakers and it was tragic that he died so suddenly. I'll always hate him for being a Warrior/76er/Laker and always killing the Knicks (except for game 7 in the 1970 finals). All in all, Wilt The Stilt Chamberlain was one of, if not the, greatest player in the history of the game of basketball.
