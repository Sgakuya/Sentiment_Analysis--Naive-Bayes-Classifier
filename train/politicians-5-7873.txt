Probably the most honest man to ever occupy the White House. He had modest formal education, but read avidly and made informed. often courageous, decisions. He used the atomic bomb on Horoshima and Nagasaki, but should probably have dropped at least the first bomb somewhere in Japan to make a demonstration that was much less costly in human lives. This is much easier to say in retrospect few leaders would have shown any more restraint against a fanatatical foe against whom we had been at war for four violent and bloody years. Overall, Truman virtually always made the best decisions he could, was as close to uncorruptable as anyone ever in the office. The opinion expressed below that he would have been considered to be a neoconservative is ludicrous - the man never showed any interest in their fantasies of preemptive war.
