Ok, yall need to stop rating JJ on his background, and actually pay attention to something more important! The kid can play. He's not the best athlete, he's no Dee Brown, Rashad McCants, etc. but ask anyone in the College Basketball world and they will tell you that he is the one of the best (if not the best) pure shooter in the country. Many people have already named him 1st team All-ACC, and the most valuable player for Duke. When he's on his game, the team is on their game. Without him, Duke wouldn't be half as good as they are now. Ok, who cares, if his family is rich, if he does drive a nice car (which he doesn't i know), that's just a bunch of Duke jeolosy right there. Hey, their good, they are usually good, and they will continue to be good so cut the whiney crap.
