Well, as fairest pollution, sadly but surely, it is present. Yet, any other city in the world has pollution, but is less advertised. So, don't think that New York City, or L.A. or Chicago don't suffer the same experience. In fact, we know how the whole world is polluted. Let's skip this subject for now. But, I would like to say that D.F. is very rich in culture, and like other people commented, D.F. has a variety of places to visit. I also give Mexico City credit for its existence. Don't be afraid about theft, you got to walk the place like you own it, or else people will take advantage. So, have fun, and look at the bright side.
