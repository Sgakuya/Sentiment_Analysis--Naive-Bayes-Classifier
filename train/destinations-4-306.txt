I'm not sure about 'best city in Australia by far' as one reviewer said, but Brisbane is a decent city with lots of pleasent greenery arrayed around its sprawling suburbs (and they do sprawl - Brisbane is geographically larger than Sydney or Melbourne). Obviously there is a reason that Brisbane is the fastest growing capital city in Australia, but the city itself isn't that great for tourists (I don't think at any rate - I'm a resident so it's a little hard to tell). However it is what is arrayed around Brisbane that makes it interesting for tourists. The Lamington National Park offers misty, mountain rainforests and many great walks as well as two lodges which provide brilliant accomodation. In addition to the Lamington National Park there is the Gold Coast - the great tourist city of Australia. Many Brisbanites dislike the Gold Coast for its highrise and perceived tackiness, but the busloads of Japanese and European tourists and southerners that come here don't seem to concur (the Gold Coast receives 5.1 million plus tourists annually making it Australia's number one destination). Most Brisbanites however prefer the smaller version - the Sunshine Coast. However a few have discovered even better beach holidays await them in the islands that are scattered across Moreton Bay - primarily North Stradbroke Island which has brilliant beaches and yet only has some four thousand or so people on the island at any one time. Anyway, Brisbane's a great base to explore all these places, but I can't really recomend the city itself as a tourist destination.
