I worked at Charter for almost 4 years.. so I am hear to tell you the company is shady. My service is perfect .. I can't complain . I can't complain about prices ( yea my gas bill tripled this year.. ) I did see everyday how ALL they cared about was making money.. who cares if someone's service didn't work.. sell them something.. I know everything there is to know about cable/internet/telephony but what people have to realize is there is only so much the person on the phone can do b/c we are at the mercy of so many others. It's the COMPANY.. not the individual. I despise them and will never ever go back to work there again. The best thing I ever did was quit there..
