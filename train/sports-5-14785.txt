emmitt did have a great O-line, but is smart and sees the field like a great running back. Many people say, it was just his 0-line and without he would have never been so great. All good running backs have good 0-lines, but to break as many records as emmitt it's not just his line. Maybe you people who say it's just his line, never watched emmitt smith play that much. Because the emmitt i saw took hits and kept going, when you thought he was going down, he would keep going for and extra ten yards. Emmitt is one of the best all around tailback in the game, he is a great blocker, good hands, and hardly ever fumbles. He also has a great heart, you dont find backs like him every day. So to all of you that say it's just his line, maybe you should watch some highlights of him before you speak. You dont win 3 super bowls, be a super bowl mvp, a pro bowl mvp, lead the NFl in rushing td's and yards because you suck. So give credit where credit is due.
