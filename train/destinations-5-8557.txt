I just returned from Iraq and was a member of 1-163 IN the "Grizzly" Battalion from Montana. The guys at Grizzly sent us some of there stuff and we all really appreciated it. I was a Kodiak fan but after I saw how these guys don't just pay lip service to supporting the troops they delivered. We had a hard time getting real chew over in Iraq (we were at a very small FOB) and the Haji chew stinks. So we wrote Kodiak, Cope and Skoal and didn't get squat. I guess when the guys at Grizzly found out we were in need and we were Grizzly's too they hook us up! Not only is their product a quality product, but they came through when we needed to chill out and grab a snoose. Thanks alot from the Infantrymen of the Griz Batallion!
