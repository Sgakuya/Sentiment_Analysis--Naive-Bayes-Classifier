I have completed both my Masters and Doctotate degrees through Capella. The University creates an engaged learning enviornment that is rigorous. I enjoyed the interaction between the faculty and the learners. The quality of the faculty and the great student services staff create a dynamic educational experience that has enhanced my journey of lifelong learning and has created career opportunities for me. As others have stated. Online learning is not easier. It requires a commitment to learning and to stretching your perceptions. But, it is very worth the cost when you factor in the lack of travel expenses and the availability of coursework on your personal time schedule. The Ph.D. track residencies are very well done and truly enhance the learning experience. For me, Capella University provided a learning opportunity and career advancement that I would not have been able to achieve otherwise.
