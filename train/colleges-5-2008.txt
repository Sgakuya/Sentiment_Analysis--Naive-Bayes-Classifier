Academics at Carleton are top-notch, with excellent teachers. Class sizes above 30 are practically nonexistent. The students here are very bright, left-wing, and generally very interesting people. Some are pretentious, but that's the case anywhere of such a caliber. One social drawback is that because it's such a small school (1900) as well as the rural MN location, there's a tendency toward gossip and conformity. The social environment can get small-towny and constricting. Anyone who's (1) from the coasts, (2) from a racial minority, (3) from a family below $75,000/year income, or (4) from a family above $150,000/year will never feel like he or she truly fits in, but can still be happy even despite not fitting in; most of the people are accepting and some are really awesome. In many ways Carleton is an antithesis of East Coast pretensia; there is a large hippie contingent, students are fairly antimaterialist and rarely get competitive against one another. GPAs and high school SAT scores are almost never discussed, nor family incomes. Students are very creative, and there's a loose connection between Carleton and gaming: Atlas Games was started by a Carleton alum, the card game Ambition written by a student there. Carleton is very good at academic grad school placement, but its greatest drawback is that it's mediocre at professional school placement, and terrible (compared to the quality of student) at real-world job placement. The students are smart and get a great education, but Carleton's terrible at marketing them. The unusual schedule (classes end in mid-June, conflicting with many internships) also hurts many students with respect to jobs.
