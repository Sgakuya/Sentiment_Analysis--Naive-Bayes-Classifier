Although considered a horror classic, the Omen fails to compel the viewer in the same way as The Exorcist did and although it is quite scary, it never reaches the intense horror and perversion of Rosemary's Baby. The eternal subject of the Antichrist is an over- exploited one. The Omen focuses on the malevolent child whose destiny is supposedly the annihilation of the human race. The kid is the biggest flaw of the movie: it's not particularly flattering to think that the downfall of humanity will be caused by a brainless, hysterical wimp. After all, you would expect from the Devil's child a form of at least rudimentary intelligence. How could evil be there where there seems to be only mental retardation? In spite of this unfortunate fact, the movie is gorgeous (especially the scenes in Italy)with a few great scenes (like the nanny's window swing style suicide and the barking dogs) that occasionally gives you the creeps.....I'M JUST A SHAPE,YES I'M ONLY A SHAPE, AND I'M SITTING HERE ON CAPITAL HILL
