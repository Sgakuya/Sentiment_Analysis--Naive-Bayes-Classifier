It's videos like these that make me wish Rateitall had a section for songs themselves and not just videos because, where I love the song very much, I think the video is a 4, at best. Anyway, because I do love this song and I think it's video compliments it very well, I'm still giving it a 5. Brandon Boyd shirtless would be just lovely if he would gain about oh, (1)20 pounds. I don't know..I have this whole weird thing that a guy has to weigh more than I do if i'm gonna be interested. The slow motion playing is lovely and it's interesting to see the little shots they have of their recording 'Morning View'. (Which I SUPPOSE is a good album..I really wouldn't know, seeing as I left it in SOMEONE'S car. *slaps self in head.*)
