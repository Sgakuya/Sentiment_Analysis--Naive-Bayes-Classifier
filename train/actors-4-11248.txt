Pardon me while I say YOWZA!!! :=8D For a blonde bombshell, Kirsten Dunst has an amazing talent for comedy, and a killer smile. Not to mention the tightest bod in the business(sorry ladies, the MooCow has to say it). She is stuck doing teen palp at the moooment, but has shined in real roles, as evidenced in such moovies as Dick, The Virgin Suicides, and Interview with the Vampire. She IS Drop Dead Gorgeous, and she IS the ultimate cheerleader from Bring it on! The MooCOw wouldn't touch Spiderman with a ten foot cowbell, but I'm sure she sizzled in that film as well. It will be nice to what she can do with a moore mature role as she gets older.
