Well, Kevin Costner, you proved you're not that bad after this amazing epic. It pulls you in, it's beautiful, it's also powerful, although too sterotyped. In fact, VERY stereotyped. That aside, also Costner giving himself half a dozen scenes without a shirt, this long film is worthy watching. Unfairly sweeping the Oscars in 1990, robbing GoodFellas of Best Picture and Director, not to mention others it should've won, Dances With Wolves is still a beautiful, sweeping epic, despite its patriotical hokum. Too bad Costner's performance is so terrible, as usual. Summary: A BEAUTIFUL, SWEEPING, YET STEREOTYPED EPIC WESTERN.
