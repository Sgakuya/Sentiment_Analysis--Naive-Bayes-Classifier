Independent Thinker 10-29-00 I believe that Nader should stay in the race to accomplish his goal:ob-taining funds for the next race.He should stand by his convictions and ignore the democratic party's whimperings about votes for him take away from Gore. Gore is a worthless professional politician. Gore says whatever he can to get a vote and will sell his mother if it meant the presidency. He is just as wishy-washy as Clinton. Look at how he has changed his opinion on gun controls! He panders to the rich and Hollywood brass just as fervently. He is not to be trusted. Nader is a man of conviction; so is GWBush even though Bush needs to be enlightened about the environment. Nader can do this, I believe; because GW is a man who tries to listen to both sides, and doesn't change his opinion to get votes like Gore does.
