Don't listen to the last guy who reviewed Revolutions, it did not suck. I would agree that the first one is the best of the three story-wise, but Revolutions is far from bad. Yes, some of the dialogue is wooden, and the beginning is slow, but the Battle for Zion will blow you away. There are some unexpected deaths, and I really cared about what happened to the people of Zion. Agent Smith is out of control, as are most of the fight scenes in this show. The final battle between Smith and Neo at the end had a pretty good conclusion, and I didn't expect it to end the way that it did. My only true complaint is that some of the cool characters introduced in Reloaded (Persephone, the Merovingian, the Architect, etc.) had barely even cameos in this one. Matrix purists may not like this, because only some questions are answered, but it is a damn entertaining flick.
