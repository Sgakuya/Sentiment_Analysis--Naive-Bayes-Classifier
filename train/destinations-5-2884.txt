While i do get upset about it being all people see to the state of New York. I can't deny that it is an awsome place. To all of you commenting on how mean and rude the people in NYC are, here is something you have to consider... The population of NYC just within the city limits is just over 8 million, with the surrounding area it is about 25 million. about 40 million people pass thru new york city every day. Less than half of all people in NYC are actually natives. Most of them, expecaily in Manhattan, are from other parts of the country, and other parts of the world. Chances are, when you walk down the street and get a bad immpression of somebody there, they aren't from New York. I like central park a lot, and i like the older, less commercail parts of Manhattan, but i actually think Brooklyn is my favorite borough, lower Brooklyn, around Bensonhurst, and Coney Island, it just has a real charming feel.
