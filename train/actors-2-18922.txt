 Do The Right Thing was so startlingly new in 1989 that I thought it was the best thing ever, but watching it now is positively painful. In retrospect it seems Lee benefited being the first figure that elites said was OK to treat like a major artist from a really dynamic injection of innovation from black America. Lee has run that into the ground over last ten years with film after film of decreasing humor and less attention to creating reasons for liking the characters in his films. It just seems he no longer connects with his audience -- even that audience (black and white) that was so much rooting for him to succeed.
