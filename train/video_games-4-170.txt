NFS: High Stakes was a great game when it came out in 1999. It played just like NFS 3: Hot Pursuit but it has car damage and a career mode. The eye candy was great: Smoke, sparks from blown out tires, night driving with headlights and rain and other weather effects. The hot pursuit mode was the funnest where you can play on either side of the law. And there are tons of options, also. My major gripe (and this also applied to Need For Speed 3) is that the steering was botched: There's a split second delay in the steering and also the car physics resemble hovercrafts, so you don't feel like your firmly on the road. This marred the game, greatly and made precise steering and extreme excercise in futility. I actually preferred the actual 'driving' better in NFS 2, not to mention it was a lot faster and funner, overall. Still, a great game in 1999.
