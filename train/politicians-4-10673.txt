Unquestionably, Watergate was Richard Nixon's legacy. Let's get 3 things straight: He didn't order the break-in, he wasn't aware of the break-in, and he didn't approve of the break-in. Nixon's downfall was the subsequent cover-up protecting the perpetrators. My hope is for people who are uninformed about Nixon to become aware of these facts, because to this day, numerous people believe Nixon was an evil puppetmaster who orchestrated the Watergate scandal. I know, because I thought this way for many years, thanks to partisan ideologues posing as history teachers. Instead of putting the country through a messy impeachment trial, he resigned. Just as he could've challenged the results of the 1960 election, he refused to pursue such options for the good of the country. Under Nixon's watch, we took steps to remove ourselves from the Vietnam conflict, perhaps not as quickly as many would've liked, but we did so nonetheless and in an honorable fashion. He was the first President to visit Red China and developed a better relationship with them, and we're reaping the benefits to this day, what with China moving away from Communism and toward a market-driven economy. I didn't give him a 5, as his domestic agenda was actually the most liberal of any President of the past 50 years, from price controls to a heavy expansion of LBJ's failed programs.
