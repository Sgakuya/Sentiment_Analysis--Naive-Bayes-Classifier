Ischia,the other island in the Bay of Naples, tends to be underappreciated, especially by Americans. If I could I'd rate it about a 3.75 rather than 4, but a 3 is just not enough. Bigger than Capri, its main attraction is that it is an escape from Naples. It has a quaint little port (with some decent restaurants along the waterfront), and not an awful lot in the way of spectacular attractions. In my experience, food was a bit better and a bit cheaper than on Capri. The best calzone that I ever had was at a small restuarant on Ischia. The local red wine there is Epomeo (named after Mount Epomeo on the island). I've had superb Epomeo (out of a bottle), and atrocious Epomeo (served straight from a demijohn at a local bar - as bad as the worst wine I tasted in France). I never drove on the island myself; traffic seemed to be pretty decent, especially considering that this is an island in close proximity to Naples and its unique brand of bullet car drivers. It's sort of a tossup between Capri and Ischia - Capri is a more recognizable name brand, but Ischia is a bit more relaxing and laid back.
