I'm biased because I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, and I prefer Cagney's gangster roles, quite frankly ("White Heat" is one of my all-time favorite movies). Cagney supposedly did this because there were some questions regarding his patriotism...there had been some assertions that he was of a liberal bent. Even though this was before the virulent hysteria of the McCarthy era, such an assertion could be ruinous to an actor's career. Thankfully, this is an entertaining movie, even if it functions primarily as a propaganda piece. Cagney's dancing will leave you in awe. It seems as if there wasn't anything he couldn't do if he put his mind to it. The film worked both as entertainment and a restorative to Cagney's potentially imperilled career. (George M. Cohan is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx and Cagney is buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, NY; every 4th of July, someone leaves American flags by both of their tombs.)
