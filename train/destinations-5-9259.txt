I make sure that I go to West Edmonton Mall at least once a year (and I live in Toronto). It is just such an amazing sight to me who has been there numerous times... some of the sights to see... 1. 3 Movie Theatres. 2. Submarine Ride 3. Full Lake with Huge Boat. 4. Aquarium 5. Huge Indoor Waterpark 6. 3 Mini Golf Courses 7. Indoor Go Cart Course 8. Casino 9. Amusement Park 10. 1000's of shops 11. NHL Size Ice Skating Rink. 12. Arcades And much much more. Make sure you try... Boston Pizza and Moxies Restauraunts while you are there. Boston Pizza is located inside and outside the mall and Moxies is just up the road.
