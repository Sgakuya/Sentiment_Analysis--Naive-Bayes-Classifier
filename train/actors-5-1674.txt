The Best actor in hollywood today. Why? he's proven he's very dynamic and can take on just about any rol but does not have really any more roles to conquer and challenge and he has his two oscars, from Glory (supporting actor) and Training Day (Best Actor). I would put him ahead of Tom Hanks on whose better. The only type of films he hasn't really broken into is comedy maybe with the exception of Preacher's Wife. He can be bad and tough guy Training Day, He got game, the Hurricane, a hero Glory, Malcom X, Crimson Tide, Courage under Fire, and a lover Devil in a blue dress. He has the rarity like his hero Sidney Poitier to have his works accepted and praised in the mainstream hollywood community and in the black community without having to sell out to one or the other. His characters in films will be remembered whether their the bad guys that society doesn't accept or misconscrew or the ordinary common man everyone loves. He has been able to distinguish himself as his own and break away from the Poitier comparison. Years from no many people no matter who it is looks up and will look up to him for his amazing accompolishments.
