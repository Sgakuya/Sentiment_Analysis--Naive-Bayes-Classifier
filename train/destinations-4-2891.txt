I still have a lot of respect for citizens of NYC. NYC is a city that everyone should visit at least once in their lives. It's an amazing city. I love it... Altho some of the people there can be rude (that's just the East Coast demeanor), they aren't all bad. Great things to do and see in NYC... I didn't really get chance to eat upscale while I was there, but duh...it is NYC so they've got some great restaurants. I didn't feel unsafe at all while I was there, but I did stay in lower Manhattan, only venturing no farther than Central Park and the Upper West Side. Everyone there seems to be very busy...which they probably are. If you like the hustle and bustle of big cities, you'll like NYC. Always something to do.
