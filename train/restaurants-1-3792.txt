My daughter was brought to Chuck E. Cheese's as a reward. Unfortunately, we paid out more than just the game tokens! My daughter put her sneakers in the bin so she could use the "tunnels" and 45 minutes later they were gone from the bin! I have never had that problem at Mc D's! The manager would not give us compensation although this location had no disclaimers posted and acted disinterested. The manager also would not give us his full name! Yep, it would be hard to figure out after giving this information to his General Manager... I have complained to the corporate office by email, we will see what happens. Word of Warning, keep the kids shoes by your tables!! Better yet just go to McD's it better, cheaper and I have never had a problem with the employees!!
