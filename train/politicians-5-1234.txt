I would like to point out that Christians do not have a country to themselves. Do you see us going around taking over someone elses country?(No) We have holy shrines in Isreal, but you don't see us trying to take it over. I don't think the Jewish people need their own homeland. The Arabs did what anyone would do. They fought for their country. Arabs in Isreal do not have the same rights as Isrealis. Is that fair I ask? The Jews may have been killed by Hitler, but does that give them the right to take over someone elses homeland? The Jews at one time lived there but DESSERTED that land and came back 400 years later to try and get it back. I say that the U.S comes to its senses and helps to help the Arabs regain their land. By the way I am an American and I say that the Arabs are in the right here.
