The power behind this mans work is unfathomable. Kubrick is an artist of the highest degree. His films show an undeniable talent and flair for visual atmosphere. From the color red he used as a symbol of eroticism and sex to the icey cold hyes of the Shinning, Kubrick is one of the worlds greatest film makers. He vreated films that were not just entertaining and thought provoking, but movies that broke new grounds in story telling and cinamatic technique. He is absolutly one of the if not the best cinematographeres. His capability to make you feel,to keep you watching. If you enjoy the pictures Kubrick has made or not, he has touched thousands of film makers with his creative style. Kubrick is on of the last truly innovative film makers. Truely Brilliant. His films and contributian to humanity will live on forever. I might get ridiculed for posting this but, I found to Eyes Wide Shut to be a very well made and thoutful movie. Kubrick's style was in full swing and I felt he did a magnificent job directing it. I cannot think of a Kubrick film that has not in some way made me think or ever made me want to leave the theater. Kubrick is an artist, and like all artist, sometimes the work isn't for every persons taste. Eyes Wide Shut was a beautiful finale for a great and inspiring artist.
