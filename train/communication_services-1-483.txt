This is part of my effort to do at least $200 worth of damage to Alltel. I had a 2-year wireless service contract with Alltel, and within 2 months of signing the agreement, my service started to decline. The reception started out decent, but I was told that some of the towers in my area had received some type of damage and that they weren't worth repairing or upgrading. They essentially ceded all of the business in my area to U.S. Cellular. I too have now signed up with U.S. Cellular and the service has been very good. I am willing to pay my $200 disconnect fee to Alltel, but I am determined to do at least $200 in damage to their business by telling my story over and over. If you too have had sucky Alltel service, I'd love to hear from you.
