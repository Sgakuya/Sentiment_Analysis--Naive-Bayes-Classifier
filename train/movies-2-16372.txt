Renting this film the other night seemed like a great choice and good idea at the time. However, I soon realized that this bumpy, uneven story would become yet another challenge to my ability to sit on my backside for two hours straight - which was made possible probably only due the conditioning of life behind a computer screen for the past several years. Pay it Forward starts out as an interesting, left field adventure in altruism that quickly slooooows its pace and turns into a twist on The Courtship of Eddie's Father - with the obligatory dark brooding elements we've come to expect in 2001. No disrespect at all to these well-respected actors who actually did a great job with what they were given. And even though it had a few very good moments, I would still say that what the actors were given just wasn't enough. Oh, yes, and to top it off, the uncalled for ending completely reeked.
