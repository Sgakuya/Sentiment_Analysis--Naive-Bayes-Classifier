Vicente Fox is the greatest hope for Mexico. Although he has said that he will devote the nation to an isolationist foreign policy, like it has been for 100 years; he will reform the system of government in the country. I believe that he will try to take care of the drug problem through stricter law enforcement. Hopefully, the border will continue to open up with Mexico. Americans can only benefit from free trade. Free trade means more jobs for Americans, more avilable resources for market consumption and stricter environmental standards. Hopefully, the recent setback with the Mexican trucks not being able to enter U.S. territory will not lead to a trade war with Mexico. Mexican trucks have an equal safety rating than American or Canadian trucks do. The reason why it did not pass the Senate was because the Democrats and their union cohorts want to protect UNION jobs without regard to newer, higher paying jobs which will be offered as a result of free trade. I believe that in order for us to enter the new world of nations, we must drop this silly protectionist philosophy which only benefits a few powerful people. Fox has already negociated a peace settlement with insurgents in the province of Chiapas and reform will continue within the government. Hopefully, NAFTA will be able to work better under him.
