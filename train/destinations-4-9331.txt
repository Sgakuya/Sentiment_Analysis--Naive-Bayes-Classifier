At first I was surprised that the tour was free, and that they give you two free rum drinks per person. But everyone left the factory store with something, so Bacardi is not losing any money. And the factory store prices are only about 20% cheaper than back on the mainland (at a good store), so if you are looking for something to bring back, get the reserve rum. At $55 per bottle, it is expensive, but you can't get it anywhere else. The bottles are numbered (mine had a number in the 44,000's so it really is not like a limited edition run. Interesting company history with many original documents. If you have some time to spend before returning to Old San Juan, not a bad diversion.
