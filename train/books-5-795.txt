Harry Potter and the Chamber is a great book!It makes me never want to stop reading it.I really like the part when the Hier of Slytherin takes Ginny to the Chamber and writes that mesage on the wall that says'Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.' It gives me the chills.I think it expans my imagination.I hear that they are going to make a movie.I think it is going to look stuipd,because I can't imagine Harry ponting his wand at Lockhart shouting Expelliarmus! Then Lockhart goes blasting backwards.I would enspire anybody who can read to read Harry Potter and the Chamber Secerts.I rate this book number one!It's the best book I have ever read.Now I want there to be a Hogwarts so I could learn magic.
