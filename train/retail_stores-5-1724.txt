To Magellan, I kinda smirk when you talk about Wal-Marts strategy and efficency, I actually work at a supercenter i am an overnight reciecving associate, The place is actually almost ran like a military, we have our own jargon, managment has walkie talkies for communication, he work fast and we are trained well, and we are trained to love the place and think on a corporate level, here is an example; I was working on my aisle when i spilled some soda, a member of my management was there i asked her to get maintence over here to take care of the spill she msged the CSM (Customer Service Manager) to page maintence, They did and maintence was there at the spil in like seconds, its quite impressive how its ran, its so perfect its sickening, We even have an ICS team (Inventory Control Specialist)..... However there are plenty of bad things i can tell you about wal-mart but that mainly ties into the politics that come from working for a 500 billion doller giant.
