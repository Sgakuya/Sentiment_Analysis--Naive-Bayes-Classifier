This film tries to be scary in a disturbing kind of a way, rather than a Pop-up-and-say-boo kind of way, and for that I commend them. However, the cinematography in this movie is horrible! The acting was subpar, and there were more flashbacks than Forrest Gump. I did like their idea for the film (although it was not original at all) that the killer always finds ways for victims to kill themselves, which isn't true in a couple of scenes (like taking a homemade jawbreaker off your head in a time limit; that's murdering!). Also, this film, and their critics, say that this is one of the goriest films ever. Don't make me laugh. There's hardly any gore at all, a couple of scenes with blood, and some afterimages of dead people, but that's it. And don't expect to be scared either... The Ring was scarier than this movie, and that's saying a lot. Don't bother.
