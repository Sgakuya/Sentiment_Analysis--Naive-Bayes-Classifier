hello, i had an experience with bank one what happened was that i sent pmnt which happened to get to them 2 days late due to mail delay. never in my history with them had i ever been late not ever 1 day. I called them asked if they received which she stated that they had, but i was charged with a $30.00 late charge. I asked the person who supposively try to help me if she can please waive the fee. she stated that she would not adviced that I have never been late, she answered by saying that it did not matter. wanted to speak to manager, would happen to be one of the rudest persons i have ever come accross. I promised to them that once acct is paid never would i do bussiness with them again. Bank one has no proffesionalism, they are a terrible company to deal with. thank you Fernando
