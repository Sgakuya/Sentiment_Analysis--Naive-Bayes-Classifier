I'm torn on this one. I hate Tony Blair as a man - I think he is a flashy, smarmy git. But as a Primeminister... He's George Bush's poodle. He's all spin and propaganda and he lies all the time - e.g. over Iraq; he refuses to answer questions in Primeminister's question time. He's putting his cronies in the House of Lords. He's buggering up the economy by slapping red tape EVERYWHERE. On the other hand, he's a strong leader; not afraid to do what he thinks is right - even if it'll hurt his ratings, which I think is crucial. He invaded Iraq and ousted an evil dictator, which I think was right, regardless of the way he did it. And, so far, the economy hasn't suffered measurably. I'm torn. I'll give him a 5 even though he deserves a 3 just because there are a lot of nutters out there slagging him off and giving him 1s with no justification or on one issue, without waying up the arguments.
