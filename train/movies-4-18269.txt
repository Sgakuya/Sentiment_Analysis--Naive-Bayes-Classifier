No, it wasn't a great movie, but it was a very enjoyable, diverting piece of entertainment, especially when you consider how banal the majority of horror movies had become by the 1980's, and what more can one ask of a movie than that? Interesting sidenote: I always wondered what had happened to actor Stephen Geoffreys, who appeared as Evil Ed in this and was being touted by some in the mid 80's as the next Jack Nicholson. Went onto the IMDB website and found out that he's a gay porno actor now (no joke)....I'm in no way a homophobe, and if that's what he wants to do, then so be it. But you have to wonder if this radical change in career direction was a truly voluntary decision or the result of something else? Only in Hollywood can you go from one day being the next Jack Nicholson to being an actor in gay porno the next...
