This is by far one of the best if not the best Stephen King horror adaption next to the Shinning. This movie triumphs in all catagories. What makes this movies is the frightningly realistic portrayle of Annie which Kathy Bates brings to life with a masters stroke. The rest of the cast does a wonderful job considering that Ms.Bates steals the show. The paceing of this movie is very well done. If the paceing had been done wrong, which could have happened easily, this film would have sucked. But this doesn't happen. This movie goes along on a very nice pace and keeps the viewer very interested. The suspence is great. The first time I saw it I almost passed out. I was only in third grade so it isn't as surprising. Still, this movie sends chills up my spine every time I watch it. I just imagine myself in the situation that poor guys situation...jesus thats creepy. This film is definatly recommended.
