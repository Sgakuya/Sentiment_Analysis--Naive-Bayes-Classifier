Coach K is my favorite coach. I began liking Duke when I read an article on him prior to his first national championship that mentioned his graduation rate is the best in the nation after the ivy league schools basketball programs. I was quite impressed and very happy to see him move on to win 3 NCAA titles. His teams have also been runner-up 4 times. By the end of his career he will be the second best coach of all-time. He has a VERY outside shot of impressing me enough to outdo Wooden but I won't hold my breath. He is still quite young and just needs to put together a few more championship seasons. I would like to see him have a perfect season but in modern basketball that may be impossible.
