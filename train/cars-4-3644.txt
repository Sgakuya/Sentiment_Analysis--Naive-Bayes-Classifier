After I tired of getting killed trading on new Suburbans, I bit the bullet and bought a Durango. I loved the exterior looks and the inside is okay. There is quite an adjustment down-sizing from a Suburban, but the Durango delivers on spunk and turning radius. I see a lot of people complaining about the gas mileage. I get 14MPG overall - standard for a SUV. Of course, many believe that the smaller size translates to better economy, but the 14 is only slightly better than the Suburban was. The problem is the undersized tank...the Suburban held 43 gallons, so you could drive to Hell and back - no matter the gas mileage. The Durango's puny tank gives the impression that a drive to the supermarket is reason enough for a refill. Overall, the Durango has been a good truck and I have since purchased a second one. The great news comes when you trade and actually have some value left - unlike Suburbans!!
