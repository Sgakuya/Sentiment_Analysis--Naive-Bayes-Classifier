The literary masterpiece of the golden age of Spanish culture. Originally intended as a parody of the insipid and ridiculous romances current then, it ended up being the most universal novel ever written, the most loving portrayal of the absurd quest which is Life. The Don and Sancho Panza have all manner of ridiculous adventures, which are like wrong-end-of-the-telescope views of the adventures we all have in life. It is incredible on how many levels you can read this book, and how utterly *true* it all is. Cervantes lost a hand at the battle of Lepanto, and spent years in the prisons and slave-camps of the Ottoman Turks before finally returning to Spain. It amazes me how he could write such a gentle and compassionate book after experiencing that kind of suffering--but yet here it is, one of the masterpieces of the world. Five stars!
