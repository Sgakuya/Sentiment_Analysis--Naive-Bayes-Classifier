I prefer her Spanish version of this album. Before getting this CD as a present when I left Chile set back to Norway, I hadn't really liked her. But now this CD makes me nostalgic wanna go back to a Spanish-speaking country which I'm actually gonna do soon. I'll spend two weeks of my summer holidays in Spain, especially Barcelona, Madrid Alicante. In the middle of August I'm going to begin at the only Norwegian (private) school on the Canari Islands. To be more specific it lies on Gran Canaria of course it's called El colegio noruego . Their webpage is www.colegio.no. However I'm gonna lived there at least two-three years. First two years at high school. Then probably some time working. I have high expectations! :-))
