That's what I love about Tar Heel fans - they show so much class and sportsmanship, LOL! BW is simply the best - hecan flat out coach, motivates his players, the players would do anything for him and his staff, they absolutely believe anything is possible if you want it bad enough and work your behinds off. Weber's record as a head coach is phenomenal, he is tied or first place for most wins over last 4 years. His record at Illinois alone is incredible, he is currently 50-1 in regular season games. He's got 2 big recruits in Eric Gordon and Bill Cole and others will be following. Most of Self's boys are gone, Dee is in a new position and three starters had a lot of adjustment to make. Two were redshirted last year - one injured, one transfer; the third played very few min pg.Yet in a dozen games they've all melded together into a extremely good basketball team, ranked #6, undefeated at 12-0 and all but certain to be 14-0 heading into the conference season. Makes a lot of things that people wrote last year about Weber and the Illini - about flukes, Self, recruiting ability, etc, - look kinda foolish now, hmm? Still, though the Illini aren't as "classy" as the boys from Chapel Hill or Duke, we won't hold that against anyone. We'll just keep on winning, and winning, and...
