In truth, I think the historical Dracula (Vlad Tepes, or Vlad the Impaler) only visited Bran Castle. The remains of the castle that could accurately be called Dracula's Castle are located on the banks of the Argas River. Of course, I speak as someone who has never been to Romania (then again, Bram Stoker never visited there either). Still, images of the countryside that Stoker described so evocatively have stayed with me all my life, and Dracula remains one of my favorite novels, although Stoker was a flawed writer in many ways. I'd love to someday go there, despite certain reservations about its stability. It seems such a beautiful, haunting country that is rich with history and folk-lore. Its politics since the downfall of Ceausescu have been turbulent and there are stories of rampant corruption, but then I guess that's true of so many places in Eastern Europe.
