Angelina Jolie is a very good actress without a doubt. But why did I get the feeling she was just playing to type. Oh, not really fair I know, since I have no idea what she s really like. By accident or design, she does seem to be building a weird little reputation for herself on and off screen. And it s not that easy to stand out in the crowd as an oddball these days with so much competition - especially in her line of work. But, she really managed to do so as far as this film was concerned. Winona Ryder also did an excellent portrayal as well. This is the kind of movie you keep watching because it is just so off center you end up more or less needing to know what will happen next. Very unpredictable, fairly depressing, and, for lack of a better word, strange. Partly because it is so emotionally draining, I can t say I would go out of my way to see it again but I ll bet if I accidentally caught it on television some slow moving afternoon I would continue to watch it regardless of where I came in.
