These were a disappointment. You don't really need to improve upon the Reese's Pieces or the Peanut Butter Cups, so why try. I ate the Cups and the Pieces for years and it never occurred to me that what this awesome flavour really needs is to be in a Twix-type arrangement. I can see why they make those little Skor bits or the Reese Balls or whatever they're called, eating little bits is fun, and you can portion them out to whoever wants some just hold out your hand , but putting a peanut butter cup into a bar form doesn't do anything to improve portability or tactile enjoyment. It's just unnecessary, and they still managed to make them taste a little worse, which is another reason I won't buy them again.
