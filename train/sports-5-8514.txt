I'm not very vague in my rating of Ron Artest: I don't like Ron Artest. But if it's possible, I like Kobe Bryant even less. Unlike Artest, Bryant mugs for the camera like a golden child that can do no wrong. He talks snidely to the media like he invented the game of basketball. He talks about his teammates like he's coaching a middle-school team (recent quote: [my teammates] are giving me 110%). Worst of all, Kobe is someone his teammates can't talk freely around in the locker room because they know they'll read about it in the paper the next day (Shaq learned the hard way). I don't doubt for nano-second that someone with Kobe's sense of self-importance wouldn't take no for an answer from a hotel clerk in Colorado. I give 5 stars for his talent, but I'm not happy about it.
