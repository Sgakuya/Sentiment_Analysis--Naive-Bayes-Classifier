Sweet, intelligent, sharp snugglebunny! Ms. Garofalo is an under-appreciated actress, a witty comedianne, and has one of the mooost winning smiles in the world. Her comedy shows are always funny, and she has positively sparkled in films she has been cast, especially Mystery Men, Dogma, and The Truth About Cats and Dogs.

She has a dark, uncowventional beauty, tremendous energy, and a canny intelligence, all wrapped up into a tiny bundle of explosive talent. The whole herd is in love with Ms. Garofalo - if only we can get her to stop smoking! :=8)
