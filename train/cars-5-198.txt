I have a 2005 700 carb. model. I must say that this machine does everything I need it to do. It has the best ride of all quads that I have ridden. I belong to a atv club. We usually put on anywhere from 50-90 miles a day. Most of the riders are very sore the next day,however I am not. Because it has true 4 wheel drive, it rarely gets stuck. Last time we went riding I switched with a Honda rider and he was very impressed. He is considering a 700 also!!! I also use it for snow plowing. I have a long steep driveway and it will push 15 inches of snow no problem. I am sure it will push more but that was the biggest amount we have had.This is my second Polaris Sportsman and I love it!!!
