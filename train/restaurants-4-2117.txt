People, I understand about the coffee and teas that they serve, but out of all the comments I read, ALMOST NOBODY ever said anything about the entrees (other than coffee, tea, donuts and bagels) they serve. I did try one two years ago and the sandwich they served was much more delicious than Subway, Blimpie and Quizno's. I went again and ate an etoufee. (Both were dine-ins in Canada.) I praise the hard work that they do for foods, but not for prepared drinks. I can guess that it was the merger between them and Wendy's that made them change their acts on service. The donuts were fresh and delicious with any meal. I would go there again- not at breakfast. They would be better off being partially fast food and a culinary restaurant together. I may pretty soon go to the US restaurants and see if they are equal to where the chain originated. Now of course, they serve good sanwiches, right? Please, stop complaining just about breakfast coffee and tea on this chain and give input on on other meals they serve! I'm sure you've been there after eleven o'clock!
