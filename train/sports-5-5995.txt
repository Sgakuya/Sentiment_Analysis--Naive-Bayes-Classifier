I am amazed at JJ's shooting ability... he has amazing range and great natural talent. I love the way fans of teams like carolina try and detract away from his success by saying that he just has luck Id love to see some of these bubbas who are saying such crap to come back up what they are saying. Although JJ isn't the best all around player he is an amazing shooter and he's becoming more versatile as the years go by. His defense is much better this year..assists are up..they have been the highest on the team...annnddd he's much better at pushing the inside defense and going for the inside shot. His training regiment really worked and I hope he keeps his discipline up because he has a real shot for player of the year! I also love how all these girls are coming on here and saying how hot he is....cause I mean he is reallly sexy....but if thats all your gunna rate about him....stick to teen beat or somethin... As for you carolina heels fan.. I hope you team Has fun watchin from the sidelines!!!
