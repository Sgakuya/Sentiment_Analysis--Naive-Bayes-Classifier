Words that best describe this school and WIU: ATROSCIOUS, SHOCKING, UPSETTING, UNSPEAKABLE, DISPICABLE, LIARS. This school is terrible when it comes to honesty and intergrity. The counselors do not communicate with you, and are appalling. They lie and note that they have communicated with you and never contacted you. The instructors are very inconsistant, but it doesn't surprise me as the entire staff seems to be. I am so dissapointed in this school, all I ever heard about was university of phoenix. I think at some point they were a number one online school, but somewhere they have lost what may have qualified them to be a number 1 school. I also was duped with my financial aid & loans. They don't care about anything but money. The classes I had were worthless. I had better classes in the community college I attended, now I wish I had stayed. The desire to have convience for me, is above all.
