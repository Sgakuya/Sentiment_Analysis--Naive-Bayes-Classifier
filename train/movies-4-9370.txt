I was expecting to be unimpressed, but I was proven wrong. I agree with Shroomwoman that it was a mindless little comedy. It seemed relatively low budget, almost bordering an a B movie in that it wasn't trying too hard to have completely perfected script and characters, which is the mistake that most big budget movies make. It really didn't remind me of clueless so much as say, Romie and Michelle's High School Reunion (also an incredibly stupid yet fun relative of clueless), because that one plays more on the fact that the two girls (while very fashion conscious) had trouble fitting in. Like Legally Blonde, they have the girls at first trying to be ballbusting business women in black power suits , but end up throwing out those outfits and the lies they made up to go with them and figure out how much more easier and rewarding it is to be true to yourself. What I also like about Legally Blonde is that the moral messages, about female empowerment and being true to yourself, are clear yet subtle undertones to the comedy itself. They're not melodramatically shoved down your throat like in many other movies with similar themes.
