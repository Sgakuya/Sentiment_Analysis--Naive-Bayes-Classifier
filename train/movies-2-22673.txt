You know, my friends say I judge movies way too harshly. However, I don't think so. X-Men was a disappointment. I must admit that I did something I don't usually do; I fell into the hype surrounding the movie. That was my first mistake. My second mistake was actually arriving at the theatre and actually sitting down in a seat to watch the movie. The casting was great, but the script was horrible. This is to kone7059om: if the film is not easy to make, then they shouldn't make the movie until they have worked harder on the movie and are sure they will have a quality product. You can't show loyalty by supporting them in whatever they do because everything they do is not always good. Anyway, with casting that superb, it is hard to understand how the movie turned out so horrible. The intro was pretty good, but as the movie progressed, it got more and more confusing. The transitions left me feeling puzzled and absolutely lost. Things happened in certain scenes that had no apparent reasoning behind them. I just sat there saying WHY to a lot of things that happened in the movie. It is true that the action scenes were pretty good, but they also had puzzling reasoning behind them. Halle Berry worked her part as Storm very well. She is THE finest woman on earth. The ending of this movie was the most puzzling part. It just ended; I was waiting for another action scene or some more talking or something, but it just ended leaving me pissed and puzzled. It's like they just threw some random scenes together and called it a movie. It wasn't that bad, but it was pretty bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.
