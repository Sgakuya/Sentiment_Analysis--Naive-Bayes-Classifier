Omaha is a very strange city. It is certainly a rust-belt city, but one that has a very large business base. Mutual of Omaha, First National Bank, ConAgra, Union Pacific are all located in Omaha. The wages are fairly high for a city with such a low cost of living. Omaha has two world-class medical facilities (Creighton University and University of Nebraska Medical Center).The University of Nebraska medical is huge, about the size of the average middle-sized cities downtown. The reason why I said rust-belt is that like so many rust-belt cities, Omaha has a major urban decay problem in the inner-city. Downtown Omaha has tons and tons of boarded-up buildings and the east side of Omaha looks like its for sale. All said, Omaha is a city of contrasts.
