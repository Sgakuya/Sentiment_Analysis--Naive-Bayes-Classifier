Although it still can't compare with the Nintendo GameCube as far as the game selection and overall design goes, the Sony Playstation 2 is a remarkable console. For one, the graphics are almost at par with the GameCube at times--only a few games have the somewhat-overblown anti-aliasing problems. The game selection is very good. I could care less about the violent first person shooters and soon-to-be-rated-AO Grand Theft Auto series. Games like Kingdom Hearts (an awesome Square/Disney crossover RPG), ESPN Sports (with the best presentation values of any sports games), Burnout 3: Takedown (with it's challenging and puzzle-game-like Crash mode) and more were the reason I purchased Sony's emotion-engine-powered console. The amount of platformers is surprising. Ignore the JAK sequels and you have Rayman, Sonic, and many more. The controller, while a bit ankward at times, is very good. The outward appearance of the slimmed-down PSTwo model is pretty sleek, but could be a bit more colorful. The 8 MB memory cards hold quite a bit of data. The sheer amount of games covering almost every genre are a sight to behold. And, backwards compatibilty with the vast breath of the PSOne library is an extremely good bonus. While Nintendo is still the best in my eyes, Sony is no longer an enemy--besides, they're just games--why not enjoy all the ones you like! ^_^
