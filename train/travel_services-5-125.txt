I've never flown Midwest Airlines until April of '04. I was impressed and shocked with the service. I never expected the airline to be as great as I've heard. Infact, until recently I never was aware that the airline served full meals on real china and so forth. Sadly, I never experienced that, but what I did experience was excellent. Infact, I even applied for a job right after I flew it, and now I work in Reservations at Headquarters in Milwaukee. I must say, everyone adores their job, I've never seen so many people happy with their career. The environment is exciting. Believe me, everyone misses the meals, as from what I notice, but there is a rumor about bringing some portions back to atleast the Signature Service. Rumors :) but we can only hope. The BEST Care in the Air.
