St. Louis is a wonderful city. It is not the kind of place that jumps out at you, it's one you need to get to know. But once you do, there is no denying its urban wonder. The neighborhoods are rich with history, fabulous architecture and very colorful residents. The city is really making a comeback. After living for a short time in New York, I was so happy to see all the wonderful progress that the city has made during my absence. A downtown loft boom, coupled with massive reinvestment all over the city makes it clear that STL has turned the corner. If you haven't been to St. Louis in a while, you need to get your ass back. The dark years are over. The future is bright for this great city.
