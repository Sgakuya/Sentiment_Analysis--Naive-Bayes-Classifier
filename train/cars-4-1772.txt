I own a 2001 Chevy Cavalier, I wanted a newer car yet I was on a budget. I saw my Cavlier at the Dealership, low miles 29,000, good condition. I have owned it now for 6 months and have had no problems with it. The car drives pretty good, it's easy to drive, for only having a 2.2 4cyl engine it moves quick enough to get me where I'm going just fine. This car is pretty good on gas, not outstanding like a Honda Civic, but much better than my 96 Chevy Beretta 3.1 V6. This is an easy car to own, and it will run for a long time if taken care of properly. Oil Change every 3000 miles, Change the Antifreeze once a year or every other year, Change the Transmission fluid every few years, and if you got more than 50,000 on your Cavlier get a tune up. Take care of the car and it will take care of you. As far as refinement goes, this car doesn't have much of it, the engine is older technolgy, but still a good engine, it's a basic car to get you to point A to point B. Everyone agree's Honda, Nissan, Toyota is better, and I agree also, but I don't agree they are better value for the Dollar. You will be paying twice the money for those cars over the Cavalier, and those other cars aren't twice the quality.
