I have to admit, when we popped this in the DVD player, I was skeptical to say the least. Disney has come out with half a dozen of these movies featuring the same basic story--worst place team gets it all together and wins the championship (i.e. Little Giants, Mighty Ducks, Big Green, Ladybugs, etc.). I was expecting pretty much the same thing here, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's based on the true story of Jim Morris, who becomes a major league ballplayer at the age of 35. He coaches a small town team in Texas, and they bet him that if they win the district championship, he'll have to try out for a major league team, and even though it's predictable what happens next, it does have it's factual background to back it up. Very heartwarming, and very much worth watching.
