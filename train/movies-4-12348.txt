Good movie that is a real tribute to the Japanese POWs of WWII, the Rangers who recsued them and the Filipino people who fought against the Japanese. This movie was a real eye-opener fo rme. WWII seemed ot be remembered more for the War in Europe than what happened in the East vs the Japanese IMHO. This movie revealed some things about the War in the Pacific that even i wasnt quite aware of , starting with a historical narrative of the war and what happened in the Phillipines after Pearl Harbor. The movie moves along at a good pace with the inevtiable rescue. Before that, though, we really get a look atthe Japanese-occupied Phillipines and their treatment of American POWs. It's not pretty, but I'm glad the story was told and referenced with real footage, of the people who actually made history.
