Before I read this book, I prepared myself to be let down. I thought that there was no way that Speaker for the Dead would measure up to Ender's Game. Not only did it measure up, but in my opinion this book slightly surpassed its predecessor. Once again, OSC proves himself the master of articulating what motivates people to act the way they do. The multicultural aspect of the book is fascinating, as are the federalism overtones, and the touches of religion. All that being said, I do not recommend this book until you have read Ender's Game - the character development of Ender is critical to understand the character of the Speaker.
