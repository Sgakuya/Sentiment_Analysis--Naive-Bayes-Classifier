I recently re-read this gem of a book, and I'm very happy I did. This was the first Tom Clancy novel I ever read, and although it inspired me to read the rest of his library, my memory kept nagging at me that this was an average book at best. Well, my memory is apparently malfunctioning. The Hunt for Red October is an exciting, fascinating book which sets the stage for the slew of outstanding work by Tom Clancy released since. All the elements of the technothriller appear in this novel for the first time, with strong hints of Clancy's understanding of human nature which he would develop beginning with Patriot Games . This book is much more than an encyclopedia of naval and submarine lore, which explains its lasting popularity. The pacing of your average Clancy is akin to Forsyth, however I find Tom Clancy's work to be superior. Even though the technical language is very prevalent, I never had the impression that I was being preached to; I actually enjoyed learning new things as I went along (as I do with every Clancy novel). This novel was made into an excellent film, but the book delivers so much more than the film could. Hunt is a great read by itself, but anyone interested in getting into Clancy would be better off reading both The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games before making a final judgment about whether or not they enjoy Clancy's style. These two works tend to balance each other out between his technical side and his stronger true storytelling skills.
