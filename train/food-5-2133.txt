This is one of my favourites. It could stand to be a little less sweet, but I like the whole peanut thing. I know, intellectually, that it's not any healthier than other candy bars, but it seems like it should be because peanuts are good for you, and Snickers is chock full o' peanuts. Other candy bars could learn a lesson from good ol' Snickers, that sometimes the simplest and most obvious ingredients are the best. You don't need any fancy rice thingies or shaved coconut or anything likewise exotic. Peanuts, caramel, chocolate. Kind of makes me wonder how O'Henry managed to screw up those ingredients. Weird, huh?
