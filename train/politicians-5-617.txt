When she was elected in 1979 Britain was in a complete mess - the chaos and apathy helping to make Britain a joke. She restored national pride and the economy and refused to be bullied by Europeans. She gave all council tenants the right to buy their own homes. She gave all workers the right to a free secret ballot before their workplaces were subjected to undemocratic strikes. She took on and defeated a fascist union leader (of the miners) who had refused to allow his members to ballot (Scargill had lost a strike ballot the year before the strike and knew he could not allow democracy to have its way in his union). And similarly she also threw fascist invaders out of the Falkland Islands. She was NEVER defeated - she won ALL her general elections. In the end she resigned, despite getting the biggest share of the vote in the final Conservative leadership election. She opposed communism and saw that monstrous evil defeated and the people of Eastern Europe liberated. She almost spoilt her record by imposing the poll tax - unfair and inequitable (note that the tax still exists today, under a left wing government!) But there are many many thousands of Brits whose lives were made better by her policies and leadership. Personally I think she was the best Prime Minister we ever had. May God bless her!
