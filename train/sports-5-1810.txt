granted, the world series is the top prize, the title that everyone looks at, and the braves have only one, i think skip carrey said it best: "how can you take the best teams in baseball, who have endured a season of ups and downs, made adjustments, and still maintained the best records, and put them together for a few games to see who's best?" you don't know who's going to be "hot" for those few games, everybody has a bad day sometimes. it's just bad luck if your bad days come in the post season. i know, that's the way it was designed, they way it's supposed to be, a 7 game series to decide a champion, but to me, 14 straight division titles says more than a few world series titles. that shows for 14 years, the braves have maintained the best baseball team in the NL East, throughout the seasosns. through injuries, through ups and downs, through trades, through it all. no other sports team in history can say that they've had that many consecutive titles. best team in the NL East, one of the best teams in baseball. there always in the mix of things in the post season, and that's why they're my team.
