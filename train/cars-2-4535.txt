Well, i guess i have another COMPLIMENT for my truck. i raced the new SS Silverado with that big 6.0 last night and i gained half a car length on him. we stopped at the red light and he said that that was all it took for him to get rid of it. c'mon Chevy, all that money for something that will get whooped by a $20k truck???? THIS IS MY FIRST CHEVY--03 REG. CAB 5.3--AND I HAVE TO ADMIT IT HAS A TID BIT MORE PICKUP THAN THE TOYOTA TUNDRA BUT IT IS WAAAAY OVERPRICED. THE QUALITY SUCKS, IT SQEEKS LOUDLY AT EVERY TAKEOFF AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT LOUD ENOUGH FOR ME WOULD BE TO TAKE OFF THE CATS...I GUESS ONCE A TOYOTA MAN, ALWAYS A TOYOTA MAN!! TO ALL OF YOU DIE HARD AMERICAN MADE CHEVY FANS GO TEST DRIVE A TOYOTA TUNDRA WHICH IS ALSO AMERICAN MADE. IT WONT BE AS FAST BUT THE QUALITY AND DURABILITY, AND LOOKS AS WELL, WILL ALWAYS OUTPERFORM DODGE, CHEVY, AND FORD. FIND A WEBSITE THAT SHOWS THE CRASH TEST RESULTS BETWEEN A TUNDRA AND AN F150 OR 1500, YOU WILL BE AMAZED!!! FORD, DODGE, CHEVY, YOUR IN INTENSIVE CARE. TOYOTA, YOU MAY GET SOME STITCHES. I'VE HAD 3 OF THEM, 87 P/U 223K, 00 TUNDRA 89K, AND A 02 SUPERCHARGED 4RUNNER 34K. PS, THAT 4RUNNER WILL OUTRUN ANY MID-RANGE V-8'S. OHH, AND I'M ON MY WAY TO TRADE IN FOR AN 04 TUNDRA QUAD CAB.
