One word, Clutch. clutch, clutch, clutch, clutch, clutch. He was the final and most important piece in the building of the Yankees dynasty before they got spend happy. There is nothing he cant do in a single baseball game. He hits for average, he can hit for power. He plays great defense, not spectacular like Omar but can make every play you need a shortstop to make. He can steal bases when everybody knows he is stealing. He can score from first on doubles to the gaps. He never gets thrown out on the bases. He's got an unbelievable knack of always coming up with the the right play atthe right time. He's THE leader in the NEW YORK YANKEE clubhouse, and most importantly, he does it all in the most pressure-filled of situations, when the whole world is watching. They dont pay him 180 million to put up meaningless numbers in the regular season, dont get that confused. But when all the chips are down, DJ is usually the one walking off with the pot. Can you say that about anyone else in baseball??
