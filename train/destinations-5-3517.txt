Key West is one of the best places I have been to in my life. Locals were okay. I got the funniest waitress in my entire life when I went to a pizza place on Duval Street. I ordered a 14 inch 4 cheese pizza and as I was scarfing it down, (it was irresistable) the waitress kept looking at me and saying; "I can bet you a million dollars you are not going to finish that entire pizza!" But finish it I did and when she looked at the empty pizza platter in front of me, she said; "YOU DID NOT JUST FINISH THAT ENTIRE PIZZA BY YOURSELF!!!!!" I laughed with her and said; "Oh yes i did!" and then left. The next day, I rented a bicycle and took a cruise through Key West. And do not let other people try to tell you that there are "no beaches" in Key West, for right off the south end of Reynolds Street, I came across the most beautiful and wonderful beach I have ever seen. Although the water was a bit murky, the beach itself was great. Beautiful painted gazebos and shower facilities, coconut palms growing right out of the sand in the middle of the beach.
