I bought a 2003 base model last summer. I have owned many bikes in my life but this one has to be the king of the road. I am 6'2 tall with a 30 inseam and weigh 300lbs and it is still a big bike to me. Handles like a dream. This bike has plenty of power and I rarely have to downshift from 5th gear even going up country hills at speeds as low as 25 MPH. It just pulls right back up to cruising speed. It has increadible torque. The only thing I would suggest is to think of buying a used interstate if you plan to do any touring because all of the hard bags and extra's that come on the interstate have cost me a fortune putting on piece by piece. Also, hidden feature with the interstate is that you have over a gallon larger capacity fuel tank. Since the bike gets about 33 MPG it is nice to have more than a 5.1 gallon tank. Would only trade or sell it off if they come out with an 1800 Valkyrie (not the Rune). One that can carry passengers. Heck, lets go for an 8 cylinder Valk. I am ready!
