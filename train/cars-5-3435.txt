I just pruchased the 2001 Rav4 Limited edition. I love it. It is very practical. I take the seats out and my 100 pound dog lots of room. The back seats are roomy and fully adjustable. They recline! My husband (6'3 ) can comfortably seat in the back. That's a first. The controls are placed in good locations. Cup holders are adjustable, water bottle and extra large soda cups don't spill. Lots of storage compartments. I test drove the CRV, nice but rear seats don't come out. I have driven an Explorer and Blazer on road trips. They drive like trucks, big and heavy. The Rav4 drives like a car. Overall, I am very pleased with the 2001 Rav4.
