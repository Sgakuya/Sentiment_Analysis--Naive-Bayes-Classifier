I recall the Movie Critic in the Philly Inquirer made Warriors the worst movie of 1976 (I think that was the year). He objected to a movie that glorified gang violence (especially in Philly, where dozens of inner-city youth would die each year from gang-related violence). But as a movie, it was decent entertainment for purient teens (which I be's at the time). The movie tells the story of a relatively harmless gang from Coney Island getting framed for shooting the Capo of a major NYC gang. With every gang after their head, they are in a classic struggle of survival to get back to Coney Island alive. However, as Hollywood luck would have it, the gangs they do come across would not even instill fear into a group of Junior Leaguers off to the debutante's ball. I mean would you be fearful of a bunch of gay-looking dudes wearing roller skates, or a band of skinny dudes all wearing bib overalls? [Maybe they should have had the 2 gay Puerto Rican Street Toughs featured in the Seinfeld Soup Nazi episode] Anywho, the Warriors kick butt and even grab a few gang skanks (trophies, I guess) and make it unscathed all the way back to Coney Island. In the cliffhanger, the Warriors, on their home turf, meet the actual gang that shot the head gangbanger. They want to kill the Warriors so that they can beat the rap. Go see the movie to see how it ends. The Warriors featured one great catch phrase, Warriors! Come out and play!!! (Bang 2 bottles together each time you say it, just like the movie). Warriors is one of those movies that is probably on every dude's all-time Top-100 guy movies.
