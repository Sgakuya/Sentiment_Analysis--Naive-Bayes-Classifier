Cool place. My sister's best friend lives in London, Kentucky and I stayed there for a month in the summer of last year. It was off the hook. The laid-back atmosphere, good food, mild climate. I ended up hooking up with a random girl here too (don't tell my girlfriend back home). The girls here are some of the nicest in the world. Out of all the places I visited, this was definitely one of the nicest. I like the Bluegrass Mountains when you drive down the 75 freeway. Cincinatti is right on the border when you cross the bridge. Lexington is a booming city that's nice and chill. The air here smells so fresh and people love to have a good time. Definitely a great place -- much love.
