Bob Kerrey would make a great President and is in my opinion the best Democrat for defeating Pres. Bush in 2004. Many here forgot to mention that he does have experience as an executive when he served as governor of Nebraska (in addition to his two terms in the Senate). Mr. Kerrey now is on the board of the Concord Coalition, a group that works to solve the problems facing Social Security and health care in our country. Serving as president of the New School University is hardly something to knock or belittle; it has given Mr. Kerrey the opportunity in the last few years to take a step back and look at U.S. public policy in many different areas. Such intellectual curiosity can't be found in our current president. As far as allegations of war crimes in Vietnam, his unit is being accused by one rogue member (selling a book mind you) and supported by two Viet Cong villagers who were there. Who do you believe? The SEALs were sent there to do a job, not intentionally shoot women and children. This wasn't My Lai and people shouldn't confuse innocents caught in a combat zone with war crimes. Calling somebody a babykiller when they don't know for sure is extreme and careless. In addition, unless somebody has hard evidence of Mr. Kerrey running his businesses in an intentionally illegal manner, they shouldn't sling mud on a great American who has spent a good part of his life serving this country.
