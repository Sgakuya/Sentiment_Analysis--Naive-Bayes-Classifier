Chris Cornell - It seems people either hate or love his music with very little ground between. I guess it simply comes down to finding an artist/songwriter that you relate to, and artist who's song seem to be directed toward you whenever you give there cd a spin. For me...That artist is 'Chris Cornell' from his 'Soundgarden' days to the single that still remains my favorite song 'Sunshower' to his latest solo release...his lyrics and voice condtinually find a way to get under my skin and into my soul- he is- simply put..the most underrated songwriter of all time, love him or hate him this remanes a simple truth.
