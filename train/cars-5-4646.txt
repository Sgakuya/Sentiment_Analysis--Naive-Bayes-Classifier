If I knew nothing else about this truck then the times I have seen it at accident scenes (I'm a firefighter) that would be enough to give it 5 stars. The first time I ever saw the F-150 crash it was versus a LeBarron. I came around the truck and saw a crumpled fender on the F-150 and figured it was just minor wreck. Nope. The F-150 had ripped the front end mostly off the car. Needless to say I was impressed with the F-150 and it has preformed in a simlar manner everytime I have seen it crash. I'm a car guy but after having seen the new design to the truck and seeing it at accidents, I'm ready to go for a test drive.
