I find bush to be exactly what this country needed, after clinton. He might not be the smartest person we've ever had in office, but he has a lot of guts, and I am sorry if you don't agree but I think we needed someone with some guts. For all you dissing him because he went into an illegal war, I guess the majority of you are from other countries, and I am sorry you think so, but in my eyes, I see all other countries as hypocrites, they just can't wait to get all the hand-outs from america, where the streets are paved with gold, but god forbid we ever ask for any help in return. The UN is B.S. because nobody cares for the usa, only because we're the top dog. It's human to hate those on top but you know what, it's sickening when the things said are totally unfair. EDIT: hey guess what, with clinton's fiscal management, Americans were so expensive to hire that our businesses were going to other countries!
