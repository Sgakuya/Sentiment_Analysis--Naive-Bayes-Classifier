after opening a small business acount with amsouth I learned some valuable information related to there banking policies. This is what happened. I deposited money in the morning, that same day we purchased items for our business at three different stores. When checking my balance two days later I noticed two overdraft fees had occured charging me $60.00. I could not understand how this could happen since I had deposited a large amount that morning. After talking to a amsouth bank clerk I was informed of their banking policies. After two pm all debits to your account are withdrawn first, then at 12 midnight all your deposits go in. Confused with his answer I gave him a senario. If I have a 1,000.00 balance, I deposit 5,000.00 at 9 am. The same day after the deposit I purchase 800.00, 500.00, 100.00 items at three different places. I will be charged 60.00 for 2 overdraft items because debits go in after 2pm and the 5,000.00 deposited before the purchases go in at 12 midnight,(which is really the following day)? He replied, yes that is correct. I informed him that this was poor banking policies and closed my account immediately and opened another where they could not believe how amsouth legaly could have such a policy.
