Brainless no-talent who appeals to a brainless audience. He sucked way back when in Moonlighting, and it was a major insult to popular culture and public taste to allow this twerp to go on. It's laughable that someone who appears to be so out of shape physically, so physically unimposing is made into a Hollywood action hero. Total suspension of disbelief. Hell, there's dozens of current actresses out there who could kick this wimp's ass. I've seen a few of his shoot-em-ups and they were the most juvenile, cartoonish crap ever committed to film. In Country was supposed to be his break-through dramatic role, but his performance was truly weak. He was so unconvincing in Pulp Fiction that I thought the casting director had to be on crack when the decision was made to give Willis the role. People think this guy is a versatile actor and I agree: he's lame in every type of role he chooses. Boy, the taste and discernment of the American viewing public has really gone down the toilet for sure if a talentless hack like this can get roles in movies people actually pay money to see. Amazing.
