With such an intense aura and a commanding screen presence, there's no denying that Kevin Spacey is a great actor. He has amazing depth and range. Spacey is probably best known for his role as Lester Burnham in American Beauty. Spacey's performance as the suburban husband whose life is miserable was absolutely priceless, and it was Spacey's commanding screen presence that created the aura of the film. Equally riveting was Spacey's moving performance as scarred middle school teacher Eugene Simonet in Pay it Forward. Spacey did an excellent job in communicating his character's physical, as well as emotional scars to the audience. A perfect example of Kevin Spacey's awesome screen presence is his performance in the 1997 thriller, Seven, in which he plays a psychotic killer who plays a unique cat and mouse game with two detectives (Freeman and Pitt). Although Spacey only appeared in the last half hour of the film, it was his brief, but chilling performance that stole the show. Other decent performances include a comedic role in The Ref and the role of the heroic cop in The Negotiator. Kevin Spacey's career has already been an illustrious one, and it is clearly far from over. I have confidence that he will be remembered as one of the true greats out of time.
