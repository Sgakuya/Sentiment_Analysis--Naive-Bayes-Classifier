I would like to remind all of the Goreons that evil corporate America doesn't exactly discriminate against political parties.

Where do you and others get off with all the evil about corporate America in particular. Why don't you take a look at what's going on in corporate Romania,China, or Russia? There ain't much to chat about is there? Is it our fault capitalism has been successful? The very internet and website we're using here is the result of the 'evil' stuff you're talking about.
