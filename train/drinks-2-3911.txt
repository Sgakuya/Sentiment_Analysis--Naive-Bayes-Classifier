These killed more brain cells during the heyday of the WWII Generation than constant exposure to Lawrence Welk. Keep in mind, however, that The Greatest Generation wasn't too swift to begin with. As a child, I remember those ex-GIs swilling these cut to the chase self-medications with great ardor, punctuating the glug-glug with copious puffs on their Chesterfields, Lucky Stikes, Pall Malls, Camels, Viceroys, etc. I also remember these guys getting drunk off their asses really quickly and thoroughly in this manner, and many a time I saw grown men puking on themselves because they underestimated the Soldier with a Sidecar. So, beware!!!
