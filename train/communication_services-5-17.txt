I have been really impressed with their service. I started with the local with free long distance. Yeah, they advertise 49.95 and you have to add the taxes, but who doesn't. I tried the internet access with good success. I haven't had any service interuptions or complications. No one has called me during dinner to see if I am interested in the next great plan. Apparently you don't have to request the lower rates when they are available, Excel just posts it across the board. I used AT T in the past and would have to hound them to give me, a long time customer at that point, the same rates as people just signing up. I had the same experience with the Bells. And the comment with reference to MCI - I have never actually met anyone that was happy with MCI. Excel is the best I have used so far.....by far. Incidently, I think the unlimited long distance is just that, unlimited. If your usage exceeds 3000 minutes a month then they want to be sure that it is still just private usage, and not business. But if you are on the phone every minute of the day and you can show them how it is personal use, they don't care.
