Go BUSH!!! A couple of months ago my local newspaper had a story on the run down on the presidential candidates. To make a long story short, it asked: Would you rather have a president that flew fighter planes during Vietnam or a president who wrote about it? . I strongly believe Bush has what it takes to be the type of President we need. It really upset me when Gore tried to sling mud about Bush's DUI. The man flew fighter planes during Vietnam for crying outloud. He is human! As a military dependent, and living in a military community for a very long time, issues concerning todays military also hit close to home. What did Clinton do? He closed numerous military bases and that in return did away with alot of jobs. Bush is a strong supporter for military operations and I believe that he has what is takes with his military service. As for the Debates, Gore seemed to be uptight and all he wanted to do was contradict every thing Bush said or what he plans to do as President. The man is a jerk, he has a temper. Please don't put this man in a position to control our country. Bush is a survivor. Give him the support he deserves. I do...
