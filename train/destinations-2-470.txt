Between the bridges, there is heaven and hell. Heaven is Paradise Island. Hell is NASSAU! Let's just say it's not the safest place for a tourist who is alone or has no clue where to go around the island. It's almost another New York City except with small buidlings. Traffic is always bad. Do not attept to drive on the roads or cross them yourself. Take the taxi (and even that is major expensive). Crime is rampid everyday (from petty theft, to drug rings, to massive murders). The cops only carry batons with them. So, even they cannot protect themselves....let alone the citizens and tourists. Never wear anything expensive there as well (clothes, shoes, jewelry, etc.) unless you want to get mugged or killed.....seriously. Everything in the shops is expensive too. Whatever you would pay for anything at any type of store, multiply that number times three. There's also a lot of diseases you can catch at the docks from stray dogs, small creatures, and garbage. Do yourself a favor and stay on Paradise Island.
