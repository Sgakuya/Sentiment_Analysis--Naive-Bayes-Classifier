Belgium is almost a great country (by my standards), but falls just a bit shy of great itself. My comments are based on numerous visits to Belgium during the 1974-2000 timeframe. Brussels is for the most part lackluster, except for the Grand Place and the area close to it. The Belgian countryside can be beautiful (I liked Brabant a lot), but in my experience, you have to hope for a clear day. Too much of the time I spent in Belgium seemed drab and dreary due to the weather. I am a history buff, so I really enjoyed touring the Ardennes area and the places connected with the Battle of the Bulge. Stopped overnight in one town, La Roche en Ardenne, that was really a jewel. Belgian food is OK, but nothing spectacular. If you're a beer drinker, there are some excellent (and unusual) beers. The people themselves I found to be friendly enough, for the most part; most I dealt with spoke decent English. Prices tend to be a bit high. Hotels and pensions I stayed at were all good, with good service. The most memorable hotel I stayed at was right on the Grand Place - what a fantastic place the Place is at night! Belgian drivers seemed to be pretty sane to me. Overall, a pleasant place to visit; if there were a four and a half rating, I'd give it to Belgium.
