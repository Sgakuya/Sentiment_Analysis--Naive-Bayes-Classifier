Surprisingly good movie. It's one of those movies that over-40ish men can relate to. There were 2 or 3 scenes that were outrageously hilarious -- all involving a girl named Cammie (Talk about a Desperate Housewife). Well-acted by the 4 stars. Paul Giamatti is totally adept with his totally deadpan routine (just like American Splendor). He plays the role of the Schlamaziel quite well. I was already a big fan of Sandra Oh from her days on Arliss. It's a good looking movie with beautiful scenes of Southern California. You can't help not to crave wine as you watch this movie. Fortunately, we had some 3-month old plum wine in the fridge. I give it my stone-cold lead-pipe Go Rent It recommendation.
