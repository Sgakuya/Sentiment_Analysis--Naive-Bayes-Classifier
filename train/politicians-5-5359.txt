Vote swapping. If you are a progressive voter (whether for Gore or Nader) worried about Nader taking votes away from Gore but still would like to see Nader get his 5% of the votes, here's a creative solution to your dilemma. It's called vote swapping and it's legal. The idea is that a Gore voter in a Bush safe state, such as Texas, gets together with a Nader voter in a swing state, such as Wisconsin. The Gore voter agrees to vote for Nader (it won't hurt Gore a bit) and the Nader voter agrees to vote for Gore (it won't hurt Nader a bit). The end result is that progressives work together to defeat Bush. For more details, see these sites: http://www.nadertrader.org/ and http://www.voteswap2000.com/ The best site for Texans to trade votes is http://Winchell.com/NaderTrader/ Gore needs electoral votes to win. Nader needs popular votes to get his 5%. Bush will almost certainly carry Texas. If you live in Texas and support Gore, you may help Gore more by swapping votes with a Nader supporter in a swing state. Nader gets a popular vote, and Gore gets a vote in a swing state. In this scenario, everyone wins and progressives don't have to kill each other. Cooperation, that's the American way!
