 The Silver Palate Cookbook, which comes from the well-known New York City gourmet food shop, is filled with great recipes for guests, including menus and lots of helpful tips. Many of the recipes are seasonal and call for fresh produce, although I must say that they are not light and healthy in general! This is not a cookbook for daily use or for people who are vigilant about counting grams of fat. The Silver Palate Cookbook is definitely designed for people who entertain. I've tried several of the cookbook's cookie/dessert recipes (the glazed lemon cake and the oatmeal cookies, for example), and they were out of this world. There are some spectacular appetizer and salad recipes, too. If you like to prepare gourmet food for guests, this cookbook would be a good resource.
