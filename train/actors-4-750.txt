No, Jed Clampett is not a classic film actor, but I think an argument for Buddy Ebsen can be made. Buddy's career goes way, WAY back before The Beverly Hillbillies. He was originally a dancer and made his film debut in Broadway Melody of 1936. He was also in Born to Dance, Captain January, and The Girl of the Golden West, all in the 1930s. Buddy was originally cast as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, which may very well have changed the rest of his career, but had to be rushed to the hospital after his lungs seized in an allergic reaction to the make up he had to wear. After that, he was held to only minor parts in westerns until he started getting work on TV. Maybe not a legend, but his early work alone deserves at least three stars.
