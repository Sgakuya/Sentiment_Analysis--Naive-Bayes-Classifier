Worst experience ever!! I didn't think it was possible for anyone to damage all of my belongings....BUT THEY DID. When I finally received the items which were a month late the driver said they couldn't find someone who would take the load because it was packed so poorly by Kings. I had full replacement cost and they fought me on every item and not once did they give me full replacement. They said they could fix everything so I gave them an opportunity to repair it and the man showed up with a box of different colored wood filler pens. Nightmare of a company to deal with and they don't honor the replacement agreement. Turst me don't let the big name fool you and stay clear!
