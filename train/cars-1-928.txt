What vehicle is more boring than the Accord? I can't think of any at the time (except for maybe the Civic, another Honda). Granted, they are well engineered and built to last, but really, who wants to drive the automotive form of a sleeping pill for 200k miles? There is nothing unique about the Accord, hell they are even modified in the same way (clear lights, huge mufflers, hiper-white signals, etc). Also, they are not even all that well built, either. A ride in one reveals a cheap, tinny quality about the car (the way the doors close, the ride quality, the seat material, etc.) that does not endear itself too well, either. Let's also not forget about the troubles with their automatic trannys of late, which even appear in the overpriced Acura line. I would go into styling, but that would take up excessive bandwidth, so I'll stop here.
