I love State Farm. As a new immigrant two years ago I needed car insurance but I didn't have a US driving record/insurance history, even though I had a clean record from my home country. I signed up with Progressive after finding that Prog was cheaper than Geico - I just assumed I was screwed and would have to pay thousands of dollars a year until I had a US record. Then... someone recommended State Farm. I called them and they quoted me a price more than half the cost of Progressive. It was very easy to sign up and they were very, very nice. Gave me a road map too :) Also, when I needed renter's insurance, they signed me up and gave me a discount for having two forms of insurance with them, which effectively made the renter's insurance free. Wonderful. I felt so stupid for ever giving rude, rude, obnoxious Progressive a single cent - let me just say I had a bad time when I called to cancel with them.
