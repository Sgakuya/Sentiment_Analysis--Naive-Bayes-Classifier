Grew up rooting for them. The park is really nice, though people in 1912 must have all been the size of hobbits: I'm not a particularly large fellow, yet I get cramped in the seats, though it's one of the best places to catch a game. It's getting too expensive, and the real fans are getting nudged out by yuppies and cellphone toting brats who don't know what the hell is going on. At this writing, what they'll look like next year remains very unclear, and I have to admit that it's different since their Series win: they're not in a league financially with the Yankees ( no one truly is) yet unfortunately they're inching towards them and away from the Cubs, Cardinals, and other clubs of their ilk: as far as having diehard fans who don't need nothing less than a Series championship to feel good about being a fan. Are accruing a fair amount of fairweather bandwagon fans like the Yankees, Lakers, etc. This is distressing.
