Will be judged by historians to have been a good president. Although the idiots now running the country resumed the lunacy of supply-side economics, Clinton and his advisors (particularly Bob Rubin, his treasury secretary), prescribed the cure, administered it, the nation prospered. In 1993, every single supply-side moron predicted that Clinton's tax increases would sink the economy - instead the nation began its longest expansion in history. This was coupled with spending restraint (only 18% over 8 years, while the economy grew 34% - in constant dollars). When compared with outrages of the Iran-Contra scandal or many of the Dubya's execrable reign, the sex scandal that marred Clinton's presidency was very small potatoes.
