Harvest Moon 64 is probably one of the best game's in N64! It's a story about a boy, Jack (you) who is taking his grandpa's place as a farmer on a farm, you can take care of the shipping, crops, and buy animals, add extentions, get married, woo the girl of your dreams, hurt your animals, go to the festivals, annoy the girls, keep beating the game! O, and if you beat the game, you can keep playing!! I admire this gamem and I hope you do! You also start with the girls heart gauges, indifferent, friends, flirturious, warming up, deeply in love. You can go to the square for festivals, except horse and sheep contests, theres dogs, and cows too! The horse and dog are in the square. Talk to the goddess. Give gifts to your girl, have a baby! Make friends with townfolks! Goodluck! P.S. Buy as soon as you can! Or else when you go to Fam. Video it usually isn't in.
