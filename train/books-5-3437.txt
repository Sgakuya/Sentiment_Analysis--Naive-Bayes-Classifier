All you dumb housewives who have nothing better to do than to bash someone who is SUCCESSFUL at something in his life (unlike your failed lives of sitting at home, watching Oprah all day, and going to Wal-mart to stock up on Cheetoes and Cupcakes) and is actually CREATIVE and INTELLIGENT enough to create such a huge following of people who are in on the joke . I laugh at you who actually take people like Howard seriously, as if he's a molesting priest or our dumb blood thirsty president trying to send our kids to Iraq so he can pad the wallets of his oil executive best friends. You're the same idiots who voted for him and who turn a blind eye to child abusing priests and ministers.
