This classic tale is about an unhappily married woman who is bored with her kind but dull country doctor/husband. She wants more excitement in her life like attending grand parties, indulging in stimulating conversation, and the romance that she dreamt about while secretly reading romance books while growing up in a convent. She takes on lovers to fill the void she needs in her life. Shocking stuff back in his day. Poor Flaubert! He was actually thrown in prison because the officials thought the story was obscene! Flaubert gets into her deepest feelings. While reading this book I had to remind myself that a man wrote these words. How could be possibly know what a woman feels buried inside her soul? I have tried my best to get others to read this story but so far have failed. This is one of the the finest pieces of literature ever written.
