ME AND MY HUSBAND BOUGHT A RING GAURD FROM WHITEHALL JEWELERS IN PHOENIX AND WERE VERY IMPRESSED WE TRADED IN A RING GAURD THAT WAS BOUGHT AT LEAST 20 YEARS BEFORE FOM ZALES AND THEY LET ME TRADE IT IN NO QUESTIONS ASKED FOR A $300.00 DISCOUNT ON MY NEW RING GAURD. ANYWAYS I BOUGHT MY NEW RING GAURD IN 2000 AND HERE IT IS 2003 AND I HAVE ONLY HAD ONE REPAIR TO MY RING. I LIVE 150 MILES FROM THE NEAREST WHITEHALL STORE NOW SO WHEN I NEED MY RING INSPECTED OR FIXED I TAKE IT TO ZALES PAY TO HAVE THE REPAIR AND MAIL IN MY RECIEPTS TO GET REIMBURSED FROM WHITEHALL THEY ARE ALWAYS POLITE AND PROMPT AT SENDING ME MY REIMBURSEMENT. IF I WAS EVER CLOSE ENOUGH TO ANOTHER WHITEHALL I WOULD DEFINATLEY BUY MORE JEWELERY FROM THEM.
