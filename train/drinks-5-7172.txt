In the world of vodka, Grey Goose stands at the top. It has the clarity, body, head, finish, and taste of a truly superb-crafted vodka. I have worked as a bartender of an Ohio Country Club for the past 17 years, and I have experienced, sold, and sampled just about every brand I can think of. In all this time I have never come across anything more perfected than Grey Goose. Now, let me admit, all the cheaper brand, Absolut, Skyy, and Stoli's are all quite good also, however, they can't match Grey Goose's super-premium status. I am tired of all those who pan Grey Goose as a , fake, pricey, over-rated piece of rubbish. It simply is not. Furthermore, for all those who claim that a good vodka is supposed to taste like water, you're simply ignorant. Let me give a lesson- A good vodka should have, fist of all, exceptional clarity. In a glass is should not be discernable from water by a glance. When tasted, the Vodka should hit the palate and release a distinct flavor based on it's creation process. Grey Goose does this, and it does it well. The Goose releases a firm, not heavy, taste of citrus and charcoal that leaves only a slight distinction upon the taster. It is not overwhelming. Second, when swallowed, the vodka should warm the throat, but not have too much of a biting heat. Grey Goose also does thuis superbly. It has only the slightest heat, which of course is from the alcohol. Last, the finish of the vodka should respresent a different taste from the initial presentation to the palate. Grey Goose leaves a slight, minty flavor in the mouth, which compliments it's heat nicely. So there you go. Grey Goose is a winner, and rightly so. To all those who question it's status as the top marked vodka in the San Diego World Spirits Championship, give it a try. The Goose will not let down and serious vodka lover who is looking for the best, and is willing to take the time to find it.
