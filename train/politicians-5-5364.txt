What do we need in a president? We need someone who is intelligent, experienced, a good speaker, and, most importantly, someone who cares about humanity. Al Gore has all these qualities. Gore's intelligence shines through his policies and priorities. Campaign Finance Reform, Education, Social Security and Prescription Drug Plans are all important in this election and Gore has a direct plan for all of these. Gore has the experience necessary to head the most powerful counrty in the world. He was a senator and most importantly, a vice president. He knows the issues and he knows them well. From the debates the nation saw Gores excellent speaking ability. Granted he was over-eager in the first debate, but his responses were always coherent, intelligent and persuasive. Finally Gore cares about humanity. This can be seen through his work on the environment and on school funding. Gore wants to raise school standards without bankrupting schools and he wants to make it easier for middle class students to attend the universities they deserve to attend by making money less of an wall and more of a hurdle. This compassion about humanity also shines through his work on keeping social security and introducing a prescription drug plan. He has the ability, he has the experience, he has the plan. Please vote responsibly on Nov. 7th. Vote Gore/Lieberman.
