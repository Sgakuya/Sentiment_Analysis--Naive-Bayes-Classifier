Ya know, these chains are a little hard to rate since you can have a vastly different experience depending on where you are at the time. Say you're on a long car trip and you stop at Hardees for breakfast. Nice and clean, biscuit sandwich is very good, nice cup of coffee, etc.. One hundred miles down the road you may stop for a coke and bathroom break and the place makes you gag so bad you wouldn t even want to buy bottled water. The same could be said for all the franchises. That said, I have never had any worse an experience at Hardees than anywhere else. For the most part, the food has been fairly good. They were the first to have the sausage and egg biscuit and I still think they do it best - unless, of course, you hit a bad link in the chain.
