This school challenges you where it matters and makes the rest of your experience a happy and wholesome one. Unlike other business schools, my classmates didn't just disappear after classes or show up to group meetings at the last minute. Having a warm, welcoming, and enormous common area certainly helped. The staff were also extremely attentive; they even provided apples, muffins, and orange juice during exam periods! My only gripe would be that the courses offered were not very diverse - there is a focus on finance; but students have the option to cross register at other Boston institutions. Overall, a good school with a paradigm for business education that other schools could learn from.
