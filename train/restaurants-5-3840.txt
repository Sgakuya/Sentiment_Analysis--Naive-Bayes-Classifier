Alright now, this is for every single solitary one of you that posted a negative comment. YOUR ALL SELFISH BASTARDS! If you really care that little about your kids to absolutely detest a place that brings them happyness you should all be ashamed. OK, sure the little animatronic crap is annoying ya? BUT. Your kids will find it amazing how they got the stuffed animals to move like that. Ya the pizza is crap, but the kids dont care! Ya there is noise, but thats what happens when you have a bunch of kids together! Alright?! This place is not here to make you happy god damnit so stop acting like the world revolves around you, get a grip on life. This place is -not- for you old idiots who cant understand the difference between a childs playground and life. On a playground, the kids rules apply. A kid doesnt want you jumping around climbing on the playground equipment and such, and your not expected to do that. So why in gods name are you expecting and kids restraunt to bring happyness to someone who obviously MURDERED their own inner child with a damned steak knife.
