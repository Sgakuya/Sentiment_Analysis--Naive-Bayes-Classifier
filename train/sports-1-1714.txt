I'm originally from CT, so I was born and raised a Yankees fan. Everybody knows that Massachusetts is the most inebriated state in the nation, how else can one like Massachusetts teams? The fact that the Red Sux haven't won since 1918 and hence have an 86 year tradtion of losing, yet the dumb Masswipes still root for them prove how bombed they really are. How can you be a fan of a team that has the biggest Prima Donna's in the game, Pedro and Manny? Pedro should have been arrested for throwing an old out of shape man like Don Zimmer to the ground, absolutely no excuse, as well intentionally throwing at Karim Garcia's head. The fact that A-Rod didn't go there and signed with the Yankees is absolute proof that NOBODY want to go to the Red Sux. The Red Sux are a classless group of thugs. Who cares if the Red Sux beat the Yankees in the season series so far, the last laugh will be at the end of the season when the Red Sux continue their losing tradition! The Yankees will be celebrating, and the Red Sux will be crying, just like their fans.
