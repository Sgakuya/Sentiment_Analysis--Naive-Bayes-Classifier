Jean Chretien is the best Prime Minister of Canada ever, perhaps only surpassed by the great Elliot Trudeau. He is my personal favourite because he jokes around a bit, which makes him seem like a real person people can relate to. He should not be judged by his mispronounciation of English because it is his second language and he has a disability concerning his mouth. I wish he could stay in office forever, however if an Alliance member like Stockwell Day were to be elected, he might never leave *shudder*. I believe that is why the law exists. Overall, Jean Chretien has done a great job as Prime Minister of Canada, and I would vote for him anytime.
