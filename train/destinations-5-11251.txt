Oahu is the most populated of the Hawaiian islands. It is known as the 'Gathering Place' and has Waikiki, the tourist spot, and Honolulu, the capital. There are many hotels of all different kinds, some horrible and some five star. The beaches are beautiful and the weather is nice most of the time. But, beware of the ocean, many tourist have been hurt because Hawaii's beaches are more dangerous than California's, since Hawaii is not on a continental shelf. So be sure to check with a life guard before going into the water. Hawaii is very expensive and accommodations are small, but all the conveniences of the Mainland can be found there. Wacky weed smokers should beware that street sellers pass off fake stuff, not that I condon that type of bad habit. There are many fun night clubs that stay open till four. The number of beautiful half naked women is mind blowing. But sex on the beach is illegal, found out the hard way. Oahu has all branches of the military, as well as, many interesting sites to see. I give it a thumbs up for those who have cash to spare. It's a truly beautiful place.
