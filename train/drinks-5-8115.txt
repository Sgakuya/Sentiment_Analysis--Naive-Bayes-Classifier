The smoothest whisky I've ever tried - it tastes good either straight or in numerous savory cocktail combinations...a few I'll submit: Seagrams's 7 & 7-Up w/lime, 7 with Canada Dry Ginger Ale w/lime, and surprisingly the best IMO, 7 & DIET COKE w/lime. Although Jack Daniels & Southern Comfort are good as well, Seagram's is a more sophisticated taste to my palate and I always keep a bootle on hand for company. In fact my relatives from Brazil like it so much that whenever I go there I bring with me a 2 liter of Seagram's to give them as they aren't able to purchase it there. Great stuff, to be taken in moderation!
