I read this book earlier this summer and was fascinated by Robert Caro's portrait of Lyndon Johnson as a senator from Texas. In less than eight years, Johnson worked his way from freshman senator to senate minority whip to senate minority leader (which became Senate Majority Leader when his party became the majority party) and Johnson brought the Senate to life. Along the way, Caro augments his description with portraits of Georgia senator Richard Russell, Minnesota senator Hubert Humphrey, Senator Johnson's heart attack in 1955, the Johnson ranch, the Johnson family, the 1956 convention the Johnson office, the passage of a civil rights bill in 1957, and the Senate itself, which had become an institution of unimportance when Johnson arrived in 1949. Caro researches and writes with his usual thoroughness. If you like the in-depth research of a James Michener, the storytelling talent of an Edmund Morris or a Stephen Ambrose, you'll love this work, along with Caro's earlier volumes in the series--THE PATH TO POWER and MEANS OF ASCENT (although that seems to a little vindictive by itself). And don't miss Caro's earlier biography of New York's public works czar Robert Moses, THE POWER BROKER--a classic by itself.
