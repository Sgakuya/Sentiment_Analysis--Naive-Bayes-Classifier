Out of general principle I refuse to pay five dollars for a small ice cream. There is something seriously wrong when a family of five needs to spend $35-$40 dollars to treat his/her family to ice cream. That would be 1 large, 2 mediums and 2 smalls. It has nothing to do with whether or not one can afford it. I would rather seek out an independent shop that is just as good and half the price. Not to mention I feel better about patronizing a mom and pop shop then a corporate ice cream shop even if the Cold Stone location is a franchise. I would not wish misfortune on anyone but I feel that Cold Stone is a bit of a fad and the people who spent 250k to 450k to open these will realize that all they did was lock in 60-70 hour work weeks for about 75k after franchise fees and expenses. By the way, they also have no benefits.
