Soul Calibur has got to be one of the best fighting games out there. The graphics are great, with realistic movements. The moves of the characters are done true to the technique they practice, from the samuri swordwork of Mitsurugi and Yoshimitsu to the incredible staff techniques of Kilik and Seung Mina. And when you earn the hidden characters Edgemaster and Inferno, who have random moves, you must learn to adapt to each fighter's techniques. The mission battles add longer playability, and the variety of gameplay options make this one heck of a game. Also, most of the female characters weren't the sex objects that other females of other fighting games tend to be. And this game had a storyline to go with it. All in all, this is one of my favorite games to date.
