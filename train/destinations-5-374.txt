Alberta has one of the lowest levels of taxation in Canada, one of the highest rates of employment and economic growth and has demonstrated through fiscal restraint the ability to pay down provincial debt, while at the same time supporting much of the rest of the country with billions of dollars in equalization payments. Yet, Alberta learned its lesson with Trudeau's rapacious National Energy Policy and protects its resource revenues from being squandered too hastily on left-wing boon-doggles concocted by federal politicians constantly embroiled in scandal. Alberta has taken steps to resolve the Canadian democratic deficit, having conducted elections for still vacant federal senate seats as yet not filled with the inevitable patronage appointees who'll likely revile the politics of the citizens they represent. Alberta has not stopped, nor even slowed, the flow of support to other provinces; despite the constant criticism of its right-wing footing; despite startlingly disparate Kyoto accord requirements foisted on Alberta's resource sector relative to the eastern manufacturing sector; despite biased villification and conjecture towards western politicians in the media. Alberta is a place to get ahead in the world - with a culture of success ingrained into the fabric of its people simply, because most citizens don't want the government coddling them. TO THE RISING NUMBER OF SOCIALIST-LEFT-WING-THINKERS IN THE WORLD. Mark the rising levels of morbidity, mortality and the incidence of sub-standard intelligence levels in the so-called 'advanced' socialist nations of the world. Note the apathy, the examples of human rights abuses, the corruption made possible only with the prominance of government... the aristocracy and undeserving elite of the modern world! So revile Alberta; scorn Albertans with ignorant and unfounded utterances; apply such fallacious ad hominem attacks as to deny the existance of logic itself!
