This is a movie I liked less and less the more I thought about it. I did get caught up in it whiile watching it. Not as good as I had heard, but effective. Walking to the car afterward, however, something was bothering me. On the Twenty minute drive home I started to have more and more trouble with it. By the time I pulled up in front of the house I had decided I really didn't like Life is Beautiful. It's a manipulative movie. And, yes of course, all movies are manipulative, but this was almost shamelessly so. The central message, that the human spirit can soar even in the midst of unspeakable horror, is powerful one. But living with that horror, it's daily fear and degradation and it's victims response to it, must be rendered with brutal honesty in order for that message to be effective. The fanciful, slightly fantastic, light tone this movie took rendered the argument ineffective. There was just too much that pushed plausability (i.e.little boys do not get on loud speakers in Nazi concentration camps and live to talk about it). Then in the thick of all this lightheartedness an emotionally packed image like the hundreds of stacked corpses is inserted to give the movie gravitas. Images like that must be earned by a film and Life is Beautiful, quite frankly, didn't earn it. To exploit its power by simply sticking it in between scenes of Roberto Bernigni's silly clown routine, is the crassest of manipulations. It verges on insult to the very memory it attempts to invoke.
