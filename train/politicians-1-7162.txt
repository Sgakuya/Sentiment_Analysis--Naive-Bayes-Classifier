I know that the Rev. Jesse Jackson seems to do some good things with regards to the country etc......however.....the thing that I can not understand here is, I know that he is funded and backed by church organizations etc....but WHY should the Rev. Jesse Jackson be tax exempt ? and be so secretive with regards to making public his financial books and such? I follow along closely with an investigative reporter Bill O'Reilly, and he has invited the Rev. Jackson to be on his show numerous times, but the Rev. Jackson declines each time he is invited....kind of makes me wonder that someone with the Rev. Jacksons (honorable???) reputation would be so adamat with regards to being a guest on such a show..Could it be that he is afraid of having certain portions of his life exposed??? And some of his acquaintances brought to the public eye????? I for one, think there is more to the Rev. Jackson than has been revealed to the public.....think about it..
