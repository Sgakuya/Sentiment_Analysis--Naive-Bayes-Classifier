I am close to age to Drew too. I loved her in ET. When I was in my early teens, I tried to rebel (a pathetic attempt, but I tried), and I read 'Lost Girl', the biography by Drew. It was very fascinating at the time to read about all her experiences and what her life had been like, yet she was only 15 years old. Through the years she has turned into a (what seems to be) a down to earth kind of girl. This weekend I was reading the latest Marie Claire December issue with Drew, Cameron, and Lucy on the cover. It again confirmed how much I like Drew, she was a guest editor and wrote an interesting article about a 3 day camping trip. I don't think Charlie's Angels will be a good movie but I still like her in most of her movies.
