Now, see how this works someone has something mean to say about Newfoundlanders, then a Newfoundlander stumbles onto it and comes on to tell us how nice it is in Newfoundland - except it can t quite be done without saying something nasty about the United States (always open season here apparently). Now, as a U.S. citizen I suppose you might expect me to now want throw a few barbs at Canada. Yet, I don t really feel inclined to. Actually, I may venture up there some day in spite of a lot of silly remarks I ve read about both our countries. With the shape the world is in today I do not understand why everyone seems to want to create more bad feelings especially when we all know that you are as likely to find a broad range of human behavior any and everywhere on this shrinking little globe we call home.
