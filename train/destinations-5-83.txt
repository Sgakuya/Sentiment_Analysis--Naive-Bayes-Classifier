We were Hong Kong for Chinese New Year in February 2004 and just loved it. In fact, Chinese New year is a good time to go because so many residents leave the city to return to their hometowns. We got a good rate in a hotel overlooking Victoria Park and saw both the fireworks on New Years Eve and the parade on New Years Day. Must do's include taking the tram to the top of the Peak, visiting Stanley and Aberdeen (we took city buses), and riding around on the old-fashioned streetcars. If you have time, cross the border into Shenzhen. The shopping is cheaper there. Because we were living in China at the time, we actually flew in and out of Shenzhen as those flights are considered domestic and are cheaper than flights to Hong Kong.
