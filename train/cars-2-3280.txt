Always wanted a Jeep Cherokee. Finally got a High paying job and bought one. Wish I had bought something else. Don't get me wrong I love her but for the money i spent I shouldn't have no where near the problems I do. She's a 2004 and I have already had the front sway bushings replaced passenger window trim replaced, passengerwindow motor replace, passenger side mirror replaced. And an array of problems the dealership will not admit are there. I too have the loud noise when shifting from park to reverse or drive. When I turn the wheel there's a loud noise in the front tires. The handling sometimes scares me, feels like the rear end has lost control. Plus my CD player will just die for no reason, or the speakers won't work. I thought I was paying for quality but apparently I paid for a "logo". If you have an honest dealership to help you with the kinks maybe you'll be alright but mine is as crooked as a question mark so I have to show myself to get anything fixed. Good Luck!
