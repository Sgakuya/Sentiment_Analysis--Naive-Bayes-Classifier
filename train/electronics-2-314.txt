At first this seemed to be a great phone at a reasonable price. But today at just than 4 months of ownership the darn thing just died. The base unit seems to be totally dead..There is no contact us option at the website in the manual just instructions to mail it back plus five dollars in its origianl packaging, which of course I no longer have...I have contacted the store where I made the purchase, Office Max to see if they could help me, but have yet to hear back from them...Its looking like I'll be stuck with the excursion 39606 which only functioned for 4 months and no recourse...I suggest to not buy this phone Sincerely V Aurand
