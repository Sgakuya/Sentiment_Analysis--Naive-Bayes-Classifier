Give Shaq the damn ball!! Not just some of the time, not just most of the time - give him the damn ball EVERY SINGLE POSSESSION. I'm talking to you Gary, and you Devean, and yes you too Kobe... and especially you Phil Jackson. Any possession in which this man does not touch the ball is a flat out failure. He is the ONLY one with a match-up advantage against the Pistons, and he is the only way this series will go back to LA. If they single cover him, he will most likely score, and probably get fouled. If they double, Shaq will most likely score anyway, and if not, will make the right decision. Give this man the freaking ball. It's not complicated.
