The customer service for Alltel SUCKS!!!!! For one, when I got the phones the lady said the first bill would be $120.00 plus tax. Fine with me! But when I get the bill it's $160.00. Why? Because they have all of this other crap added that I didn't want and didn't even tell them to add to it. They added it themselves. So I call and see why the bill is so much because this isn't what I was told. Well you have these other charges plus the stuff I didn't want. OK fine they took it off. Now my bill is about $140.00. Still not the $120.00 plus tax. Second problem. When I called checking on the bill and to remove the stuff I didn't want, I made sure they understood to leave the text message on the phone. Did they? Nope! Had to call back and she said it would be added. OK so I try to send a message does it send? NOPE! Tried for an hour. Finally called them back and it wasn't added back..arggg!!! So now she is adding it back. Turned my phone off then back on and now it works. The other problem is we have the Total Freedom plan, not suppose to be roaming anywhere at anytime. Well guess what? Hubby is 2 hours from me and he is roaming. He was told to update his phone. We did and said it was successful. He leaves again to finish his schooling 2 hours away and guess what, he is still roaming. Call them to make sure we would not be charged roaming fees and they SAY we won't. Guess I will have to wait till the next bill to make sure huh?! As far as a signal. So far no complaints there. But then again me and hubby are only 2 hours apart at the time. Wonder how it will be when he is in another state.
