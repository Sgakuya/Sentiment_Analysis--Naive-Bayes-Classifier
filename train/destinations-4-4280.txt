As the former capitol of the confederacy, you'd think this would be a backwards-ass, redneck, good ole boy town. It's not quite that. Richmond actually has life and has got a lil' something to it. Capital One Credit Card services has enabled many new people to come into the area and there are enough businesses around to make this more than a hick, Southern town. Richmond also seems like an affordable place to live and is more diverse than you'd imagine. Parts of the downtown look.....Urban....but the suburbs ( at lest Glen Allen) are nice. It's a big city in Virginia, but I dont get the sense it will become a Charlotte, Louisville or Nashville. Good thing, it's fine as is.
