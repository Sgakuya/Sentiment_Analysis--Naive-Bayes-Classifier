Wake up Americans! Once in a lifetime does a person of Ross Perot's caliber come along. If we would only let him he would set us free or at least give it an honest try. Why do we need to be set free? Because most people look at the world through rose colored glasses. They don't want to think about what's happening to others, what's around the corner or even how things will effect their children. There are a lot of things going on that Mr. Perot is well aware of that need to be dealt with for the good of all Americans. Those charts and graphs show his dedication to getting the job done right. If I ever get the opportunity to meet this great man I will thank Heavenly Father. As far as the spying goes - People there are so nasty things going on in workplaces, etc., to some good people and good ideas. The bad ones think they are the only ones that can use modern day technology to accomplish their ends. Well move over, the good guys know how you do things. By the way, Mr. Perot deserves 10 stars.
