I've been taking a lot of heat lately for being rough on JFK, so I'm going to write about him twice: negatively on the U.S. presidents list, and more positively on the 20th century leaders list - and hope to achieve balance. Here goes: Kennedy had a personal dislike for the southern states. A man that I know was a young college student back in those days, and JFK sent some men who came down and entered his home and terrified him and his parents, accusing them of stirring up civil unrest - a totally false charge. This was in Laurel, Mississippi and these were gentle people. It made them (and who knows how many others) frightened of their own government. Joseph Kennedy had raised his sons to be ruthless in the pursuit of power. He also encouraged them to have sex with as many women as possible, treating promiscuity as a virtue. The patriarch had planned all along to buy Joe Jr. into the White House, but Joe Jr. was tragically killed in a plane crash, so it was up to JFK to fulfill his father's wishes. I'm convinced that Kennedy's agents stole the election in Illinois, and possibly in Texas as well. JFK lurched from crisis to crisis as president, and spent a lot of time gladly cheating on his wife. He and Lyndon Johnson detested each other, and ran together in 1960 for purely political reasons. I was living in Madison County, Indiana, when he died. Our county was employed mostly by General Motors, and was a strong Union area, always voting Democrat even at times when most of the state voted Republican. Yet, I can remember that even in Madison County, people joked about Kennedy saw him as a lightweight. The Indianapolis Star didn't have a good thing to say about him - until he was shot, and then he suddenly passed into legend, so that the Star began writing tributes to him. (for a more positive assessment of JFK, see my comments under 20th century leaders).
