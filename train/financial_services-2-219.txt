A friend of mine is a bank manager for a boa branch in illinois. He told me- It is a simple fact that if you put money in to cover a transaction (like say an automatic bill pay) and your deposit falls on the same day as the automatic withdraw- the bank will hold on to your deposit for 24 hours to let the automatic bill pay thru- then hit you with the overdraft fee- then add your deposit (even if it is cash) This happen to me more than once. I noticed that if I made a cash deposit it was always available right away- unless i had a pending transaction then- amazingly- the cash was witheld and i was charged an overdraft. Unfortunantly, BOA is not the only bank that dose this and it is perfectly legal. It amazes me that blockbuster can be sued for a 5 dollar late charge but banks are allowed to gut your account for all its worth.
