Jordan is obviously the greatest basketball player of all time. That can not be disputed. But he is not the greatest college player of all time. Actually, he's not the top Carolina player of all time. I would say Ford, Scott, Cunningham, Jamison, and then Jordan. Again, I'm not saying he's not the best of all time,- that would make me a moron. IN COLLEGE. I'm sure however, that he could eat anybody on this list alive two years into his NBA career. The same goes for guys like Shaq and Duncan, given the evolution of the basketball body. Those two guys would've destroyed Walton, Chamberlain, etc. If you dispute that, you're a moron. It's not new school vs. old school or any thinking like that. If you understand the game, and are'nt just hanging on to old memories, be logical and visualize Wilt guarding Shaq, the athletic quick Payton guarding slow small geek Cousy. Think about it. Guys are MUCH bigger, stronger, quicker, and just plain better now. Man, I bet even a guy like Sean May could dominate Wilt at the height of his career. He'd slap him away like a fly. What were those guys in those days?- 6 ft 11, 220 lbs at the biggest?
