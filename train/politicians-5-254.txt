Although a King, the Lionheart was probably one of the purest knights who ever lived. King Richard was in possession of the sword, Excalibur. With this he was wont to smite the infidels during the Holy Crusade. Holy King Richard 1st, Lionheart, should be canonized as a holy saint of England. Several monarchs are saints or saints in waiting (King Charles 1st) and King Richard 1st, Lionheart should be proclaimed a saint throughout the realm. Both Christ and Saint George apeareth unto the King. The King, gravely ill, was approached by Saint George. The King then arose from his sick bed, then armed himself and mounted his chargeur and lead an attack against an infidel raiding group. With a single blow of his sword Excalabure, the dread King slew two mounted saracens of his sword. Surely our Lord with the King. King Richard took up the cross and valiently lead a holy crusade to rescue the holy places of Our Lords passion from the infidels. He restored the True Cross to Christian veneration. His military genius showed through countless times, the relief of Acre, the conquest of Cyprus, the sack of Messina, a valiant advance along the coast. He inspired great deads among his many followers. The people of England were only too happy to pay the awful ransom leaved upon them to ransom back thier crusader King. The wicked emperor of Austria will receive eternal damnation for holding to ransom a crusader King. All of Europe feared the name of Richard, Coeur de Leon. Even today, people sing epic poems in his memory.
