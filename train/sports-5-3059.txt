This guy was a switch hitter! he hit 50+hrs twice, as a switch hitter! amazing! in fact, hes the only person ever to win a triple crown with 50+hrs. his fielding, while not as excellent as willie mays's, was far from mediocre, exceptional. his arm was fabulous, not as good as mays, but still very impressive. but what was most impressive about the mick was his speed. this guy could outrun rickey henderson or tim raines in their primes, in a run from home to first, thats how fast he was. he had a horrid knee injury his rookie year. had he not had that, and had he taken care of himself, he could very well be the single season and career hr kings, as well as the walks king, and runs scored king. this guy was great, he possibly had more raw talent than anyone else who ever played the game
