It looks as if Radio Shack has gone the way of too many companies in that volume sales has taken precedent over what a customer may actually need. There's nothing wrong with volume sales but very few companies seem to be able to promote things in volume and also remember their roots and the formula that enabled them to become big powerful companies. If I had to take a guess I would say that it was during the 1970s when CB radios were all the rage that Radio Shack tasted the fruits of high volume sales and began to leave it's roots, telling customers what they should buy instead of tailoring their merchandise to the customer's actual needs.I would be in favor of further expansion if they would pay more attention to the formula that got them where they are today. It's hard to believe that Radio Shack was the merging of a small Boston radio supply store with a leather and shoe repair company, and during the early days of hi fi they were one of the industry leaders and innovators. Personally, I have never had any problems with the personnel who work at Radio Shack and from my own experience I have no complaints. A few years back I worked for a gentleman who was employed by Tandy Corp in the early 1960s when the founders son was then the head of the company. When I asked him about Mr Tandy and what has become of Radio Shack he said something to the effect of Old man Tandy is spinning in his grave so fast he has his own gravitational pull. Volume sales look good on paper but satisfied customers (which equals repeat customers) are more profitable in the long run.
