I read the brothers Karamazov in my literature class which iÂ´m taking in my school in Iceland. I am glad I choose to read this book because it is very good. This book gets you thinkig about life and how persons can be different. The conflict between good and evil is interesting an the conclusion I got from this book is that without evil in the world we would not know the good. The book will live on for centuries because it is about what humans will always have to deal with, communicating with people,love,envy,finding yourself and alot more. Everyone should read this book in there lifetime because you will learn from it.
