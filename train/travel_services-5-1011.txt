I had a move from toronto to ottawa. I arranged my move through the toronto office and spoke to a woman by the name of Rev. She was very pleasant and very helpful. Everytime I had a problem she was always nice enough to help me. I remember her words to me if you have any questions or concerns, please dont hesitate to give me a call and fror the first time I actually went through a company who actually meant what they said. Customer service is very hard to fin now a days. If you are ever looking to find a mover locally or long distance..contact the men with the big hearts. Thank you Rev and all the staff of the toronto office. You have made my experience with you wonderful. Two thumbs up **** Mary Beth Blade
