It is one of those countries that polarizes people. Either you love it or you have it. If you want more of the comfort and cleanliness - not your cup of tea. Not your average one week holiday. It is very historic land, with lots of culture. More than 20 different written languages. You need to understand the rythm of the place and then you just LOVE IT. It took me 3-4 days to stop frowning at everything. Then it was FANTASTIC. People are friendly in a FAMILIAR sort of way. They are helpful and most of them are very knowledgable about the world. Loads of spirituality and very sophisticated ethical and moral systems. Village people are innocent but not naive. City people have adopted Western thinking to a limited extend. Very conservative values. Best part is - PEOPLE ARE HAPPY. Amazing to see happy people in the villages, slums, living in abject poverty. It is impressive.
