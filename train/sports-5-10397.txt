I understand that folkd (Miami, Oklahoma, Iowa and USC fans) like to criticize the team and the Nat'l championship victory, but c'mon, the Bucks were suppossed to get killed, and in the end they won, when we talk about bad calls, I have a lengthy list of missed calls agains Miami that would have ended the game in regulation. As a coach, it doesn't get any better, if you don't believe me, go to a home game and watch the tradion that now exists. See how the players and Tressel sing the alma mater with the band at the end of games, the fan base has always existed, but now there is true class. Granted, he does need to shut Clarett up more often. And for my final piece of evidence notice that his new contract, while a big raise, does not make him the highest paid coach in the Big 10 (+1), and the fact there is only one bonus for on the field performance, all other bonuses are accademic merit. Go Bucks, In Tressel We Trust!!
