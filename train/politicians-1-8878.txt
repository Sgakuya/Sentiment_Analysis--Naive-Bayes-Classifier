The economy may have been good (although it proved to be phony and all the dot coms deflated) but, any educated person knows that the current President is not responsible for the economy - he inherits it. Clinton (much like Jimmy Carter) is remembered for expressing his deep felt care for Americans and their problems. And what are his great accomplishments, again? His failed socilization of health care? The bombings that just happened to coincide with his sex scandal? His negotiation of peace in the middle east? His tax increases? His many, many, many social programs that sound great on the stump but fail miserably? The most demoralizing American president of the last 50 years - more harmful than Nixon in many ways.
