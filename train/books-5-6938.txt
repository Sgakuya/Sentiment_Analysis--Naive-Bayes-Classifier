If Douglas Adams & Dave Barry had never published books, Terry Pratchett would be the #1 comedy writer. These books are very original (usually, but often with a twist on other stories), very funny & there are enough of them to keep you busy for a long time. I've been reading them, off & on, since I was about 15 years old (I'm 30 now). There are probably more than 30 books (maybe around 40?) in the discworld series (the 1st I read was Pyramids. If you can get any with the witches, Ogg & Weatherwax +1 (like in the Wyrd Sisters, they're a blast. And the magician Rincewind, with his little box (there aren't enough books about them!!!) are awesome too. I believe Sourcery was about Rincewind, and one of the 1st ones had I read.
