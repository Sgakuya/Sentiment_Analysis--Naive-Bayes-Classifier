I started diupping Copenhagen when I was 12/13 and that is still my tobacco of choice at age 57 now. Working in a papermill to earn college tuition, I was introduced to Redman at age 18. I bought some chew on and off over the years and it was always Redman. Recently, I've been tempted to go back to chewing and for some reason, Redman is the brand of choice. Guess this stuff must be good to make we want to buy some after all the years. I don't like flavored tobacco in any form and Redman just seems to bring all the right things together. It is moist enough, has a great taste, and is available everywhere. Beats the taste of Beechnut, the dryness of Levi, and just plain satisfies.
