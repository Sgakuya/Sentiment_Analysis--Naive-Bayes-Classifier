I LOVE Sharon Stone. Basic Instinct people say she was a slut and all for showing us her glory, but she played the icy cold bitch to the hilt in that movie. Little seen movie Sliver she softened a bit, playing a newly divorced writer involved with a younger man who might be a killer. Underrated performance. Casino , again another twist in her career, where she played Robert DeNiro coked out wife, where she won an award. The woman has a really high IQ I read somewhere, which is probably why she has a rep for being hard to deal with. She even had a bit part in Total Recall , a futristic sci fi thriller with Arnold Schwarzeneger that she was ok in. I see any movie she is in .
