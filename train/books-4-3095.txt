The well known film based upon this book does a great job capturing the flavor of the novel. However, the film makes the writer's character a bit more sympathetic than the book does. The Paul Sheldon of the novel Misery is in many ways a jackass, but since we get a clear and well-rounded pictuire of the flawed author in this book I still found myself rooting for him. the punishments and tortures inflicted in the film are pretty tame compared to what happens to Sheldon in the novel, but that's all I'm going to say about it. I have to rate this a four since I'm rating the King novels on the curve vs. his other works. The novel is awesome and would get a 5 star rating in a general fiction list, but I have to rate King a little differently because there are so many novels to choose from... King newbies, if any exist, should know that some books are better than others in his library, but 90% are highly recommended.
