I subscribed to Netflix because it had an excellent selection of foreign films which I required for my global cinema class. After using them for a few months I can tell you that there is a lot to recommend them. They have a huge selection, they are quick to send you the movies (at least in my case), and its not a bad value. The only problem I personally encountered with them was that I received too many damaged DVD's. I think I rented about a dozen DVD's and of those, four had play issues. Maybe I was just unlucky. I have read that if you are a heavy user that they will employ various tactics to reduce the number of movies they send to you. I would believe that because, beyond a certain point, someone renting a bunch of movies is cutting into their profit. I would say if you are going to join Netflix and plan on renting loads of DVD's you will be disappointed. If you aren't going to rent that many it will probably work for you, especially if the high proportion of damaged DVD's I received was just bad luck.
