I had to give this game a 5 because it truly is one of the greatest ever. However, GT2 was the best in the series, and I'm giving GT3 a 5 because GT2 deserves a 6+. Super clean graphics and lighting effects is the strong point here, along with the trademark, very in-depth Simulation Mode. My only qualm with GT3 is the fact that some of the best tracks and cars from GT and GT2 were left out in favor of some rather weak substitutes. What happened to Grindelwald and Rome Night? Why did they take away the TVR Cerbera LM - the single greatest all-around track-devouring monster from the first two games - and keep all the absolutely useless cars like the Mazda Demio, Toyota Vitz, or anything from Daihatsu? And what happened to the Racing Modification? I can only hope that these will be fixed if GT4 ever sees the light of day.
