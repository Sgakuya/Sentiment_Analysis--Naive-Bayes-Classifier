St. Kitts is a spectacularly beautiful volcanic island below St. Thomas and above Antigua. We spent last week at the Marriott, but if I had to do it all over again, I'd stay at Ottley's Plantation where there are no TV's or internet. The government is quite stable and although there is poverty, it seems more middle class than a lot of the Caribbean Islands. That also makes it a little more expensive to stay there. People rave about the Dominican Republic resorts but don't understand that they are so cheap because they don't PAY their employees! I liked St. Kitts because they DO have a thriving economy despite the downturn in the sugarcane industry and because I felt safe everywhere I went on the island. I could drink the water and eat the food wherever I went off the resort. The beaches are OK - not the best, but the locals were wonderful, the history interesting, and the ambiance sensational. There is even a rain forest with horseback rides for those who don't want to just loll about the pool or beach. A real tourist trap that I loved was Turtle Beach where, in the mornings, the Green Velvet Monkeys come down out of the rain forest for special treats tourists can feed them. Meet Wilbur the pig and goats everywhere. Trade winds keep the humidity down so they have pretty much a year-round temperature of 80-90 degrees daytime and 60-70 nighttime. If you meet Albon at the Marriott say HI for me - what a sweet man. Get Heart Attack for your taxi driver. It was all great. Beware of some of the beach merchants. Get your price up front BEFORE they make any jewelry for you. Otherwise, it was absolutely the best vacation of my life (so far!). And I brought a friend away with me (something I don't always do). When considering a trip to the Caribbean, please check out St. Kitts. Also, try their wonderful beer - Carib! It's fabulous. Wish we could get it here in the US!
