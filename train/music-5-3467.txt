Yay! Someone is adding all the great Dylan albums! I don't always know what to think of Blood on the Tracks. It's the album that initially got me interested in Bob Dylan, but sometimes it's so depressing and sometimes I think I've listened to it too much. Tangled Up In Blue is a good kick-off, the way the song tells a story, the way the lines come together and it rhymes so perfectly, it's amazing. I've heard three different versions of the song, and each one is sang from a different point of view. Most of the songs are sweet or sentimental and full of emotional regret, Idiot Wind is a sarcastic heart-attacking rocker with crazy lyrics, I've heard an acoustic version of it and it's just as good. Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts is a song that doesn't fit in with the theme of the album; it's parable-like, upbeat tune with obviously intelligent lyrics and it keeps you thinking as to what it all means. The most amazing song on the record, however, is Shelter From The Storm with Christ-like imagery, linking religion to personal love. It's awe-inspiring. And that tapping sound you may hear in the background on songs like this is just the buttons on Dylan's shirt bumping against the guitar; that's how down-to-earth, honest, and touching this album is. It's truly a five-star album, I just don't always enjoy it.
