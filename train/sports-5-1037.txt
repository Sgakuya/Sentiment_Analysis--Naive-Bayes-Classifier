The reason why Bonds is on sterroids now as opposed to earlier in his career is simple...EGO. His vast and unfathomable ego has forced him into a situation: compete or deplete. His age was forcing him to the curb and he wanted to be the man. He'll never be the man because REAL MEN DON'T CHEAT. Before 2001, Bonds was hitting around .282, averaged almost 40 homers and struck out about 100 times a year. So, he did the math: if you are a hitter who puts 12 balls per season to the warning track for outs and increase your strength by, say, 3% and your ball goes 3% farther, it's in the stands and you chalk up 12 more homers. Get it? 3% of the distance to the warning track is generally about 10 feet and that track is about ten feet wide so ten more feet puts the ball in the stands. Liners that might have been caught now go over the fence. Bonds KNEW that in 2001, he'd be playing in Pac Bell Park, which has the second-shortest right field fence since Ebbets Field. So, in essence, by taking 'roids, he could feasibly hit 60-70 homeruns if the pitching was bad enough. Steroids could aslo help him steal bases. He could finally be the man . Fortunately, he has to live with the fact that he got to this plateau using drugs...the same drugs he preached against in a 1999 interview with ESPN. What a hypocrite.
