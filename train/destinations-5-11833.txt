I lived in Council Bluffs Iowa all my life untill 7 years ago when I moved to Ohio. My family went to the zoo at least 4 times a year. I've been to the zoo in Columbus several times and it does not even come close to Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo. In fact I am amazed at how dissapointed I get every time I go. We come home every summer to visit family. And I just have to go to the zoo. I have 5 children and they love the Henry Doorly Zoo!! Other than family the Henry Doorly Zoo is the one thing I miss about living in Iowa!!!!! The attractions are amazing! There are some new attractions this year that I cant wait to see!!! Thank You Henry Doorly Zoo for making our vacations feel like we are home again! M.Reef and Family
