The only Ivy Leauge universities that actually feel like "real" universities (University of Oxford)" are Penn, Yale and Princeton. Penn, Yale and Princeton are the only one's that have that English-Gothic look. Penn is also America's First University founded by Benjamin Franklin. It has the first medical school in the Nation as well as the world's first collegiate buisness school. The world's first computer was created at Penn and it has the Nation's first hospital as well as the oldest Psychology Department. Although Harvard has a big name, but it has ugly architecture. Harvard is very plan, puritan and colonial; not as beutiful as the WASPy Penn, Yale and Princeton. Harvard also feels like a town I grew up in. I wanted the feel of a university, not a town. Except for a few jews and Asians, Penn is one of the best universities in the world. Also, Penn is ranked 3rd place after Harvard, Princeton and Yale (2006, US News and World...)
