This is a vote of the heart. I began cheering for the Pale Hose in 1957, when believe it not Chicago was a Sox town. Many a night I snuck my transistor radio under my pillow and listened to Bob Elson and Don Wells call the games on the radio while I drifted off to sleep. I remember running home from school to catch what was left of the first game of the 1959 World Series. Final score White Sox 11 Dodgers 0. Alas, it was all downhill from there. The White Sox and their fans are the true red haired step children of sports. The Boston Red Sox finally had their day in the sun. When the White Sox end their long title drought, the celebration may not be the biggest, but I can assure you it will be the most intense in the history of American professional sports. Until then like the songs says, root for the White Sox and whoever plays the Cubs!
