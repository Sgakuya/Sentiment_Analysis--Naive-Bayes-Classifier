Colin Powell story is the classic tale of the American Dream coming true. I believe he will make an excellent Secretary of State under an excellent new president; George W. Bush. At first, I had my doubts whether he would be good at the State Department because he initially opposed the Gulf War, but after looking into it, I discovered why he really opposed it. As a general, he did not want to sacrifice any of men in a war which is fruitless like Vietnam. Obviously, the Gulf War was not fruitless; we freed Kuwait and we managed to keep oil prices low in the long run. Hearing him speak gave me plenty of confidence in his ability to understand our role in the world. We must maintain a strong military, at the same time we must engage in combat less. The military should be used as a form of coercive diplomacy (that is, using military strength as a drawing card for peace negociations). I somehow do not imagine Colin Powell singing Respect in a commercial for the UN like Madeline Albright. General Powell is a great American.
