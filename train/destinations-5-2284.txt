People need to realize that the government (which by the way was put into power by the US) is hostile to the US. The people, however, love the US. We are told that they all hate us, but they really just dislike what our government has done to their country. After WWII we assasinated the democratically elected Prime Minister and put the Shah in power. When it was clear he was going to die and lose power, we helped Ayatollah Khomenie take power so that the Communists wouldn't take over. After the Ayatollah cut relations we gave Sadamm Heussein chemical and biological weapons to attack Iran. This was all based on oil prices. The people there embrace American culture and most speak Engilsh because it has one of the most educated populations in the world and has for about 2,000 years. Iranians, it apparently needs to be mentioned, are not Arabs, they are Persians, completely different then Arabs and sharing a common ancestry with the Celtic people of Whales, Ireland, and Scotland. Iran is home to some of the most beautiful scenery in the world with just about every imaginable terrain existing in the country. Lastly I would like to say two things: 1.) The koran may say that people who don't believe in mohammed are pigs, but the bible says much worse about people who don't believe in Jesus. 2.) It seems that people are making statements based off of ignorance with their sole source of information being Bush propoganda. If you disagree with me click on my name and send me a personal message.
