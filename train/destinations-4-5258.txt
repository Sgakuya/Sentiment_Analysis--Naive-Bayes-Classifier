California is a great place to visit. The countryside is beautiful; specifically the coastline around San Francisco. The Napa and Sonoma Valleys are nice and there is great food there too. The Sierras are some of the nicest mountains I've ever seen. Northern California overall is nicer than Southern California. L.A. has no personality, very cold and plastic. Palm Springs and the surrounding deserts are nice. San Diego and its surroundings are nice too. San Francisco is definitely a nice city but a bit too eccentric for my taste. All in out, you can't say you've seen America if you haven't been to California. I wouldn't want to live there though--the cost of living there is very high, among the highest in the country. But still, I guess it's a price you have to pay to live in such nice surroundings.
