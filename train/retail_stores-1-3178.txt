I always thought that people were just being impatient when they complained that service slowed down the longer one was a member and/or the more DVDs one rents. However, I just had some of this confirmed for me. I have had Lost in Translation in my queue for more than two months! it just was released last Tuesday, and it is now listed Very Long Wait, aka 4-6 month wait. now it is possible that just that many people have been on the waiting list for two months and one day. So I asked a friend at work to test it for me. (she gets '6 movies a month, and i'm in the 12-15 category) Sure enough, the movie immediately came up as available Now! I am amazed at this. I'm supposed to wait for 4-6 months and she can have it now, simply because they are making more of a profit on her? I'm quitting the service.
