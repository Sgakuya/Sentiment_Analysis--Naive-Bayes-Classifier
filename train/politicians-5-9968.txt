You liberal pin-heads are clueless. You consider Clinton to be a wonderful president, and he accomplished nothing. Nothing of significance happened during his terms. 8 years of acting presidential, especially in the Oval Office. The libs had 8 years of nothing and were satisfied, now we need to get the ball rolling and that takes conservatives....it's been 6 years so far, but guess what libby's, we shall win in 2008 and score a total of 16 years of conservatism when you add in the 2012 term. We are going to shove conservatism up your liberal infested ashholes and cram it down your big whining yaps...MMMwwwahhhhhh ahhhhh...I cannot wait! Funny stuff. MMMwwwahhhhhhaaaa
