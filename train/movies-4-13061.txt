This is an undeniably well-done movie. Several of the acting performances are alone worth the price of the rental. The plot is compelling and there's hardly a wasted moment. But on a recent viewing I felt a little let down by the simplicity of the ending. I mean, are we really to believe that Michael could undertake this dramatic purging and not create huge unintended consequences. If each of the families had the same kind of nest of allies as the Corleone's, then what Michael did seems as stupid as throwing rocks at a hornet's nest. I'll have to re-watch G2, but on a second viewing, his character definitely has some similarity to Sonny, whose emotionalism was a fatal flaw. It's not clear why the writers decide to let Michael off the hook, but not Sonny.
