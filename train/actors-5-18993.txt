Michael Morre is a God send. Sure people can bitch and moan about what he did at the Oscars, but for no good reason. To those who say It was an inappropriate time to say those things, I say: why? What the hell is so sacred about the Oscars? The one night that all of Hollywood comes out to give itself oral sex is nothing sacred and it is irresponsible, in my view, for anyone who has the spotlight on him/her to not use that time to try to get across and actual message with actual value. And to those who say, We should all support the troops right now, you are right we should all support the troops right now, but last time I did a reality check portesters in the streets and Michael Morre are alot more concerned about our young men and women dieing then the rest of you war hawks. How the hell do you possibly, on any mental level, equate being against war with being against our young men and women serving in the military? In addition, nothing Michael Morre said was untrue: Bush did steal the election. How? Because Al Gore won the popular vote and in any respectable democracy that equates to getting the office. Furthermore, democracy, especially ours, is based upon being able to criticize politicians on any level when you feel like they are doing a diservice to the American people. The idea that you are somehow Unamerican if you disagree with this administration is floated by blow hard know nothings like Rush Limbaugh, but THINK FOR YOURSELVES. Just because Rushy says its unpatriotic- whatever the hell that means- to protest doesn't make it so.
