sobe green tea is the perfect drink at all times, which makes it extremely addictive. i crack one open take that first swig, and read the cap, some times the cap says something stupid like sobe and the city other times it's tight as hell like H to the Lizzo one time i got ran over by a car and had a scrape on my elbow. i poured a little green tea on it and it was back to normal looking (not just healed, but 100% normal) in 3 days, and it was bleeding a whole lot. a cut like that usually reforms to normal skin within a month, but this was 3 days. also, this bevrage is simply sublime when stoned. not only does it quench your thirst and relax your body, but it calms your mind and heals your soul. when you swallow it you it feels like there was a fire in you belly that just got put out. you need to try sobe green tea. im sure that in your life time alot of poeple will tell you to do or try things, but this time you must trust me, even though you dont know me, you need to trust me. im not getting paid for this, i just want others to derive the pleasure that i have from this product. in summation, f*ck jesus, sobe will save your soul.
