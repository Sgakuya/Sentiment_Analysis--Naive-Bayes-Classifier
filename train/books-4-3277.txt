I have read almost everything Stephen King/Richard Bachman has published, and I enjoyed Dreamcatcher; devoured it in fact, (so glad he's recovering from his accident, we were worried about him). The only reason I rate DREAMCATCHER a 4, is because IT, DOLORES CLAIBORNE, THE STAND, and NEEDFUL THINGS had more of an impact on me. I'm a Texas girl and the entry in Franny's (THE STAND) journal about Nolan Ryan ( there once was a pitcher ) is something I will never forget. I love Stephen King's work because he can make me see, hear, feel, taste, and generally share in the experience of his characters, male or female, young or old. IT is the only book I've ever read that scared me so much I had to put it down and turn on every light in the house. Didn't pick it up for a couple of days. I think Mr. King would be proud of that, as well he should be. I loved every minute of it. I remain, as ever, a faithful reader.
