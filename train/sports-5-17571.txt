If you had told me at the beginning of the year that KC would be 8-0 at the halfway point of the season I would have laughed in your face. But Priest and the boys, along with likeable coach Vermiel, have made me a believer. These guys are setting the standard week after week, and the formerly suspect defensive unit is playing at a very high level. It's amazing what a few wins early on against rival teams can do to a team's confidence. Whoever beats these guys this year will have to do everything right and Kansas City will have to turn it over a lot. That's the only way. I think it will happen, but no more than twice. I say 14-2 and a first-round bye, and probably win the Super Bowl. The Kansas City Chiefs of 2003-04 are almost unstoppable.
