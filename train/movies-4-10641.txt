i'm not really sure what this movie was about. stuff i heard about it before i saw it, from its story's creator and other people painted a picture for me of self-absorbed, aimless, almost sickeningly indifferent people trapped in a world equally insubstantial, but none of that's what came through for me at all. the movie -unintentionally, i believe- captured the flatlined, buzzing hum of youth, the roar of excitement at a new world opening up after high school, and the contrary influence of forced disaffectedness. you know, like when you were about to do something new and almost painfully exciting (nudge, nudge, know what i mean) but you tried with transparent teenaged bravado to pass it off as old hat? well, i guess that wasn't everybody. it's pretty sad, looking back on it in one's own life, but that sort of humorous embarassment and all the rationalization that it spawns can make for a pretty entertaining movie watching experience, if the film recreates it convincingly. like i said, i don't know if that's what the graphic novelist or the filmmakers meant, but that's what it was, to me. naturally, the initiators into the world of adulthood made up the aged extras of the film, and they were also therefore the most interesting characters. in sum i think i have to say that i feel this film is worth seeing, though that it at times caves to the sort of dark otherworldliness that littered so many low budget cult gems of the 80s, as is especially notable in the last scene. that's probably the comic book's influence. what can i say: conformists believing they're individuals, and sneering without justification or knowledge at the rest of the world- oh, to be young again.
