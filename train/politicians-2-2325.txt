Opportunist extroardinaire. Here is an example of a man who took advantage of opportunities that came his way to the fullest. The armed forces have benefitted from his intelligence, wisdom and eloquence, yet this is someone who knowingly worked with Cheney, Schwarzkopf and George H.W. Bush to initiate the Gulf War against a brutal dictatorial regime in the name of saving the Kuwaitis and, in the process, slaughtering innocent Iraqi civilians and subjecting our soldiers to countless chemicals and other atrocities that have contributed to a high number of post-traumatic stress disorders. (My wife and I firmly believe that's what happened to McVeigh, and why he committed the terrorism he did.) Powell used his status as war hero (as did Schwarzkopf) to manipulate an American populace in dire need of a feel-good panacea to boost our international standing. It is important to remember that while the Western forces were trying to get rid of Saddam Hussein, the Americans were also there to fight for their interests in O - I - L. Kinda sad when a country puts fossil fuel and capitalist profits ahead of American soldiers who want to fight for their country's honor and belief system, only to have their patriotism manipulated by consummate insiders such as Powell.
