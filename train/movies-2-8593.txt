I had pretty low expectations for Miss Congeniality, and the movie barely met them. Sandra Bullock plays an FBI agent who goes undercover as a contestant in the Miss United States Pageant in order to prevent a terrorist bombing. The show develops in a predictable manner, first showing Bullock as a mousy tomboy, and then transforming her into beauty-contestant material. There are some funny scenes as Bullock struggles with her new image, and she's pretty believable in both of her roles. I admire the way Bullock plays unglamorous roles and is willing to look goofy and unattractive (that's a relative term here!), kind of like Lucille Ball. But even Bullock couldn't salvage a really bad script and terrible acting by most of the cast. I don't recommend seeing this movie unless you're a die-hard Sandra Bullock fan. Even then, it's a risk!
