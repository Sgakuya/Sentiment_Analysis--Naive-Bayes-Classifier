Jake Plummer is a terrible quarterback. He has thrown way too many picks in his career, and would have thrown more, except he's had some great options at reciever, as well as one of the best o-lines in the NFL blocking for him. You can't be tied for the league lead in interceptions one year and be a good quarterback the next. HELLO! Jake "The Mistake" has thrown 20 or more interceptions 5 f'n times in his career... 5 years he's thrown more INTs than TDs... His career passer rating is just 75.0, even with his "improved" play this year. Whenever a hairy situation pops up, a linebacker in his face for instance, he freaks out. When he doesn't know what to do, he'll throw it up. When he has no one open, he throws it up. This is still true to this day, even though he's thrown dramatically less picks this year. That's because his team has been playing ahead most of the time, so he hasn't been forced to make plays and the hand off the ball more often. However, I've watched about 3 close Denver games and the same old Plummer came out... The one that makes mistakes the second he's forced to make a play. He threw up a couple INTs, and threw up a couple more that could have been. The Broncos will never be able to beat the Colts, because then it becomes a quarterback duel between Peyton Manning and Jake Plummer... It's already been proven who wins that. UPDATE: What a terrible AFC Championship Game for Jake "the Fake" Plummer. What happened? His team fell behind. He got pressured. He was forced to try to make plays. He gets intercepted twice and fumbles another two times. He had a couple other really bad throws that could have went the other way too. Four turnovers in what very well could be the biggest game in his career is not what you want to be remembered by. I promise you this will continue to happen throughout the rest of his career. He can't handle pressure, and that's not something that's easy to change.
