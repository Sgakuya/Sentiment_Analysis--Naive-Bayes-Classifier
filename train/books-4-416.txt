C.S. Lewis was one of the first sci-fi children's writers I ever read. L, W W was actually the second book in the Narnia Chronicles I read (The first was The Silver Chair, which I actually enjoyed more). I always thought Edmund was a real punk. Lucy was all right, though, but Tumnus was the MAN!!! (Or, at least, the FAUN!!!) The Armageddon-esque battle scene pitting Aslan's armies against the Winter Queen was pretty decent, though. I would definitely recommend this book and this series to any young child who has an interest in fantasy. It's a great place to start. (The animated film of L, W, W was pretty good, too.)
