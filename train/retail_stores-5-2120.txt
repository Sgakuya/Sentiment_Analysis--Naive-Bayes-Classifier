Whoa Slow down people, I happen to work at a radioshack, and retired at 30 years old, as the vice president of a large corporation. I have a Bachelors in Electronic Engineering. I love radioshack and so do many of the people I work with. As far as diversity women get abused by customers that think they do not know anything or make sexual ccomments, and usually quit because of the customer abuse. Ethnic wise we have a full mix of employees. I work at a store where yes most of the people I work with are 18 years old and yes they only make minimum wage so lay off they work damn hard for what they get paid and take more guff of employees than higher retail outlets, and companies. They have a pay for performance plan which if they sell cellular or sirius or dish's they get spiffs, that can double the paychecks so they ask you. I honestly do not know how some of them live paycheck to paycheck, I do it because I love tech and designing a device for customers that have not got a clue between rg6 and rg59, let alone buy a 5 thousand dollar HDTV and want a pair of rabbit ears for it. Money well spent. Be courteous and they will help the best they can, do research on radioshack.com first and if you can bring the product in so we can match up the correct ites for it.
