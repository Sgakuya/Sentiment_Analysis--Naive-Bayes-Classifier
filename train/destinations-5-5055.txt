New York state has everything you could ever want. Except for Chalky, i can't stand people like him, grow up man. You don't have to type a whole freaking essay to make your HOME state look bad, that is really stupid. I think that once new york gets rid of pataki, we will probably the most livable state soon. I already think that new york one of if not the best states to live in. One thing though, they either need to split upstate and downstate apart, or try to unite them some more, because that is an issue that needs some major attention and action taken. lol look at all the stupid people who think that all of new york is one big city, that is stupid, its obviouse that those people have never even been here so their comments really get no credit.
