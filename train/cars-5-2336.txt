The Porsche Boxter is a really nice car. I've driven one at my work and they are very comfy well balanced cars. I have owned all sorts of cars.. Toyota Celica's, AE86 Corolla's, Miata, Twin Turbo FD3S RX-7, AWD turbo 323... I've driven countless other people's cars such as MR2's, cameros, mustangs, 911 Carrera 4, lexus SC430, SC400, SR20 powered 240's, Corvett's, Nissan Skylines, turbo II rx-7, Mazdaspeed Miata, Supra's, Twin Turbo 300ZX's, etc.... I have experiance in cars and driving them. and i can say that the Porsche Boxter is a really nice sports car, hands down. BTW.... Toyotas are actually really well known for their reliability and i actually see more 70's toyotas on the road than i do porsche's... I'd say Toyota has to be one of the most long lasting most reliable cars ever. My toyotas i've owned are great cars... my AE86 only failed once after i installed a custom T25 turbo kit and over boosted with too high oil pressure.
