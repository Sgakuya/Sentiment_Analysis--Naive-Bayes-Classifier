While Wal-Mart has low prices, their employees are paid borderline poverty wages, therefore, they are unable to shop anywhere else. The health plans are offered are expensive, (700,000 workers can't afford it) and cost other employers and taxpayers around $2 billion per year. In addition, since November 2001 Wal-Mart has 28 complaints against it from the National Labor Relations Board. Their is a class action suit coming forward in San Francisco for discrimination and Wal-Mart was recently found knowingly working with contractors who employ illegal workers for third world wages. With its downward pressure on wages and costs, Wal-Mart drives jobs out of the country. By silencing workers who attempt to unionize, Wal-Mart is able to pay wages $2-3 below UFCW-represented workers. Think about it! Wal-Mart banks about $7 million per year in profits, yet pays employees about $15,000 per year (average) for full-time work. At Wal-Mart, supposedly, 28 hours per week is considered full-time. Part time employees must wait two years to even qualify for the health plan - so only about 38% of Wal-Mart employees are covered. Wal-Mart's global suppliers, such as those in China work 13-16 hour shifts. China's minimum wage is 31 cents per hour, the production workers who make Wal-Mart products are reputed to make only 13 cents an hour. They live in a shack and must pay for horrible food and their own medical treatment. They are fired if they become sick. Wal-Mart eliminates three good jobs in the US for every two jobs it creates in its stores.
