I will keep this short. There are so many ratings of him already I cannot imagine I will add too much to the ratings but here goes... Harrison Ford is probably the best actor of the 20th century to never win an oscar. The full scope of his works is amazing. Romantic comedies, action, drama, blockbusters, thrillers. On and on. He is getting along in years and may never win an Oscar. I hope he does before his best days have passed by. I don't want him to win on a pity vote like a few have or like Lucci got for her Emmy. Somebody give this man the script to get him an Oscar! he deserves it. He is THE leading man of all time when judged on box office business and total number of blockbusters. Not because he was in the Raiders movies or Star Wars but because he is an excellent actor. Win an oscar you nut!
