Sleepy, out-of-the-way; just the place to go if you want to relax in a national capital with a small-town atmosphere. I have not been there since 2000, so some things may have changed. Food is good and dirt cheap; crafts are plentiful and, likewise, really inexpensive. Somewhat of a cosmopolitan atmosphere for such a small capital. People (especially the women)are fashionably dressed (much better than their Czech cousins; Slovak women come pretty close to Italians in their standard of dress). The Slovaks may be characterized as the poor cousins (which they are in many ways), but they are much more polite, gracious, and unassuming than the Czechs. Not an awful lot to see in Bratislava, but what there is generally is clean and well-kept. The two hotels I stayed at during separate visits were spotlessly clean and served truly outstanding breakfasts (included in the room price). I would say that it's well worth a day trip from Vienna; a bit more of a stretch from Prague or Budapest.
