First off, Victoria's Secret is very overpriced! You can buy a new outfit for the price of one bra! But I do like the products. The basic underwear is comfortable enough and if you get it on sale, not as badly priced as could be. And the sexier apparel is nice....but only if you have a special occasion and need to splurge (anniversary, honeymoon, etc.) Their pajamas are terrific - both in style and comfort. And I love the Victoria's Secret Garden body lotions. The fragrances are heavenly, and the decor is perfect, for that kind of store, too. A woman can feel like she's landed on the pink cloud of Venus! And I love the Victorian music! But the waitstaff at my local Victoria's Secret are not that friendly, which kind of detracted from the shopping experience. But in general, I think Victoria's Secret is a fun store to shop if you have some extra money and want to feel sexy for your dollar!
