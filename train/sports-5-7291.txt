my favorite player of all time, one of the last great true centers . gentlemen w/ the ability to play w/ the bcks to the basket. all time scoring leader in the NBA. very well conditioned athlete, which allowed him to play into his mid-40's, incredile talent, which allowed him to still be unstoppable scorer at that time. not the greatest rebounder, but an excellent passing center. one of my best memories of Kareem was actually off the court. Abdul-Jabbar graduated from UCLA during the bidding wars of the NBA ABA. Kareem did not like the idea of a Black man being openly bid on. he thus instructed the two teams interested in his services (Milwaukee the Nets) to submit only ONE closed offer. the Nets decided to bluff and he never gave them another chance, not even for much more money. a true champion. like Mr Jordan, Kareem won 6 championships.
