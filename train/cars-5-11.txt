Great quad. I have had mine for 6 months now and love it. The only complaint I have is that it has been in the shop twice for the same problem. It acts like the choke is still on, or the governor is kicking in at very low speeds. Competition Accessories has told me two different stories as to what was wrong with it. A 2/wd 4/wd select would be nice for trail riding. Other than that it has been nothing but great. It will hold its own with most of the stock quads I ride with, a mix of sports and utilities. I have had to pull my friends blaster out of about 12 of THICK BLACK mud and it never even thought twice about it, and that was only the back wheels pulling, the fron ones were in the air spinning. I just ordered a Moose 1700lb winch for it and cannot wait to see what all I can pull. If you are looking for a utility quad that is going to handle and feel like a sport than this is the one for you.
