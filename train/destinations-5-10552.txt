some of you all are crazy, parliament lights are the best cigs ever. ive always thought that marlboro lights, camel turkish gold etc are the choice of the next gen smokers. if you see a guy buying a pack of pfunks, you know he knows whats up and he's defienently smoked for a long time. i get questions all the time from people that have never seen em like are those generics? when actually they're about 30 cents more then camel or marlboros. the recessed filter is the bomb, stays firm never gets wet on your lips. they also got the best light flavor, but i admit they do burn fast as a mofo. also that taking a bump of coke off the filter thing kinda sux, i tried it and the yayo wants to stick to the paper for some reason, i suggest not doing it. if you've never tried them i suggest you go buy a pack, if you can find em that is; seems like they're never available in rural areas, and most gas station attendants give you funny looks when you ask for a pack. pfunks, hands down, best cigarette ever conceived.
