Rev. Al just LOVES to see himself on TV, and there is not a bad thing which ever happened to a black person which the Rev is ready to tell us is whitey's fault. When the black community has such as these constantly telling them not to accept personal responsibility, all that is bad has been foisted upon them, some hear the message. Others are at least influenced by it. He is a disease; if it were legal to medicate him out of our existence, it would serve blacks and society in general to do so. But I was raised with morals, so I'll just hold my nose and wait for us to grow up past him. It is certain that he will not grow up on his own.
