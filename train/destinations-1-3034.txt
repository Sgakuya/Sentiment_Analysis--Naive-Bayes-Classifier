San Francisco is probably the worst city in America. It's small, boring, and overrated. It lacks any true vitality, the streets smell like urine and sewage, there are homeless people and panhandlers on every corner, and disgusting perverts roam the entire city. The weather is terrible, the people are stupid, annoying, ugly, and fake, and even the nicer areas are nothing special. The city looks pretty on postcards, but when you really see it, you find the place depressing, cluttered, and unbelieveably filthy. The culture it may have once had has been stripped bare, revealing nothing but a deplorable place that makes you glad you don't live there. It's a city jealous of more famous and better cities like Los Angeles and New York City, which offer so much more in different yet better ways. It's San Fran-cesspool, a dead, vile, empty city. Tourist tip: Shop at Gucci in "pretty" Union Square (the only real place to shop for big brands), and then walk a couple blocks west on Market to the Moon Stone Shirts shop. Shame, shame, shame.
