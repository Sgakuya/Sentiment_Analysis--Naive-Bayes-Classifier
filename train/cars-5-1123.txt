I have 96' Honda Civic manual 5-speed. What can I say, it has 106 horse power and wheels the size of Power Wheels, but I couldn't imagine a more eficient, reliable car for a relativaly low price. It costs me $12 to fill up my tank and that will last me for 250 to 300 miles. For some reason a lot of people hate the civic, but it seems that they are all people who invest themselves into their cars. A car, in my opinion, is something designed to get you from point A to point B, the Civic does that incredibly well, I don't see why so many people do so much useless crap to their cars, the worst being the loud mufflers.
