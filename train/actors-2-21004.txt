Maybe she is the She-Devil , sort of. Her now defunct shows, her talk show and Roseanne , weren't that good but not bad. At least not The Martin Short Show bad. Her talk show didn't last long and didn't have a lot of potential in the first place. Second her formerly popular show Roseanne was although offensive, funny, sometimes. Her movie, She-Devil , now in heavy rotation at Comedy Central, was no Sleepless in Seattle but hey it beats Autumn in New York and Sweet November . This big lady's biggest flaw is her attitude. Although she's shed a few pounds, she could use an attitude adjustment. From her National Anthem crotch grab to her foul little mouth, she definately ain't no Katherine Hepburn!
