Small class and interested, qualified professors provied a quality liberal arts education and the degree granting colleges range from good to excellent depending on what major you pursue. The student body has been becomming more intellectually based over the last four to five years despite raising tuition and no increase in scholarships. The university has the nasty habit of overspending on buildings while neglecting appropiate pay for professors and staff. The dorms and cafeteria are both top notch relative to the 10 or so colleges that I have visited. Most dorms are nice to the point that they feel more like apartments than the traditional dorm. SMU is an excellent place to get a very good education and meet interesting people. As most places, there will be many kindred spirits and many people that must be tolerated. Whether or not the cost is justified depends on your financial situation and the aid provided by the school.
