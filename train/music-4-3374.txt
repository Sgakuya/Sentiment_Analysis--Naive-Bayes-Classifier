Pink Floyd peaked with Dark Side Of The Moon when it was released in 1973. I imagine that other Floyd releases have been ranked higher on this list than Dark Side merely because this release has enjoyed so much popularity and has been (admittedly) overplayed. Nevertheless, for someone just starting to approach Pink Floyd, this full-length effort is undeniably the place to start which avoids the excesses of The Wall, Wish You Were Here, and Animals. For a Floyd album, Dark Side Of The Moon has an impressive number of singles as well, most notably Time, Money and Us And Them. As other comments have noted, by intent or by happenstance, one can play Dark Side along with the film The Wizard Of Oz for a interesting musical interpretation of the movie. Finally, as an interesting note, Alan Parsons was the engineer for this release.
