Look dips, Frank inherited a terrible program from that oof Bill Dooley. Tech IS in the middle of nowwhere, which is why you can leave your doors unlocked at night there. But that makes it more difficult to recruit. He's taken the proverbial sow's ear and played in the big game. Recruiting in Florida is as easy as picking up a he-ho in West Hollywood. Coaches all over the country study what he's done at Tech, esp. w/ special teams. And the knock about if it weren't for Mike Vick, like I said, if you coach at FSU or Miami it's not much of a challenge. Instead of being knocked for getting Vick, people should say hey, what a coup, to land that kind of talent. Ralph Frieden, well let's see in a couple of years if he;s still doing well. Remember, Ralph came in while U Md was busting with talent. Frank came in with Tech busted, so give the man his due. Hell, you could put Forrest Gump in Tallahassee and he'd win. I just hope that Tech doesn't end up in the same division as both FSU and Miami, that would be very bad. But Tech would like to fatten up on UVa, Duke, Wake, UNC, esp. UNC, what tight asses. They gots a real Ivy League wannabe syndrome goin on there. I can't wait for Tech to destroy those Cigarette Row hucklebucks. Look if they is all of that, why didn't they asses get into Princeton or some place significant. Tech is just a real nice place, real nice little school where liberalism, lesbianism, multiculturalism hasn't destroyed yet. One final word, I and many Tech fans would have much preferred the Big East stay intact, it's been great for Tech football, and a Miami death penalty didn't hurt either.
