Racist? PUH-LEEZE! OK, I got that out. It seems that people either hated or loved TPM. It may not be the best of Star Wars saga but it does enough to move the story forward. It is easy to overlook that the movie is laying the framework for the soon-to-be Emperor to throw the Star Wars galaxy into chaos by taking total control. The whole Trade Federation debacle was nothing more than a puppet show to achieve that goal, thus the Phantom Menace . There is nothing more to it. Of course our Emperor will need help assimilating the galaxy and that's where Darth Maul comes into play-until his timely end, anyways. So enter young Anakin Skywalker. We are also introduced to his future mentor Obi Wan Kenobi along with his master Qui Gon Jinn. We get to meet Anakin's mother (a future source of conflict I'm sure) and his future love Queen Amidala. So basically that is the gist of the movie in a nutshell. Could it have been told better? Perhaps. Was there a need for Jar Jar Binks? Probably Not. Too heavily laden on special effects? Maybe. Have we all gotten so old and jaded that we can't forget ourselves for two hours to sit back and enjoy?
