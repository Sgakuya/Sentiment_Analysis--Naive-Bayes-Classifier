Australia,a great nation built on mateship rather than patriotism.It boasts of every terrain in the world,and offers a wide diversity of wildlife and attractions of natural splendor.Not only does she give more aid than she receives,Australia demonstrates a high level of ethnic tolerance which should educate other nations of their ignorance and arrogance.Her defence force is at a numerical disadvantage but,very professional,she has flourished in all departments,fields and sectors of sport,buisness,and arts.Unlike some,she did not have to fight a war to win her independence.I feel as an outsider looking in this nation concentrates more on caring for it's people rather then becoming great in the eyes of the world.5 stars for a young nation that has achieved so much in so little time.
