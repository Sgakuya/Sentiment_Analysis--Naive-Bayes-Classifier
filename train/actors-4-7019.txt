I agree with most of the people on this board- Christain Slater has amazing potential as an actor. He has proven that he can play just about any role: action, romance, drama, western, etc. I first saw him in Young Guns II as the cocky Arkansas Dave who rode with Billy the Kid. He was also good in the romance Untamed Heart . He gave another great performance in the action film, Broken Arrow . However, in my opinion, Slater was simply too good to stick with supporting roles. Finally, in 2000, he filmed The Contender and he was great as the young and naiive U.S. Congressmen who is encircled in a political battle. It gave me hope that Christian would overcme both his poor film choices and his personal issues. As Castlebee said, if Christain Slater wishes to be remembered as an actor, low budget independent films will not do it.
