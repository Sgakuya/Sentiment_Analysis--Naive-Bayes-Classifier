Well.....before I didn't think that JJ was gonna be able to step it up and make in the NBA.....but now I have a bit of a change of heart. Redick has scored a new career high every single year. Last year vs. Wake he had 38 and this year vs. Texas he has 41. He's proven that he's worthy of a high draft pick. He has proven once again that he is a well rounded player......but now he's an even MORE rounded player. He's improved so much from last year. Everyone expected an upset against Texas....but instead Duke blew them out and Redick stepped it up and he shined. He contributes so much to the Duke Bluedevil offense and he also contributes to the defense. His defense is so much better this year. It has really and truly improved. Now I'm still wondering if he is going to be able to defend anyone like Allen Iverson or anyone like that. He's still got a lot to work on before he's up to par on defending an NBA allstar. So that question is still there. But Redick is a big time player and has proven to me and many others that he is capable of "hangin with the big boys" UPDATE: Ha! First career dunk was WEAK......LMAO....that's alright tho. Dukies are now 15-0 keep it up boys! JJ has to keep shootin threes when he has that shot......he does chunk some up there...........he needs to stop chunkin some up there
