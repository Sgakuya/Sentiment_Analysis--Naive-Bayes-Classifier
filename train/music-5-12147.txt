I absolutely love this CD. I saw Prince in concert on 6/24 and was given a free copy of it. Oh my goodness, he's jammin'! Jazzy grooves, intelligent lyrics, sensual and fun. My favorites: Illusion, Coma..., different sound, especially in the chorus; Call my name, very sweet; The Marrying Kind, fun to groove to and What do u want me to do?-I LOVE this one. I have to admit that I prejudged the album because of some of his most recent releases that I was not too thrilled about, I think he may have been experimenting with what people may or may not like (think Rainbow Children) but I was wrong about Musicology. I would highly recommend it (and see his show while you still have the chance as well!).
