I feel sorry for all the young folks who never had the oppertunity to see the Big O in his prime. before Jordan, this player was considered the best NBA player of all time. at 6' 5 and close to 235 lbs. Oscar was the first true big guard . playing the point he was unstoppable. I'm 47 years old, have been watching the NBA since 1965. NO ONE besides Oscar has averaged a triple-double over a full season. a stat that everyone just loves in todays' NBA. and his defense was fantastic. the battles w/ Jerry West was awesome to see, pure pleasure. in my opinion, the 2nd best guard all time. between Jordan and Magic.
