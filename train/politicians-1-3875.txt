As a native Texan, I would like to discuss Ws history. He started an oil company in Midland that cost his investors, Daddy's buddies, hundreds of thousands of dollars. That company was later bought by one of Daddy's buddies who promptly installed W on its Board of Directors. Ran for State Office in the 70's and lost due to his Ivy league image and his campaign rally at a West Texas University with free beer. Later, he bought into the ownership of the Texas Rangers Baseball Club for $600,000, and was installed as the Club President by another of Daddy's buddies, who was actually the majority investor. The Rangers wanted a new stadium so Bush et all went and convinced the City of Arlington to raise their portion of the State Sales Tax to finance the construction. This boosted the value of the Club and when the Rangers were sold W netted 15 million. Sweet, huh? Or, how about that military service in the 60's during that little armed conflict in Southeast Asia? Seems W was able to leapfrog past 100s of applicants and become a pilot for the Texas National Guard helped again by, yep you guessed it, Daddy's buddies. Then he transferred to the Georgia Guard so he could work on a political campaign there. The only problem, no one recalls or has any record that he ever showed to fullfill his obligation. I wonder if W can spell AWOL? In the 90s he ran for Governor and won. His first official act of office was to sign a bill that eliminated the State Vehicle Emmission Inspection Service which was contracted out just the previous year to an independent businessman who had invested a ton of money and his trust in the State. No Vehicle Emmission test and later the bussinessman won a lawsuit against the State for over 140 million dollars. There is more, but I am out of time. I am not a member of the Democrat Party, only a small business person and I have to go back to work so I can pay my Personal Property taxes that went up after W lowered the School portion of that tax at the state level. I just don't know what people see in this guy? Yeah a great guy to have a beer with, but the single most powerfull position in the World? Oh, by the way, while W was with the Rangers he traded Sammy Sosa.
