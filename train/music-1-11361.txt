If Best Buy wasn't the best electronic store out there, I would say it was the worst store PERIOD just for playing this disc constantly inside their store. These guys must have the same producers and engineers as Britney! They both sound exactly alike....which means they both sound just equally bad. Overuse of futuristic keyboard sounds, lame beats, and now, less actual singing form the boys....WHICH BRINGS NSYNC's musical abilities to an even new LOW!!!! Just when you though these guys couldn't get anymore musically talentless, HERE COMES CELEBRITY! Let's hope for the world's sake and sanity, they won't be celebrities for long!!!!
