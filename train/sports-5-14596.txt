I've been watching pro football for 36 years and Snake was the best passer that I've ever seen. In an era when quarterbacks called their own plays and challenged the defense by throwing the ball down the field, he was a truly a peerless field general. As a Raider fan, I was never more confident then when the team trailed by two touchdowns going into the 4th quarter and the Snake was calling the plays. He was simply money in the bank. His four touchdown fourth quater against the Saints on Monday Night Football was just one in the great many comebacks the only Stabler appeared capable of pulling off. He seemed to be able to do it every week. Why he has not been elected to the Pro Football Hall-of-Fame is one of the great mysteries and travesties of sports. A much better quarterback than Bradshaw, Griese, or Tarkenton who were all elected in their first years of eligibility. Long live the Snake!!!
