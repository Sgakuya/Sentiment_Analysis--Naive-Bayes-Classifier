Vancouver rocks! My favorite thing about it is Stanley Park which is in my opinion the best city park in the world. This park easily could have been prime real estate but instead hundreds of acres of thick forest with big beautiful trees right on the edge of downtown was set aside surrounded by a magnificent harbor, beaches (you can actually swim here), views of impressive mountains that are very close by, and a shimmering postmodern skyline. I would reccommend either getting a bike or strapping on a pair of rollerblades and skate around the perimeter of the park along the seawall, one of my fondest memories I must say. The shopping here is decent and the people are fun loving, a lot of transients relocated from other parts of Canada among lots of people from Hong Kong who moved in with their British passports, therefore it offers quite a bit of diversity. Dining here is OK (I would say food is better in Montreal) for such a young city though this place is really taking off and seems to have a promising future. Downfalls, this is the only large city I've been to that doesn't have a highway/freeway to bring you into town, leaving you to navigate city streets - Good Luck! You can clearly see the division between wealth and poverty in this city and although most of the Vancouver is prosperous and clean stay away from East side of downtown, it's a miserable dirty place, which is why you see contradicting remarks below - what a clean city - what a dirty place, well actually it's both, just know where your going. Overall this is undoubtedly one of the worlds most beautiful cities and it keeps getting better for the most part.
