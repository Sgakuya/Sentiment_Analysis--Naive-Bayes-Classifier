Though 'The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy' was written in the 1980s, the Guide of the title foreshadows Rate-It-All in some ways. The Guide resembles a conventional encyclopedia (in proto-notebook-PC form) but like RIA is more irreverent and entertaining. Also more superficial. The guide's major selling point is having the words don't panic written on the cover, implying it succeeds due to clever merchandising rather than superior merit. In short, a mixed bag; but a resource tool that may be more useful than a dry reference book, at times. The novel also includes a Babel Fish (small organisms that, placed in your ear, will translate any language 'in the universe') a ship that travels through space and time by exploiting the unique mathematical patterns that only exist in restaurants ('Bistromath') and many other strange, funny, fascinating ideas. You can't do much better than this series if you're looking for funny/serious (i.e. not escapist) science fiction. These were the very first science fiction books I read, and I haven't read better SF since. The last two books aren't as good; the second one (The Restaurant at the End of the Universe) was the funniest, maybe the best of the series.
