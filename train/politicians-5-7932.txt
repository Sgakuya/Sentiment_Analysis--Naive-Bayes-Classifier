The last truly great president we ever had. Now Bush is completely undermining every decision this great man made, and is undoing the good things he did. Damn shame. Oh and the New Deal and first hundred days, without a doubt, saved america from being stuck in the depression for ever. He is deffinetly turning in his grave right now. And one more thing, he didn't start socailism, just socail security, which is now going to be lost the next time the stock market crashes or even falls on rough times. Carl Marx started socailism. You can't deny he was a great presient, he was elected to 4 terms, by an absolute landslide every single time, and one them winning all but 2 states. Don't mess with FDR.
