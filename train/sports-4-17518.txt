Love them or Hate them (I like them), no other NFL club has the mystique of the Raiders. Some of this has to do with the best uniforms in all of sports. Some of this has to do with Madden and Al Davis. Some of this has to do with their pscycho fans. And Some of this has to do with the rousing Raiders theme song you hear on those old NFL films (where voice of God John Facenda is narrating) and you see Darryl lamonica hurl an 80-yard bomb to Warren Wells or see Jack Tatum unleash a punishing hit. Though they have been down of late, I am a firm believer that the NFL is High on the Hog when the Raiders are winning.
