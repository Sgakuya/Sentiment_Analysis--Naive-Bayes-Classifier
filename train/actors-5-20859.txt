I like Hennessy a lot. I think her characters are filled with emotion and feeling. She hasn't done many movies that I know of and may become a huge TV star only. Many have done this in the past but most seem to move on to movies as fast as they can. I hope she keeps getting good roles on television but would be just as happy to see her move to the big screen. She can do comedy just as well as drama. Very talented and deserving of a high ranking. Her time on Law and Order was the pinnacle for that show. I still enjoy it but the best assistant will always be her. I wish they would bring her back. Damn drunk drivers!
