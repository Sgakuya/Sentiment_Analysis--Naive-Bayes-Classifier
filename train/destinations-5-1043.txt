Absolutely and unequivocally the very best country in the world. And the reasons why.. 1. As a european colony it's only two hundred years old. We haven't totally depleted our natural resources, nor do we have cities with 300 year old slum areas. 2. We have 20 million people in a land the size of the United States or Western Europe. In the centre there are cattle stations the size of Belgium with only 10 or so people working or living on the station. In short, Australia is not crowded. At all. 3. We are the worlds most successful multicultural society. This makes for interesting food, interesting nightlife, and a fantastic fusion of influences from all over (although predominately Mediterranean/South East Asian). 4. We have a fantastic climate- Sydney is the worlds most temperate city (for all you American speakers- that is where the temperature range is extremely small). 5. We have a very active sporting culture. Although the US influence (McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Taco Bell) has made our kids fatter than ever, most kids (and adults) in Australia play some kind of sport. We have the weather for it 6. Underlying all this, we have a stable British backbone in our system of law and government. We are forced to vote, which means that lobby groups have no power in Australia, because every Australian has a say in the State Federal Elections. 7. Our crime rate is low, our economy is stable, and underwritten by our massive natural resources. Basically, we are not old and shabby like Europe. We are not totally screwed up, violent, self-destructing, fat turkeys like the United States. We don't barb wire our white townships like South Africa. We are surrounded by ocean, have no borders, and no worries. The very best country in the world. I don't know why some of us ever leave it.
