Coach Nutt may not be the best in the world but to say he is bad is stupid. Coach Nutt is just now starting to get all his players that he recruited on board. Coach Hatfeild left the program with the cupboard bare in the talent department. After that class left there was nothing there. Coach Ford did a fair job of recruiting but still could not get the big time players. Coach Nutt is beginning to turn that around. Give it time they will be there. And for those who like stats there are several and these are among them. Since 1998, best overall record western division, Arkansas 39-23 for a .629 percent win. Next closest, Alabama with 37-24 for .607 percent. The herald Alabama, Auburn, and LSU not so go huh. At least not the last five years. The most bowl appearances, not wins, but apearances, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee have 5. The herald Alabama, Auburn and LSU only have 3. Best home record in the SEC Arkansas 29-5 .853 percent. Next Tennessee 27-5 .843. The herald Alabama,LSU,and Auburn are 23-11 23-11 and 22-12. Not so good huh? So quote stats all you want but these are here as well. Arkansas has not been the best but for the last five years, like it or not, they have consistently been in the top part of the SEC in the win column.....
