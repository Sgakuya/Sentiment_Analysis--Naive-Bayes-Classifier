Some people have been unfair on Italy. They dislike it cos of the past military history in the WW1 and 2. Italy is an old country..and its people always developed their pros and cons like everywhere... Plus not every italian is the same, like anywhere else people are all different and have different opinion both politically and on other aspects. so dont be unfair ! Judge using your brain Italy has got wonderful food, just think about pizza you eat...well italians invented it. Da vinci, Botticelli, Raffaello, Michelangelo, they are all italian and many more... plus the land... think about the wonderful mountains and historical places...
