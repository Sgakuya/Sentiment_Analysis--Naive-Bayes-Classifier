I'm not here to talk about Drew's movies (although i've seen and loved them all!) I want to tell how she inspires me. At a young age I went through some horrible experiences and had to go to therapy for a long time. I was drinking alot and did drugs as well. But she was always the one i looked up to. After what she had been through in her lifetime and turned out to be a beautiful and intellegent and of course greatest actress of all time. I found strength to give life another chance.. I love Drew. It would be the greatest honor to ever meet her and thank her for that inspiration. i think it is so cool that she is dating Tom Green he is awesome and sooo funny it would be cool to kick with him for a day and just laugh at all the crazy things he does. good luck to both of you in your relationship!!!! and Drew, I'm a picies too my birthday is the day before yours i think that is really cool
