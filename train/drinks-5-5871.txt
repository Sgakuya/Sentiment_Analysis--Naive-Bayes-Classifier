Ever see such a group of people? In rapture over a carbonated beverage? Well, a few times each year, my family would hop in the car and drive down Woodward Avenue in Detroit, to take the tour of the Vernor's factory. Why? At the end of the tour, we would get a tall cup with Vernor's AND a scoop of Sander's vanilla ice cream. Get away from me! I'm not sharing! The last couple of inches of a Vernor's float IS nectar-like. Back in those days, Vernor's was aged in oak, as it said on the bottle. Vernor's was a way of life...you could actually get yourself beat-up for saying you liked Coke better. And those stories you just read about how their Mom's would heat some up for them when they weren't feeling so good? Well, it's true..my Mom used to do that too. A lot of memories and love attached to Vernor's. Sure, it's an acquired thing and we can't expect the rest of you to understand, but until everyone converts, let us have our fantasy about Vernor's being the King of the Royal Soft Drink family.
