As much as I wanted to like this movie, I couldn't. Yea, it was funny and yeah it had its dratic moments but over all it didn't feel like it left me with any true moral message. What? Don't go on the road with a band? Do go on the road with a band? Don't do drugs? Do use drugs? Don't use women? Do use women? I don't know. This film didn't do much for me. It left me kind of empty. Its performances however were great. The entire cast was incredible which is the only reason I gave this movie a two. It was done very well. It just lacked in the heart department. I rate movies on the overall feel I get when I leave the theater depending on the genre. With this genre and this type of film, I just didn't feel moved in the least! All I can say is that it was masterfully made. Beyond that, it was an empty shell of a movie.I really wanted to love Almost Famous. Too bad.
