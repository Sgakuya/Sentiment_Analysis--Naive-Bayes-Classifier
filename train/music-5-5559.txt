Released in 1980 and produced by perfectionist Mutt Lange, Back In Black is a landmark release in its hard rock/metal genre as reflected by the singles which enjoyed huge crossover success: Shook Me All Night Long and the title track. There is not a weak song in the bunch which is even more impressive when one considers that this full-length effort was released a mere five months after the death of the band's singer Bon Scott. Some of the better tracks (other than those already noted) include Hells Bells and Shoot To Thrill. Guitarist Angus Young was at his best, and new singer Brian Johnson filled in admirably and became the new voice for the band. The bottom line is that Back In Black is rightfully considered one of the best rock releases of all time.
