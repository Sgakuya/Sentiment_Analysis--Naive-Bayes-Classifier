I've lived in three other states besides WV and would move back there in a heartbeat if there were jobs. Currently living in NC and talk about a back-woods, in-bred state. These people are always making cracks on West Viginia and still think it's part of Virginia. Tennessee was the same way. Yes WV has its ills but so does every other state in the county. I've been in parts of NC that are far worse than any in WV, including Welch! You people keep cracking on WV and spreading the news that it's a suck-hole state. That will just keep more of you retards out. I just wish you would stay away during ski season so I wouldn't have to spray so many of you dumb-sh!t'$ on the blacks.
