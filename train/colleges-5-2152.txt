Boston College is great school for many majors -- and very good in others. The Philosophy department's undergraduate offerings, for example, are widely considered to be the best in the country. World-renowned profs teaching small- to mid-sized classes. A big school, with a smaller-school feel. You can't beat the cultural and entertainment value of Boston. Few schools combine the sports with the academics -- and also provide an amazingly fun, interesting, vital backdrop like the city of Boston, which puts the best cultural opportunities (museums, libraries, concerts, lectures, historical sightseeing) in America within walking distance. I could go on and on.
