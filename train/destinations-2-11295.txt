I was there on business once. I do not know why anyone would want to come to Dallas for vacation. It offers nothing you can't see anywhere else, except for the Sixth Floor museum. Six flags, large shopping malls, Best Buy? Every part of the country has those types of places. Like many cities in the sunbelt, there is no real sense of history or culture. Much of Dallas actually feels like the countryside, because it is so spread out. The downtown area is dead after 7:00 PM, even on weekends. The scenery around Dallas is non-existant, nothing but flat praries. People who think that Dallas is a great place to visit have not been to a real city. Anyway if you're in the area I would go to the Stockyards in Fort Worth. They have some interesting western culture there.
