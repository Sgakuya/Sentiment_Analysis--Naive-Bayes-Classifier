This the best board game invented if you have a lot of time on your hands. My friends and I have killed many a boring day by playing Risk. I think the that they should be playing this on Survivor instead of backgammon. That would probably break up quite a few of their alliances. This game has every thing strategy, planning, luck, defeat, glory, and battle. Some people think this a game for men with Napoleon complexes, that is bull I know many females who love this game and contrary to what most people think this game does not promote bad feelings among people. I find that when it is played everybody feels like they have had an inexpensive entertaining evening. Sure I realize not everybody is going to like this game because everbody has different taste so if you do not like risk I hope you find a game more to your liking.
