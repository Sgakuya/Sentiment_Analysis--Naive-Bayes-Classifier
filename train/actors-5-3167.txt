It's been a long time since I have seen an actor play a role that was so conviencing. I have often been dissappointed after spending good money on movies with men having long drawn careers and little talent. Until I came across 'L.A. Confidential.' Russell Crowe consumed his character so well, I found myself doing research on him. And found, an array of movies that I have not seem before. (of which I plan to see very soon) I did see him recently in 'Gladiator' which bore some resemblance to 'Braveheart', however I don't remember crying with so much happiness with Mel Gibson than I did with Russell Crowe. Crowe has a gift and I am grateful he choose to share it with us.
