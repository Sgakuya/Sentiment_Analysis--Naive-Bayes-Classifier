Well after at I believe they could have warned us the day we were joining it, that the bill would be coming so soon. Not only that, but they charged us when we both thought in the ad it said free hook up for july. We tried to tell them, and they wouldn't budge on the charge. We also had to pay 100 dollar deposit and if any bill is late, we lose that deposit. The other reason we got nextel was because of the walkie talkie feature, only to find out that if we try to connect to his sister, we get an out of network charge for that. Talk about a scam. EDIT: Just lowering my rating to 1. DO NOT BUY NEXTEL. They are the biggest scam-con artists I have ever met. I tried to pay over the internet and then I get 3 days later than it will take 10 days to process and if it will be late to find an alternate way of payment. I call to tell them I will be putting the bill in the mail and to cancel the internet option only to find out that even if I put it inthe mail today (the 10th and it's due the 15th) that it won't register for 7 days and it will be considered late to them. In other words I lose my 100 dollar deposit, because they're so slow at entering the check into their system.
