Add me to the list... started using version 8 and have patched and upgraded through 9.4.3. Finally threw it out. Between the software crashing while creating simple photo albums, and crashing during rendering, and now, it gives capturing errors, claiming "aspect ratio changes" (even though three other software capture programs have no trouble). In the years I have worked with Pinnacle, I have only completed a couple of the projects I have started. The software looks great and is easy to use... but if you actually want to finish a project, be prepared for rendering problems and DVD burning problems like you cannot imagine.
