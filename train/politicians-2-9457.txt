This guy had his own ideas, and plenty of them- good or bad. His inaug. speach was long-winded and he caught neumonia and died in 1 month. It would have been interesting to see what he would have accomplished or not, had he stayed a 4 or 8 term. He is tied in some way to Kennedy, in that we DON'T know if much GREATER changes would have happened with an extended Presidency. Perhaps, nothing much would have come, but no one will know for sure. His lack of term justifies a low rating. His value is NOT in the term itself, but rather, in the determination upon history; What difference does it make which routes a President chooses to pursue for the nation/world policy? Which new ideas are followed? And which policies does the President pursue which have public support- does it matter? The choice for direction and policy, influence or ignorance, repub. or democrat or whig,etc. values are his legacy. He stands as a Presidential monument to : What history can be or NOT be. (and what IS the influence of the man chosen for President.) ..... (or perhaps, he's just a guy who died after only a month- You decide) .....
