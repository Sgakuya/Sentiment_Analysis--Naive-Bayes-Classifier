J.J. Redick is the best there is out there! He is the most worthy of player of the year in the ACC. When you all talk about how 'bad' his defense is you only look @ him when his guy has the ball. Have you ever looked @ his off-the-ball defense before?...He denys the ball almost better than anybody I know. His offense speaks for itself. SwOoSh! And yes he does have his bad games, doesn't everyone?...but when he does; you better believe that Melchionni, Ewing and everybody else for that matter are going to step up their game! That's what makes Duke such an awesome team...physicaly and emotionally! >I LOVE DUKE!....And in response to ACCfanatic89, I agree w/ you about the whole LOOKS thing, but I have to disagree w/ the cocky part. That is just part of JJ's personality after he hits a big-time shot, thats a reaction...No different then Eric Williams beating his chest while running down the court after making a lay-up, or Rashad McCants doin that triangle thing w/ his hands after he makes a 3. That's just a part of collage basketball...and candy06, why do you care if he has a girlfriend or not?...It's not like he even knows you exist.
