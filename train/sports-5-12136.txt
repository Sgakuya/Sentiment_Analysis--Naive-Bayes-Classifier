I have personally attended 34 of the 35 games he started at Arizona State. I would put my livlihood on the line to say there isn't a better QB in this draft. Sure he isn't going to scramble for 60 yards a game, but his ability to dodge people in the pocket is impressive. His arm strength is even better than advertised - I'd wager he can throw a deep ball better than any starting QB in the league not named Culpepper or Manning RIGHT NOW. His throws also have an uncanny touch to them and are very catchable. Plus he has a personality devoid of cliches, will always say what is on his mind, and has been nothing but professional from day one in Tempe. HE WILL BE A STEAL no matter where he goes.
