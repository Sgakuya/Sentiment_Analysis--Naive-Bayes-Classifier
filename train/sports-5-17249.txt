Grew up in Houston in the 60's. The ritual was to gather around the TV after church and watch Coach Landry and Staubach lead the team to victory every Sunday. I guess that's now the Golden Age, when players played HARD to win and the salary was secondary to being on the team. It was not uncommon to run into Cowboy players in town or on a hunting trip. I consider team loyalty to be an important part of character (I've also been an Astro's fan forever too...) and relished the Super Bowl victories in the 90's after being mocked for terrible seasons in the 80's. I agree with the concensus that Jerry Jones is an ass and should go. Some of the current players need to grow up and move on to allow some kids who want to play football on the team. Nevertheless, the Dallas Cowboys concept created by Mr. Murchison and my memories of great Sunday afternoons growing will always be the reason that they will always be America's Team, and my favorite team.
