Let's be real fellas. The Jaguars are a decent team. The only thing keeping the Jags undefeated right now is the souped up Indy defense, and still they did well. In all reality, the Jaguars are one of the underated teams that will turn heads pretty soon. Even though they havn't been to the playoffs in a while, doesn't mean they suck. I've seen the teams play, and I know what teams suck. The Jaguars are not one of them. The Jagaurs are playoff bound, and you know it, so just shutup about that. If they don't get to the super bowl real soon, I will be astonished. Think about it. The Jaguars were the only ones to beat the Colts in Indy last year, and that was with a less than par defense. This year, though they lost, the Jags have a much better defense, unfortunately so do the Colts. And as for no offense, I don't think so guys. It looks like a pretty solid team if you ask me.
