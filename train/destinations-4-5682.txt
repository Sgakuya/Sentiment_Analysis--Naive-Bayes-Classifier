There are so many things I like about Massachusetts that it's hard to name them all. The islands, Cape Cod, Boston, and western Massachusetts is very pretty. On the flip side there are a lot of things I don't like about Massachusetts (mostly driving related) such as traffic driving through Boston is a nightmare, the highway system with their outdated exit and enter system, but the biggest thing unfortunately I gotta say are the people. Now maybe I should say mostly people in Boston as opposed to the state as a whole but in terms of encounters with strangers I give Mass (Boston) a very low rating. They don't call them Massholes for nothing!
