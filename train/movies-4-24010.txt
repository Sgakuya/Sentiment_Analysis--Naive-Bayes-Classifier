Well well well...this is another interesting and very thought out movie by Stephen Speilberg. THis movie I guess u can say is like a drama...The movie is based on the future and has unrealistic events and objects that we do not hav in our day and age...For instance the movie is about a people trying to create a robot that looks and feels like a real human being.The inventors usually specialize in adults that don't hav ne feeling or emotion..but 1 man said he wanted one of these things to act, feel, and hav emotion like an ordinary human does. HE made an example of a child's love 4 his mother...(everlasting)..SO he created a young boy...(haley jole osmit) and this boy had real love 4 the person who was called his mother..But then she decided she coudnt hav him nemore n she let him escape...b/c if she gave him back to the peeps who created him he would of been destroyed n she didnt want to do that..and he heard the story of pinnoccio..and how he became a real boy...so David(haley) went looking for the blue fairy to turn him into a real boy....this lead into an adventure packed journey...the ending is very wonderful and u will leave with a smile on ur face...I know i felt like crying =*( a bunch of times but i didnt want ne1 to c me..hehe...but it did hav an impact on me...and on u too....its a lil confusin and it goes on longer than u suspect it would but its worth it...Go c this i recommend it!! : )
