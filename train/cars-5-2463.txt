How is anyone going to compare cars worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to a Supra? I wouldn't trade mine for anything else. It's worth every penny I have put into it. In a few more months, my Supra will reach the triple crown and I bet my first born child I could take down any of the cars rated higher than the Supra. As for talk of the McLaren F1 being the fastest, I beg to differ, the Dodge Viper Hennessy is. Look it up in any Road and Track. If anyone is going to belittle others out there, research your information first. The Toyota Supra is the best car for the money, sure you can buy a Z28 or a T/A, then you'll be driving the same car as both your next door neighbors. Being rare is worth something too. Oh and for those of you who don't like the way the car or the wing looks, it's called aerodynamics.
