Clinton was the best damn president this country has ever had...PERIOD! One could work where work was available and make an honest living. Never mind the fact that he had marital problems. This country was in good fiscal shape and young people weren't sent off to war to die over the price of oil. No body died because Clinton lied about having an extra-marital affair with Monica. I wish there was a way for him to be president again. AND...if the US constitution is changed to benefit a Nazi-sympathizer like Arnold Schwartzeneggar, then it can be changed to allow Clinton to run again. I'd give his tenure as President 100 gold stars if I could!
