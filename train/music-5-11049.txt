Mariah's Greatest Hits album is an expansive and inclusive collection of chart topping hits from the peak of her career throughout the 1990s. Most of the songs on this album can also be found on Mariah's #1's album released in '98 but this GH album also contains material from her 1999 Rainbow release like Heartbreaker and Thank God I Found You . ALL the songs on this album were number one or were near the top of the charts when they were first released. If you don't have Mariah's #1's album yet, skip it and buy this collection instead. What's really good about this GH compilation is the fact that most songs have been left untouched (with the exception of the So-So-Def remix of All I Want for Christmas - a bonus track), unlike Whitney Houston's greatest hits album which contains some of the most dreadful remixes in recent memory. Buy Mariah's GH album, you'll be glad you did!
