Combien de temps? Combien de temps till A Perfect Circle gets OUT of the jukebox in my head! I dreamed about that song last night! This album is great. My favorite song is of course A Perfect Circle followed by Talk About the Passion followed by Shaking Through. The song Radio Free Europe had an amazing video. And you know what's utterly amazing? They did this album while they were living in a zillion-year-old run down CHURCH! I'm not kidding, R.E.M was that poor! How many of todays crappy bands could pull off something like Murmur? I think not. I think nought. Get the point? Murmur is GREAT! Medgar Evers, I think you made a mistake by getting Catapult . TRhat's not a good first-song-to-listen-too. Too much like Queens Headlong ---fast, feel-good, and overkill. Overall, Murmur is abfab. Take care, everyone!
