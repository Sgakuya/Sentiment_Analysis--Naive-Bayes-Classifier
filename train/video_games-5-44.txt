probebly one of the best productions ever in the FPS game world. it's not too hard (but who am i to judge? i don't think aliens vs. predator is as impossible as some people thought), but it's game play is just amaizing. it uses every surprising, dramatic and classic trick you can imagine. you drive a train when suddenly something breaks and it loses control and start rushing towards a radioactive pit, monsters blow up doors and walls to get to you, the walls shake with might when you know there is a huge monster in the centeral hall, creating the fear it might break through the wall every second, elevators break down, bridges collapse, monsters appear behind your back. the game introduce you the dangers so you might have something to fear, a dying scientist warns you about a beast ahead, another one say that to kill the shark you must get into the water with him, other scientist screaming open the blast door, it's our only way out when suddenly the officer near the controls get killed by a mutated scientist. this game just keeps surprising you every second, creates a great atmosphere and challenge you every step.
