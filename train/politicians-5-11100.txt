One story attributed to Zell Miller is about the time he found poisonous copperhead snakes in his garden. Being the family man he is, he was caught in a little dilemma. Should he let the copperheads live, thereby appeasing potential animal activists? Or should he slay the copperheads with his shovel? Despite earning the wrath of animal activists who later heard about his deed, Miller reasoned to them that he picked the latter because of the potential threat of having these snakes possibly hurting his wife and grandchildren who often went to the garden. In any case, I feel this illustrates the essence of why Zell Miller is so respected by so many Americans. Moreover, Miller has shown why he is an excellent U.S. Senator in that he is willing not to tow the party line in favor of doing what he feels is right for his country. Whether a person agrees or disagrees with this man, he has an independent streak for which others from both parties ought to respect and admire.
