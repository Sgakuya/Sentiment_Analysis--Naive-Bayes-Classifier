Comparing the Beatles Rubber Soul to NSYNC and 98 degrees is ignorant. The Beatles had so much more soul than that. George Harrison's If I Needed Someone is a masterpiece! It's my new favorite song! And other songs like the Word, Girl, etc. are absolutley wonderful. How can you give this less than 5 stars? If you do, you have problems. I mean saying the lyrics and guitar playing are amuature? Have you ever heard George play the guitar? Apparantley not. What is this world coming to when ignorant people say that a Beatles Album is poor? ( Some people have the worst taste in music) I LOVE GEORGE HARRISON! P.S. Did anyone know that in the background of GIRL the Beatles are singing tit-tit-tit-tit ? That humored me.
