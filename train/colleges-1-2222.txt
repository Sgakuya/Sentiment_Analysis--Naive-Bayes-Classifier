What you have to understand about this school, is that it's basically The Shining with a thousand hippies. Socially, it's a void of drug-induced stupor, or a fashion show. The instructors are Manhattanites, the most pretentious of all types of intellectual poseurs. The college President markets his scholarly persona like a prostitute. Like all conservatives with an under-evolved social consciousness, the student body, believing itself to be ultra-liberal, clings to the division it creates in society by escaping any responsibility, and reinforces every negative ism in the book in the effort to oppose it, said escape being magnified by the terrible geographical isolation of the place, which I find reminiscent of stereotypical horror movie brainwashing backgrounds.
