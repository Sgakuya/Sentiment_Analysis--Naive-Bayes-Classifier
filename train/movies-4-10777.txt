This movie probably only deserves three stars, but I was so shocked that it wasn't terrible that I have to give it four. Let me make some disclaimers: I can't stand Brendan Fraser. The guy just annoys me. But I think Elizabeth Hurley is drop-dead gorgeous and I'd probably happily sit through a movie if it consisted of nothing but her walking around in different outfits. So maybe my dislike of Brendan Fraser and my infatuation with Elizabeth Hurley kind of balance each other out. Anyway, as I said, I expected Bedazzled to be awful, and it turned out to have a few things going for it (in addition to Elizabeth Hurley, who did in fact walk around in a wide variety of pulse-quickening outfits) - there are some amusing scenes, it moves along quickly, and it doesn't try to be anything more than a very light comedy. So if you're in the mood for a movie that aims very low but hits the target, and you're not looking for an Oscar-caliber cinematic masterpiece that will challenge and amaze you, don't be afraid to rent Bedazzled.
