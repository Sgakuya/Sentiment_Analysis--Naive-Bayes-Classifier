well i first saw aeropostale on mtvs battle of the sexes... anyway i have to agree they seem to be a poor rip off of they higher companys and alot of there stuff is a huge poor rip off of af and ae but for some things like there cargo shorts and pants they are like exactly identicel to ae af shorts and pants but for 1/4 the price... and right now everything in the store was boot cut and i hate that i think its stupid to do that and i dont think there jeans are that long lasting i got a pair of there jeans that were my fave but started to fall apart afterr 8 months but for 20 bux i think they served there purpose and the people there are nice un like af but honestly i think aeropostlae is more of a 10-14 year old store except on stuff like polos and cargo shorts.... im changing there rating from 3-4 because they have such great prices the other day i was there and there were hoodies for 12 and shorts for 6 so its a good buy
