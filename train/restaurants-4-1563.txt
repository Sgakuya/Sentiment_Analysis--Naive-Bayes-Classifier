Chicken! First, the rumor about the fake chicken being the reason Kentucky Fried Chicken became simply KFC is false. It was having to pay fees to Kentucky. Now, their chicken strips and popcorn chicken simply rule! They need better fries, but their chicken is so great, it doesn't matter. That's not to say that their potato wedges aren't enjoyable, they are. Drinks are typically good as well. Good service is typical. Highly recommended! I have to take away a point for the silliness that is Kitchen Fresh Chicken. That's a lame name for a fast food restaurant! Like most of your great restaurant chains, the designs--both internal and of the packaging--are bright and creative. Lots of nice primary colors. Some of KFC's older commercials were pretty amusing as well. I don't really remember marketing tie-ins such as toys. The logo is alright, but the older one with the 'bucket of chicken' was better.
