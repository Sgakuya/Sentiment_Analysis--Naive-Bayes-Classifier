Nintendo owns the handheld industry and here's one brilliant reason why. This great console is simply an amazing step forward in portable gaming and electronic technology. The processor is actually 32-bit (the same as Sony's Playstation 1) and can easily support 3D graphics. The design is clean and easy to use and comes in many bright and upbeat colors. The screen is clean and easy to see under most lighting conditions. The game library is simply amazing. You can purchase all of the classic Mario games from the past on here. The newest of the Pokemon series are here. Kirby. Zelda. Donkey Kong. And, yes, Sega's even produced the amazing Sonic Advance series. There are also new Pac-Man titles, Crash, Frogger, Spyro, and many more of gaming's best franchises. More titles are still on their way.
