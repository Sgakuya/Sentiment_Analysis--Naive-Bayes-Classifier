Robin Williams is a great actor and when I saw him act in Patch Adams he reminded me of my dad. The reason is because he made people smile even if he didn't know them he would try his best to get to know them and make them happy as can be and that is just how my dad is. I like the way Robin adds a smile to everyones day and makes things seem better then what they are just to see u smile. I have never met Robin in person but the way he acts in his movies and in interviews on talk shows and other shows he always has a smile and always has something funny to say to make your day. That is why I really like Robin as a actor.
