If there was a team that would earn the label The People's Team, the San Antonio Spurs would come to mind. The Spurs are a high-class, fan-friendly organization that is not only successful on the basketball court, but also do great work in the community. David Robinson has reached legendary status in San Antonio beyond his basketball accomplishments. The team is fundamentally sound with good coaching and a brilliant front office. Gregg Popovich stresses to his players to play defense, and that has translated to many wins. Ticket prices to a Spurs game rank among the lowest in the league. The atmosphere at a Spurs game has the feel of a college game since they're in a small market, and the fanbase is very loyal. The Spurs have won 2 championships on a shoestring payroll, and are poised to win more with Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili making up their core.
