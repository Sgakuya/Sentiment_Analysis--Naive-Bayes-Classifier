I guess as will all products, there are people who love it and people who hate it. I love my Sirius Set up I have it in my house and in my car (same subscription) I have never had a problem with service, the people are all nice in there office, and the companies that they work with are all great. I have had it for 3 years now and I cant find anything that i dont like. I drive coast to coast once a month and I get continious reception. The programing is wonderful as well. I wish that Sirius aquired the baseball package, but I Will not switch to XM just for that. Sirius does carry alot of sports including the NFL package.(every game, Even Blackouts). I hope this helps some one make a decition
