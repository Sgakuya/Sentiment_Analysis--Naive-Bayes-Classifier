Ihop has to be the crappiest places I have ever eaten in my life. I have eaten at the one in Denver (Colorado) and they have the worst taste in food ever. I think, by far Ihop is gross and disgusting. Their ommelettes are disgusting, and they do not know how to make a crispy piece of bacon. I got a piece that was still runny, and very flimsy, not thin and crispy how we all like it! For your (Ihopanduhopforihop) comment on how we are all just narcissiticly impossible to live with-cant be happy for anything-even if your life depended on it-god forsaken-hell bent on making your reputation BAD-picky-eccentric-unhappy people. Because we are just needing some good service. That is false, and I could sue you for all youve got for that comment!
