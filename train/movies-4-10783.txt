Hmmm....how to describe this movie. Lets start with FUNNY! I laughed so hard I spilled my drink. TWICE! And I'm not normally a clutz. Next, I'd call it DUMB! This plot has been done to death. Don't expect much originality. Finally I'd call it SEXY! Yep, Elizabeth Hurley got my attention and kept it throughout the entire movie. With numerous costume changes from one revealing outfit to another, she made this movie a must see for every red blooded American male out there. Here's a tip. When she's in her office in the Nightclub, she's wearing a full length red dress with a slit all the way up to her...well you know. So watch very closely when she moves to sit behind her desk. WOW! I bet that makes it to the internet. (I hope).
