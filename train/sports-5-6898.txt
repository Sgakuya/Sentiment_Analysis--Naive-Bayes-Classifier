The Greatest. I have a tough time picking him or Michael Jordan as #1 All-Time NBA Player. I would take Chamberlain based on his unnatural stats. 100 Points in a game. Averaged 50.1 PPG in 1962. Also had incredible rebound totals and had they recorded blocked shots, he would probably be #1 there too. People that get 50 in a single game make headlines. For those who never saw the Big Dipper, think Shaq with more mobility and better conditioning, albeit they are about the same on the charity stripe. The only knock on him was that the Celtics always seemed to beat the Philly Warriors; however the 66-67 '76ers may have been one of the greatest teams of all time. Chamberlain was also a member of the Globetrotters, an outstanding volleyball player and almost signed to box Muhammad Ali. He went to Philadelphia' Overbrook High. A family friend of ours was his biology teacher. According to him, as a student, let's just say Wilt was a basketball phenom.
