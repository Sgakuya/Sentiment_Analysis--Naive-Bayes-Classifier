An endearing screen presence whose contributions were too few and too far between. In addition to the wonderful 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' (1947) and 'The Court Jester' (1956), Kaye should not be missed in 'Knock on Wood' (1954) and 'The Five Pennies' (1959), both inexplicably unrestored, the latter a serio-musical bio of jazz cornettist and band leader Loring 'Red' Nichols, with memorable musical moments alongside Louis Armstrong and performances of songs such as 'The Saints Come Marching In', 'Ragtime Lullaby' and 'The Five Pennies'. The lack of directorial focus makes difficult to recommend 'The Inspector General' (1949) and 'Me and the Colonel' (1958) for purchase in that either the comedy in the first and the drama in the other seem to be at odds with the performances. And yet there is always Kaye's skillful dancing in 'White Christmas' (1954) and his sincerity in 'Hans Christian Andersen' (1952). A much missed performer.
