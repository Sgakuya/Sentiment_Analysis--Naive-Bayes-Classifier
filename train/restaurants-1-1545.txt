My husband and I went to a local KFC (zip 83501) on a friday night at 7:30pm (dinner rush) and found there to be only one person running the inside. The boy either had to be new or extremely stupid. Once we made it to the front of the line we were asked to wait so he would be able to fill the orders that were backing up, and boy were they backing up. So for 15-20 minutes we waited at the register. The boy would stand and study the order for a very long time, move to the line and find that he had either forgotten or misunderstood the order and would return to the screen to study some more. Finally 6 or 7 more employees came in from outside to help, they must have noticed the line proceding well into the parking lot and thought maybe they'd better call their smoke break good and return back to work. The service was greatly lacking. I don't care to visit again.
