Thankfully the majority of fans on this page have better taste than the moderator who could not be more wrong in her insulting assessment of Stanwyck. Yes, there are many of us who have said WOW, what an incredible performance, The Lady Eve being a perfect example in which she gave just about one of the greatest performances given by any actress ever. In this classic she proved that she was not only a marvellous comedienne but incredibly sexy, something that Bette Davis could never have been accused of. She was without doubt the GREATEST actress NEVER to have won an Oscar. Moss Hart once told her that she would never win the award because, You make it look too easy. Some actress were considered great because they chewed the scenery, but Stanwyck, to quote her, I just did my job. Any of you detractors may notice that Stanwyck has just moved up to 4th place in the popularity poll. I suggest some of you take a look at The Lady Eve to see why many of us consider her The First Lady of the Screen Any fans are welcome to join my group, you will be more than welcome. www.groups.yahoo.com/group/MissBarbaraStanwyck
