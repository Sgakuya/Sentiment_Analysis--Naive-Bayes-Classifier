Garth's done it AGAIN!!! Not that we should be suprised though, he is the biggest selling solo artist of all time. This album takes every track he's done before and wraps it all up in 12 amazing songs. This is definetly the album that sums up Garth Brooks' music. From Why Ain't I Running to When You Come Back to Me Again , this is a very personal album and if there's one guy who can convey his feelings lyrically, it's Garth. If you're a Garth fan you'll love this album, if you're not, it'll open you up to a whole new world of music, he did that to me when he released No Fences...and I haven't look back since
