I don't know how many times I've heard the media call him stupid , idiot and metaphores connected with challenged thought process. Immediately after 9/11 the general public somehow realized that they were lied to about this person. Truth is most anyone who derrides President Bush is, at best, a college drop out or a liberal media mogul who, if you take away the stupid argument looses 75% of their vocabulary. Another not so well published truth is (thanks to the liberal media) former VP Al Gore attained more D's in his Yale studies than Goerge Bush had C's. The media called this Presidential adversary intelligent beyond imagination . They also overlooked all his misspeaks and idiotic statements. In any case, President Bush had won (yes, he did win the Florida recount 3 times) an election worth loosing. He is doing the best job possible with the cards dealt to him.
