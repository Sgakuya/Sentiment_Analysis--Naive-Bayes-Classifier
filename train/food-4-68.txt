It depends on *which* store brand. For those of you who live in LA, Private Selection, available at Ralph's, is a good, low-cost option (it might be available in other regions too, but I don't know the specifics). Their vanilla is pretty boring, but some their other flavors are generally terrific-- I particularly recommend New York Cherry Cheesecake (good cheesecake flavor, with tasty bits of crust), Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (more dough than most other brands), and Cinnamon Caramel Cashew Crunch. Thrifty's ice cream, sold at LA-area Rite-Aids, is also very good. Most of their flavors aren't that creative, but if you want something fairly basic, like mint chip or strawberry, Thrifty's is both delicious and cheap.
