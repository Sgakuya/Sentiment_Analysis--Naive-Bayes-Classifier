As previously mentioned, there isn't a great variety to go on, but as far as the Harry Potter films, I think he's terrific. It's been great to see how well he's developed as an actor, the emotion and dedication he brings to his role is very impressive. As far as him personally, I haven't met him but he seems remarkably down to earth and sweet for really any guy his age, to say the least one that rich and famous. Overall, I think he's perfect for where he is and will continue to develop to the point where in forty or so years, the children of the raters here will be rating him under the "Actors-Classic" category
