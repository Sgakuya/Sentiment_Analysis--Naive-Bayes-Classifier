This is the best album Nirvana ever did...it's kind of sad, though, because there are little red warning flags scattered all over it and nobody noticed them at all. All Apologies , Heart-Shaped Box , Francis Farmer (which is about Courtney Love), Radio Friendly Unit Shifter , and Serve the servants are all great songs. This was the first/last Nirvana album where Cobain really showed off his voice...let us know he actually had one. And like I said, there were little hints of his depression all over the album, and the entire world was too blind to notice them...it would be even nicer if we could say that this was the album that saved Kurt Cobain's life. Take care, everyone!
