At the moment, this is by far my favorite grocery store. There prices can be stiff sometimes, but it is well worth it. I have never had a bad experience in any Albertsons, the selection is great, they have a great bakery, and the meat section is wonderful too. The staff seems really nice too. I recommend Albertson's to everyone ! UPDATE: As I said earlier, the prices can be a little high, but I am saying a LITTLE, I don't know where some of these people live that claim that a loaf of bread is over 3 dollars or hot dogs are 5.79 a pack, they either read the ad wrong or the sticker wrong or they are totally exaggerating. I don't believe it at all...Albertson's has been around a long time and is a very large chain with a good reputation, if they charged prices like that they wouldn't be in business any more with all the tough competition out there.
