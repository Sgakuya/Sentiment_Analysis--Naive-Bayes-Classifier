One of the most acclaimed records of the late nineties isn't quite all it's cracked up to be. Sure, it's undeniablre this is a brilliant piece of art. But the record suffers from being overly ambitious. Therefore, the listener is forced to see the beauty through the individual songs, instead of the album as a whole. Each track builds up the listeners appetite more and more, but after listening the album in its entirety, the you are left feeling bloated and stuffed. Still, this is by no means a bad album, it's just difficult if you don't understand what it's going for. it's almost like it's something you have have to concentrate very hard on and master it. Once you do, it's actually a vey rewarding album.
