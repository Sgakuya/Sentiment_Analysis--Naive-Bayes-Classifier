I feel that Jesse is not trying to unite us in this situation.He has always tried to divide us and we all need to stand up together and stop him.I love black people,hispanic people,and Asian people and thats why I can't stand to see someone like Jesse stand up there like we're all ediots,that we don't know how to keep this Country together.I believe the Lord Let this election happen this way to make people see how important all of our votes are.George Bush has won and we all need to stand behind our new president.Democrats,republicans,blacks,whites,and all other races have to unite and stay that way.Jesse,please stop working for the devil and be a real minister,we need a real leader,a leader sent from God and you are not it.
