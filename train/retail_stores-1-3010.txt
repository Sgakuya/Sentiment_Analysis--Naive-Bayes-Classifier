My husband and I bought my wedding set from them. We thought it would be a good idea putting insurance on them for the price that we paid for it. We were told to get them appraised. Well, we paid almost 2200.00 for the set and it was worth maybe 550.00. They showed me the diamonds... it had bubbles in them. I was told that if the diamond has bubble's in them then it was man made... very cheap. I was soooo ticked off.. I went there and talked to them about it. Granted it had been about 4 months, they refused to take them back. We had a charge account with them and they refused to give us any type of credit. These people lie to get people to buy their things. Stay away from them... Wal Mart is a better place then Friedman's. Atleast Wal Mart will work with you if you are not happy with their products. The only way Friedman's are still in business is because they are ripping people off.
