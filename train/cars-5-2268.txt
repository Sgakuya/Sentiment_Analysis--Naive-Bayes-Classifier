Being a lover of these cars from the 240 model the 90+ Z300 is one of the greatest cars t o hit the road. The styling is more exotic then even more modern sports cars today. When soem may complain about its tight engine compartment or perhaps its slightly slower speed than say, a Supra TT the 300 looks better and handles as good and was a better seller that the Supra. Its first foreign sports car gene to uphand (most sold) the Vette with the 240, an distinction now held by the Miata. While I own both the Supra and the Z. The Z has perhaps a solid 10 with the Supra getting a solid 8. Speed is not everything and when you have knock dead looks to boot......
