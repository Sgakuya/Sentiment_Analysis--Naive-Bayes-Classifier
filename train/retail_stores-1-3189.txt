Very slow to send next rental. Also, it can take over a week from mailing back a DVD before they say it was received. The DVD's are shipped by First Class mail, so there is no reason for it taking over a week. I have been with Netflix for awhile. The service was fine in the beginning, but now it is getting progressively worse. I have mailed back DVD's they say they never received. Mail can't be tracked unless you are willing to pay extra for Registered mail. They put a suspend on your account for missing DVD(s) and unless you are willing to purchase the DVD you mailed back, you are stuck. It is your word against their's. I would not recommend joining Netflix. They are a one shift only operation and the more people that join - the slower the service. Also this makes them more prone to mistakes.
