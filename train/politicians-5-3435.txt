In rating US politicians & officials, GWB is currently the most powerful man in the world, as was Clinton before him, and on and on. Like him or hate him, (and I've never seen anyone quite so hated by the press and Hollywood since Ronald Reagan) he still holds the title until January and most likely, January of 2009. Whenever someone engenders such hatred, and I believe it is ideological rather than personal, (though the atacks are shamefully personal) myths arise around him and his deeds (Bush lied, kids died, he's unintelligent, the economy is weak, etc.) People who are too lazy to pay close attention tend to remember the myths and they become part of the pop culture. Unfortunately for Kerry, those too lazy to pay attention are also generally too lazy to go vote in November and even the most aggressive get-out-the-vote efforts don't generate much change in turnout. I believe today that Bush is headed for a successful reelection probably garnering a majority of the popular vote. If so, it will be the first time that has happened since Bush ('41) ran on Reagan's coattails, only to disavow those coattails, to his own peril. The election will bring a welcome relief from the constant, shameful, shrill political railing going on now and certain to go on until election night. UPDATE: ihate cowards, how did you settle on that name? Were both ihatelogic and ieschewtruth taken? I thought it would be an ugly presidential campaign but this is getting ridiculuous. The continued existence of the Sect 527 organizations, under their present lack of regulation, will guarantee the American people (and the world observers) only ugly, smearing, destructive campaigns from now on.
