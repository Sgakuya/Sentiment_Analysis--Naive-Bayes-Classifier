Spree is an awesome player. It's obvious the enormous steps he's taken from the altercation in Golden State. I thank the Knicks and the Garden fans for welcoming him onto the team with open arms. Something that I have to commend him on is that he is always out on the floor giving it his all, 100%. Him and Houston can really go off on opponents at any given time. Sprewell is efficient in going strong to the hole and making things happen. I remember against the Pacers in the 2000 playoffs, he had a broken foot and on the first possession went in for a monster tomahawk jam. I distinctly recall as well the famous run in '99 when Houston and Sprewell combined for 62 points in a second round game against the Hawks. Probably the most memorable performance in his career is during the final game (game 5) of the '99 finals against the Spurs, he and Duncan accounted for 28 of the game's 29 points during a six-minute span (this span included the last 2 minutes of the 3rd quarter and the first 4 minutes of the 4th). He also scored 21 of his team's 25 points in a 15 minute binge. He finished the night with 35. It was a display of pure basketball brilliance unmatched by any Knick I've ever seen in my young life. Spree is a downright great player and I'm proud to say that he is a part of the Knick organization because he has been instrumental in all of their playoff runs since he's been on the team.
