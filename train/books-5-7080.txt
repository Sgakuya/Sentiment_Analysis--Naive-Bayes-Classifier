how can you read these books and not get suckered in? i think this is a great book for people who like Lord Of The Rings type fantasy: elves and Svirfnebli and other such creatures are easier to swallow when you like such things to begin with. These books are great for younger reader who may not be ready to take on more advanced SciFi/Fantasy novels. Drizzt is an excellent character who i rooted for from the very beginning. Salvatore wrote a seamless prequil, despite all the pressures that Drizzt Fans placed on him (th sort of stress that usually amounts to a crappy book). This is a great book for someone who likes a little bit of brain candy, a great story, and interesting characters. Lots of action and plot-advancing situations. I'd recommend this book to both young and old people.
