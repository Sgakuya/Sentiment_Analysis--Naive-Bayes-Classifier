Make no mistake - this is a very nice car to drive. Handles very well, it is powerful enough for it's weight (I have a manual transmission, for automatic you need more powerful engine) and it is definitely good looking (just compare to 80% of US built cars!). Gas mileage is very good, but still - not as good as it should be. Interior design is simply cool - no squary surfaces or vents! I moved to US from Europe, where Focus came out one year earlier. I was impressed with how the car was rated over there, how good gas mileage was (European models are BETTER in this than US models - go figure) and I heard from several people that they are good quality cars, no worries if you own one. Ford in Europe has a very good reputation, believe it or not. So I came over here and bought this thing and was very satisfied at first. But: I have the car for 11 months now. I had 4 security recalls on it already (better to have them than not to I guess) and I had to take the car to the shop to fix strange noises in front wheels twice already. It just started again few days ago. The car has 7,500 miles! Exterior black plastic parts on doors started turning white for some reason after few months - were replaced last time in the shop. AC does a good job dealing with Texas summer, and that's the ultimate test of any AC I think. :) Because of amount of times that I had to repair something - I really can not recommend this car. For everything else I would, but it is not worth it if you have to worry if something is going to break! If you are getting it - definitely get some sort of extra insurance or mechanical protection plan that covers a rental if your car is in the shop!! I am glad I did! :(
