i live in israel and it's really a great place. i wish you will all come here after things will cool down and it will be safe to walk around the cities here. it's the best place to live in and i would never live. the people here are nice, you can make new friends just by walking down the street. you can start talking to people you never seen before and they won't tell you to get lost. you have a great weather here and it's always fun. eilat is a great city and tel aviv and jerusalem are nice to. any way with all thats going on here all you see on the news is a war zone but actually it's a beautiful placeand it's very fun to live here.
