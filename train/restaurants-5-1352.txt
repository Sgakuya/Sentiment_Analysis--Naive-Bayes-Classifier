Schlotzky's is the best sandwich shoppe around, ten times better than Subway's and better than even Wendy's. The meats and the bread are fresh and taste great. The sourdough on pastrami is the best and the chicken sandwiches are out of this world. Have the sandwiches with some of their potato chips, it is the best. The place even has some pretty good pizzas. The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty good, it's a step above most other fast food places. There's only one Schlotzky's in Miami where I live, so I really don't get to go a lot. I see them all over the place when I go on the road; it would be nice if this franchise expanded some more.
