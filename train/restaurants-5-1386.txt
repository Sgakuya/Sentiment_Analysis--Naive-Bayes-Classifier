I live in the Seattle area, and have been seeing commercials for Sonic for some time now. My husband and I finally got tired of drooling every time we saw a commercial, and when we had someone to watch all 5 of our children, we made a 3 day trip to Boise(a 9 hour drive, one way) to see if it was as good as it looked on TV. We were quite impressed, I'm still suffering from slush withdrawals. Yes, we dedicated the only chance we'd have to get away from the kids and work to go eat at Sonic, but I must say, it was well worth it. We ate every meal there while we were there, and bought extra slushes to drink on the 9 hour drive to get home. It was fun enough that we're thinking of doing it again sometime. I just wish I didn't have to drive 9 hours to get a slush, Sonic really needs to move their market up north. Could put a big dent in McDonalds sales. We got our food quickly, it was always fresh, made as ordered(we ordered plenty of special order food), and the prices put McDonalds and Burger King to shame. Every time I go to any other restaurant near home, it seems the screw something up or forget something. I'd love to have the option of going to a restaurant that doesn't screw my order up everytime, and I'd really love to be able to get my daily slush. While I'm waiting for Sonic to move up my way, I guess I'll just enjoy the fact that I have a visible waist line now, I probably wouldn't if I had the option to eat there every day.
