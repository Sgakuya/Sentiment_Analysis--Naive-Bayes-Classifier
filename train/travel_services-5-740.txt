Needed a car when I flew up to San Jose. However, rates are much cheaper in Oakland than San Jose. I flew into Oakland and drove down to San Jose. I was kinda worried at first with all the stories I've read on here and epinions, but alas, my rental was without any problems. The car rental location is slightly off the Oakland airport along with the other 5-6 car rental companies, and a shuttle is provided. I arrived in the evening and there were no lines or wait for anything. They quickly confirmed my reservation and gave me the keys. I did not have to prove insurance, I just told them who my insurance company was and that was that. I rented a Mid-Size car, and I ended up with a PT Cruiser. I'm not really a fan of the PT Cruiser, but it was decent. It was brand new with about 640 miles on it. The guy at the lot didn't do a walk around or anything, he just signed his name off. Being that it was new, it had no problems. I took pictures of every angle anyways just in case. Drove it for 3 days...returned it about 20 minutes late at Oakland Airport, and had no problems. They didn't ask me for receipts for the gas tank, although I just filled it up down the street. Everything was the price they quoted me on the jetblue website (which was alot cheaper than other place.) I would give it 4 stars, instead of 5, but I can't find any problems and everything went smoothly.
