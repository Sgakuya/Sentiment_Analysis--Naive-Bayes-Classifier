Travelling to other countries didn't have the typical 'oh, other cultures are better than us' shtick that afflicts visiting scholars and the like. After travelling, there are a few reasons (luck being one of them) that America rules the economic world. We have a large degree of freedom (it's not complete freedom. . .a common misconception among my countrymen) We have a large amount of opportunity. I've heard complaints about the poor. Please. Of COURSE the poor are exploited! (That's the case in all countries) The usa has THE FATTEST POOR PEOPLE ON EARTH. . .trust me on this. A country where the poor are obese can't possibly get lower than 3 stars. Public schools do suck but the Univerisy system is good. Job market is tight right now but we still draw from the highest talent pool in the world. Our Hollywood movies are crap. .. just like our music but oh well. . .The USA is really 50 seperate little republics and each one thinks that it can do a better job than the other 49. . .yes, this causes political headaches, but it is a better system. USA leads the world in effective bloodless transfer of power- the secret to the sucess of any empire. Bush's cheap win notwithstanding, the country will outlive that dope. . .that's the beauty of our system. Having said all that, any American should spend a good deal of time away from home to understand how the usa is different.
