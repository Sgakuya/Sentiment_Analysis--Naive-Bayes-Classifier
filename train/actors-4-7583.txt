I was just thinking about the movie 'The Outsiders' 2 days ago for some random reason and was reflecting on how many big name actors received their first break from that movie. Patrick Swayze was the all-knowing tough but compassionate older brother Darryl. That kind of kicked off his career which is riddled with character portrayals oof that type. I guess that is why I get a little Swayze crazy whenever I see him in a movie. For some reason, he always gets me to root for his cgaracter, even if he is the bad guy. Favorite Swayze movie - 'Point Break'. 2nd favorite - 'Ghost', there is nothing like getting your eyes a little damp to a good viewing of this movie. Worst Swayze movie - 'To Wong Foo'. He is looking mighty wrinkly these days.
