I don't think there is any woman who cannot identify with Jane Eyre at some point in the story. Woman of all ages will find themselves identifying their own personal tragedies or triumphs with the situations Jane is put through. I found the novel absolutely delightful. I could not help but feel terrible about the conditions at Lowood, but then I had to laugh at the thought of a man keeping a demented wife in his attic. I will admit that I only read it as an assignment for class, but it was an assignment that I really enjoyed. In fact, I have read it numerous times since then. I never tire of hearing the romantic tale of Jane and Rochester or the tragic story of St. John.
