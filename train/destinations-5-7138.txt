It is the most visual city that lives almost 24 hours...and the only reason I do not know is I needed 2 hours sleep!!! Everyone is friendly if you approach them with a smile and show respect for their customs....try the Belgian beer..Duval..can't stand Heineken...Excellent food in all types of restaurants for an excellent price...however..do not try the traditional dutch meal of beans..thats exactly what it is. The red light district is a fantastic adult playground. Infact the only time I felt unsafe was when an english boy was so drunk in the Liedesplein that he wanted a fight..the best thing to do is walk away..the irony of this is you can walk the darkest alleys in the red light district and nothing is threatening...Watch out for pickpockets...very skillful, but the are not muggers...It all adds up to the fun of the fair...beautiful city with a gothic sense of culture. GO!
