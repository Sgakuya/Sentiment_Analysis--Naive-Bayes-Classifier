I'm rating it terrible because of one particular store in my neighborhood (San Francisco at Hyde California Streets) that consistently has long lines. I also live down the street from Whole Foods and THEY have just as many or more people than this store but their lines are always very fast-moving and short, and the checkers are much faster. The two Safeway stores I go to and the Cala in the Castro neighborhood do not have lines like this. I have fallen arches and bad legs and cannot stand comfortably for more than a minute or so, so I often judge a store by its line lengths. Management here should care more about their customers' comfort and try harder to remedy the problem of huge lines. If they do not, customers who are impatient, busy people are going to go elsewhere where they can get faster service. Apart from some of the sheep that wait oh so patiently in this particular Cala market, most of us are busy people and have better things to do than wait in lines. This chain does have some good sales but I'm likely to care more about convenience and less waiting, so I'll wait to take advantage of a Cala sale at another store, or instead go to Safeway or, especially, Whole Foods, where the lines are much shorter and management seems to care more about their customers.
