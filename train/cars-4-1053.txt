93 GXE 220,000 miles - Wonderful ride, quality through and through, if little bit expensive to maintain. Good gas mileage when engine is tuned properly. I may be replacing it with a 94 Altima. In my relatively short life I've owned a 72 Datsun 240Z and this Maxima: I'm not straying from Nissan for a while. I wish the Maxima would never die, but it's had a hard life. This may be the best car I'll ever own, and I'm going to miss it. I really, really love this car. At least I'm replacing it with another Nissan. I said that about the 240Z also. Now I gotta get over the inevitable loss of my second wonderful Nissan product. On to the nest one...
