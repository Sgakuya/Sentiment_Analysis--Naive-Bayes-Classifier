I have been using Sprint PCS for about 8 months now, and while it is not perfect, it's a vast improvement over the BellSouth mobility package which I had previously. If you have any intention of using your cel phone for more than just emergencies, I recommend Sprint's nationwide free and clear plan, long distance and local are included in your flat fee (up to a certain number of minutes.) Quality is decent, though not as clear as they make it out in the cellular bashing commercials. Coverage is passable, but seems to struggle in some surprising places such as the San Francisco airport. I strongly recommend the phone replacement program if you are at all prone to losing things. I left my Samsung 2000 phone on an airplane and never saw it again, but through the replacement program I was able to get a new shipped out to me within 5 business days. The only hassle was that I needed to get a police report to start the replacement process - fortunately that only took my 5 minutes. Overall, I recommend Sprint PCS.
