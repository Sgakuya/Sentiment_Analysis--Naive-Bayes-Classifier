Good movie. Henry Fonda is great as Tom Joad a man who was just released from jail only to come home and find his family losing their home and having to move to California. this large extended famiy go to California with the hopes of jobs. they face tragedy along the way {the grandfather dies} and soon after the grandmother heartbroken also dies. The promised employment turns out to be a disappoinment.A lot of the movie is kind of depressing, I find myself wishing something good would happen to this family.After a fight that ends in someone dying. tom has no choice but to move on without his family. Henry Fonda gives the famous speech about all he wants to do to make this world a better place. A good movie but a sad one too. Well acted .
