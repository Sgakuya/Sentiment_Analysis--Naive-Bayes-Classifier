Give it up Al and go home. Al does not believe the people know enough to manage to get a sharp object in a hole with a arrow next to his name. Shame, shame, shame on him. Each time I see some offical lift a ballot to the light, it confirmes to me how little the Democrats believe in the power of the people. Rather, they want to micro manage each part of each of our lives including the ability to vote responsibility. Al, how many times do you have to lose to believe you lost. And shame on Dateline NBC for not delivering a unbiased report on the show on Sunday night regarding voter fraud. The reporter was so biased and smug I walked directly to my computer to write this e-mail. Hardly a way to increase your advertising ratings. By the way, this is the first time I have ever e-mailed my option to.... anyone.
