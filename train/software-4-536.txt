Corel WordPerfect Suite seems to be the primary competitor to Microsoft Office. Corel's suite generally comes with WordPerfect (a word processor), Quattro (a spreadsheet), various other programs that are designed to compete with PowerPoint, etc, and sundry wizards, utilities, etc (eg an address book). As I prefer WordPerfect over Word, this is the package I choose; moreover, the Corel suite is usually less expensive than Microsoft's, and I get the added satisfaction of not allowing Microsoft monopolize the office suite market. The problem is that while I prefer WordPerfect over Word, I prefer Excel over Quattro, which results in a loss of a star.
