Many of the negative ratings listed here seem to be by people who have axes to grind with UOP. Those of us who have continued through the program have learned how to deal with the free-rider problem (let you instructor know when your team mates aren't pulling their weight). The infrastructure support - while rocky about a year ago - has improved phenomenally. I have done a comparison of the course materials and assignments with a colleague of mine who is attending the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Business Management, and we agree the material and assignments are comparable. I resent the implication that I just pay my money and make a token effort to participate. There are plenty of diploma mills out there for which I could pay money and get a degree on paper with far less effort. When one reads negative ratings by professors at traditional universities, one must take that with a grain of salt. The sheer efficiency of delivering an online degree program certainly does put a different light on traditional programs. Those with a vested interest in traditional methodologies may have difficulty maintaining an objective point of view. UOP is not perfect. But get used to it - with states cutting back on their financial support of traditional universities, with private institutions raising their tuition, more and more individuals and corporations will come to value the efficiency and effectiveness of an online degree. And I do not work for UOP. I am within 3 courses of completing my MBA.
