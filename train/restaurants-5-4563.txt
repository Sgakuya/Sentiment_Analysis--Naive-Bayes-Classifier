In response to the server feeling like too many things were expected for 2.13 per hour.....if the average tip is only $1 for breakfast and lunch, you must really be in a bad area. I know several Bob Evans servers in our area who are always making good tips. They consider $2 to be low. One of my friends who works there has gotten as much as $10 several times, and not for large checks. Sounds like you live in cheapville. It isn't Bob Evans fault that you don't make tips. It's the fault of the customer. Personally, I find Bob Evans food, service and overall quality to be excellent. Granted, it varies by location, but that is a management issue.
