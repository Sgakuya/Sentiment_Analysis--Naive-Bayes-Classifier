I visited Davidson last year with my brother who was admitted and chose Princeton. Coming from California, Davidson was a shock. A lot of self important limited thinkers. The faculty and staff were nice, but the students seemed oblivious to the rest of the world. We felt a little odd, It was the most homogeneous school we visited. Do you know they get free laundry and dry cleaning. It is a little weird. They also have crummy financial aid and they make you visit to get your final package. My brother regretted applying and I am not even considering it. Its a little school with big aspirations that will never get there by excluding so many ethnicities and political views. Go north.
