Hysterically funny, and as it was made in the 1950's, I'm still not sure if it was even TRYING to be funny. Steve McQueen stars as a Steve, a teenager in a small town who, along with his girlfriend, witness an asteroid hit the earth. Oddly, Steve McQueen appeared to be about 30 years old when he made the movie, making for some amusing scenes as the rest of the other characters attempt to convince the audience that McQueen is a young whippersnapper up to no good. The storyline is brilliant - a small jello like being emerges from an asteroid and attaches itself to an unfortunate old man's hand while he tries to poke it with a stick. For simplicity's sake, everyone refers to the old man as old timer for the rest of the movie. Predictably, the red jello goes on to devour the old timer, the town's doctor, and a number of other town dim wits before anyone believes that young punk Steve (age 30), that something is really going on. The dialogue is campy, wholesome fifties stuff at its best, and the town tough guys act like howdy doody. Perhaps the greatest part of the movie is the movie's ridiculous theme song - a cheerfull, goofy, surf sounding song that warns beware the blob! All in all a fantastic B-movie, and worth seeing for the unintentional comedy value alone.
