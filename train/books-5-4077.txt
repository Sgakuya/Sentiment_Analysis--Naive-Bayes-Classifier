An amazing little book that is written with the simplicity of Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist, but carries with it the depth of Paradise Lost . Hesse is able to integrate a number of profound, thought provoking themes into the story of a young monk / businessman / ferryman who is on a quest for meaning. Whether it be learning through experience, seeing life as a complete cycle, or identifying what is truly important - Siddhartha has something for everyone. For me, the test of greatness of any book is whether it A) makes you want to read more by the same author, B) makes you want to read more about the theme, and c) inspires you to think or act differently. Siddhartha passed all three of these tests with flying colors, and I look forward to reading Narcissus and Goldmund (based on Wiggum's suggestion).
