Kay Jewelers is a great company to shop with! In my experiences I would choose them and their customer service over any other store! They guarantee everything and will work with you to make you happy with your purchase. I buy all of my diamonds from them and believe me I am the happiest customer of Kay! I just recieved a 2 carat 3 stone ring for christmas and I love it. If I have any questions they answer them. I have NEVER had any problems with my Kay's in Olean NY. The staff there is fantastic and if I want something specific they go out of their way to find the perfect thing! That is why it up to you to SHOP and ask questions about specific things, tell them hat you want and they'll get it! Don't blame them for your stupidity. KAY rocks and nothing will deter me from shopping with them. ''I'm proud to shop at Kays''
