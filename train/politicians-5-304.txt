Irishgit, with the utmost respect, are you SURE you have the right person here? I hardly think you can judge him as a weak and stupid man. First off, he came to the throne at the age of ten and died at the age of sixteen, you could hardly judge him as a man, that would be a tad unfair. As to stupid, I strongly disagree. By the age of nine he was already writing vast and articulate essays about the plight of the English people at the hands of the papacy (which astounded his tutors who often were surprised at both his wisdom and passion) and we can see further demonstrations of his high intelligence in the journal he kept of his rule. As to weak, I would disagree just as strongly, it is true his uncle, Edward Seymour, the duke of Somerset did kidnap Edward and kept him locked away in his castle but Edward rebelled and declared his Uncles malicious intentions to the council (quite strong for a twelve year old, I think). Somerset was jailed and Edward had him executed in 1552. After 1549 he was far from a prisoner, rather he had great influence on English policy for a young teenager, this is evident in the radical protestant reforms undertaken in England from 1450-53. Edward was an extremely intelligent and principled young man and had he not died so young could have been a truly great king.
