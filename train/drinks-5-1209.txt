Ah, Molson Canadian. If there ever was a real Canadian beer, Molson Canadian has to take the cake. Does this mean is it a world class Great 5-Star beer? No. Really, that 5-star title belongs to very few beers in the world. But it is a great Canadian beer along with Labatt Blue. Molson Canadian is like the water of Canada. Pure, refreshing, invigorating, in it's catagory of beer, it has a good flavour too. I've had this beer while traveling in the USA. Molson Canadian is so common here in Canada it is hard to think of it as an Import beer there, and even crazier was it was brewed in Texas not Canada! If you are up for a taste of Canada, crack open Molson Canadian!
