Just puchased a 2006 Pontiac G6. I've had it for 4 days and so far so good! I have been looking for a new car for over a year now. Confortable seats, reasonable price, and safety ratings were the features I found important and I got them all in this car! I got the base model, 2.4L, HO 4 cyl. DOHC-MFI with 4 speed automatic transmission w/ Overdrive. It still has lots of pep going up hills. MPG: 23 City 34 Highway, but one can get up to 38-40 HWY. The car seems to look like a combination executive-type car with a sporty attitude to me! I got the granite Metallic color with a Pinstripe. The look is very modern and aerodynamic. The car is full of electronics with a 3 year bumper to bumper warranty. I chose to pay extra to get a total protection package for my G6 that will give me a 6 year bumper to bumper warranty that is better than the manufacturer's which includes things like struts and road hazard items. When I went looking for a car I made a list from the goverment crash rating site of all 2005, 2006 sedans. The Impala and the Pontiac G6 had good ratings. While the Impala was comfortable to sit in, the car seemed just too big and wiedly for my tastes. I had looked at a Pontiac a few years back and found them uncomfortable. The adjustable pedals allow me to sit back from the steering wheel and rest my arm on the center console. So, I was genuinely surprised when I sat in the Pontiac G6 and was so comfortable. The size is substantial and safe, Yet is compact at same time. It takes turns on a dime, has huge trunk with back seats that will fold down for extra trunk space. 2 side cargo nets are standard, I think. Standard equipment: 16" wheels, 4 wheel disc brakes, touring Suspension, Airbags, Running lamps, Theft Deterrent Sys, passlock, Power outside rear view mirrors, air conditioning, Driver seat power Height adjuster, AM/FM/CD W/ Clock & Driver information center, 6 speaker sound, *Tilt & Telescopic sterring whl, Power release Trunk, Power Windows w/Driver EXP. Base Price $18, 865.00 For only $1,050 more I got Power Adj Brakes & Accel Pedals, Floor mats, carpet, Cargo Net, (4) 16" Painted Alloy Wheels, antilock brakes, keyless Entry, remote, Ctuise Control. After Destination $650 car cost $20,390 and after a $1000 rebate from GM and another -$150 savings on package total was $19,390. I had a trade-in worth $500 and The dealer came down another $500 for a base price of $18,600. I added a pinstripe(which I think is especially attractive on this car) for $150 more. Add license and plates and taxes and I had a car with very nice features. I opted to add extended warranty. It cost $1250 for 6 years. It covers things not covered by the 3 year factory warranty during the 1st 3 years and it also extends total warranty out to 6 years. I figured a new strut costs about $600 these days. This plan over 6 years cost about $210 year. Will update later.
