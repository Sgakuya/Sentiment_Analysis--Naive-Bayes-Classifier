SILENT HILL 2 This game is the best and scarest game I've ever played. the graphics are supurbe adn the music and sound effects are awsome. the story of the game is one of the best i've ever seen in a game. It make you keep playing no matter what because you don't know what will happen next but you want to ficd out. And with over 7 different endings It is worth playing over and over. If only thay would make a movie based entirerly on the game!!!? but i heard that they were so awsome!!!!!! Go buy this game if or even if you havent played it it will scare the the hell out of U garented... Greg over and out!!!!!
