What more do you want in a band than Limp Bizkit? they push the limits, get nailed by the critics and still come out with a work of art in Chocolate Starfish. This band is getting bigger everyday and they never forget the fans. Not to mention this is the best live band I've heard in years of going to concerts. This album in 1 word is powerful . as time goes by this band gets harder and harder, and still keeps it real. My Generation is my favorite song on this album, its about time we had a rock star to look up to in Fred Durst. Great job bizkit, sorry I can't give you 6 stars for close to perfection , but I would if I could.
