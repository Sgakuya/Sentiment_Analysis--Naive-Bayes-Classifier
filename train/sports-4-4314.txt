Look... the only reason that I didn't give this guy 5 stars is that UK did not win it all this year. Unless you are a complete MORON, you realize what a phenomenal coach this guy is. As far as I'm concerned, UK was the best basketball team in the country this year - even without the championship. I ask most of the idiots who want to get rid of Tubby one question --- Who do you want as a head coach? Who could possibly do a better job? Billy Donovan? Tubby has owned Billy Donovan for the last several years! All the Tubby critics need to back-off and count their blessings. We have the Coach of the Year in the Bluegrass State and I personally hope that he doesn't get tired of all the B.S. and sticks around for a very long time.
