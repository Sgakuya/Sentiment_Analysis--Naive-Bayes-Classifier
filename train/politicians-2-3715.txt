GW is totally unrealistic and living in a past that is ancient history. I just hope the real US Majority will get its Act into action and make sure this doesn't happen again anywhere !!! Florida was the target this time; who's next? If you didn't know it before, the Republican Party has been scheming for this for 20 years (since Bob Martinez was Gov of Florida) and Martinez and the Bushes have been in bed with each other since then ... Have you taken a good look at the mean-spirited, evil-souled attacks that Bush's supporters and backers have been making? Whining, yes. Threatening, yes. Gestapo-esque, yes. Jingoist, yes. Rational, true, realistic, NO WAY !! Too bad the voters have such short memories. Makes me sick to be a Floridian. GW will NEVER have my support, nor will any of his Republican clones and robots. If ever I waivered before, and believe me, Bill C. made me waiver, I am now sure my instincts about the BUSH Dy-NASTY was right!
