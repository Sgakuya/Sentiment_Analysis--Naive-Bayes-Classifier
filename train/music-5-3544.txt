They are a great band. This is a great album, albeit not the best album, but still a great one. Based on a fictional character, Pink Floyd, it shows how he builds a wall from the outside world. It goes from his childhood (In the flesh?), to how the teachers at school abused him(Happiest Days of our Lives, ABITW #2), to his love life (Young Lust), a call for help (Hey You, and Is there anybody out there), the world of acid and psychadelic drugs his succombs to (Comfortably Numb), and how he turns into a facist in the end. It is beautifully crafted, the lyrics are some of the best ever(thanks Waters) and Gilmour has a great solo in Comfortably Numb.
