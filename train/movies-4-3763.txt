Most people have never heard of this 80s chaser from the Land Down Under, but it's well worth haunting the bargain bins to locate. Features Ken Wahl (before the unfortunate career downfalls) and the rock-steady character efforts of Donald Pleasance as New Zealand deer ranchers who stumble upon a downed World War II cargo plane loaded with gold bars. Through a series of whiskey-induced misadventures, the plane also becomes known to a ruthless fortune hunter (played with faint conviction by George Peppard), who turns things into a winner-takes-all contest of wills and resources. Lesley-Anne Warren seems oddly cast as Wahl's eventual love interest; not exactly a "muffin" (which might seem out-of-place in such a rural setting), but at least she's up to the fun. Dizzyingly top-grade helicopter sequences, and the speedboat pursuits near the end are naturally enthralling. If you can get past the wonky quirks that plague Australian films (stilted double-takes, mumbled line stutters, light-hearted scoring shifts, etc.), then you'll probably enjoy the solid entertainment value this movie offers. Definitely merits a look.
