Its funny reading the critiques of Reagan. He was a pawn of his advisors. He went through 3 chiefs of staff and something like 5 national security heads and never deviated from his core objectives and the very contrarian (and it turns out, very correct) approaches to the most vexing policy issues of the last 50 years. He ran up deficits. So did Lincoln, FDR and anyone who fought a major war! His Cold War spending brought on the disintegration of the most evil tyranny in history, and the susequent peace dividend has left us awash in surpluses -- what idiot can possibly think it wasn't worth temporary deficits to rid the world of mutually assured destruction? Even his advisors say he was clueless -- yeah, the ones at HUD and all those rat-hole bureaucracies that matter very little in the scheme of things. Reagan came in with clear goals and achieved them. Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr might have memorized the nuances of regulatory matters that pertain to federal collaboration with state and local governments on urban renewal projects but where the hell did it get them?! No where. Reagan goes down as THE great political figure of the latter half of 20th century. Bar none. Its absolutley awe inspiring to contemplate the prosperity, freedom and security he helped bring to the world -- the political odds against his doing it (getting massive tax cuts and his Cold War build up passed with a Dem Congress) -- and the incredible charm and integrity with which he accomplished it all.
