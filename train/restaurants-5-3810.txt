I love Chuck E Cheese!!You know why,well because of a realy nice guy I met there. He was a tech and realy smart who had a green Chevrolet.I thought this place was for babies but it turns out I was wrong. The only reason I always wanted to go was to see him , though I was shy and my sister told him I liked him (that was true.)I wish the best to all of ya'll because you find the coolest people at the weirdest places,also that i could know where he is cuz he doesn't work there anymore.I wish I lived in Boca Raton!!!!!I am always thinking of how much fun i had there with ,JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ!!!!!!!Go dolphins !!!!I love Jason Taylor#99.JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ my sister likes Patrick . Love YOU STILL+
