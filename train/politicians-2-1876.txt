I am begining to think I was wrong about violating my rule never to vote for a woman to vote for her. Has done a weak job at governing this once great state. As much as I dislike Bush, he is still President of the the USA, and has visited the state twice during her tenure. She has been conveintly not available to meet him both times, once to go on vacation! When the President comes to your state, your Governor should be there to greet him, only if out of respect for the office, if not the man. As Governor, she represents the state, and should have been there to greet him. Last summer, her solution to rising gas prices due to a delivery pipe break was to tell people not to buy that much gas, so they'll more to go around. She has yet to respond to the latest gas price crisis currently going gone for no apparent reason (other than greed by gas companies). She'll be lucky to finsh out her first term with a recall.
