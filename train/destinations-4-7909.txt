A place for all seasons. I have since moved from Chicago to Atlanta and have grown to appreciate more what Chicago had to offer. Our family would go down to the children's museum at least once a month, which was a good motivator to get us out into the city. It's located in a beautiful area on the lake. They have the best children's museum in the country. There are good kid's restaurants and if you prefer sports bars in the mall. In the summer, they have music playing in and around the perimeter. Across the street is one of the most fun to watch fountains which is not your typical pool design. Instead the water comes out of the flat surface that people walk across. Bring the kids bathing suites they'll get into it. Bring your bikes because this is a good starting point for a ride up the shoreline, passing Oak street beach, Chicago's premier beach and then in and around Lincoln park where the last free zoo in the country is located. In the winter, the music moves inside along with the other entertainers. With the cold season so long, this is a great way to break out of the blues. Parking is reasonable and plentiful. From there you can get out to other Chicago attractions. Take advantage of it while the kids are young or they will grow up not being very friendly to the city and all of the great culture that it offers. In the fall you can watch all of the trees in the parks change their color and in the spring see them flowering. Site seeing boats on the pier run all year round and offer a great view of the skyline and its famous architecture.
