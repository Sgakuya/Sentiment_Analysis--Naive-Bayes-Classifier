to kar54 your concepts on diversity are rather 'Utah' to say the least. I would suggest you look at northern New England which is mostly white and rural but also very liberal and tolerant of 'different' cultures and lifestyles- or in Connecticut-which is 75% white- but still has incredible diversity- and has passed civil rights for gay couples to unite in civil unions- are all 'tolerant and diverse' places dirty crime infested rat holes? Hardly- your narrow and bigoted and fear driven essay speaks for itself OF what Utah truly is- a fearful paranoid driven culture with incredible intolerance and backwardness to progressive ideas. If you want to live in a 'safe' place, that is basically intolerant and very regressive-plus lead a life of uniform blandness perhaps Utah is your kind of place.
