I have lived in Savannah for three years. I fell in love with the place pretty quickly with all the history and architecture and overall quirky vibe. The beach is nothing special as far as beaches go, but it's still a beach and people don't visit here for the beach anyway. BUT (there's always a but) it's bad sides are becoming more apparent as I live here. Crime for this small city is through the roof. The school system is in bad shape. The cost of living is relatively high and jobs don't pay much. If you like sports, well, this ain't the town for you. All we have is a Class A baseball team (Sand Gnats, no kidding) and if 300 people show up for a game, it's a good night. And speaking of sand gnats....OUCH. Oh, I still love it here, but we certainly got some work to do. But it is a very nice place to visit and cheaper than Charleston.
