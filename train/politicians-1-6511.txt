Daschle doesn't possess a great deal of principles or core beliefs. He's voted as a liberal for the previous 5 years in the senate, however, now that he's up for reelection, he's scurrying to the right. He's keenly aware that playing the part of a Washington Liberal doesn't play well in South Dakota, but he may have realized it too late, as his opponent, John Thune, will fight a tough race. I thought it was shameful, on the eve of Operation Iraqi Freedom, for Daschle to say that the President was a failure in diplomacy. First off, it's not even true (see Col. Khadaffi/Libya). Second, anybody can criticize the President, after all, it is his right, but show a little bit of class on the eve of sending our troops into battle to remove a thug like Saddam Hussein. It was Hussein who was THE FAILURE of diplomacy by not accounting for his weapons programs. Finally, someone tell Daschle's speechwriter to write some new material. Every one of his speeches starts as I'm deeply disappointed... or I'm deeply saddened.... However, it would be cool if he began his concession speech with those words after he loses his Senate seat in November.
