This is a premium vodka made in Russia where vodka was first made. It's different from others because it is filtered throught birch charcoal and quartz, this make it very pure and gives the vodka a distinctive taste. This is a quality vodka for the fact that I can drink this straight from the freezer, I can't do this with with other vodkas like Smirnoff or Absolut. Lower quality vodkas can only be mixed and they also have a chance of causing a hangover the next day. Stoli is crystal clear with a clean finish, good flavor and finish when drank straight and also good for mixing. Sure it doesn't have a cool looking bottle and multi million dollar ads but it's what inside that counts.
