Mmmmmm! Dr. Pepper is definitely my favorite major pop (or soda, if you prefer), though I think I like Mr. Pibb a little bit better. Where did people come up with the prune juice idea? I had never heard of that before. If I had to describe the taste, it would be more like the cross between cherry coke and red cream soda (both of which rank very high with me as well). Anyway, it's a nice refreshing change from the ever present cola. The only bad thing about it is that not all restaurants carry it, but maybe some day they'll wisen up. Oh, and as someone else mentioned, Diet Dr. Pepper really doesn't taste much different from regular ( I don't normally like diets); it's pretty darn good too!
