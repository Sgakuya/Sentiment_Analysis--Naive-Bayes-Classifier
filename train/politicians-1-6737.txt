Why is he so angry all the time? Is he afraid people will eventually get the drift of what his lucrative hate campaign is all about, abandon him and leave him with no means of financial support? Naaaaah, of course not! What was I thinking - people love to hate too much for that to ever happen. UPDATE - in light of recent news developments: Al Sharpton for PRESIDENT? Haaaaa! Somebody stop me from laughing before I burst a blood vessel. And some people thought Nadar screwed up the last election?! How many votes for whomever do you think this hateful bigot will avert? OF COURSE it s high time we saw people of color run for this office but for the love of God and sane decisions we all know there are many others much better suited to get the job done - fairly.
