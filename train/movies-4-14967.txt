I really enjoyed this movie. It s not the most masterful piece of cinema I ve ever experienced, but it was a great way to pass a couple hours on a Sunday afternoon. If you re turned off by violence, you may want to steer clear, but if you re in the mood for a good (if predictable and unoriginal) action movie, The Patriot will do the job. The big battle scenes don t compare to the D-Day landing depicted in Saving Private Ryan or the huge arrows sword clashes in Braveheart, but they give you a powerful sense of what it must have been like to be involved in that kind of deadly, musket-to-musket chaos. The acting isn t stellar, but it s good enough to carry the story along and make you care about the characters. And the plot follows the same avenge my family template we ve seen in countless other movies, but it manages to keep you engaged in the action. My only real complaint is that they really overdid the whole bad guy thing. To claim that this is not one of those movies that blurs the lines between good and evil would be an enormous understatement, which is kind of irritating because they could have used the main character s savage past to do a much better job of exploring the way war can often produce moral ambiguity. But that s not the point of this kind of movie. The point is to show a good guy who has to take revenge on a really, really bad guy. And trust me, they do just about everything possible to make it clear that the bad guy is about as bad as he can be.
