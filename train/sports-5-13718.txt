Love him or hate him you have to appreciate his drive and determination. Doesn't let the biased media or his detractors detour him from his game plan. I sometimes disagree with his decisions but, Brian Billick is what a coach should be! A meantor and most of all a driven leader. Excellent computer skills and treating his flock of Ravens with respect when they deserve it and gives them hell when they need it. His record as the Baltimore Raven's coach stands for itself. As of January 15, 2002 after handily defeating the Dolphins in round one of this season's playoffs, his record is 35 victorys and only 18 losses. Virtually a 2 to 1 winning ratio. May we be blessed with many more winning years with Brian Billick guiding our Ravens to greatness!
