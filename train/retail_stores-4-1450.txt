Target is WalMart on steroids. I have Neiman Marcus taste but (alas) no trust fund. Target's buyers are quality conscious and design savvy. My only complaint is that the store is inconsistently stocked in one area or another. In other words the housewares department might have great new things one week but the clothing department will appear picked over. The next week the lingerie and gardening sections are well stocked and the housewares area is depleted. I rarely find the item that I intended to purchase but always find wonderful things that weren't on my list. HINT: This is a once-a-week browser's store. Start from one end of the store and progress all the way through. Seriously. Last week, I couldn't believe the quality and design of the gardening tools. The major gardening catalogs that I usually purchase from flagged in comparison.
