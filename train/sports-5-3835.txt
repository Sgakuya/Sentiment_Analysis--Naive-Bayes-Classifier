Barry doesn't just rate as the best player in the game today, but even one of the best of all-time. Chances are he's going to end his career in third place on the all-time home run list. He is also very good in the field and has an amazing on-base percentage. Last year he set an all-time record for home runs, walks, home runs per at-bat, and another category that I don't recall. His 2001 campaign was possibly the best season in the history of the game. His career numbers definitely put him among the elites to be enshrined in Cooperstown. I added another chapter of my respect for this 73-home-run man with his gargantuan 588th home run hit on Saturday at Yankee Stadium.
