When the book, on which this movie is based,came out, it topped the NY TIMES bestseller lists for many, many weeks! Lana Turner toplines the stellar cast. The movie colony gave it five oscar nominations for acting, including Turner for Best Actress. Diane Varsi was a leading contender for the supporting oscar, according to the press at the time. She lost to Myoshi Umeki, (Sayonara). But Hope Lange was also excellent in a smaller part, and had a powerful scene that is a highlight of the story. But there is so much more to see. Peyton Place is about a New England town which has a strict moral code, and the young people who must deal with that, as well as their coming of age. Even though the story is dated, one should check it out for its delineation of that particular period of American society. Supporting oscar nods went to Russ Tamblyn, as a shy, mother-dominated teenager, and Arthur Kennedy, who plays a rapist, and is the other party to that pivotal scene with Hope Lange. Terry Moore is also very good as the town loose girl, who wins her lover by being the kind of girl he likes. Peyton Place was a smash hit on release. It has great drama, everyday people who deal with life, love and each other.The cinematograpy captures the beauty of 1940's New England, and the direction by Mark Robson brings it all together. This picture should be seen on a large screen, if possible.
