The best pop corn flick to come out in ears. Made to entertain and that is exactly what it does. But this is up town hard core entertainment, the kind Hollywood should be pumping out these days. A ton of star power, an academy Award Winning Director and a great heist story. How could any film maker go wrong? This is a sure thing and it was from the get go. It is a classic caper with a modern hip feel. This is one to see. Great entertainment, I would say, for the whole family. If your family is cool. I mean, no one gets killed or anything. It isn't Not Another Teen Movie by any means. So take the kids or grandpa and treat yourselves to a great fun classic bad guys are the good guys flick. Much to love. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
