Very cool city built on a hillside with lots of winding little streets and old buildings. It's also very touristy but that's to be expected considering what it is and where it is, (only about an hour bus ride from Madrid so it makes for a nice day trip. Apparently Toledo is like the sword making capital of Spain so you can't walk 10 feet without passing swords in the windows of the shops. It's one of those things that is just so touristy to buy and so exploited that you think there's no way I'm gonna buy one of those and everyone you see carrying them is 50 with a camera strapped around their neck with the wife and kids in tow. So of course we each got one and then had to carry them through the streets packaged in newspaper that was just wrapped around the blade and then bulbed up around the handle. The wrapping did nothing to conceal the shape in the slightest, it would be like walking around Manhattan with a 3' tall model of the Empire State building wrapped in colored cellophane, everyone can see exactly what your holding. It was just one of those moments when you realize that YOU are the huge dork sitting on a crowded bus full of Spaniards with your souvenir swords resting between your knees or carrying them through streets trying to look casual, or checking it as baggage at the airport and then waiting for it to come out at the baggage claim upon arrival. Oops excuse me that's my sword going by could you grab that for me, thanks. Still now that it's over I'm glad I have it, it's fa un little momento I just wish they could have spared a box.
