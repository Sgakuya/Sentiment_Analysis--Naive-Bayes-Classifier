I usually agree with the opinions Munson leaves on this site, but he's way off base on this one. Finding Forrester is a predictable, cliche-filled movie that is nothing more than a hybrid of two much better movies - Good Will Hunting and Scent of a Woman. I had high hopes for this movie, and I was really disappointed. It's not terrible, it just doesn't have any real strong points. Decent performances by Sean Connery and Rob Brown can't overcome a lame script, poorly-developed supporting characters, and a surprising lack of plot originality. The villain (an insecure teacher) is overdone, a six-year-old can guess the entire plot after the first twenty minutes, and many of the story details just aren't believable. Not even worth a rental.
