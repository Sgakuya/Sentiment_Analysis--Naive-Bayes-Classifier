I really struggled with whether to give Ali a 3 or a 4. While I'm glad I saw it, it definitely didn't keep me riveted throughout. There were parts that dragged, and I didn't really walk away from the movie with the sense that Ali was the larger than life figure that I imagined him to be. However, the movie is beautifully done. The attention to detail is outstanding, from the fighter/actors who actually looked like the fighters they portrayed, to the Zaire scenes, to Howard Cosell, to Will Smith's mannerisms and speaking stle. Unlike the reviewer below, I thought Smith was credible. The best parts of the movie - in my opinion - were those that showcased Smith / Ali going off in poetry. It's really hard to figure out why this movie didn't hit me more than it did - it's a great story with good actors and excellent cinematography. What could have been a five star film winds up at about 3.5 for me - a good film, but I'm glad I didn't drop $8 to see it in a theater.
