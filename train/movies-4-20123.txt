The recent free Showtime weekend finally gave me an excuse to see this movie. I was irritated by all the hype when it first came out, and I generally can't stand to watch any video made with jerky hand-held cameras, so I expected to hate The Blair Witch Project. Maybe my low expectations helped, because I ended up really enjoying the movie. It's creative, creepy, and more frightening than any other movie I've seen in the past couple of years. The sometimes-nauseating homemade video style actually worked, and I didn't find it to be overly distracting. The actors probably would have been terrible in a conventional movie, but their unpolished performances seemed to increase Blair Witch's illusion of reality. I found myself drawn into the story, and that last scene had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. If you haven't already seen it, Blair Witch is definitely worth renting and watching in the dark.
