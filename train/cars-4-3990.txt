I'm 38 and have driven all types of cars. Most recently had a new VW Beetle for 4 years. Before that a Nissan Quest. The Buick Rendezvous is fast becoming my all time favorite car. I can't find a single thing about it that I don't like. It seems as if it was designed with a woman in mind. The ride is extremely smooth and quiet. It's got all the room you need for just about everything (unless you need a pickup truck). The gas usage is no worse than anything else comparable in power and size. The pickup from start might be just a little under-powered but nothing that would bother most sane drivers. I would not classify it as an SUV. Insurance calls it a sport wagon. It's more like a multi-purpose hybrid SUV/Van/Wagon. Call it a MPHSVW? For a small to mid-size family you can't go wrong with this. I think the engineering and design is very smart and logical as far as interior is concerned.
