3 rings, 3 different starting QB's. 2 Winston Cups, 2 totally different personalities. Forget about the salary cap, players are different, all that crap. I suspect (ok...I PRAY) that Joe is the ONLY coach Danny Boy won't mess with. If he shuts up, signs pay checks, and stays out of the way, Joe will win again, and win big. Simply the greatest coach out there, maybe of all time. 16-5 in the playoffs, and were talking about Landry, Parcells, Shula, Ditka and Walsh coached teams...that's not beating up on Dave McGinnis and Bruce Coslet. OK!!! All together now...you know the words!!! Hail to the Redskins! Hail Victory! Braves on the Warpath! FIGHT FOR OLD DC!!!
