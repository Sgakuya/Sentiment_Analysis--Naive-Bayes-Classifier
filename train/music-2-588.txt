R.E.M. is a very important band for me. But lately I've heard a lot of criticism that was kept silent in the 80's...basically R.E.M. is accused of being somewhat pedestrian in their sound. As much as it pains me, I know now that it is true. Don't get me wrong they had a lot of great songs, but innovative they were most definitely not. Well to me, Up is R.E.M.'s attempt at being innovative. I don't think it really suits them at all. It sounded like Stipe doing a Bjork record. Up made me re-evaluate one of my favorite bands, and now I wonder why I thought they were so cool in the first place. Please, next time call it Buck-Mills-Stipe and try to salvage R.E.M.'s dying reputation.
