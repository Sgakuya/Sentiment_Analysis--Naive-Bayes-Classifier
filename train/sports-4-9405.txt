Decent basketball player. Obviously, climbing into the stands to punch the spectator was poor judgementand Artest should be suspended for a very long time. HOWEVER, how stupid to mess with an athlete that has a history of violence. I liken the scenario to visiting a zoo and poking/throwing things at a tiger. If that tiger is set free you now suffer the consequences of your moronic actions. The fan and all those responsible for throwing objects and punches should have been bludgeoned even worse and are every bit as guilty as the athlete perhaps even moreso. Good job O'Neil for protecting your teammate! The outbreak during the game shows just how stupid some of the fans in Detroit are. It would never have happened in a much more civilized place like Boston.
