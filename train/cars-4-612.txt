Harleys hmm why in gods name would you want to pay 20+ thousand dollars for a motorcycle that first of all is notorious for having problems second has this huge engine and gets very crappy fuel mileage and very poor power now i could see if this huge engine put down big power why it would use alot of fuel but they dont harleys v twins are about as fuel effiecient as a 5 hp briggs and stratton and just about as powerful too now i will give credit when i think it is due harleys are very nice looking bikes and i like loud as well as the next guy but if you are gonna have the bark and no bite it is all pointless you harley guys are about as pityful as these new hondda civics with the fart cannon exaust yeah its loud but has no power this seems like dumb ass to me even the Vrod which is a high performance harley is has if i am not mistaken a 1340cc correct me if i am wrong and makes what 110hp well shoot fire any 750cc jap bike makes that with a much lighter better handling package i raced this queer on a harley one time on my old honda cb750 sohc which for its day was pretty fast and this freak on this sportster883 with all sorts of hop ups pulls next to me running his mouth you wanna race that japanese pile of crap i am talkin this 883 was built cams pipe ported polished ect so i broke him off a a little bit off the line we were pretty even by the top of second i had him by about a half a bike third i walked out to about 2 bikes and by 3rd i continued to pull ahead and by the time i let off in 4th he was about 5-7 bikes behind this is with a totally bone stock honda 750 single cam which is not really a fast bike but decent for its day and this was a few years ago and as far as cruisers go all the japanese companies offer a very nice cruiser ar half the cost of a harley and a much much better bike more power better handling better brakes and way more reliable than any harley ever thought of being so if you own a harley i am sorry to say you got screwed all you bought is a name with no quality no power and ancient technology that you will be fixing more than riding i can think of alot of things to spend 20 grand on and a stinkin harley isnt one of them i could buy 3 jap cruisers for that kind of money and have a much nicer bike that out performs a harley in every aspect and that old cb750 i had is still running great and has never been rebuilt the only thing that has ever been done to it is the carbs were gone through but that bike is 25 years old and has had the hell ran out of its whole life who here has a harley that old can say that about his bike ill bet you all i own not one of you can say your bike is that reliable i know better if you say otherwise facts are facts and japan builds a better product this is true with thier cars also you cant wear out a little nissan or toyota or honda they will keep going and going
