There is simply nothing remarkable about Jameson's Irish Whiskey. It is pleasant but undistinguished. Even it's most ardent admirers couldn't claim that it is the best whiskey from Ireland. Out of the few that I've tasted, I'd say it's no better than 7th or 8th. I'm certainly not buying Jameson's when I can buy the much better Powers for $5 less a bottle. Jameson's bears the same relationship to Irish whiskey generally as Budweiser does to beer. It is not unpleasant, but I'm not about to drink it unless it's the only thing behind the bar. Why Pernod Ricard are pushing this brand instead of either Power's or Black Bush is baffling to me.
