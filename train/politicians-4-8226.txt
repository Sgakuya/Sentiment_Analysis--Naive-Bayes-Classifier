Here I have been reading comments about a man who occupied the Presidency and many comments criticize and rate him low for being a skirt chaser?! Gimmie a break! That's the only quality you rate a president? Who cares?! Let's see; didn't he stare down ( negotiate ) with the Russians to leave Cuba? Isn't that little more important that he probably avoided nuclear war than if he chased skirts? JFK did not have much time in the office, therefore he was not able to do a lot. However, if you were alive during that you know (whether you like him or not; similar to Ronald Reagan who often spoke highly of JFK) that he was a tremendous inspiration to America with his enthusiasm, his intelligence and his leadership. I suspect one reason why JFK was so cautious yet firm with the Russians, is he was in WWII; unlike our current W. Bush.
