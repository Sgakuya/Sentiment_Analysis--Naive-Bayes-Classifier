The newest of all the Harry Potter books lives up to it's predescendents. I still am kinda depressed and upset that J.K. Rowling killed off Sirius in this book though. He was a really great and important character. I don't think that she should have killed him off. She is probably trying to make a complicated plot, but, I mean this is Sirius after all. I don't think he should have died. He was my favorite character only though he only really appeared in the fifth book, a few times in the 3rd book, and a few in the forth. I think he shouldn't have died. But who am I to say what J.K. Rowling rights, right? But the book did live up to it's predescesers. And that's good. Great job, J.K. Rowling.
