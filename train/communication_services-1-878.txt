By far the worst service and most expensive. I owned a Clearnet phone and couldn't be happier. They had 24 hour friendly, customer service, they had no hidden fees (all you paid is the plan rate, no bullshit 911 charge or system fee ect. just plan rate + GST), they had free voice mail, free call waiting, free call diplay ect., they had the best prices and the best 24 hour 7 days a week friendly service. Now that telus has taken over, they have the worst prices, the worst service that closes at 8 east time, the most annoiying servce, and they've discraced the slogan: the futre is friendly . For example, when telus took over they started charging $1.00 for 911, $7.00 for system fee, and many other charges on top of the monthly rate plan. Clearnet used to offer 200 for $25 flat, no hidden cost plus free voice mail ect. now telus offers 150 minutes for $25 plus all the hidden cost(about $10 in hedden cost), not to mention they down graded their voice mail to mini voice mail , which in short means that you only get 3 message capacity, if you want more capacity of cource you gotta pay more. This is just for starters I could write pages of more cheapness, but I'll just leave you with my last experience. To keep it short, my phone froze and since the battery needs a special screw to remove I was forced to run around for 7 hours to get it fixed. I couln't call cutomer service because telus does not allow pay phones to call their toll free number without putting in $0.35, even at their dealers they would't let me call customer service. Too sum up their cusromer service was useless and after visiting 5 of their sugessted locations and went and bought a scewdriver and fixed it myself.
