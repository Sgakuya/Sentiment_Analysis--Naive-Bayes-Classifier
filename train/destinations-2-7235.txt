Well what can i say i love Scotland so much beautiful countryside and Inverness, Glasgow and Aberdeen were all fantastic........but as its capital Edinburgh is such a let down. It is a boring city that is full of beggars and drug dealers, i was offered heroin 3 times on princes street, which has to be the worst shopping street of any city i have been to in the UK (including Cardiff). The door stewards at the clubs were rude and the locals were abrasive (and ugly), with no sense of humour. The biggest thrill i got from Edinburgh was leaving! Overated and the only reason it gets a 2 is because it is in Scotland.
