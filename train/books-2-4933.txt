This is one of those books that, for some reason, is viewed as a classic. Personally I fail to see why. The story is mainly told through the memory of the maid Ellen. She follows Heathcliff and Katherine throughout their childhood and adulthood. I usually try to look for books that have character s I can symphatize with and Wuthering Heights failed extently in that capacity. I didn t like Heathcliff, I didn t like Katherine, I didn t like Hindley I didn t much care for anyone. Well... I might ve cared a little something for them while they were still young but once they grew up, or atleast grew older all that sentimental liking just dissapeared. As for anyone to portray Heathcliff in a romantic light... There are several not-so-clean words I have to say about that believe me. The story in itself is basically just a build-up and build-up until it winds down and then stops. It never really amounts to anything apart misory and pain. So all in all, a pretty dull read that won t do much other than dissapoint you.
