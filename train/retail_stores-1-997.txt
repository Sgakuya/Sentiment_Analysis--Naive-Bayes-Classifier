In short, Abercrombie = overpriced mediocrity. Abercrombie Fitch is nothing more than Suburban Uniforms R Us. This is where insecure high school football players buy shirts that tell the world they play for Abercrombie or that they're on the Abercrombie Rowing Team or some other such bullsh!t. And what amazes me every time about the people who shop there, especially the males, is that an overwhelming majority of them ARE the stereotypical homophobic jock types, yet they feel they achieve social acceptance through shopping in a store plastered with homo-erotic imagery. That little contradiction or whatever you want to call it never ceased to amuse me, because I'm sure all these macho guys gotta walk around the mall with images of young muscle boys hugging eachother all over their shopping bags. Nonetheless, Abercrombie does their best to meet the MTV-uniform demands of our increasingly vapid and mindless youth culture. I mean, if the sh!t MTV passes off to our youth as music absolutely must sound homogenized and uncreative, then it only stands to reason that there is a pressing demand for clothing that is equally dull. And Abercrombie Fitch has it covered. Thank god - it's just so much fun living in a society that regards creativity and originality with shame. In style, my ass! Thanks, Carson! Oh yeah, I almost forgot: I'M NOT A F*CKING BILLBOARD!!! Maybe there's some advertising loophole I'm missing here, but I'm pretty sure that ADVERTISERS are the ones who foot the bill for ad space, not the parties providing said space. What a racket they have going, eh? But just remember, Melanie and Stacy and Britney and Buffy and Fufu and Biff and Ethan and Logan and Heath and everyone else in the Fashion Club won't accept you if you don't shop there.
