ohh, at moments like this you want to put up a red flag in the face of pop-culture. What i most despise about bratty, besides the fact that she is a talentless, thoughtless, and until surgery boobless chic, is that she actually had the nerve to compare herself to madonna. Ah what has the world come to dear friends. and reported madonna doesn't mind this. Madonna wake up and regain your artistic integrity. I actually like pop music. I luv madonna, i luv cher, i luv stevie nicks, blondie, cyndy lauper and you know all them. but britty is so unoriginal and her voice sounds like an old lady in labor, her dances and imagery is trite. This is not what pop music is supposed to be. I am disturbed, upset, and angry. 80's madonna and cyndy was so much better, what's wrong with this pop generation
