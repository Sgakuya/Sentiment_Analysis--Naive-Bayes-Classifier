I like Chivas on the rocks with Coke Cola. Chivas is good stuff, and very worth it when I bought it on sale last week for $21.95 for a 5th. Chivas ranges between $26.99 - $29.99 most places I have looked for the 5th. I figured for $21.95 it had to be a great deal, considering Makers Mark and Jack Danials was around $20.00 a 5th, pay a few bucks more and get some better drink. I am a lover of all kinds of booze though, Jack Danials, Makers Mark, Knob Creek , Jack Danials gentleman Jack, Jack Danials Single Barrel is heaven, and expensive. Any time you find a good bottle of something on sale it is always worth it.
