The question is, if you take a great player off of a great team would he still remain great. Dan played with both a superbowl caliber team (Dolphins of the early eighties) and a team that probably should not have been in the playoffs at all (Dolphins after the early eighties). His productivity was greater early on but he still played at a very high level throughout the remainder of his career. It is difficult for me to say Montana or Emmitt or any very good player that plays on a Dynasty is the greatest of all time because of the fact that they are surrounded by other Hall of Famers. Dan never had that luxury and was still amazing therefore I can see why people would consider him the greatest ever.
