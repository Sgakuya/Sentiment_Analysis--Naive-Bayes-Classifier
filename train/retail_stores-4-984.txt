This is to everyone: I think that it's very ignorant on both sides to your opinions on Abercrombie. To all the people who say Abercrombie is sick: clothes are clothes. People wear what they want to wear and there is nothing wrong with that. If you want to wear something different, people don't criticize you for that! And if racism is your back-up to your argument, I'M BLACK AND MY FRIENDS ARE BLACK AND WE WEAR ABERCROMBIE FITCH. I feel comfortable in these clothes, and it's what I like to wear. I don't criticize everyone else on what they wear. And to those people who love a f: don't beat up on people just because they can't afford the clothes. They can't help how much money is coming to them. That's not a good argument.
