oh please, JOE MONTANA was the best to ever play the position, i have this argument w/ my uncle and brother, who make every excuse in the world for marino. marino was a great passer, and i would say he had a great/greatest arm of anyone in the nfl.....but montana was the better quarterback, he played the position and knew the game better than anyone. it's like comparing a brawler and a boxer, and most boxing experts agree, the boxer usually wins. anyways, for everyone riding the JERRY RICE excuse.....first things first, marino had some excellant recievers himself (the mark's brothers, and they made him look good many times climbing invisable ladders to catch balls) and elway had the 3 amigos (who were an excellant trio as well).....montana won 2.....2.....once again,2 superbowls w/o jerry rice (i think rice was still in high school when he won his first).....joe took over a team that was considered the joke of the league, they were 2-14 before joe and were consistantly bad, when joe took over (only adjustment made was montana) they win the SB his first yr as the starter, then another (against marino who outside the first qt, didn't look like he belonged as a qb)....rice was just icing on the cake, and rice bennefitted from acurate, percise passing where he never had to lay his body out (like cris carter for example) and get injured, or break stride to adjust (and slow down) which made his job that much easier (just catch it and keep running w/o slowing down).....the west coast off is not simple and qb friendly, which is why so many teams dropped it , they did not have as holmgren says the qb to run it, short quick,timing passes require much more skill than it looks, beside accurate reads of def, audibles, and percision....elway tried it for a season or two and stunk, they were even booing him at mile high, they switched up to a run first off, and terell davis became the man....elway is a qb i feel was great, and he couldn't run it. when he went to KC, even as an old man he was a winner (KC has not won a post seasn game since montana retired) and all i needed to see his first season there was, that if he was not so injury prone, he would have at least took an avg (and offensively they were avg at best) team to the superbowl,lol, even as an old man......one more thing, joe also won championships in college and high school.....the teams couldn't buy a win until he showed up.....he is either the luckiest guy alive.....or that freaking good.....incase you didn't figure it out.....he is the best hands down
