He never has been and never will be impressive enough to call him a true #1 shutdown corner. Last year the Raiders paid $10 million to keep him on a franchise tag. How were they rewarded? Their defense continued to languish, failing to either stop the run or pass. Were it not for their terrible run defense, the passing game would have got picked on more than it had been. He is fast and had a great rookie season... but this is a league of "what have you done for me lately?" His rookie season was 8 years ago... what has he really accomplished since? He loses most one-on-one battles, is terrible in run support, can't jam most recievers, and is no where near worth the money Oakland pays for him. He wouldn't even be a #2 corner on alot of teams.
