I think that Tolkien is a genius, no no words can describe him because what he has created is beyond brilliant! I loved these books and ll of his books! He bringshis characters to life and he discribes everything so well! You actually feel like you in Lothlorien, Gondor, the Shire, Rivendell, Mordor (but who would want to be in mordor), on the road with the Fellowship, and on the battle feild. If i could I would give this trilogy 1,000,000 stars but it only goes up to five. The second I started to read the books I fell in love with it instantly. This book can be enjoyed by people of all ages and I hope that every on enjoys it.
