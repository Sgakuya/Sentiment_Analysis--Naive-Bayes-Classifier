ONE of the best centers in carolina history... his tattoo says it all i can... he can do AnYtHiNg! he conditioned alot last summer and it's really paid off... glad he's comin back his senior year and he WILL get his jersey in the rafters!! oh yeah, and his name isn't SCOTT!!! UPDATE! Ahh!! my baby did great against maryland! who swept maryland? that's right.. CAROLINA! way to go sean... 22 pts & 11 rebs UPDATE! career high 32 pts against FSU... and 12 rebs. also named ALL-AMERICA! UPDATE:::: yes unc4me07 is right.. sean is better then sheldon... he should def. be the ACC player of the year... and everyone who thinks it should be J.J. should look at how much talent Sean has. All J.J can do is score.. not that thats a bad thing.. but that aint the only thing that matters.. u need to be able to DEFEND! J.J. bein a top choice for ACC player of the year is the biggest piece of crock i've ever heard... the 13 ppl who thought Sean shouldnt have been on the all acc team needa try actually WATCHIN him play... UPDATE: Wooden Award finalist! well deserved, and kklove his name is SHELDON not SHELTON, if you're gunna talk all great about him, spell his name right UPDATE: MVP of the Tournament... he's the best player in AMERICA... and if you don't think so, you don't watch college basketball... I'm so proud of him for comin back his senior year and get'n his degree... This afternoon he was on tv sayin We didnt have to worry about him not comin back next year, bc that aint gone happen... He's going to do everything he can to get his teammates to comeback also... Way to go Sean! Congrats...
