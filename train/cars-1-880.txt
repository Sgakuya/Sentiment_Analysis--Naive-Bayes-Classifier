We purchased our 2001 Virage TX new in July of 2002. We put apprx. 75 hrs on it during the summer of 2002 with no troubles and had a lot of fun with it. The ski has been in the shop for the entire spring summer of 2003 due to a recall that was not fixed prior to our puchasing the ski. We were not notified of the recall and only found out about it after paying $1200 to have the exhaust system replaced. Polaris Industries refuses to work towards getting the ski fixed, placing the blame on the Polaris Dealer we purchased the ski from. This dealer is no longer in business so at this time we have been hung out to dry. Additionally, one of the parts needed to fix the ski has been on back order for an extended period of time and obtaining information from Polaris Industries about the time frame of the part's availability is frustrating to say the least. Purchasing a product from Polaris is a risky investment.
