First off, Ill have to say that im proud to be a citizen of this country. We may not be as popular our neighbour in the south, but we can hold our head up high and say that our conscious is clear, we are a safe and a peaceful nation. This is a multi-racial country, and we all could get along fine and is a racial harmony country. We have alot of things to offer, from great beer and great hockey teams, to the beautiful natural scenary like the Canadian Rockies and many more. By the way, dear old Grim, u have failed to insult us by critising our accents cuz I think the southern georgian accent of your country is much more annoying.
