1994 Honda Accord LX. Blue, 5-speed, 4-cylinder, pwr windows/locks, after-market CD player. 128,000 miles so far. Bought it used, one prior owner, in January of 2001, with 91,000 miles on it. Needed a new water pump and timing belt when I bought it. Regular oil changes every 3,000 miles and no major problems. It died on me in October of last year- needed a new ignitor because the old one burned out- and will need a new clutch master cylinder and slave cylinder in a few months. Not too bad, considering that for 30,000 miles now I have driven it like a race car and beaten the piss out of it in every way I can. Still rides smooth and out-accelerates most other 4-cylinder cars in its class, and this is a 10-year old car now! Only body problems are a little rust on the front of the rear quarter panels, but it seems every Honda in New England has a little rust in the same area, so I guess it must be endemic to the species. Also, the heat shield under the car rattles like two skeletons screwing on a tin roof; the aluminum pins that hold it in place rusted out after last winter. These last two quirks I've mentioned are common with most older Hondas I have seen, but the reliability, gas mileage, and sheer enjoyment of driving a car that just won't die makes these seem incidental. Love my Honda, definetely recommend it for anyone looking for a reliable vehicle.
