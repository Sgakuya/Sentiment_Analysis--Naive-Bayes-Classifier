Hi group! I just went in tonight to try to fix a couple problems on my account. The retarded bank decided that when a person has $3 in their account, that they can authorize a $208 credit transaction that I didn't know was coming through the account. The charge was refunded by the original company and the bank still refuses to refund my multiple charges I have from their greed and fees. Instead of the manager looking at the problem, he called me an idiot, made an idiotic expression on his face, and threatened to have me arrested because of me being so pissed at them for trying to screw me over. They instead say they are going to charge off the amount and send it to my credit report. I think this shows how unethical and greedy this company really is. I will never do business with this bank again. If I ever open another business, I may refuse checks written from us bank accounts if I can legally. I have no desire to ever deal with them again in my life. Does anyone know how I can fight this on my credit? Also, I think it is really funny that US Bank owns the website usbanksucks.com They totally own it because they know it's true. If anyone could help me, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.
