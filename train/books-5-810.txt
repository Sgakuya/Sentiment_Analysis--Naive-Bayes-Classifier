I would agree with earlier comments that this is an excellent book in its own right, but as you continue through the series, it isn't the greatest. But if you have never picked up a Harry Potter book, I would highly recomend it. I would say the first two, maybe three books qualify as children's books, and are a quick and simple read, but really, it's a book about a 12 year old kid, how complicated do you want it to be at this point? It was under a lot of protest that I finally picked this book up, being under the impression that 12 year olds was the age group reading it at the same time, but this is far from the case. I don't think you have to have a simple mind to enjoy a simple book, and being an introductory book I feel this serves its purpose well, and it left me wanting more.
