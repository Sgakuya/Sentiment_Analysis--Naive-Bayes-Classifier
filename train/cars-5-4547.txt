I've read some of the other comments, and felt compelled to submit my own to clear up a few things. First of all I'm so sick of hearing that Ford's out sale Chevy. Here's the truth: Ford has never outsold Chevy from now until the beginning of time! Ford doesn't tell you in there ads that they only outsale chevy in a division. When you put chevy and GMC together, they've out sold Ford by roughly 100,000 units a year over the past 20 yrs. A GMC is nothing more than a Chevy in GMC cladding. Another thing is the comment that Ford's sit higher, which some of these dim wits think it gives them better ground clearance. Yes it's true, Ford's sit higher, but don't have better ground clearance. The way the chevy suspension is designed, it gives you about an inch more clearance than Ford. So basically you get better ground clearance, and a lower step in height. I challenge any stock Ford V-8 out there to try and out run my 5.3 chevy. I also challenge any Ford or Dodge to out do the mileage I get. I have a 3:73 rear end, on a Z-71 4x4, and average almost 17 MPG just around town! I recently got over 19 on a trip! So take a back seat Ford guys, you should be used to it.
