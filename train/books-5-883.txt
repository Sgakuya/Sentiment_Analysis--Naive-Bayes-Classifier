well I first had the study this book in 6th grade with a mediocre teacher. I thought it was vaguly intresting about how the community worked but thatas about it. But having studied it in 8th grade with a fantastic teacher, Whoa. WHo could expect so much from a small, paperback novel? The beauty of this book is the psychology, you have Jonas. Who goes through his 'Jonah and the Whale' trail. Growing up in a world where everything was laid out for him, no choices, no freedoms, but no hunger, or anger, or gried. To him it seems like a perfect world, but as Jonas learns about how the world used to be, before it went into 'Sameness' he is left with the choice of leaving the world in its own ignorence, or changing the lives of everybody. THe most direct theme I would say thats in this book is 'theres no happniess without pain'.
