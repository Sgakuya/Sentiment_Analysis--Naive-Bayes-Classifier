Can I just point out yes, Quebec City is quite small and yes you can see a lot of it in 24 hrs but there is also a lot to do out side of the city, you can visit Chutes Montmorency or you can visit further afield and try some of the outdoor sports available such as whitewater rafting in summer or skiing in winter - was cityslicker too stupid to visit the tourist information to find this out!!!! And what is this about not going if you don't speak French!! It is a tourist city - EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE speaks English, and everyone is prepared to help, the Quebecois are some of the friendliest people you will meet. Everyone should visit Quebec City, it is full of history and culture and quite frankly (depsite the cold) it is beautiful.
