Sarah Jessica Parker is an awesome actress. She is intelligent, beautiful, and charismatic. I feel sorry for her because of all of the bad publicity she has been getting recently. So she said something that she probably would've been better off not saying--GET OVER IT. I think that it is great for people to express their political views, whether or not I agree with them. Her family used to be on welfare. Maybe she is talking not only for herslef, but for all of the other people over here that may need support from our government. Oh, by the way, she quit smoking a few months ago--she smokes fake cigarettes on SATC.
