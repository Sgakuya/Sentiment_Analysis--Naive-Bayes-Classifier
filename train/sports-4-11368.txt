The fact that Mike Shula does not have any head coaching experience in his resume doesn't worry me. In theory, every coach who has ever coached at ANY level once stood at that same position. Mark Richt had no head coaching experience before Georgia expressed their confidence in him. I have that same confidence in Shula, who was charting plays in the Super Bowl at age 12. He has all the tools at his disposal: a program with a rich tradition (which some people scoff at, but it IS a factor in recruiting, whether they want to admit it or not), great facilities, a good staff and a young outlook, giving him the ability to establish a good rapport with recruits and make an impact on their parents, as well. As for ability, he has Shula blood running through his veins and has lived and breathed football virtually his entire life and learned from the most successful coach in NFL history. I see no reason to not think he will succeed at Bama.
