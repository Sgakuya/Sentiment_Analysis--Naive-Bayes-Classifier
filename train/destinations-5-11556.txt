Definately if your vegan/vegetarian/Italist...go to ITAL it's the best place to go when your in Negril!!! I ate there 3 times a day because the only thing I could eat with all inclusive spring break was rice. It was very very cheap and relaxing and everyone there was so friendly. They will accomodate to anything you want, I guarentee you will leave satisfied. It is on Norman Manley Blvd between Willow Woods and Kuyaba! Im serious! *if you are vegan you have to try it out! try out the banana pancakes, they're my favorite!! my friends who eat meat and dairy went and they loved it, even if it was just something light before a night of going out and partying! Thanks! Tell Jerome(chef)and Karl(owner)Amy says hi!!
