What a magnificent Park!!! The cast members are polite and helpful (99% of the time), and you are blessed with great California weather. Take advantage of the FastPass system...they will always pay off. Best value restaurants to go to are Pizza Port in Tomorrowland and Cafe Del Zocolo in Fronteirland. Great food. Stay away from anyplace that serves burgers and fries....if you need such an apertife, try Award Wieners at Disney California Adventure....or pretty much any other restaurant. I worked for the park for nearly 10 years...in the 90's...and I noticed that pretty much every restaurant built after Pizza Port actually had taste and value.....all others stear clear of. Want a good burger....go to MacDonalds across the street ( it not Disney owned....so you are not paying outrageous prices like at the MCD in Disneyworld).
