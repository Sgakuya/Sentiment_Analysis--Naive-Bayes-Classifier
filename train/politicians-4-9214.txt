A solid president, Jackson's terms as Chief Executive ushered in a new era of politics for the common man. His Native American policy was loathesome, but it was the natural next step for manifest destiny. The Peggy Eaton affair and other scandals led to the resignation of multiple cabinet members like John C. Calhoun, but he was not fully responsible for those events. He did a good job in defusing a volatile situation with nullification for the time being. One negative in his time as President was his deliberate attempts to destroy the Bank of the US through Specie Circular. His moves in that area killed the economy. Overall, though, he did a more than serviceable job in the presidency.
