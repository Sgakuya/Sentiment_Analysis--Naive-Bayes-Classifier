If I could rate her as a 4.5 or 4.75, I would. I shy away from a 5 because I'd probably be accused of rating her that highly just because of my ingrained Italian prejudice. Sophia was (is) a very versatile actress, doing everything from comedy to drama (that is, if you ever paid attention to the story line in the first place because you weren't totally distracted by her obvious physical attributes). She did a couple of films with Marcello Mastroianni that had some hilarious lines in Italian that just didn't come off very well when dubbed in English. Although I liked most of her films, there were a few that were real stinkers in my estimation. I may have put this in another RIA post, but there's an anecdote about an Italian guy that was being interviwed by a magazine reporter who asked him what he liked most about Sophia Loren. His answer was "Is she walking toward me or away from me?".
