Mostly the courses are regurgitations of well known and publically available material. The original material is rather poorly written and not well organised in terms of theory. It often sounds good until you question it. That is probably my biggest criticism: questioning anything, from the book material to general theory, gets either no response or 'that is an interesting question but beyond the scope of the curriculum.' If you are the type of person who is satisfied with taking the material in the textbooks at face value, then, like all MBA programs, the OU is a good place to learn the jargon and it does serve the purpose of opening the student to a larger picture of business. However, it is still two orders of magnitude below excellent.
