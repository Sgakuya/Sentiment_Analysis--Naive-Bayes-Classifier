Talk about a no win situation. He knows that Israel's long-term security in the region is predicated on establishing a lasting peace with the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world. Yet, to do this, he must negotiate and shake hands with a man who not too long ago was the leader of a terrorist organization whose sole mission was the destruction of Israel and whose people are taught from birth to hate Jews and Israelis. In addition, he must deal with his own people who are understandably skeptical of the peace process, many who do not want to trade land for peace, and all who will never give up any control of Jerusalem. Barak is doing everything he can in this very difficult time.
