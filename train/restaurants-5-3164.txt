I just tried Maggie Moo's after being a fan of Coldstone. I have to say I am now a lifelong loyal customer of Maggie Moo's. My kids absolutely loved the bright colors in the shop and the cute (but crazy looking) cow mascot. My 12 month old caused a ruckus after trying the cotton candy flavor - he just loved it!! I found out that Coldstone ice cream is milk based, whereas Maggie's is cream based. I really could tell the difference in taste - and the price was about the same as Coldstone (which I had always thought expensive). Maggie Moo's has a superior product, fun environment, friendly staff, a great mascot, and of course, delicious ice cream. Watch out Coldstone!
