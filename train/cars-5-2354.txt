OKOL1170M obviously cannot afford a Boxster. I would bet $10,000 that this guy only has a Honda or Nissan of some sort. The only people that take the time to rant about the Boxster not being a real Porsche are not successful enough (and probably not educated enough) to afford one. They are also the same people that wouldn't know a 550A Spyder, Number One, an RSK, or a 904 if it ran over them from behind. The Boxster is an amalgamation of all the classic lines of Porsche, and more importantly, all the classic notions of what a open two-seat roadster from Porsche should be. By the way, in addition to my Boxster, I also have a Ferrari 308, so don't tell me I don't know a thing or two about sportscars.
