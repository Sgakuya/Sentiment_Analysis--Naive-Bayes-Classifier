Besides being extremely beautiful, I think that Katie Holmes could be a very good actress. The problem is that she will always be typecast as Joey from Dawson's Creek , in part because it was her first major part and also because she played that role so well that its hard to watch a movie without thinking of her as Joey. I think that her most far-reaching performance was her brief, but powerful appearance in The Gift , in which she plays the town slut who becomes the victim of a murder. I feel in a few years, now that Dawson's Creek has run its course, people will take Katie Holmes more seriously and recognize her very obvious acting skills.
