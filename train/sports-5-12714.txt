They'll contend for it all this year, if not simply because of that defense; almost everybody is back. It's just the best defense in the country, no question about it. They'll have trouble scoring, though. I wonder about them at every offensive skill position: Jason White is fragile mentally and physically; Brent Rawls will replace him early in the year. Without Quentin Griffin, they'll struggle to move the chains; last year, he and Hybl were basically their only weapons on offense. The recieving corps are middle-of-the-road. They play a favorable schedule, though. I don't see a team on there that they can't beat.
