Ok, all you Bibi fan, myself among them, we have to admit one thing to ourselves. In his private life, Netanyahu isn't exactly a saint. But that doesn't matter. He is a man of remarkable courage, patriotism and intelligence. Terrorists (ok, they were baader meinhoff but still they were acting for the PLO) killed his brother, he knows what scum they are. He understands that the PLO (i refuse to say PA) is incapable of peace and there is no point in negotiation. Push them into the arab world. I'm tired as hell right now so I'm going to end this with this. The labor and the people of Israel are going to have to realize that if they don't elect a man like Binyamin Netanyahu now, they will soon have Yasser Arafat.
