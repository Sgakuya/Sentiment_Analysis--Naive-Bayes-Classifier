My comments echo what so many have said when they first heard JOSH's voice - they stopped whatever they were doing to try to find who he was! I think that as Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder ... so Music is in the Ear of the Listener ... No one can force someone to like a performer if they are not'in tune' with that performer's style or type of music. I fully respect the choices others make, but I feel that Josh's voice is a welcome 'Fresh Summer Breeze' on the music scene, where so many seek only to fit into the 'popu;ar accepted mold of the day'... He is in a class of his own, for those of us, to whom his voice is an inspiration... Thank goodness we can all have the freedom to make our own choices!
