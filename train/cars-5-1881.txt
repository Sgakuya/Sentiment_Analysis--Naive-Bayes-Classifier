I have a 1998 Ford Escort ZX2 and love it. This car is really cute looking and has alot of pep. I bought my car brand new and can't complain. It's fully loaded, except it doesn't have a moon roof, and the sticker price on my car was $15,695. The 2001 models have leather interior and chrome wheels, and they are still cheap. When I finish paying mine off I'm going to purchase another one. Two of my friends have ZX2s and love them. It's the perfect first car for anyone. My car can haul ass too. It's not the best car on the market but who can afford $50,000+ on a car. It's a great value for the money, I'm happy.
