A poster here was complaining about one specific area in Washington. Not a fair review I would say. I do agree that someone moving to Seattle is not intelligent. Its expensive, Its huge, its overpriced, the traffic is bad, and there are a lot gangs. Not a good thing. But Washington is a big state people. Go further south down near the Oregon border. its beautiful. Also , in the middle of Washington its pretty dead. The tri-cities area supposedly has a lot of gangs as well. Its ugly there anyway. The EAst coast of Washington is AWSOME. Spokane has anything you would need and is surrounded by suburbs and rural communities. Its affordable! Its perfect. Its a river city and I love river cities. Riverfront park is nice if your bored and there are a few nice restaurants around it too. Its only 45 minutes from Couer d'alene Idaho which has a beautiful huge lake and is mountains and pine forest. Beautiful. Theres winter sports there too and its a 4 season area......a full snowy winter, a hot dry summer and the spring and fall are pleaseant.
