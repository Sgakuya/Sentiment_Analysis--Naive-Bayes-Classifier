Totally underrated movie. The premise is pretty typical, the whole grad night/teen party thing but something sets this film apart for me. Perhaps it's Ethan Randall/Embry who has always been a charming, vulnerable, likeable actor. Perhaps it's Seth Green who I think is one of the funniest young actors today. It could be the music, Matthew Sweet helped out on the music for this one. Can't Hardly Wait is a funny film that's not trying to be deep or meaningful. Maybe it's the fact that comedies don't get Oscar nominations but they don't seem to make as many as they used to. Lighten up Hollywood! We need to laugh every once in a while.
