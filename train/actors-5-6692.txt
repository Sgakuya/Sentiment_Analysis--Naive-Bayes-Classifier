I think Tim Robbins is a very good actor. He is also very handsome. I at least think that. Some of my friends don't understand why but I just think he is gorgeous. I love the Shawshenk Redemption. Right now I am trying to see every movie he has ever played in. Some movies I can't find but I'll keep trying. I'm determined to see all of them. But seriously he is an awesome actor. I loved him in Arlington Road also. I just feel he is so good at showing different personalities. From being a good guy accused in Shawshenk Redemption to an evil terrorist in Arlington Road. He has style and class. Too bad he is married to Susan Sarandon!!!!!!
