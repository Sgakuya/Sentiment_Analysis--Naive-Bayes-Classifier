FORGET ABOUT I'VE DONE ALL THE RESEARCH IN THE WORLD AND HAVE TALKED TO ALOT OF HEAVY PEOPLE. HAD MICKEY NOT DRANK SO MUCH AND TAKEN CARE OF HIMSELF AND NOT GOT IJURED SO MUCH HE DEFINATELY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER OF ALL-TIMES. ALOT OF PEOPLE HAVE OPINIONS BUT GIVE ME SOME FACTS, IT IS A FACT THE MANTLE HAD MORE SPEED THAN ANYBODY INCLUDING MAYS[ HOME TO FIRST 3 SECOUNDS FLAT LEFTY AND 3.1 SECOUNDS RIGHTY WHEN HE FIRST CAME UP]. FACT THAT HE HAD MORE POWER THAN ANYBODY[ HE HIT THE LONGEST HOMERUNS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GAME, LONGEST HOMERUN EVER IN GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS-643FT IN DETROIT! AS IT IS HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST OUTFIELDERS THAT EVER WAS, IF HE WOULD HAVE HAD GOOD LEGS THAN WHAT? HE ALSO RETIRED WITH A HIGHER BASE STEALING PERCENTAGE THAN MAYS, EVEN WITH BAD LEGS! HE ALSO RETIRED WITH A HIGHER FIELDING PERCENTAGE THAN MAYS, THE MAYS FANS WILL TELL YOU THAT MAYS TOOK MORE CHANCES, HE ALSO HAD THE GOOD LEGS MAYS RIGHT? CONSIDER THAT MANTLE MANY TIMES WAS SWITCHED TO RIGHT OR LEFTFIELD WITCH THROWS YOU OFF IF YOU'RE USE TO PLAYING CENTER BECCAUSE OF THE ANGLE THE BALL IS COMING AT YOU! TALK TO ME. FORGET IT I HAD THE PRIVLEGE TO ASK RED BARBER WHO WAS BETTER MANTLE OR MAYS TO SEE WHAT HE THAUGHT AND HE SAID 'WELL MANTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST BUT HE GOT HURT', THERE IT IS. MICKEYS' CARREAR CAN BE SUMMED UP BY 1961 THAT YEAR HE DEFINATELY WOULD HAVE WON THE HOMERUN CROWN HAD HE NOT GOT HURT HE MISSED TWO WEEKS AND HE AVERAGED A HOMER MORE PER AT BATS THAN MARIS, ALSO CONSIDER HOW THAT HE LED THE LEAUGE IN WALKS! TALK TO ME. MANTLE WAS THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER OF ALL-TIMES AND STILL IS AFTER THAT, WILLIE MAYS. AS A MATTER OF FACT HE WAS AND IS THE ONLY PLAYER IN HISTORY BETTER THAN MAYS! I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU. THE REASON MAYS WAS THE VOTED PLAYERS OF THE 60S IS CAUSE MANTLE GOT HURT IN 63 AND WAS NEVER THE SAME AGAIN, BUT MICKEY WAS PLAYER OF THE 50S. MAYS WAS GREAT, MANTLE WAS JUST BEYOUND THAT, LOOK WAHT HE DID IJURIES AND ALL, 1 TRIPLE CROWN, 3 MVPS AND THEY TALK ABOUT BONDS, IN THIS ERA OTHE THE HYPED UP BALL. A YOUNG MANTLE WOULD HIT ONE TO CALIFORNIA TODAY. LET'S GET SOME FACTS AND NOT OPINIONS. OPINIONS ARE LIKE ASSES EVERYBODY HAS ONE, MANTLE COULD ALSO HIT FOR AVERAGE AND LETS NOT LEAVE OUT HE WAS ALSO A GREAT BUNTER, THERE JUST WAS NOTHING HE COULDN'T DO WELL. LET'S GET SOME FACTS! SINCERELY, TEDDY.
