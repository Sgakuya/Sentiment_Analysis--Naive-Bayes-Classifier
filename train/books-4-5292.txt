I'm not quite sure what to make of this 900 page, rambling story of a man and his schizophrenic twin brother. Parts of the book reminded me of a Pat Conroy novel - especially the emphasis placed on how important it is to come to terms with the horrors of the past in order to come to make peace with the present. At times the book reminded me of a John Irving novel, with Lamb's liberal politics supplying the underlying backbone to the storyline. Whoever Wally Lamb counts as his influences, you have to give him credit for creating a pretty ambitious piece of fiction. This novel tries to tackle everything: from difficult childhoods, to infidelity, to religion, to politics, to racism, to immigration, to AIDS, and for the most part, it does a pretty good job of holding things together. My only complaint is that at times, the characters seemed to be merely tools to get across whatever point that Lamb was trying to make in that particular chapter - some of the politics, in particular, seemed somewhat forced, as did some of the parallels between Domenick and his grandfather. At times moving, at times way over the top, and at times riveting, I Know This Much is True will keep you interested - and given the scope of issues addressed, will probably cause you to get introspective about some of the things that are going on in your own life.
