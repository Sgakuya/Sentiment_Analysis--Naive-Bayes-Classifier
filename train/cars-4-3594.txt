I drove one of these recently for a couple of days and actually liked it more than I thought I would. In general I'm not a big fan of the oversized SUV's that crowd the streets these days and for the most part do little more than carry baby strollers and diapers from Starbucks to Starbucks. But I have to admit it was certainly a comfortable ride, very smooth, good acceleration, and overall very stable feeling, (of course I didn't stray any farther than secondary roads so that doesn't say a whole lot). I did however tow a little under 2,500 lbs. of stuff behind me on a trailer and it was certainly more stable at highway speeds of up to 75 mph than other vehicles I've driven with similar loads behind them and it didn't experience that constant herking and jerking that other trucks fall prey from the shifting weight of the tailer. So even though I still wouldn't buy one because I'm not a soccer mom and therfore would feel left out I can appreciate it's utilitarian side and give it a 4 spot.
