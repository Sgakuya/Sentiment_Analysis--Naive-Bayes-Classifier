I rented a 2001 4runner on my honeymoon in Costa Rica. Talk about using a 4x4 for what it was made for. We traveled the pacific coast for 2 weeks during the rainy season. We went futher south near Panama where there is much less pavement. The 4runner was great. I used the 4x4 probably half the time driving through rivers etc.. slept in it one night with the a/c on low at idle all night where there was no power, pavement or anything else within 30 miles. Still running great in the morning. Never got stuck even when the mud was making me a little nervous. Also the ground clearance really paid off in some areas where others could not get through. Oh and this thing had about 82,000 miles. This is back in 2003. I was impressed. I have a jeep wrangler and love it and would love to have the chance to challege it like that. Although I know the wrangler would never have been as comfortable. Still will keep my jeep but this is definately going to be a second car of ours in the future.
