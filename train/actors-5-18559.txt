I love the Coen brothers. The Hudsucker Proxy is such a great film, it is hysterical and Tim Robbins performance is so funny. The Coen Brothers can really push the limits of narrative cinema with their frequent and often musical dream/hallucination sequences. Raising Arizona is one of my all time favorite comedies. The characters in Coen brothers movies are as weird as David Lynch's characters but not nearly as dark, we often find a soft candy center at the heart of a Coen brothers character. The Coen brothers are as willing to take chances while most mainstream directors sit back and play it safe. I will see any film they make.
