Don't like shopping there and did not like working there. Too many managers(they hide a lot) and not enough clerks(associates). They let the loafers get away with a lot and put their workload on the good employees who are already overburdened. Managers think they are royalty and therefore do not think they need or want to wait on customers. I was a good employee there and received many compliments and there first employee of the month award they held in the store but they took advantage of me way too many times(I was an indentured servant to them) and I had to walk out in the end. I understood what customers were upset about but was powerless to do anything about it. I do thank them however for giving me a job when I needed it most but one can take only so much. The pay was terrible and the benefits minimal. Wal-Mart has good deals and I like the match other stores ads policy too but they need more variety in their food section. The smaller stores in town carry more variety. There is plenty of introspection needed in this company! I think Wal-Mart's stores are too big for their own good.
