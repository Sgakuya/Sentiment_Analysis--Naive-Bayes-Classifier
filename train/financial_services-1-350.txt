BANK ONE SUCKS - offered 4.99% on balance transfers - did it.....Grandmother dies, miss payment b/c I was away, came back to 17.99% and going up to 27.99%! The rep. told me not to worry about anything - I have great payment history and never been late....removed my stupid late charge of $35 and boom - $100 interest increase b/c of one late payment - and this will be every month (if I were to stick around like a fool). Then I try and work it out with another rep. who says they can't help. So I have to get in touch with the Executive Correspondence Dept. which has no phone - you can only fax or mail! So I do this and get no response, while they stick me with their b.s. interest charges all in the meantime. Bunch of losers with absolutely no sensitive exception for one PROVEN family disaster (by the way - offered to provide proof of death). Still no response from them so I am transferring again to another card - what a waste of my time......never again will I choose Bank One. Can't believe they would rather loose my 4.99% interest over the next 5 years as I pay down my debt, than have no interest to earn from me since I am bouncing out of here - sounds like bad business to me.
