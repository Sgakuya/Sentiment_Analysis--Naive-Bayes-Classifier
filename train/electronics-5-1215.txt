Currently own a 20 GB iPod (gray scroll wheel) and works great. I own a Mac and there is complete harmony between Mac and iPod. The space is wonderful not only for music but I also store large photoshop files on it too. I would highly suggest AppleCare because it is a delicate product. However, I've dropped mine many times and it still works great. It does scratch easily so I would also suggest a protective case. This model is definitely the best bang for your buck in terms of price and storage capabilities. I also would recommend iPod mini (brother-in-law owns one). Apple makes great products so I also recommend their computers too. One note: Many people don't like the earbud ear phones. They feel fine to me but some people will find discomfort especially if you have small ears.
