The buyer has to work a little to get these up to a 4 rating: loosen the pepperoni and add an extra amount of mozzarella cheese. By doing these things, you'll end up with probably the best frozen-pizza option available. The twin sheaves of French bread are uniquely tasty (crusty enough for an audible *crunch*, but soft enough to chew without bruising your gums). The sauce gets gushy at times, and backs up towards each end (watch out for fingertip burns!), but it's got plenty of salty spice. The happiest I've ever been with pepperoni consistency. Takes 38 minutes in a 350-degree oven for everything to get done, but it's worth the wait. Not for the faint of wallet, but if you're in the mood for something other than your run-of-the-mill gooey circle, these are hard to beat.
