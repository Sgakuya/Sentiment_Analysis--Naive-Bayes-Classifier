Since Rochester is my hometown, you can say I'm pretty biased towards it. It's a city that you can't really appreciate until you go somewhere else for awhile and realize what you've taken for granted is gone. After living there for over 17 years, I figured it was better for me to move on to other areas to recieve an education. And so I went out west. After coming home, I was pretty happy to be back. It's a relatively modest city with average people. Its suburbs--especially henrietta my former home--are what you expect them to be: white picket fences, large yards, old people and young families as neighbors, decent sized houses, and safe neighborhoods. Not just that, but everything you need is within easy reach. While the city itself isn't exactly the greatest place to be, it has made an attempt at reviving itself. Let's hope the mayor eventually has enough common sense to stop bickering about the loss of jobs and tax dollars and propose tax incentives in bad areas to get Rochester back in business. As far as everything else goes, what more can you ask for? You have seasons year round, a day's drive away from Toronto, the Finger Lakes, Adirondack mountains, 1000 islands, and the Buffalo Bills to watch in the fall. It's a great place to grow up and to raise a family. If I'm lucky enough to obtain a job there, I will definitely move back.
