kobe bryant clearly defines a very undisciplined player. could it be because he didn't go to college? phil jackson once compared him with michael jordan... MJ can do a lot with or without the ball while bryant can do a lot with the ball. yes he has exceptional athleticism but he is not a team player. ever noticed him when he gets blocked? he always makes sure to shoot it back no matter what. and oh boys look at that annoying face! he should start paying for a PR manager and work his attitude out if he wants a worldwide respect. and pls. play in a clean way...don't go putting elbow on those players better than you!
