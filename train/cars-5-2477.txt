I own a 1984 MKII Celica Supra, and I'm very happy with it. No real problems, I could just drive it and drive it and not have to worry if there's going to be a busted-this or snapped-that. The new, 93 and up MKIVs, well, those are just awesome! I don't understand how some say that it's not that pretty. The headlights, the whole rear shot, those are just beautiful! To say you need to add a body kit to be noticed is just plain uninformed. All of my friends comment how cool this one car looked, even not knowing it was a supra. How can you comapre the common Mustang to a more unusual Supra? Everyone and their brother has one of those 90 or higher ones. Spend a daily commute trip, and count the amount of mustangs and supras, of ANY years. I think originality comes into play. And what's this about an F1? Well, if we go by that logic, I think an F-16 is faster and produces more horsepower. So does that make it better? But Swarzkopf, I'm glad you could clear up my confusion by letting us all know we're morons . That's probably the best argument anyone could ever make about someone else. Bravo.
