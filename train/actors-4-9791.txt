Reese is talented and not to mention hot. As someone already commented, Reese is much more than just another pretty face. She turned down the leading roles in both Scream and Urban Legends (Why? I don't know. Perhaps she felt that the typical teen slasher genre was beneath her). She was impressive to me right off the bat in Fear . She was great as the innocent girl who is terrorized by her not so sweet boyfriend. She was also impressive in Cruel Intentions and Election . Legally Blonde was pretty funny as well, and she showed that she can pull off comedy as well as drama. Reese has a bright career ahead of her, that's for sure. It'll be interesting to see if she can play a bad girl role.
