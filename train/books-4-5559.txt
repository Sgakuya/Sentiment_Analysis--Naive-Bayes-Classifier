I enjoyed this book. While some of the praise this book has received ( The best book ever written by someone under 30 ) is a little ridiculous, Garland does a good job of developing likable, believable characters, and painting a picture of a garden of eden gone wrong. Those who see the movie prior reading the book (as I did) will find a piece of literature with much more of an edge than the movie. Gone is the cutesy oversimplification of characters and motives and a plot that ties neatly together. Make no mistake, the Beach is a chilling, uncomfortable novel about how things can go very very wrong - even with the best intentions.
