Interesting comment on behalf on Wes D. However, his irrelevant comments seem only to add to the imbroglio that Red Sox haters have created in this page. It seems to me that Marcus addressed only what was worth addressing. You see, nor he or I view a continual run for the position atop the AL east as a way to lose, whether it means a championship ring or not. Duquette's not the most beloved manager in baseball, Wes, but let's get back to the original statement of him slowly killing the franchise. Pedro and Nomar have the most secure contracts in baseball (you can throw out the argument about Everett; there was never any real conflict here, was there?). Furthermore, the phrase holding his own is in the light of playing a certain position (no matter for how many days) admirably, which I don't think anyone can debate. Inappropriate and disrespectful? Give me a break -- how Marcus phrased his idea wasn't nice, but let's get real. The inaccuracy of Pobody's Nerfect 's comment did seem to fall from the sky. Undertaking the temerarious task of getting back at insightful comments is indeed what defines an exercise in futility. And on the topic of neglect, you fellas have yet to acknowledge Duquette's acquiring of Varitek, who has since contributed to a Red Sox pitching staff that has led the American league in team ERA for each of the past two seasons. Do all you Bo Sox loathers think the same way? I suggest you move to reconsider your way of thinking!
