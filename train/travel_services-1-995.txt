I wish I had read these reviews before hiring Two Small Jerks. Similarly to the majority of the comments here, my items were held at ransom until I paid an extra $800 for a weigh scale ticket that showed no rationale for the increased weight. They damaged a number of my items and lost 3 boxes: one a safety deposit box containing hundred-year old heirlooms that could not be brought with me on the plane, and plenty of documents that could lead to identity theft including my birth certificate and personal cheques. After following up with them for over a year, I have not received ANY compensation for my loss. I have filed claims with the BBB, Ontario Ombudsmen, the Department of Consumer Affairs, and have lost any remaining faith in our judicial system. TSM went so far to tell the BBB that WE were the ones being rude! This was after following up with them 32 times. They returned 2 calls in total. If anyone is interested in filing a class action lawsuit, please contact me. cwoodley@superiorhorse.net. I have contacted CTV consumer alert as well. Hopefully someone will stop these crooks!
