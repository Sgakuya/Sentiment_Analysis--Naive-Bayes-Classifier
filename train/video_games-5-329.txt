I discovered the King's Quest series of graphic adventures when I was nine. I started with King's Quest 5, then 7, then 6, and then I found the collection. This is probably the most fun I've ever had on my computer. It includes the entire charming King's Quest series, including the notorious remake of the first (and the original, don't worry), all the way up to the seventh, and a preview of the the 8th. The King's Quest series chronicles the adventures of the Royal Family of Daventry, as the go through epics worth of story to save the kingdom or a loved one. They are truly fun and great games, and promote family fun in gaming. There's more though. The three CD set also includes the Laura Bow mystery series, about a 1920s female sleuth who finds herself in sticky situations and must find the killer in a series of gruesome murders (two games total). The first one is truly great, as it varies depending on what you do, and events happen whether you witness them or not (though you can, indeed, witness them). It also includes the Roberta's Mixed Up Mother Goose, an adventure game for much younger audiences, in which you must help nursery rhyme characters get their rhymes back on track by fetching items for them. This remake (the third remake, I believe, entitled Mixed Up Mother Goose Deluxe) is multi-lingual, and fun for all ages, not just the kiddies. You get to chose your own persona, as well. The CDS also include a few behind the scenes slide shows and articles, along with backgammon, chess, and checkers, all thrown in together with a weak KQ tie-in, in which you play the games against King Graham. This is definitely worth getting, if it is still around. Sierra has seen two renovations since this collections release, and it might have been discontinued. It is too bad the last, Mask of Eternity, did not live up to its legacy.
