Coach, as a former player I gotta tell you, the Ga Tech game was the worst job of coaching you have doen snce being at Miami. Your comment on Kyle Wrights last past was a joke, he didn't call the play, either you or Shannon did adn no one who has coached pop warner football would call a fade pattern into double coverage, throwing it up for grabs wiht the game on the line. Come on coach, first down on the 32 3 min left basic football knowledge tells ya to eat clock go underneath in safe routes with options. It was the most rediculous call you have made and look what it cost ya.....for the second year in a row..........time to start coaching Larry, get off your hand calppin ass slappin ra ra mentality and coach some football. You ahve had the talent to win two Nat Champ..............let's go Coach!!!!!Get in the game
