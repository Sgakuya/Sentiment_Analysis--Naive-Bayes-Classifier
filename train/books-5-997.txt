It doesn't surprise me that the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books are just as appealing to kids today as they were when they came out in the '40s. The books are collections of stories about Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, an eccentric woman living in an upside-down house who helped parents solve their children's problems. Her methods were unorthodox, creative, and always hilarious. For example, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle told parents whose daughter (Patsy) wouldn't bathe to sprinkle radish seeds on her once a layer of dirt had accumulated. One morning, Patsy awoke to find herself covered with leaves. After her parents harvested several radishes, Patsy declared that she wanted a bath. In another story, tattlers were given licorice drops that caused smoke tattletales to come out of their mouths and hang in the air above their heads. Once they learned to stop tattling, the tattletales went back down their throats. The Bad-Table-Manners Cure was another one of my favorites. In that story, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle sent her pig to live temporarily with a little boy in order to teach him how to behave properly at the table. Because of the vivid memories I had of my second-grade teacher reading these stories aloud, I tried reading them to my class of second-graders a few years ago. The kids were absolutely enthralled with the stories, and they begged me to continue reading every time I stopped. The male/female stereotypes date the books a bit, but you can edit them out (if you're reading aloud) or take the opportunity to discuss how things have changed. I highly recommend the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle series for kids in kindergarten through third grade.
