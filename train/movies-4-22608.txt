As a kid, I collected comic books and was a big fan of the X-Men, so I really looked forward to seeing the movie. But my expectations were low, because movies have traditionally done a poor job with comic book characters. As it turns out, X-Men isn t too bad at all. People complain that they didn t include all the characters (no Nightcrawler, Colossus, Banshee, etc.), but there s no way they could have introduced that many characters in an hour and half and still have had room for a plot. As it is, you hardly got to know Storm or Cyclops at all. And of course purists are going to find fault with the fact that small details of the comic aren t respected (Rogue is too young, Wolverine is too tall, etc.), but give me a break that stuff is far too minor to matter. Overall, the movie works. The special effects are great, the story is interesting enough for comic book fans but basic enough for people who are new to the X-Men, the acting is decent, and there are some good fight scenes. Four stars.
