A poll of Japanese businessmen revealed it was the city in Japan they most liked to visit. The only large city in scenic Hokkaido, parks full of flowers in spring, with a cool summer climate and a magnificent festival of snow and ice sculptures in winter. The compact Susukino entertainment district is known throughout Japan for bars, restaurants, and nightlife. There is a giant enclosed mall with a beer garden (Sapporo, of course) and an underground shopping complex that hums in the winter. There are surprising links to New England, like a statue to an early 1900's visiting agriculture prof from Massachusetts whose advice Be ambitious, boys! has become a catch phrase. This is friendly, beautiful Japan, without the heat and crowds.
