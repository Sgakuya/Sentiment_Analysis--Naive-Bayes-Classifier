I dig it. Here, There and Everywhere is one of those songs that even our best pal Lou couldn't deny is a bad tune. I think I heard somewhere that Lennon said that it is his favourite Beatles song, ever. It seems that on each of these albums, there are a lot of great songs, but they just strike gold on one particular track- on Rubber Soul it's In My Life, on Sgt. Pepper it's A Day in the Life. Lately I've actually been doubting the Beatles' adaquacy as musicians, perhaps because I've listened to the few albums that I have too much, and because I hadn't often stopped to think about what I was listening to. I am unsure as to whether songs like And Your Bird Can Sing, For No One, Good Day Sunshine, or Taxman are actually quality, or I just like them. But then again, according to whoever-that- painter is, art isn't great, music isn't great, it just tickles us. Perhaps I shouldn't think so much, but I can't help it. Eleanor Rigby is a neat little 2-minute poem with nice cellos. Got To Get You Into My Life has a nice verse, but it all leads up into a simple phrase. And why don't they make the horns more dynamic? Tomorrow Never Knows is a cool, psychedelic, sitar- buzzing, tape-squealing opus. Ringo's drumming is great. Revolver has a lot more depth than Rubber Soul, and I've seen polls on which Revolver was voted as the third favourite Beatles record (behind Abbey Road and the White Album, and above Sgt. Pepper by a good amount of votes).
