Being a star football player does not entitle you to a seat in Congress. Being black should not entitle you to a leadership position in the Republican Party. People should rate this guy on the same scale they rate all the athletically-challenged white people in Congress -- what has he done for the nation and his constituency? If you ask yourself that question you will inevitably come to the conclusion that Watts is a horribly ineffective Congressman and representative for his District. If it becomes a question of character (what the hell does that mean anyways?) look no further than his child out of wedlock, estranged exwife and children, questionable land dealings, slumlord properties, etc.
