Too bad all those Hollywood types found BIG SKY country first or we might have moved there. Now the Big Sky is still free but Big Land is pricey in western end of state. Love the privacy, love to visit, but maybe not so great for young and restless. Sure, it's a land of topographic/demographic, love it/hate it extremes, speaking of which, it had room for the two Teds--Kaczynski and Turner--so I guess there's room for 'em all. Aside from the state's scenery and sporting opportunities, Bozeman has great food (not just Buffalo burgers) and upscale shops; Whitefish, quaint chalets and 7,000-ft. Big Mountain Ski Resort; Kalispell, popular Flathead Lake and Glacier Park; Missoula, the university, if you're academically inclined; Livingston, a Lewis and Clark history, Yellowstone, etc. We touched down in Kalispell for 1st time in Feb. '97 and moonwalked on an eerie, endless, timeless snowscape. We were reeled in like a bass in the Bitterroot. We drove a 600-mile loop the first full day we were there. Couldn't see enough--like crazed Seinfeld fans watching a show about nothing, I guess--but we were tired of Chicago's crowded corporate cityscape and we're not fun-in-the-sun types. So Montana's not for everybody, but if you're looking for what it's got, then it's got it all.
