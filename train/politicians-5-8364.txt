When I think about the 1980s, I remember this great man and all that is great about being an American. And when I hear of someone claiming that the 1980s were nothing but a time of greed, I always counter by questioning if people, such as my parents (who immigrated from the Philippines during the 1970s), are greedy because they were amongst those who succeeded during this wonderful era. Make no doubt, the 1980s were a time of great prosperity and achievement. And Ronald Reagan inspired millions of Americans to aspire beyond what they thought was possible in everything they sought to achieve. In short, the President taught Americans to always believe in themselves. As far as his mistakes, he was definitely not a perfect man- he never claimed to be. But Reagan (a man who exemplified personal civility in the face of much criticism by his opponents) was a truly better President than most who held this great office. Finally, if anything, Reagan (not Gorbachev) was the person who contributed most to ending the Cold War. I feel that he is finally getting his positive due now, and it is about time he did. For me, he is one of my great, personal heroes (my parents, of course, being my greatest heroes).
