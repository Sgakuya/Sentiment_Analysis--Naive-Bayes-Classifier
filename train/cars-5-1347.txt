My parents recently leased a 525i which I drove when I was visiting. This is one sweet ride. I couldn't get over how quiet it was and how well it handled. It's a little bigger than you might expect, but who cares. While it lacks some of the bells and whistles that other cars in the price range have (e.g. no automatic headlights), there are some other pretty cool features (my parents each have a different key which can be programmed so that the seats and mirrors will move to their specifications). And, by leasing the car, my parents are able to have it serviced for free at the dealership. They only have to pay for the tires. I wouldn't hesitate to get one in the future.
