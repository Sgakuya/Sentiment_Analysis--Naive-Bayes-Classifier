The best of the one-term presidents. Remember that he did not seek a second-term and made it clear while he was running for office that he would not seek one. He clearly outlined his major goals for his presidency, and he achieved them. Some may knock him for matters he did not confront during his presidency such as slavery, but let's be honest, no president confronted this issue nor had the political courage to do so until Linciln entered the national stage. Polk should be rated for what he did, and that was everything he campaigned on. He should be rated among the top ten presidents in the history of this country.
