Many forget that Jim Plunkett was a great player both in college and in the professional ranks. A Heisman Trophy winner, Plunkett was unfortunately given the task of leading the hapless New England Patriots of the mid-1970s, thereby giving him an undeserved reputation as an underachiever. Plunkett had the desire to become a great player, nevertheless. His journeyman route finally led him to the Raiders where his once-faultering career finally blossomed to what many had expected of him earlier. With two Superbowl wins and the MVP for game XV, he finally proved he was one of the games better all-time quarterbacks.
