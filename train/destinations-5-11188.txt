Been going there with our kids for 7 years now. We still have a great time. No place better to go on a steamy-hot July day. Aquazoid has always been our favorite, followed by Big Daddy Falls. I still get an adrenaline rush out of Jet Scream (a tobaggan ride), and the Lemon Drop, which is basically a free fall through a concrete tube (great way to crack your skull just before you drown). I actually almost did drown there once by making the mistake of going in the deep end of the wave pool without a life jacket. When I realized I had to get out of the pool, the mass of humanity blocked my egress (it was like a scene out of Titanic). It took me about half and hour to move my fatigued arms and legs again. On peak season, you have to get there as the park opens or else you will be stuck in queues that get quite long. Maybe they should do Fastpas (waterproof, of course).
