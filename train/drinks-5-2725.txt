I think its kinda funny for people to complain so much about a product they have the freedom to ignore. Starbucks is the greatest coffee compant in the world, and has been copied over and over agin by competitors. I agree that some of the things Starbucks competitors do, they do better than Starbucks. Its easier to copy than invent. For those of you you look at Starbucks as a big mean Corporation should know that they buy only FAIR TRADE COFFEE, build schools and hospitals in Latin American countries. Why do they do this??? Because they realise that the coffee farmers are vital to thier future success and they take care of them. Starbucks has nearly 7500 stores worldwide and employes over 74,000 people. Part Time partners receive stock options and benefits. Wow what a brutal mean Corporation. Don't like Starbucks fine, don't drink it. I love Starbucks because the coffee is great, the people are great, and the company is great.
