We have had our 2005 Rendevouz for three months and just love it when we get to drive it. We also own a Ford Focus and Chevrolet Malibu. I don't think I have ever owned a car that didn't have some minor issues including the 2000 Camery and the 1998 Accord we owned. Never buy another Japanese car again after those experiences. They were dogs that couldn't get out of the way of there own tail and electrical problems were abundant. However, in fairness, the worst car I every owned was a 1990 Chevrolet Eurosport. Kept it for 11 years, 232,000 miles and put a fortune into it in computer modules and starters. But as far as my Buick goes it serves the purpose which we bought it for and off road was not one of them. We own a large dog and have been traveling lately from New York to Florida. This car is very, very comfortable to ride in, has plenty of room for the dog and cargo and is very quit and and smooth on the road. We bought it because it was adverstised as just that, a vehicle that offers luxery appointments, a ride like a luxery car and the room of a van. I highly recommend anyone considering an SUV that won't be mountain hoping to test drive one of these. It is a great looking car as well and you don't have to be old to own one.
