Don't let their psuedo-convenience fool you. During my first cross country move, the U-haul truck broke down three times! During the second move, we only had a few minor problems with the drive, but we experienced horrible customer service once we reached our destination. The one month free storage with a one way move was horrible. You can only reserve a spot 24 hours in advance, and the facilities are not inter-connected. We had to find phone numbers for about 15 different storage facilities before finding one with space available. Then they expected us to carry our couch and other furniture up a step ladder to the upper floor facility.
