DeVry - Serious about Success, Not SEX. So if I had a second chance in life, I would go to a community college, learn computer like the others, have alot more prettier girls in my book of love, still be skilled and certified in what I want, get a Tech job on the side and in the real world, and save that $30,000 I owe. Who needs to know so much computers? Not even the POPE. So, to put it short, if you go to DeVry, and focus on learning and not F!!cking, you'll have a great career, but also end up paying loans for 10 years that could equal a brand new car note. Or you can enjoy life and see sunlight, have a wife and a girlfreind and some baby mama drama.. AMEN..
