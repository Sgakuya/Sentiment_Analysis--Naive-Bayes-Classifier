I have been hearing so much about Big Ben and Jerome Bettis on ESPN that it has been making me sick. The real reason the Steelers have had so much success is their great defense. On the other hand, I don't think that they are as good as the New England Patriots. I have watched every New England game of the season and I have to say that the Patriots looked like the 49ers that day. Tom Brady wasn't focused, the defense was horrid, and the Patriots did not have Corey Dillon. So just remember that Pittsburgh is still #2, but if New England and Pittsburgh do play in the playoffs, it is going to be one exciting game. Corey Dillon on that Patriots squad though makes that New England team untouchable. 11-0 with him, 0-1 without him.
