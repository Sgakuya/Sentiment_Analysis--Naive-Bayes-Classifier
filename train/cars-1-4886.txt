Great gentlemen's truck, not for roughing it out. If you are a owner, just watch out for the following: (1) Ball joint design is defective, and will disengage without warning (2) brakes are defective, and will cost you plenty in fixes (3) seat covers are of poor quality and you need to change the driver side seat by 70K. Toyota will not help you with the brakes or when your ball joint disengages. If you want a real truck, the Tundra isnt it. It is great for grandpops who takes it for sunday drives. If you are interested in joining a class lawsuit action to sue Toyota with regards to the Tundra Brakes, please contact ippwsa@yahoo.com or those in the pacific area, please contact toyota_lemons@yahoo.co.nz
