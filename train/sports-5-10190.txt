Whether you like him or hate him, which in that case I like him, he is without a doubt the best coach in college football right now. He turned aroung the prgram, won a title over Florida St., has won the Big 12 championship almost every year there, has pounded Texas ever year but this one, and been to 3 national title games. He may have lost 2 out of 3, but even legendary coaches like JoePa, have not accomplished what he has. OU had a bad start of the season, and coach Stoops quickly turned it around. Which they are now likely headed to a good bowl game. Only competition to him as of the past decade would be Pete Carroll or recently departed Nick Saban. Mack Brown has been dominated by this man and OU, with recruit from TX, in which the Longhorns still are ranked one of the best recruiting teams year in and year out, and OU as well, but OU dominates them. UT better enjoy this years victory, b/c it won't be long.
