As Castlebee said, this woman has definately beaten many of the odds that face up and coming actresses in Hollywood today. She is so talented and no matter what she is doing, she always brings her characters to life and makes them so believable. Espescially in one of her not-so-well known films, The War at Home opposite Martin Sheen. She played the somewhat mentally ill mother in a very dysfunctional home in 1972 Texas. She was so believable in her role. She also impressed me in Primary Colors as the unstable Libby- she brought drama and comedy to the screen all at the same time in that film. She's definately one of the top actresses of recent memory.
