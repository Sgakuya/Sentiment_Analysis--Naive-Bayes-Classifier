I was very pleased with Bandits. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton make a great team and play very honest and believable criminals. Bruce,of course, plays the manly man and Billy, he plays the dorky germ obsessed sickly fellow. Cate Blanchet does an all together good job but might have over done it a bit. Bandits gets off to an extremlly slow start, but builds into a very funny and very entertaining little movie. The climax of the film had me on the floor. Bandits is by no means a great comedy,action,suspence,romance film by any means. But Bandits succeded in creating a quaint little story with some interesting fun characters.
