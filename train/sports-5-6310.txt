apparently you're not the only one getting censored, so i'm removing part of my entry it doesn't matter because i think i got my point across when i responded to your obnoxious private messages. ******In response do dukebballinbabe i completely agree with you. Duke does nto get all calls I would not lose my voice screaming at refs every game if that was the case. And no matter how much or how little duke beats unc by poeple will always bitch it just shows that they can't accept defeat graciously and to iluvseanmay, i think its so funny how people are so bitter about money. I will say that unc is having a great year, and thought i hate them bc of the rivalry, they definitly deserve their rank this year. But its people like you that degrade UNC by calling people rich schoolboys. That has nothing to do with anything. Income does not have anything to do with going to duke whether you're playing basketball or not. It is blind admissions meaning they accept you regardless of what you make, and then give out need based scholarships so don't be bitter that people that go to Duke are the best of the best academically. Just be content with the fact that UNC is having a great season. ....UPDATE i will never understand why people think Duke gets all the help from the refs. Duke gets so many shi tty calls its ridiculous. Do refs make some mistakes that go in Duke's favor, of course. But generally i think Duke has to deal with alot of horrible calls that have ultimately caused some losses in very close games. UPDATE even if they dont win the championship (which i think they will) they have had an incredible season, earned a number seed, coach k has beaten the all time NCAA tournament wins (**passing dean**) etc. etc. its just been an awesome year and it was supposed to be a building year so i know i'll walk away from this season happy***and calling jj redick a spoiled rich boy is classier?
