sorry but the game cube is the most childish games console i have ever seen, i used to own an N64 so im not prejudice against nintendo, but it is rubbish. On the other hand th1e x box is brilliant, games can be bought for 34 if you find a decent shop, the dvd playback is fully equipt for anything as the sensor can reach for about 20 metres and it plays DVD-rs of the worsh quality, my friend bought some dvd-r's and they won't work on his ps2 but they work on the xbox, wonderfull. Also the graphics are increadable and games load up extremely fast, and getting to the hard drive......never fork out loads of money for memory cards that mess up after a while, instant retrieval of game data and it facilitates the copying of your music collection to the hard drive, play sega GT to prodigy, wicked!!!! my only quarell is the fact that you can not fast forward the music cd's on the hard drive, seems silly as the DVD player can via the remote, so why not incorperate it into the media player on the xbox for music???/ silly microsoft
