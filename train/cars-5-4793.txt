I bought my 2001 Ranger EDGE used, in December, 2002 with less than 24000 miles on it, and really caught my eye on the lot. Enjoyed the test drive and bought it that day. It's quite a head-turner, with sharp looks (in Candy-apple red , no less). Great-running 5 speed 6-cyl. 3.0l with a great supercab, cd player, bedliner and fog lights. Gets pretty good gas mileage too. No problems or complaints at all, after 4 months. It's great on the highway as well as in town. I'd recomment this model to anyone looking for a SLIGHTLY smaller truck that seems a lot more solid than my Dodge Dakota (which is a nice truck too). I think the Ranger EDGE is a far-better vehicle.
