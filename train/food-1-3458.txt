I bought a crap load of Totino's Pizzas when i moved into my new house. I used to eat a whole one for dinner, until i started noticing somthing. Almost every time i ate one, I got sick, and I NEVER ger sick. Needless to say, the last one I had was the mexican style. I woke up later that night with a KILLER pain in my stomach, and the runns that took forever to get started. But what was really weird, is that i was having some serious hot flashes. I was hot and cold, and sweating at the same time. Oh my god, I wanted to die right there on the head. If I could offer any advice to the public and people who make the pizzas, DON'T EAT TOTINO'S!
