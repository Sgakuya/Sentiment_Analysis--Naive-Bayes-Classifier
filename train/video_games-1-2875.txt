Why this game is marketable is a mystery to me. Maybe I'm just a bit old-fashioned, but this game sounds like the most horrible thing to happen to American society in the past year. I heard about this on NBC Nightly News the other night and did some research. Now I want to voice my opinion. I rarely go to movies because they're loaded with sex. The reason I'm against this game is because of all the sex, not to mention the law-breaking aspects and killings of civilians. If people wonder why there's so many floozy young women out there today there's two reasons. One is that both them and the guys are watching Hollywood's garbage. The other is because the guys play this game and are taught that premarital sex is a good thing. On a Saturday night a guy aged 17-24 (the game's target market, I assume) who has any respect for a girl should take her to a baseball game. Not a movie since they're all trash these days. And he should treat her nice and not have sex until he's married. However, so many guys in that age range are at home playing this instead and corrupting their mind, not to mention their eyes. The worst part is that kids as young as 7 have been known to play this. Where are the good parents of the 1950s when you need them?
