How did we get from George Herbert Walker Bush to George Hiram Walker Bush? As a airline transport pilot and instructor of airline pilots I am struck by the fact that if I were to fail to mention something as serious as a DUI to the FAA, no matter how far back it went, the mechanism is in place to have me flipping burgers at McDonald's before I knew what hit me. That mechanism does not, apparently, apply to a job that has potentially far more serious consequences than I could ever be responsible for. If Mr.Bush didn't self-disclose this, how many other little easter eggs has he got up his sleeve for us? Not that I think that Al Gore is that much better. He is the quintessential politician, trying to be everything for everyone but at least his IQ exceeds that of a golden retriever. We have been given the sparsest of choices to pin our hopes on in either of these beauties. I move we throw the whole mess out and start over with a couple of suits that actually have someone of substance in them.
