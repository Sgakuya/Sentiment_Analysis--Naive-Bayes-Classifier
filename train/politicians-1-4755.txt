One of the most undistinguished Speakers of the House, ever. The old wrestling coach doesn't seem to have a clue, outside of playing wasteful and meaningless political games: the Congress he has presided over has passed some of the weakest and most inconsequential legislation in the history of that august body. His leadership has led us into record deficit spending again (read that: Reagan Redux), BSing the public into thinking this uncontrolled spending and borrowing is essential for national security (this entirely remains to be seen, and not likely tenable) while actually mortgaging away the futures of our unborn grandchildren. However, strange as it may seem, he is an improvement over the past two Speakers we've had, which isn't saying much: (1) Bob The Speaker Who Wasn't Livingston, who never actually made it to the chair because he was one of the biggest whoremasters ever in a city of whoremasters, and (2) Newt The Ultimate Hypocrite Gringrich, who's gonna have endless explanations to make on Judgment Day. Hastert is also one of the most morbidly obese members of our lardass Congress, which boasts the likes of Henry Hyde (475 pounds) and Jim Sensenbrenner (650 pounds). I guess alot of sirloin and lobster tails, as well as martinis and scotch, is consumed in those so-so but remarkably high priced restaurants in the district.
