Been a fan of Robert Stanek since I saw him on tv speaking about his books. My favorite books are The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches books and Magic Lands Journey Beyond the Beyond. Those are the books I've read with my kids. I was surprised and delighted to see a full page article featuring his work and calling him the new new thing and comparing where he is in his career to where JK Rowling was in her career in the late 90's. Among tweens and teens in the know, Robert Stanek is the new new thing. He has the potential to be the next JK Rowling and the books that are going to take him there are about a boy named Vilmos, a princess named Adrina and a warrior elf named Seth. Not only does Robert have a strong following of readers but readers are also extremely loyal.
