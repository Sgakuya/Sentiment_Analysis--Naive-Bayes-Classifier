I don't think there is a single more electrifying player in the game at the moment than the first time ProBowler as well as November and December AFC Offensive Player of the Month, Larry Johnson. After having just 12 starts in his NFL career, the third year back has 13 100+ yard games and already broke Kansas City's club record for rushing in a game with 211 yards. LJ's only been KC's starter for 9 games this season and he already has 10 100+ yard games, including the last 9 in a row, another KC club record, shattering the old one of 5 in a row as well as tying for the the third all-time best streak of 100 yard games in NFL history. In fact, despite all of the time he wasn't the feature back, Larry Johnson was the 3rd leading rusher in the NFL (just 130 yards behind Shaun Alexander) and the leading rusher in the AFC with 1,750 yards (Edgerrin James a distant 244 yards behind him). In the last 9 games alone he picked up 1,351 rushing yards, which would be good enough by itself to make him the 8th leader rusher over the whole year. He was also second for both rushing and total touchdowns, 20 and 21 respectively behind only Shaun Alexander who broke the NFL record for Total TDs in a season while tying the rushing TDs record. Consider this... If he kept up his pace since starting (1,351 yards in 9 games, an average of 150.1 yards a game) over a whole season, he'd have 2,401 rushing yards on the year. The NFL record for rushing yards in a season is 2,105 yards by Eric Dickerson. His pace of 1,627 (180.7 per game) yards from scrimmage in the last 9 games would be equivilant to 2,892 yards over a season. The current record is 2,429 yards by Marshall Faulk. His 17 total touchdowns in 9 games would translate into 30 TDs over a whole season at pace. The current record by Shaun Alexander is 28. He can run against ANYONE. He ran for 130 yards on the NFL's best rush defense (San Diego) and 140 on the second best (Denver). UPDATE: So, go_blue14, Larry Johnson is just mediocre? He only had more yards in the last 8 games of the regular season than anyone else has EVER had in 8 consecutive games. Besides, have you WATCHED Larry Johnson run? It's a thing to behold. Look at NFL.com sometime and check out some game day clips. I particularly recommend week 1 against the Jets (where he got 122 total yards on just 10 touches... you know, the normal mediocre stuff). I also recommend you look at his week 16 toetapping routine against the Chargers and tell me how the offensive line did that for him. The Chiefs have a hell of an offensive line... but so do the Seahawks, and you don't hear me saying it's all them and Shaun Alexander should just give it up. In fact, think of every rushing team out there and all of them have at least above average o-lines, or at least o-lines that are good at run blocking. Even the Giants, who are lackluster in pass blocking and thus not normally thought of as a great o-line, have great speed on the line which helps them alot in run blocking. LT has the help of perhaps the most underrated line in football and the best blocking fullback, and you don't see me rating him a 3!
