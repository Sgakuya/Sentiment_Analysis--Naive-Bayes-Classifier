Cedar Point is the best amusement park I have ever been to. I visit CP at least twice every year, because I can't get enough of it. The roller coasters are incredible, and every amusement park I've visited since Cedar Point just pales in comparison. CP's 14 coasters are all worth riding, and I laugh at other amusement parks that boast 5 or 6 mediocre roller coasters. The lines aren't bad if you go during the week, and the prices are a lot better than other, more commercialized amusement parks (like Six Flags or Disney World). If you go, definitely ride Millenium Force, the Raptor, the Mantis, and the Magnum XL200.
