Around this particular time of the year cinema audiences shouldn't expect nothing more gracing their multi-plexes concerning popcorn movies and I confess as a member of the ticket buying public I've leanrt to just accept these movies for what they are. Will Smith made the best of his paranoid Detective character - Del Spooner. Bridget Moynahan however was too tepid and as Dr Susan Calvin lacked experience to show realisitc emtion on screen. I, Robot is noticeably a special effects movie set in the future, but there are certain issues raised in this film that is an on-going persistent taboo, noticeably prejudice. Good popcorn movie.
