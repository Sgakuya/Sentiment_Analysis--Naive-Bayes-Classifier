I don't waste everyone's time giving poor reviews to products I've never used. Carfreak says, I have not driven this or ridden in it, so I don't know what it is like but I'm a total jerk so I'll give it the lowest rating. I've had my LX since W's first election day and it's been an exceptional vehicle, fully loaded for $23,500. I wish I'd have waited for the moonroof, climate controls and CD/cassette and paid the extra grand or two, but to see this XUV (the ORIGINAL cross-over SUV) rated below the hollow-shell, roll-over prone Saturn VUE...you people are still reliving the early days of Hyundai. Fine with me, I guess. Keep Hyundai's prices down long enough for them to introduce a Tiburon convertible to the US market!!!
