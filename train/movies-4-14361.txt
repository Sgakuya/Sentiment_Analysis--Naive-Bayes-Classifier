This is a pretty rough movie and one that the far right will not point to as one that glorifies drug use. It follows the downward drug spiral of four people: the diet pill popping mom, her early twenties son looking to turn his addiction into a successful drug business, his girlfriend who is estranged from her wealthy parents and desperate to score, and his friend and business partner who is trying to make his mother proud. The acting is brilliant (particularly Ellen Burstyn), the story is heart-wrenching and stomach-turning, and the cinematography is powerful. I really can't say whether I would recommend this film. I would just say be prepared to be moved.
