My second favorite place to visit (see my comments about Nova Scotia elsewhere). PALM beach, thank you, is the top destination if you want sheer, unadulterated high-end luxury. The Breakers Hotel is the epitome of refinement and luxury, and the Flagler Museum (America's Taj Mahal) is simply not to be missed. Shopping on Worth Avenue makes Park Avenue or Rodeo Drive look like an outlet mall. And if you're hungry, don't leave the island without trying the strawberry pie at Testa's. Simply to die for. The key lime pie is just as good. I'd recommend a couple of beaches off the beaten path, though. Try the south end of the island at Manalapan, or way up on Singer Island at Macarthur State Park. Very nice beaches, both of them, and usually very deserted. Lake Worth Beach is also a good one, but because of its proximity to food and shopping, it's the most popular. Then there is the classic Ocean Beach at the end of Worth Ave, too.
