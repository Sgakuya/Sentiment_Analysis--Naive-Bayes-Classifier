It is amazing that this movie fooled so many people into believing that they are watching a realistic and well written and directed movie.I mean, even common sense is slaughtered here.Stallone probably put all his teenage frustrations into this one, and turned it into a hilarious movie.The extra star is for the involuntary humour.Everything is so clichee and boyishly macho that you can't help but wonder what audiences found in this.It is probably an American thing that I don't get,about going forward against any odds, bla, bla,bla,and macho, macho, macho.The dialogue is completely idiotic,and the Rocky's character is completely absurd.The poem in the hospital scene in Rocky II was hilarious.This movie is was probably the main source of inspiration for another crap of the century: Karate Kid 1,2 ,3,4,5.... (and let your imagination run freely).One positive: One of the greatest unvoluntary comedies ever.
