One of the things that I believe about Angelina Jolie, besides the fact that she's unbelivably beautiful and talented, is that she's a positive role model. Most of you are probably thinking, HOW CRAZY DOES THAT SOUND , but I truly believe it. She's always her self no matter what, she dosn't let what other people say get her down, and she's an honest person. When people comment about her many tatoos ( they're awsome by the way)she dosen't take what they say to heart, she keeps right on smiling. When people make comments about her relationship with her brother, she dosn't lash out, she handles the situation with patience. Lastly, whenever I read an interview with her, it sounds like its her talking and not just someone trying to make up some dumb cover-up answer that sound unrealistic like My career is the most important thing in my life right now like some BSB would say. Whatever she says seem to say in those interviews sounds like someones saying what they really feel, and not what the public thinks they should feel. Now thats honesty.
