Well, I somewhat agree with ExpressJeans about the amature-ish lyrics and guitar playing . But in the time of Rubber Soul , it was the first album really to follow a real storyline, flowing song into song, no matter how simple, in the mainstream of '65. And thoughtful masterpieces like In My Life are anything but amateur, all though I will admit that What Goes On isn't top-rate material (sorry Ringo). This was the Beatles introduction to sophistication, no matter how it may sound. The Beatles shan't be belittled next to 'N Sync and all of them. Listen to the genius of The White Album, Abbey Road, Magical Mystery Tour, and even Rubber Soul:). You may not be able to hear it. But I sure can. And I still think the album (and band, of course) is great...
