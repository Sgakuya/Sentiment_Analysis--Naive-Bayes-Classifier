Raised a White Sox fan and will always be a White Sox fan. That's just the way it is. I remember in my youth (some years back), the Cubs were always at or near last place, the Sox were the only competitive team. The Cubs upper deck was never opened, and you could just about sit anywhere in the lower deck. Right now this is the Cubs era in terms of popularity, one day the pendulum will swing back to the Sox. That how things go. Go you White Sox! Oh, by the way, here's MY lifetime most memorable Sox by position: 1B Dick Allen, 2B Nellie Fox, SS Luis Aparicio, 3B Pete Ward, RF Magglio Ordonez, CF Ken Berry, LF Minnie Minoso, C Carleton Fisk, SP Gary Peters, RP Hoyt Wilhelm, MGR Al Lopez, and the greatest pitching coach ever Ray Berres.
