For some instruction about how to analyze political commentary in the future, 1) read some of the anti-Cheney comments on this list, 2) recall how the media made these same points, and 3) observe over the next four years how whether or not these critiques have any connection with reality. You'll learn the Left's modus operandi: demonizes those with whom they disagree by stretching facts out of context. In the 80s, Cheney didn't sign onto a House resolution (an empty gesture by its very nature) saying Free Nelson Mendela b/c of a disagreement over the language. Cheney and other conservatives wanted to use the bill to push Mendela to renounce his past connections with communists in South Africa connected to the USSR. From this, you get mainstream media people saying that he's against Nelson Mendela , or opposed to civil rights . Cheney is a profoundly decent man, who actually wrestles with public policy questions, considering potential untended consequences. If only there were more politicians that thought this way, rather than worrying most about how to spin things on the Today Show.
