OK WELL HERE WE GO AGAIN. THERE ARE MANY COMMENTS ON HERE ABOUT BOY BADNS IN GENERAL. PLEASE CAN'T YOU PEOPLE GET OVER THE FACT THAT THE BSB ARE POPULAR. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SAY BUT THEY ARE. EVERYONE NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO RESPECT OTHER TYPES OF MUSIC. DO NOT LABEL ME AS A TEENYBOPPER BECASUE I AM NOT. I JUST HATE TO SEE GROUPS HAVE TO GO THEROUGH SO MUCH JUST TO GAIN A LITTLE RESPECT. : pOP AS IT HAS SO NICELY BEEN LABELLED IS RIGHT NOW IN. WOW GRUNGE IS GONE OH NO. I WISH EVERYONE COULD RESPECT EVERYONES MUSIC. THIS CD IS VERY GOOD AND I ENJOY IT. AS FOR THE COMMENT ON WRITING MUSIC. THEY WROTE SOME SONGS. BUT AS YOU KNOW THEY ARE A PUT TOGETHER GROUP SO THEY AREN'T BRON WRITERS GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR TRYING. NOT ALL TOP GROUPS WROTET THERE OWN MUSIC IE//THE MONKEYS ETC... SO LETS STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT A GROUP HAS DONE BEFORE YOU JUDGE THEM.
