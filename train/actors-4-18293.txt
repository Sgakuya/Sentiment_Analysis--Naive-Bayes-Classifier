I wouldn't say that any of his films are among my favorites but surely he has made some of the greats, 2001, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange. He seemed to possess a keen sense of stage, how the surroundings of the characters could deeply impact the scenes they were in, that a his use of long spans of silence. For instance, the great halls that the young boy big wheels through and the sounds of the wheels going from carpet to hard floor with door after door zipping by as if in a tunnel. The joggin scene in 2001 where there is nothing but the sound of the astronaut shadow boxing as he runs in what appears to be a wheel shaped ship on edge, or the men as they eat scraping as their food plates, and again at the end as the old man clinks the plate in his room, alone. The war room in Dr. Strangelove, and the hang out club in Clockwork Orange, all created the scene more than the words or actions of the characters in them. As for Eyes Wide Shut, I didn't even bother to pay money for that.
