One of the most believably crafted horror stories of our time. The exorcist is not a slasher flick with a badly crafted villan who is indistructable. Instead, this movie concentrates on the root of all evil and the distruction of innocense. While this movie's sequels are not well crafted, this movie's serious examinations of horror, evil and possession are the best ever seen in any movie of this genre. This movie leaves unclear the knowledge of whether or not good can triumph over evil, and that is one of its strongest points. The special effects leave a bit to be desired, and the film quality is not good. However, this movie well makes up for those shortcommings with its great plot development, and realistic feel.
