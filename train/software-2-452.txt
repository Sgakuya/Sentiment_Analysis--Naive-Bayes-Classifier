I recently re-formatted my hard drive and re-loaded my system with WinME after running quite a while under Win98. In my experience, WinME doesn't cut the mustard. The primary use for my system is combat flight simulators. As such, maximum performance from 3D graphics accelerators and DirectX is necessary. I've spent days looking for and installing updated drivers and software patches for WinME. In some cases, they just don't exist. In other cases, it appears that they just add WinME to the list of supported OSs, thinking that 'if it works for Win98, it should be okay for WinME'. Bottom line: very unstable. Frequent system lock-ups while running flight sims. Other times just acts flaky, whereas Win98 with the same hardware and sims was much more stable. Now, I can't conclusively blame WinME. It could just be that the software, drivers, and weren't written very well for WinME. But the end result is the same. I will be wiping my hard drive again this weekend and starting from scratch with Win98.
