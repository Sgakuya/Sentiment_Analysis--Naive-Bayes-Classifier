I just would like to tell people who think MP is ok why I think he is more than that. He is cute. His pictures makes me :) every time I see it because he is so cute. He is funny. Someone couldn't just kind of do the part of chandler bing on Friends and kind of be funny like chandler is. Matthew Perry fully makes the part funny and all of the other actors and actresses totally play off of his sense of humor and sense of comic ability. He is humble and respectable. Most celebrities any more don't do anything besides their movie or t.v. shows that is respectable. aka they are in a movie or on a t.v. show and that is supposed to make them respectable. MP, on the other hand, took the extra step. when he realized that he needed help w/ drug problems, he got the help. That is like worth 1,000,000,000,000,000 kudos in my opinion. That took guts. He is a good person and doesn't deserve anything, but compliments.
