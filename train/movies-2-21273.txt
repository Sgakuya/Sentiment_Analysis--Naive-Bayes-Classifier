Even though this is one of Presley's better films, it still ranks as poor for several reasons: (1) implausible, ridiculous, cliche-ridden script, (2) truly lame acting, which is the typical hallmark of an Elvis flick, (3) shot in about six days, (4) obnoxious and ho-hum score that only manages two decent songs, (5) the presence of no-talent Ann Margaret, who just seems to get in the way in virtually every scene, (6) Elvis was thoroughly goofed up the entire time. No wonder this guy's career was in the toilet by the time this abortion was foisted on the brain-dead and not too culturally discerning American public.
