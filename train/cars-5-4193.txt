Got our '03 about 2.5 years ago and have about 20k. Absolutly reliable w/fair fuel economy; the 5 speed auto helps. Got leather LX pkg, added an aftermarket 15" dvd player mounted on rear ceiling; keeps the kids occupied on longer trips, but obscures rear view mirror visibility. Love the handling as it behaves very carlike. It still weighs (several) tons, but you don't notice it except in its' solid feeling. Ride quality may be a bit harsh for some, but it's better than the "disconnected" feeling that's typical in minivans. Have seen the "new" models, and don't think they offer anything significant that wasn't available several years ago. A hybrid, diesel and/or AWD might persuade me otherwise. Meanwhile, we use our regularly and all drivers love it! HTH
