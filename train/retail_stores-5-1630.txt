Hmmmm...I don't think Sears is as bad as these other reviewers..I think there is a stigma attached to Sears. I do not personally buy my clothes there, but they do have quite a selection at reasonable prices, they have a wide selection of shoes..EXCELLENT Hardware section..the BEST Electronics department..not only are the salespeople courteous, they also know what they are talking about. The Appliance section is also large and affordable..What's the matter with Sears?!? (Update: I recently did buy an outfit at Sears..a pair of capris and a cute plaid top..I have already washed them a few times, and the quality is excellent, they are true to size and I got the outfit for a great price) Don't knock Sears!
