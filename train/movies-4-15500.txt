The ship was beautiful. The special effects, especially during the sinking, were breath-taking. And the plot could have been superb, were it not for the fact that these actors did not act like 1912 people, did not talk like them, and did not demonstrate the moral values of that time. In the real event, there were heroes all over that ship. But in the movie, we were treated to more of Hollywood's class warfare mindset, making it appear (falsely) that the rich people were kicking aside the poor people. Another point: why does Hollywood think there was no second class on the Titanic? Everyone was first or third. But the movie did put my wife in a romantic mood, which is more than I can do, so I'll always appreciate that.
