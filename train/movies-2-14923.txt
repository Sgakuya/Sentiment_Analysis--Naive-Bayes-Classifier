PLEASE...PLEASE...lets keep the SS and its minions out of the American Revolution. Face the war waw fought because a lot of rich Americans didnt want to pay their taxes. THIS MOVIE IS A DISGRACE...unfortunately alot of uninformed viewers will think is truth...however it isnt..it is a very nice yarn spun around some truths...why not make a Mel Gibson movie of similar ilk in 1941 occupied France...then you really could have Nazis...Lets see we could make Mel a French gentile married to a Jewish woman...then the SS comes and carts away his family to the death camps...Mel would do his swashbucking against the super heroes of the master race . unfortunately, he'd find two of his children in Dachau dying of typhus...he'd swear revenge...and ultimately kill Adolf Hitler aand everything would be all right...and just as fraudulent...The MTV generation will like this movie because none of them were awake during history class...and cause it has cool special effects.
