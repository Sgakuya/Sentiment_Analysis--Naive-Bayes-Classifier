I have never owned an XBox and only played on the system briefly so I cannot debate which is better. The PS2 is a great system. Much more backwards compatible than many systems with only a few minor flaws in that respect. The graphics capabilities are top of the line but not always utilized by the game makers. The enumerable game titles available for this system alone make it worth a rating of 4. The dvd capabilities are nice but can possibly damage the system. I believe a fix for this has been put out but I still do not recommend using it for playing dvds. I have played many gaming systems and PC games and this is the best I have ever played or used. Just be careful about which games you shell out the bucks for. Preview them before buying since the games are not always as good as the system.
