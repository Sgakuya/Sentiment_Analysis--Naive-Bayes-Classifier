MARTINA McBRIDE'S GREATEST HITS CD, IS THE BEST CD I'VE EVER OWNED!!! EACH SONG ON THIS COLLECTION IS DISTINCT, AND A HIT IN EVERY WAY: INSTRUMENTALLY, LYRICALLY, AND DEFINITELY VOCALLY. MARTINA IS AN AMAZING SINGER, WHO UTILIZES HER VOICE REALLY WELL TO CARRY OUT MESSAGES FOR HER SOCIAL ISSUE SONGS SUCH AS: INDEPENDENCE DAY, LOVE'S THE ONLY HOUSE, BROKEN WING AND CONCRETE ANGEL. GREAT LOVE SONGS ARE ALSO FEATURED ON THIS ALBUM, SUCH AS I LOVE YOU, THERE YOU ARE, VALENTINE, MY BABY LOVES ME AND SAFE IN THE ARMS OF LOVE. IF THIS ISN'T ENOUGH, MARTINA HAS ADDITIONALLY INCLUDED 4 NEW SONGS WHICH ARE BREATHTAKING IN EVERY ASPECT. MY FAVORITE NEW SONGS OF HERS ARE WHEN GOD-FEARIN' WOMEN GET THE BLUES, A HILARIOUS TRADITIONAL COUNTRY SONG, AND WHERE WOULD YOU BE, A BALLAD ABOUT A FAILING RELATIONSHIP, FEAUTIRING MARTINA'S BEST VOCAL PERFORMANCE EVER! OVERALL 18 SONGS IN ONE, SUNG BY A TOP CALIBER VOICE. RUSH OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM!!! I GUARANTEE YOU, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. IT HAS YET TO LEAVE MY CD PLAYER, AFTER BUYING IT OVER A YEAR AGO. =0)
