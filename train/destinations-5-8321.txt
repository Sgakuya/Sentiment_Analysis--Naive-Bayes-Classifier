I have been going to Knott's for over 35 years... it never gets old to me. I remember when they used to have mock robberies on the stage coach ride, and donkey rides for the kids... it has grown into a remarkable place to visit not only for children but for us old timers as well. I used to work security for Knotts many years ago.. I'll tell you.. security there is friendly, helpful, knowlegable, professional and SEEN. What I love about Knott's best is the old west atmosphere. Walk down Main street in the old Ghost Town part of the park. Fantastic Fireman's BBQ...a bit expensive, but I guess all theme parks are. The new wooden coaster is the best ride in Cali. Check it out for Halloween Haunt ... really not a good time to take youngsters.. lots of teenagers, dark and scary. Also offers the absolutely best night for gays/lesbians during Odyssee night usually held at the end of September. Great fun for all no matter what time of year. Something for everyone. Don't forget to have dinner at the world famous Mrs. Knotts Family Chicken Restaurant.Hope you enjoy.
