Sometimes it's worth it to go with the best. I recently booked a trip to LA through LowestFare.com. After a made my flight reservation, I checked into getting a rental car through the service. Lowestfare gave me a number of options including a company called RentRite which was by far the cheapest, and which I ended up selecting. When I arrived in LA, I waited for 30 minutes for a RentRite shuttle bus, to no avail. I called information who told me that no RentRite existed in LA. I ended up getting on an air-conditioned Avis bus, which were passing every 3 minutes or so, and renting an Avis Car. While the rates were more than a little more expensive, everything about their service screamed WE ARE A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION AND TAKE PRIDE IN OUR JOB. My car was new and clean, the agents were polite and professional, and the overall experience was very positive. Never again will I choose Rent Rite.
