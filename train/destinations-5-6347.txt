OK, so I'm biased giving Ohio 5 stars since I was born and raised in O-HI-O. It may not be the most exciting state in the U.S. of A, but I totally disagree with you folks who rate it the worst. Ohioans ARE a friendly, accommodating group of people (I'm not sure where you've been looking, Alan1058). We are not rednecks or hicks or Yankees...you have to go a little further south to call a race of people names like that. Ohio has three large cities (Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland), the Indians the Reds, the Browns the Bengals, Ohio State University and the almighty Buckeyes, Dave Thomas (the founder of Wendy's), 2 major amusement parks (King's Island Cedar Point...and CP has the LARGEST roller coaster in the WORLD there), Longaberger baskets, good old fashioned Amish country...I could go on on. And although we may not have as interesting terrains as other states (no oceans, no deserts, no real mountains), KDdid is incorrect in claiming that Ohio is uninteresting flatlands. Ohio is hardly flat! The whole state is very hilly! And we don't have to worry about earthquakes or hurricanes or volcanoes, and we rarely have tornadoes. The winters can be long cold, but we haven't had a blizzard since 1978. So, no, I don't think Ohio is a bad place at all to call home. I think if you are going to rate a place (especially if you are going to badmouth a place), then at least get your facts straight, people!! (P.S. Note to Alan1058: You talk about returning to Colorado...well your great state had the Columbine tragedy...Ohio has had no horrific event like that, to date).
