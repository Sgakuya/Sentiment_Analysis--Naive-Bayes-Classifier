James I ascended to the English throne following the death of beloved Queen Elizabeth I. Despite being hand-picked by the beloved Elizabeth, James was never able to gain the acceptance of the English people, largely due to his Scottish roots. James was largely a failure in dealing with the growing discontent among England's protestants and Catholics. Ironically, James' own disdain for the Puritans led to the first wave of English immigrants to the Americas and the establishment of the English colonies in America. In other areas, James was equally incompetant. Under James, there was growing discontent between the King and Parliament, which would eventually lead to civil war under the reign James' son, Charles I. In the area of foreign affairs, James was equally incompetent, trying foolishly to kindle relations with Spain through political marriages and other means. Overall, James I was largely a failure as King, leaving England in much worse shape than he found it. His greatest accomplishment perhaps was establishing the commission that finally approved the King James Version of the Holy Bible. However, this is hardly enough to make up for James' obvious failures as King. Unfortunately, those failures would ultimately lead to political instability and civil war.
