Owners of sludge-prone Siennas should be concerned about the future resale value of their vehicles, even if their engine does not have the problem. As time goes along, consumers will learn that Toyota Motor Sales will not repair the engine after the car has changed hands. I recently purchased my vehicle with 22,000 miles. The company declined to repair the sludge-filled engine, saying I should go back on the person who sold me the vehicle. Is this what you want to happen when you sell your vehicle? Or buy a used Sienna? As this word gradually spreads, the impact on the used-car values will be devastating. In the meantime, the so-called benevolent policy of Toyota Motor Sales to repair the engine is good only so long as the company can't find a reason to wiggle out.
