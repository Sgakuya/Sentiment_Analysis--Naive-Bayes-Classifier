He gets a sympathy vote from me. This guy has a reputation of being one of the more solid family-type guys in professional sports and now he's being accused of sexual assault under some questionable circumstances. Word has it that this guy doesn't go out partying with teammates while on the road, isn't a V.I.P. member of so-called Gentlemen's Clubs like most of those overpaid, overpraised freaks of nature known as professional athletes, and generally behaves himself. If he is guilty as accused, well, he should pay the price. But if this is just another instance of some ho having misgivings the morning after and in need of covering her a**, or this is just another ho looking for some fast and dirty money and 15 minutes of fame, then perhaps the credibility of all women who hang around pro athletes should be questioned. I'm not a basketball fan and don't know much about this guy as a player, nor do I care much about that, but from what I've read in the tabloids, it looks like Bryant is a ready-made-to-order patsy for some conniving bimbo, her attorneys and the mutant sports media to use as a main course in a feeding frenzy.
