I am on my 8th course at Capella and have had very good interaction with my instructors as well as my fellow learners. Those that say this is a Diploma mill need to take a better look. It is accredited by the same body that accredits the University of Illinois and other Big 10 schools. That means that a diploma from Capella is worth the same as a diploma from the University of Illinois. It is by no means a diploma mill. The course work is challenging and I do not feel like I am being short changed. Also, the cost of the university is inline with all of the other private colleges and universities throughout the United States. Full time tuition is roughly $12,000 a year.
