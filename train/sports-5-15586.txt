Donovan McNabb is the paramount reason why the Iggles have risen from the ashes from one of the worst teams in the NFL to the elite team of the NFC. Unbelievable scrambler and not that far behind Vick when he breaks loose on the run. His passing statistics keep getting better and better. This year, he had 31 TD passes vs. just 9 picks. Right now, I gotta rank McNabb as the best QB in the NFC, but behind Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. While he has had a few setbacks in post-season play, I have no qualms about his performance in the Super Bowl. On the road to the Super Bowl, the Pats made Peyton Manning look like a Rookie and Ben Roethleisberger also look like a Rookie (Oh wait, he is a rookie). But Mcnabb had the 3rd best Super Bowl passing yardage total and three for 3 TDs (and that was an off day). I feel McNabb and the Eagles will be back next year as the kings of the NFC East.
