Bob Stoops isn't perfect, but he's as good as there is in college football. He understands that there is more to football than x's and o's, although nobody is better at that. He uses momentum, and creates it better than anybody in the game. When a two point conversion is a good gamble, he doesn't just go for it, but has a plan conceived from great preparation to get it done. He doesn't make many logistical mistakes, and does little things to prepare his team. He exudes confidence and has created an atmosphere where no-nonsense hard work is expected and breeds confidence in his players. He relishes the big game and usually excels in it, as do his players. Yet he keeps the game in perspective. Some have made absurd comments about his performance, but there aren't five schools in the country would woundn't trade their coach for him, and probably none who wouldn't seek him ought if they thought he might be available if they lost their coach. The best in America.
