I cannot say honestly that I agree 100% with the President, but I do know this; His economic policy is excellent for this country.He cut out the Marriage Tax Penalty!He increased the Child Tax Credit!He gave tax relief to over a million small business owners!He increased pay to our servicemen!When people have more money on their paychecks they spend more into the economy!It is very simple!Secondly, I agree with the President's moral stance on the sanctity of marriage!Lastly, this country is much safer with Bush at the helm!At least when our country comes under attack whether it be an embassy, a ship, or our own soil, Bush has the forbearance to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!I am sick of him being blamed for 9-11 when Clinton could have done something and did nothing in his 8 years of ignoring terrorist attacks!You people will be very SORRY if Kerry takes over, trust me!!!You heard it here first!His economoic plan will bankrupt many of ya!Don't want to hear folks complaining about higher taxes either cause they are comin at ya!!!IF YOU ELECT HIM TAXES WILL COME!!
