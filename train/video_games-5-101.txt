What can I say that hasn't already been said? Well let's try. Back in 1993 a mate at university handed me two black floppy disks and said Load this - so I did and it changed my life. How? you ask, well I had never experienced anything like it, at that point I had been through a Vic 20, Spectrum and Atari ST so I thought my gaming hobby couldn't get any more exciting than Barbarian or Return to Genisis but how wrong I was. I was running down some green tunnel with a pistol in my hand and shooting ugly brown imps, before I knew it I had topped up a sickening body count, mastered an assault of weapons and shit my pants. Welcome to the real world of gaming. This game taught me about ambience, music, sound effects and level design then on top of this you could play against your mates over a network - now this really is a new generation I had entered. I must have played the game from beginning to end about five times until I discovered that you could build your own levels but on top of this you could doctor the sound effects and graphics so one weekend I had changed all the imps to look like my younger brother and aded some more comical sounds and a bit of swearing for good measure - this game invented longevity. As you all know, together Wolfenstein and Doom spurred a whole generation of first person shooters and bedroom games designers and more than a decade later we can thank ID Software, specifically John Carmack and John Romero for the FPS games of today. A true classic!
