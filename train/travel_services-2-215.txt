It's not enough that they have O'Hare, a notoriously delay-plagued airport, as a hub, but United has horrible customer support. I would say non-existant because it's really not helpful but it's actually annoying and frustrating to deal with them. Why does anyone fly United? Well, I started because I was flying with a co-worker and he picked the flights. Within four months I had flown 40,000 miles with this airline in hopes of one day, if I'm good, getting a free ticket somewhere. But that's not what my complaint is about, that's just why I kept flying this non-distinct airline. My annoyance started with contacting customer support to get travel awarded to my account. E-mail customer support is useless - you get a scripted answer that really doesn't say anything. They should really do away with this since it's not really adding any value. Phone customer support is equally useless and you get attitude. If the delays and bad catering weren't enough to keep me away from United, this certainly is. In a last attempt to feel better about this company and get the feeling that they really do care about their customers, I called customer relations. Huge step up from any other support personnel because they listen to you and are actually nice. However, that too ended with a promise to escalate the issue to management which I appreciated at the time, but I don't appreciate so much anymore since I've gotten no reply back on a resolution. So, after putting myself through great pains to try to convince myself to stay with United (to get 50,000 miles for a trip to Europe) and failing miserably, I've conceeded and booked my next trip on Continental...
