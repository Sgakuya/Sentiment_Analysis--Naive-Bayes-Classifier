T Brady, is perhaps the new Joe Montana. Sorry, ESPN your becoming so corporate with your analogies it's almost becoming pedestrian to watch Sportscenter anymore. He is not, in the same league as Joe Montana but he draws comparisons to him-but the line stops there. If he wins Super Bowls by 45 points then i might make a case for the best ever, but this last Super Bowl his heart just simply didn't look like he was in it (That was a very costly fumble he made, and if this where the Panthers they would of pounced on the PATS). But the one thing he has that I've never seen is that he is unflappable in big games and has a great poker face. Nothing fazes him, he could be down by 20 and he'll look at the opposing teams and simply say Let's play some F---ing cards. Right now he is already in Canton, he has 3 rings but he is no Joe and no one will ever be. Brady worked his ass off to play in this league and he is not going anywhere any time soon, if he wins 2 more then he is the best ever. But, not now he is not even 28 yet....Breathe nuttriders...Breathe
