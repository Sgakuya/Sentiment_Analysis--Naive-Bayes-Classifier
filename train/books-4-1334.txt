A warm strip, that is nice to all. I was sorry to see it discontinued. As a Scottie lover (and owner) the strip rang true. It had "normal" people, with normal lives. As a majority of the US is overweight, it was good to see some characters that show that reality. Some of the strips were less than great, so what? No one gets it right all the time. The strip was never malicious, sexy (or sexist) and usually in favour of all that is right and good. The nice things Chris said about President Bush brought on a few of his detractors. I would be nice to have more Duncans, but the inspiration for Duncan died about a year before the comic did. That is most likely the reason for the end of the comic.
