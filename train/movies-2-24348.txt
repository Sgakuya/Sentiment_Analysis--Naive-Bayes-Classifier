Well, you kinda go into this kind of movie with very low expectations with respect to acting, storyline, dialog . . . well, pretty much everything. The only thing you're looking for is cool fight scenes and some nice special effects. Too bad it didn't really deliver in those areas, either. I'm not going to even get into the acting, storyline, etc., because seriously, how many people expected that to be any good to begin with? For the fight scenes: missing both quantity and quality. For the special effects: there wasn't anything that particularly stood out. Overall, the movie wasn't worth the $9.00 I paid to see it, and wouldn't even be worth seeing at the $2.00 theater for that matter; but to its credit, I've seen worse.
