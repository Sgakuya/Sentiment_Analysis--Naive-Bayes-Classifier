I have friends and relatives in Denver so I get to visit alot. I keep thinking of moving there, but if I did I would never want to work, LOL!! I would want to be in the mountains everyday. There are endless things to do here, camping,hiking,skiing in winter. The view of the mountains to the west, and the city skyline are something I never get tired of. The city itself is full of things to do also, a great amusement park, museums, restaurants. More miles of parks and trails than any city in the country. The biggest thing that would amaze people who've never been here is the weather. Denver DOES NOT have severe winters!!! It may snow a few times, but the next day the sun is out again and the snow is gone!!! I hope to move there soon, unfortunately everyone has the same idea as me. Denver is very fast-growing. Problems are there, smog, traffic, hopefully it will not become another Los Angeles, with it's scenic beauty destroyed by endless freeways, suburbs and shopping malls.
