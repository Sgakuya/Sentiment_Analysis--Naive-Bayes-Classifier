Miami was ripped off by the BCS in both 2000 and 2001. They had what really was the second-best team in the country in 2000, but were robbed of the right to play in the Orange Bowl, and consequently Oklahoma never got to play the real number two...Fast forward to 2001, where the Canes dominated throughout the year, and were locked into the number one seed. Everything's fine, right? Nope, because the same BCS computers that denied UM in 2K repudiated Oregon or Colorado, teams that had a legit claim to being #2, instead selecting the Nebraska We just lost to Colorado by 26 and allowed 62 points, but I know we deserve to be number two Cornhuskers. So how was Miami robbed? Well, if you watched the much-hyped National Championship Game on ABC, you saw that there was no way Nebraska deserved to be there. They got beat by Miami worse than they got beat by the Buffs! Don't let Miami's mere 3 second-half points fool you, either. They could have had 70 if they had kept letting Dorsey loose to throw bombs in Andre Johnson's direction like they did in the 1st half! Miami got gypped because they won't ever get a chance to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they're #1. Had Oregon played, I'm sure it wouldn't have been so lop-sided. But still, congratulations to the Miami Hurricanes, we'll remember them as champions, and they may have had the best NCAA Football team ever!
