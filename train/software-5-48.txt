I've been using the free version of spysweeper for about 9 months and I've been very pleased with it's performance and ease of use. It seems to be rated the best on websites that review this type of product. On my computer it has detected and removed trojans as well as advertising programs and cookies. Naturally your level of protection is greatest if you subscribe to the updating service. Every 3 or 4 months I'll delete it and download a newer version which will give me a good number of updates over the older version. I would not hesitate to recommend spysweeper to anyone who has a need for this kind of program.
