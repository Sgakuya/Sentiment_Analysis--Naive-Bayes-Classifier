I used to regret not going to a smaller school. UT is very overwhelming and something that should require you to go to one building will often require trips to five. This being said, I do not regret going there. Just talk to anyone who is being held captive to huge student loans because they went to a small school. Personally, I'll be a little bit more persistent to get faculty signatures if it means I don't have to fork over 60 grand when I graduate. UT can be a good school if you use the resources available to you. There is a terrific library system and there are tons of student organizations to join. UT recruits some pretty amazing professors, some of which are great people and some are too buried in their research to care about you, the peon student. But that's almost anywhere. Overall, I was happy to go there.
