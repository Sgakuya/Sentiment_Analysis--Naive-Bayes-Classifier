* Today's Gaza primaries have been canceled, "frozen," by Abbas' ruling Fatah party, due to ballot box stealing, violence...and maybe Fatah's oldtimers losing in last week's primaries had something to do with it--last week's choice of the people was Marwan Barghouti, a still-in-jail murderer serving 5 consecutive life sentences; democracy.... Oh, 2 other winners were fugitives Jamal Jumaa and Jamal Abu Rob who calls himself "Hitler."* (7/25/05)RIA will need to change this from Gaza, Israel to Gaza, PA. (I suggest not going to Gaza, although in Israel proper, just a few miles north on the Mediterranean is Ashkelon, a nice little town on white sand with clear aqua water, and some archaeological digs.) In a few weeks the Israelis will be gone, then it will be for the Palestinians to work out who will govern that area--the terrorist group Hamas has strong support and is busy raising havoc in the area now to make it look like they are victoriously chasing Israel out of the area. Lately, there is talk of the US becoming more visibly involved in the pullout: bad idea, the Palestinians agenda is fixed as is their determination to use violence to achieve it.
