an almost four. it takes a family that seemed happy and having a good life. and what happens when something bad happens to them. For them their only daughter is raped by a popular boy whose family has a lot of clout in the community.Not only does the family begin to pull apart, the community turns their back on them for trying to have the boy arrested.The father cannot deal with the daughters rape and sends her away. won't even communicate with the girl. the book goes over a few years what this family goes through including the breakdown they have and members leaving. does not have the happiest ending but at least more realistic of what could happen to a family when something awful happens to them.
