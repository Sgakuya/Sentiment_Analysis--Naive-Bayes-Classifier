From Alumni, Full Scholarship Student and FORMER donor. pros: extremely diverse university - u can take women studies at Barnard; biomed engineering at engineering; Health admin at Business School; synergies with Presbyterian Hospital. easier way to get job on Wall Street or Fashion or Advertising undergrad research and Noble Prize winners core curriculum - Discuss writing, philosophy (the GREAT ideas), aka contemporary civilization. The underground book at Papyrus Bookstore calls it "contempt for civilization." MIT and Polytech make nerds and inventors. Columbia makes the ONLY well rounded IVY league engineers. SIPA - international grad studies - or on your 'spare time' go to the 'French House' for conversation/film busy, everyone is into their own thing cons: highly competitive, sometimes grading on the 'curve' busy, "Grand Central Station" grad tutors (foreign) speak with an accent, but they have 1400 SATs housing is dirty, moldy, sometimes rats professors are interested in research - "publish or perish" poor cafeteria food expensive city living located in Harlem - poor area with a crime rate!! http://ci.columbia.edu/ci/index.html
