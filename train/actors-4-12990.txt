Cameron Diaz is foolish in trying to battle this Rutter guy. If she is worried about her image she really has nothing to worry about as people have already conjured up their opinions about her image from this fiasco. It's really just a huge waste of effort when every one knows these photos will someday be made availible to the public regardless of the outcome. Besides, this scandal will unethically boost her career much like Lewinsky, the run away bug eyed bride (what the hell is Katie Curic doing interviewing this #!%W@ anyhow?), and Paris Hilton. Cameron, ignore this guy and there will be nothing to extort. Ahhh, the pains of being famous.
