On some of my fellow americans views (which are based soley on ignorance,) I have to reply. One fellow commented that he would be scared if gwb was president. after all he was only in the National Guard. Well he must have been shaking in his boots the last eight years. And as for the experience of Gore, yes he knows the buddist temple and the Chinese leaders phone #. You say I hate all those bible toting hippacrits but you sure don't mind living in America, because without us christians ( or shall i say GOD, Jesus) there would not be an America. I say a country can rise no greater than the greatness of their leader, and I sure don't think Hollywood sets the standard for greatness!!!!
