Of all the Pixar and Dreamworks computer animation films out there, this is by far the worst (Monsters, Inc. was the previous title-holder). The whole premise is in the What were they thinking? department, with mobsters, rastafarians, Lolitas, gambling, and other adult-themes. It lacks any of the comedy of that other sea-tale Finding Nemo and leaves adults groaning after a yet-another bad double-entendre while our kids laughed nervously because something prompted them to think that something was funny even though they really didn't find it funny at all. Don't sea this stinker which reeks like 9-day old fish left out in the sun.
