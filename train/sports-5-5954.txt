I think that JJ is awesome he has brought the team far if it wasn't for him Duke wouldn;t be as far as they are. I think that he is a great athlete and I bet I'll see him in the NBA some day and I'll cheer him on more than ever then. ps JJ if you read this I just want you to know that I think that you;re a great player and that you are really cute. I would love to come to one of your games, but I don't have the money.I also agree with XxDukefanforLifexx everyone is jealous of him and thats why they talk crap about him. I haven't met him but I sure would like to . I think he is one of the greatest college players and I 'll keep watching him play. I am one of the girls who think he is one of the cutest guys out there, and I hope all of the other guys are jealous of him because they shoyld be. Love your biggest fan Brytann Busick.
