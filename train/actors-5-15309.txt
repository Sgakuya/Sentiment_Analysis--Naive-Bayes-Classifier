Bobby Driscoll ranks up there with the greatest child actors of all time! His biggest impact was in the '40's. He became a Disney child star, and had some very popular films to his credit, including, Song of the South, So Dear to My Heart, Treasure Island and The Window. In the latter, he portrayed a boy who cried wolf, who witnesses a murder, and is not believed when he reports it. He won a special oscar given to exceptional juvenile performers, for his harrowing performance. I have a special place in my heart for the work he did in The Sullivans,(1944). The other juveniles in the film were memorable, also. It is the story of five brothers from Iowa, (the state he was born in), who joined the U.S.Navy after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and died together after their ship was blown up. Bobby played the youngest brother, Al, in the beginning. He was always trying to catch up to his bigger brothers, while yelling, Hey, wait for me! Bobby had one of the saddest endings of a child star. When he became a teenager, he was no longer sought after. He went back east to try his luck. He got into the drug scene. Hard drugs. Just by luck, his body was identified, quite some time after it was discovered in an abandoned tenement building, in March,1968. He was buried in a pauper's grave. There should be a book about this great talent, who was used, then discarded. There was so much about him that was appealing; yet he ended up such a tragic figure! I'm thankful for the gifts he shared with us!
