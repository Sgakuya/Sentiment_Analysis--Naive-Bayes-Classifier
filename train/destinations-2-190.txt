Good Comments: Good food, but be careful where you eat and what you eat. You may or may not take a liking to hot, spicy Kim-chi. The beer tastes more like water than American beer. Bad Comments: The air is horrible. People from Seoul get off the plane at Kennedy Aiport in New York and remark how fresh the air is. The air, however, is not as bad as the air in Mexico City. The water is of very questionable quality. Drink bottled water. South Korea is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a pedestrian. There is also an old Korean saying that goes, Do not lend money to anyone who rides a bicycle or a motorcycle. In other words, you might not get it back! The traffic accident rate in South Korea is three times that of Japan. Drivers are rude, careless. Many taxi drivers are just plain rude. Many Korean employers of foreign residents of Korea treat their employees the same way they treat their dogs. If you are going to work in South Korea, make sure you are working for your government or a company from your country. Go shopping with somebody who is experienced and can bargain.Do not try it on your own. Note: I lived in South Korea for 12 years.
