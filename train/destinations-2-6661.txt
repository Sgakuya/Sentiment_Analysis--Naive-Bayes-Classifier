I recently drove from Washington DC to Kansas City, and one of the many states I drove thru was West Virginia. I traveled the whole width of the state on I-64 the entire way. Part of I-64 was a toll road. Generally, a state that has a toll road has a great smooth highway. West Virginia highways were horrible, even compared to someone from Missouri (who has the 2nd worst highways in the nation). The scenery was awesome, but to potholes in the highways were rough. We stopped for lunch right outside Charleston...I think in a city called Kanawha City. We walked into the restaurant and everyone looked at us like we were lepers. I got a feeling the most of the folks didn't take kindly to strangers. Just a bizarre state in my opinion... I have visited Harper's Ferry in north-eastern WV, and that's worth a visit if you're a history buff...
