A living archictectural museum. Tree lined streets proving an over-arching canopy to this day. Most affordable housing between New York City and Chicago. Great access to Niagara Falls. Sandly, the economy isn't what it once was. You need to use your brain to get a job in Buffalo. You can't walk out of school and onto the shop floor. Political leadership is missing. One can get elected to statewide office without winning any upstate county. During the campaign, you may see the candidate. Once in office? Forget it. Medicaid costs are dragging New York State down - and taking the counties and local jurisdictions with it. Absent a fundamental rethinking, no state is immune. Weather? Oswego, Rochester, Watertown and Erie PA all get more snow than Buffalo. Buffalo Airport is closed the least of any major airport for snow. Plow it out of the way and move on. Better yet, strap on skates or skis and go play in it.
