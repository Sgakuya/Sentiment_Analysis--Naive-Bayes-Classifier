In my opinion, Robert Duvall is the best actor I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. He can play anything. A backwoods, redneck from Arkansas, a street smart New York City cop, a lazy cowboy from Texas, a small town doctor, a big city lawyer. He's done it all, and done it incredibly well. Lonesome Dove would not have been the excellent mini-series it was without Duvall (all due respect to Tommy Lee Jones and the others). He made Augustus McCrae the modern version of Hamlet, delivering each line with such ease you believed he was an old, ornery cowboy. There just isn't enough I can say about Duvall. If you haven't seen it, check out The Stars Fell on Henrietta. It's a nice movie, set near where I live, and Duvall is aces again.
