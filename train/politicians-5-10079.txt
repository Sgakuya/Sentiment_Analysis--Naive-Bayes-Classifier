it is no surprise that Bush is as low on this list as he is, considering 1) he is a Republican in a world of leftists, 2) he IS the incumbant, 3) the Democrats cannot get over the fact that someone who lost the popular vote the first time can win it the second time, and 4) Bush actually stands up to and fights the terrorists instead of doing what (most) other countries do, and giving them money or concessions in return for them not attacking. Bush is doing whatever it takes to keep this nation free and safe, and the partisan nature of the U.S. has not been able to see that. It also seems that the left cannot deal with the fact that the tax cuts WORKED! As for his poor public speaking, there is a saying well done is much better than well said.
