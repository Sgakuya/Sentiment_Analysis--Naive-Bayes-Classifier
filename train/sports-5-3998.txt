I am a Kentucky fan through and through, from the tips of my toes to the Kentucky tattoo on my left arm. As I've said before, in Kentucky we are raised to get up in the morning, bow toward Lexington, and say three hail Rupps to start the day. That aside, and being completely objective, Rupp is one of the top five coaches of all-time. His record proves it. What gets under my skin is his treatment from the media. In their zeal to be PC, they ignore one of the greatest basketball minds in history. They are afraid to give Rupp any praise whatsoever and only mention his name when someone passes one of his records. They act like they fear if they give praise to the coach who put college basketball on the map, the very gates of racial hell will open up and swallow them and their network. They, and any fan who does the same, make me sick. Was Rupp a racist, I don't know. Did he refuse to play blacks for many years, yes, that is a fact. HOWEVER, before you judge him on that remember, he had a long line to stand in. Prejudice was commonplace not just at Kentucky, or in the south, but throughout the United States. The majority of colleges refused to play black players. Coach Rupp shouldn't have to be a Christlike figure who has to suffer for EVERYBODY'S treatment of blacks. I too, wish he had played black players from the beginning. Kentucky would probably have around 15 national championships right now instead of seven. However, this was a different era that happened 40+ years ago. Let it go and give this great coach his due credit. Tell the whole story of this incredible man. To do less would be ignorant, and just plain wrong.
