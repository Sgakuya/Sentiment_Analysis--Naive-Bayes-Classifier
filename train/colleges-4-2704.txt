Overall DeVry has a lot to offer. But, like any university, it also has its pitfalls. Not only does DeVry offer a variety of degree programs, but it also offers flexible schedules for adult students (age 21 and over) who work full time. I am currently enrolled in the accelerated Business Information Systems bachelor degree program in Phoenix, AZ. I have been at DeVry for 3 years, and should be finished by now, but I have changed my major 3 times. I have just over a year now to complete my degree, which I feel has thus far offered a course curriculum that is extremely relevant to the real world. In addition to campus studies, DeVry also offers online courses, which are structured very efficiently. Some positive characteristics that DeVry has to offer include flexible schedules, accelerated courses, a variety of degree programs, Keller Graduate School opportunities, up-to-date technology, and small student to instructor ratios. Some of the negative characteristics include that you must be at least 21 to enter the accelerated degree programs, DeVry doesn't currently offer all of their degree programs in the accelerated format (but they're working on it), not all classes needed for graduation are offered every term, limited number of elective courses are available, colossal tution fees, and the worst pitfall of all poor student administration. I have had numerous issues with class scheduling and unprofessional administrative staff. I have found it very difficult to get the same answer to a single question from different staff members. Additionally, there are a few dud teachers... but that can be found at all public and private universities. I hope this review will help you make an informed decision on your educational needs.
