As a running back one of the best ever. Reading the bulk of comments under this is yet more distressing evidence of the generally soggy intellects of folks on this website. For those of you who have difficulty reading, this list is a rating of NFL players as players, not as murderers etc. Feel free to make any comments you like, but try to keep your star rating within the realm of the list definition. If you want to rate Simpson as a human being, there are several other lists to do that on, and I would join you in rating him at one star. However, this is about his skill as a running back, and he should get no less than 4 stars.
