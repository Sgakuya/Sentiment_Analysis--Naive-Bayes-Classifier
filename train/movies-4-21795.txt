Well, I think this one was a bit more fun to watch than the first one. I happened to agree with Ebert on both - the first one was very awkwardly paced and in this one the main heroes, the hobbits, seem to take a back seat to Helm's Deep - a battle that occupied one short chapter in the book. This guy I know thought it would've been better to end the movie with the cliffhanger Tolkien used in the book (I guess I shouldn't give it away to non-readers). As an avid fan of the book I'd have to agree. I was discussing with some online fans what will be left out due to their chopping the main events off the end of the second book, and we ended up agreeing that quite a bit will be (I'm guessing Aragorn will not take the POTD). I noticed the absence of the twins - Arwen's brothers, and wondered why it couldn't have been them with some Elves and the other Rangers to come down and help with the battle. But I guess Jackson wanted to give Lorien a bigger role. And, oh, I just love the decision to sacrifice Rohan's Nordic blond genes and traditional braids so that they could look all dissheveled compared to the more organized Elves. What bothered me most was not just Faramir but basically all the human leaders seemed to be many characters with one face - despaired, corruptible and unwise... perhaps so the Elves will seem so much better by comparison? I was highly disappointed in the movie's depiction of both Faramir, and Theoden - who first left the highly-esteemed Aragorn dead on the field (something noone of an honorable and militant culture such as Rohan's would dream of doing), and then even tho he was cured lost all his Rohirric courage and spirit . Although I think the worst thing about this one was the sleep-inducing and unnecessary amount of time they devoted to Arwen. Give her a couple of blips, fine, but I insist they overdid it. I think the best thing about this movie was Gollum. I was surprisingly impressed that there was actually nothing I would change about him.
