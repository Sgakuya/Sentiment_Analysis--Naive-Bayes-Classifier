With Robin you get two people in one, the serious actor and the crazyman comedian. If you happened to catch the episode of the old TV show Homicide that Robin was on where he played a husband who brought his family to Baltimore to see a baseball game. When the got to the ballpark they were mugged and his wife was murdered. This show will tear your heart out. Robin as the grieving husband and father is superb. The scene where he goes to the morgue to identify the body is great. This is superior acting. Now that is a lot different than Robin the comedien. The comedy guy will do absolutely anything for a laugh. I mean anything.
