Although Secret Window didn't fare too well at the box office and critics' reviews were tepid, we watched it on DVD (just came out this week). Secret Window delivered the goods. Johnny Depp delivers another great piece of quirky, off-beat acting. Timothy Hutton plays the role of the D---Head quite well. Though I am a big John Turturro fan, his performance here was a bit uneven. Based on a Stephen King story (aren't they all), Secret Window delivers a nice suspenseful mystery that gives you the willys at times, and provides a nice twist at the end. I can't delve into any more than that without giving it away. The one thing I noted from the DVD was that in every case, the director made the right call in his deleted scenes selction. Of course critics love to pan movies like this for being too predictable, etc., etc. It seems like they would rather pine over evil propoganda movies like Fahrenheit 911 (By the way, that's how much Michael Moore weighs). I digress -- Go rent Secret Window.
