If you're interested in seeing good examples of colonial architecture, Cuenca is probably your best bet in Ecuador. There are some really beautiful churches, parks, and civic buildings. And Cuenca is far less touristy than Quito - I walked around the city for a full day and only noticed a handful of non-Ecuadorians. But looking at buildings can't hold my attention for very long, and after a day in Cuenca I found myself wanting to head back out to the countryside. If it's a choice between seeing wildlife or artchitecture, I'll choose wildlife every time, and Ecuador is so full of great places to see animals that I didn't want to waste a lot of time in Cuenca.
