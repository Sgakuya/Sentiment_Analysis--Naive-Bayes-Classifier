this game rules!!! sure the graphic was a little outdated even back then, but this game is just so addictive!! the exaggeratedly exaggerated car physics enable you do preform tons of cool stunts and allows alot of creativity. me and my freind invented over 20 diffrent killing !! it's full of bugs but the bugs don't ruin the fun, they are even amuzing like when the engine puts a pedestrian too close to you so you can see him appear out of thin air, or when the peds dive into the ground or something like that, but it doesn't happen every second and even when it does it's just funny!! this game obviously provided SCI the recovery it needed from failures such as gender wars ect., so the movies aren't the best, actually they'r the worst i've ever seen but that's just amuzing, because the game itself is a huge fun and full of action. baisicly it's the only car race game i can tolerate and enjoy.
