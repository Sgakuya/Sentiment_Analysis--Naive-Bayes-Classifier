I love my Jeep Cherokee 4x2 (ha thinks its a 4x4) i would recommend a vehicle like this one if you know basic mechanic skills and have your own tools (can fix anything on it) lots of after market parts, very dependable (mine has never left me stranded but stuck a few times. tons of power with I6 (I pull ford,chevy and dodge full sizes out of the ground, and rocks and trees and trailers ect.) gas milage depends on how well you keep it tuned and what size tires you have mine gets about 325 mi. on a 19 gal tank, um body does rust in some places (but who really cares about cosmetics) fender flares fall off(haha long story on that one) very tough in crashes( my mom in her cherokee got hit in the side by a full size van at 35 mph and after 1500 worth of shop work it is still running good(not totaled like most vehicles would be) i love my jeep and if you are a home mechanic, dont mind paying for the extra gas and want one beast of a motor and STEEL around you i suggest this one sincerely JEEPGUY
