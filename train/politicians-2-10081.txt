While travelling, I heard Dubya give a press conference in Russia and I was shocked at how terrible his public speaking skills are once he is off the page and away from the protection of his handlers. (Foreign news doesn't cleverly edit and provide spit and polish) This guy is a dope. . .his mediocre academic, business, and political achievements are a matter of public record. This was the best that the GOP had to offer? If 9-11 never happened, this bozo would be crucified for the lousy economy. He can't shake the image of trying to finish daddy's job in the Mid-East. I can't belive I'm actually saying this but I really am starting to miss Clinton. Memo to America- stop electing rednecks to the Oval Office. There are thousands of unreported civilian death in Iraq - Americans might be fooled but the world isn't.
