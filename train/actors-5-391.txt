A unique and gifted actor whose extraordinary career had the rare distinction of spanning five decades. Low key and seemingly emotionless at times, Mitchum may have been at his best and most effective when he portrayed the creepy antagonist. For me, he more than proved this in disturbing but compelling films like Cape Fear and The Night of the Hunter . His nonchalant acting style lent itself well not only to forties film noir but also to a large variety of westerns, war flicks and comedies. I'm no doubt in the minority when I say that, by the time he did the Winds of War and War and Remembrance for television, he had moved from low key to slightly dull. But, for me that certainly does not begin to tarnish the huge body of excellent work he achieved in his long acting career.
