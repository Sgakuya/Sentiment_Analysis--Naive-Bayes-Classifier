A couple months back my buddy recommended this book, and said it changed his life. It's about love, values, relationships, God. It sold over 10 million copies since written in 1979. Well it took me a while to read this book for some reason, and just today I went to finish the last twenty pages when I put it aside for the newspaper. I run across an article in obituaries section entitled "M. Scott Peck, author of best-seller "Road Less Traveled." I'm thinking, get out of here, today is the day I intend to finish this book, and he just died two days ago. Just yesterday I randomly left a rateitall review on how great Litchfield County, Conn. is, and that's where the Dr. Peck is from. A line in the article that was intersting to me mentioned how influential Dr. Peck's book has been on the world, and how people actually regarded him as a prophet, yet he had trouble with that comparison due to issues in his own life including weaknesses for cheap gin and women.
