I'll admit it - I was a fairly late Pavement adopter, and it was the hooky, poppy sounds of Gold Sounds and Range Life off of Crooked Rain that made me a fan. One of my roommates a while back was an early adopter of the band, having bought Slanted and Enchanted when it was released, and I think he always resented the late adopters like myself. While I can appreciate that sentiment, I stand by my claim that this is their best album. Don't get me wrong, I love Westing and Slanted and all of their early stuff as well - I just don't think anything they've done is as powerful from beginning to end as this one - despite the fact that Crooked Rain had a top forty hit.
