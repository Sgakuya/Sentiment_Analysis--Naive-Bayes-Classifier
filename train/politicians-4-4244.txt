Mr. Nader is very committed to his beliefs and I admire him for speaking out when necessary. He will not be our next president, but I do hope he gets the required votes for matching funds. I also hope the people that support him in states where Gore and Bush are running close realize what their vote means. People of California, Maine, Michagin, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Washington, please think what the earth will be like if Bush gets elected. I will gladly change my Gore vote here in Texas for Nader if you will change your vote to Gore. Gore doesn't have a chance in Texas, so let us help Nader get the required votes for matching funds while you help Gore get elected for all of our sakes. We can still make third parties a part of the election; it just won't happen this election.
