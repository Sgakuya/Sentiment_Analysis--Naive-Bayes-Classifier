Purchased a 2001 Frontier SE-V6 Desert Runner in January 2001 and have had 4100 trouble free miles so far. Gas milage is between 20 and 21 mpg average, with a best tank of 24 mpg. Adequate engine power from the V6, although a little more oomph at highway speeds would be nice. Manual shifting is crisp and smooth, and it feels more like a car than a truck. The steering is could give more road feel, and it can feel skittish going around really bumpy curves. Parking is a breeze because the truck is VERY nimble. The interior is very quiet, except when accelerating hard. The front seats are very comfortable, even for long trips. The rear jump seats are not very comfortable at all, best used only when necessary. The HVAC system works too well sometimes and requires constant fiddling when it is really cold outside. The optional 6 Disc CD Changer is a joy, but the rest of the stereo system could use better speakers and better balancing between the full range speakers and the subwoofer. Overall the truck feels substantial, turns lots of heads, and seems to be a great value. I think the build quality is better than the domestics, without the high ticket price of the Toyota Tacomas. There are a few features of the Toys that would be nice, but this truck is just a better value. Drive one and see.
