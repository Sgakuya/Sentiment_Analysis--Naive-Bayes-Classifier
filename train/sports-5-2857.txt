The Phillies are humming The Cars Just What I Needed in the clubhouse with the hiring of Charlie Manuel. After 4 years of Larry Bowa's reign of terror, Manuel provides a calming influence. He's a player's manager and he has a legacy of success in managerial stints both in the minor and Major leagues. Though it's easy to write him off as a country bumpkin, Charlie is a true baseball man, in the mold of Jack McKeon. He's no pushover. I think he got thrown out of 3 of the first 4 games he managed for Cleveland and became so angry with his players over lacadasial play, he threw out the clubhouse ping-pong table. Though one of the greatest gaijin players in Japanese baseball history, Manuel was just a career .198 hitter in the majors. Another great manager, Tony LaRussa, batted .199, which lends creed to my theory that marginal players make better managers than talented ballplayers. One other aside: I wrote a book about below .200 hitters a couple of years ago. A young Charlie Manuel is featured on the cover ( www.mendozasheroes.com ).
