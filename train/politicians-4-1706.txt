I don't see what everyone has against the guy. Does every guy who runs for office have to be a pale-faced impotent weenie defunct of personality? Given the choices during the democratic nomination, at least this guy was somewhat dynamic and interesting. As for the GYEEEEEAAHHH debacle, which was a total fiction created by the media - look at the context. The guy was in a room surrounded by hundreds of young people who were screaming so loud that he had no way to speak over them, even amplified. Go figure, the first time in years we have a candidate that gets a few young folks out to the polls, and he's knocked out so early in the race. Still, I don't think he had the right stands on all the issues. But 4 stars for effort.
