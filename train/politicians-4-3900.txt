Are we better off now than 7 years ago? Yes, probably financially, but no if we speak of Social Security, Education, Perscription Drugs, Medicare and the Military. It's time for a change, not just throwing money for a quick fix. Does working two jobs or round the clock mean we are better off? The Environment is important to many voters, I would like to see a comparison between the % of deaths per year due to automobile accidents, plane crashes when matched against the accidents in drilling and distributing 1000's of barrels of oil each year. What is the amount of land set aside in Alaska, and what % of land would GWB want to explore? A Supreme Court nominee must be confirmed by the Senate...Democrats are using scare tacticts as well as misrepresentations. Regan was much more conservative than Bush, and was Rowe vr. Wade overturend? Even if it was than the States would be free to decide.
