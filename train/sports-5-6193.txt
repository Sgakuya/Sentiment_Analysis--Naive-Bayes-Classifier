He is a wonderful post player. If you have watched any games, you can tell that he has raw talent. His ability to score in the lane with two, three defenders on him is amazing. They don't call him the Landlord for nothin. He owns and dominates the lane-he is number 4 in the NCAA in blocked shots. And where is Sean May? Not even good enough to make it into the top 50! Pitiful if I do say so myself. In the ACC, Shelden Williams is number 1 in blocked shots! Well whaddaya know? Oh and by the way, it's pretty low to make fun of the way somebody looks. Thats what you losers have to resort to when you can't find anything bad to say about his basketball skill. Not his fault that he's so good you can't find anything to make fun of. What's the matter? Can't think of a smart comeback? Doesn't surprise me in the least. UPDATE** You don't have to be excellent at freethrows when you have the ability to go in the lane and score with THREE!!!!!! Defenders on you (like Shelden Williams does). Who cares about foul shots when you can make those tough layups? Not me. Oh and by the way, do you actually have any GOOD insults that don't have to do with his looks? *UPDATE*- Ok I have two things to say here- one is iluvseanmay, you must not know that Shelden just HAPPENED to be ACC defender of the year. Guess you must not watch too much basketball if you didn't know that AND you think Sean can make it up the court faster than Shelden, who is in top condition. When was the last time you watched them because you obviously don't know what you're talking about. The second thing is- why do you post on Shelden and then go on non stop about Sean? No one wants to hear it.
