Portland to me, seemed like a smaller version of Seattle. Nevertheless...the locals were friendly...traffic didn't seem to be much of a problem. Man, I went there last August...and the weather seemed chilly for some odd reason! What's so darn great about Portland...the downtown area that is...is some of the public transportation is FREE! I had a field day riding buses from shopping malls back to my hotel. The weather did suck while I was there...cloudy like Seattle. Oh, and don't forget there's no sales tax in the state of Oregon! I'd say Portland is a lefty kind of city ...but I've never bumped into any hippies or pot smoking weirdos. I would not mind living here.
