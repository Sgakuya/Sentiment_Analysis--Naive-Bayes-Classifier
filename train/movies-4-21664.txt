Released in 1983, Return Of The Jedi attempted and for the most part succeeded in tying up all the loss ends and in bringing the Star Wars saga to a conclusion. Because the film had this responsibility, the screenwriters were a bit controlled by this responsibility; nevertheless, they still failed on some fronts. On the plus side, casting was again not really an issue as Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford portrays Han Solo, etc, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian improved from his weak performance in The Empire Strikes Back. The viewer finally gets some good looks at the supreme nemesis in the form of Emperor Palpatine (played by Ian McDiarmid). The special effects continued to improve as well, spectacular for 1983. The problems, however, are notable and material. As several comments have noted, the Ewoks were overexposed. While the scenes and editing was frantic and fast paced in Empire, they were extended in Jedi which resulted in a slower paced film and causing the Ewok problem to be exacerbated. Moreover, the story relied on another Deathstar that must be destroyed which evidences a lack of imagination and ideas. Certainly the screenwriters could have come up with a more original task for our heros besides resurrecting the same goal from Star Wars. Nevertheless, nearly all complaints and criticisms of Jedi are relative as the film still shines when compared with most other science fiction movies.
