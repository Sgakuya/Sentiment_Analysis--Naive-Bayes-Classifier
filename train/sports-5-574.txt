Jeter is not just a solid player, he's an amazingly talented and efficient player. He has a career average of a great deal above .300 and is a perennial 200-hit batter. He has experienced a disproportionate quantity of success in his 6-year career, winning 5 pennants and 4 world series. Jeter is also an excellent fielder. He possesses a great creativity at shortstop. His poise and just plain acrobatic ability helped the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs alone. He made that miracle play in which he saved the season in game 3 of the ALDS with the score 1-0 and the ball coming home, he flipped it home from the middle of the first base line to catch the guy at the plate. Jeter also made that awesome play where he dove to catch a pop-up against Seattle in the ALCS and fell into the stands along the left field line. His on-base percentage is commendable as well. Overall, Jeter is one of the best in the league and an all-star every year.
