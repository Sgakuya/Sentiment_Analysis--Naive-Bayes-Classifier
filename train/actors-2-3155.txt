Russell Crowe? to be honest, nothing special! He has certainly a pretty face (so do many other actors in Hollywood) and I suppose to a certain degree he can act. However, he is just too concious of himself, he is machist and likes his women to be women that is to cook and the rest... Also, his ideas are, as he himself, quite inconsistent- i.e.; he said that he would only live in Los Angeles in the event of a martial attack and now he is sharing a $8 million house with lover Meg, where? ummm! yes! you guessed it!in Los Angeles! And of course saying that he is the new Marlon Brando is a pure joke.He is not a bad actor altogether, but in Gladiator he gets absolutely outstaged by the IMPRESSIVE performance of Joaquin Phoenix.....
