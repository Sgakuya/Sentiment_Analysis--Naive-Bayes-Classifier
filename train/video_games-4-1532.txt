Eternal Darkness is a good game although by no means is it a masterpiece as some people have claimed. Comparisons have been made with Res Evil although both games couldn't be any more different. Eternal Darkness is less of a survival horror game and instead relies on it's gripping story influenced by the writer Edgar Allen Poe and a unique feature called an 'insanity meter', to keep the player in suspense and guessing the outcome til the very end. Having said that some sections of the game fall a bit flat and seem more of an afterthought with a few generic puzzles thrown in. Some of the insanity effects too start to wear a bit thin after a while and feel a little gimmicky in places. I wouldn't say it's as scary or as polished as Resident Evil, although the music throughout is great and it has enough gameplay variety and puzzle solving to keep any gamer entertained for hours.
