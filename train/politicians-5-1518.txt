Saddam is many things to many people. What is true is the fact that he lead the most secular and FREE state in the Middle East. True, it was not a democracy like France or Germany. But, either was it Saudi Arabia. Saddam was a tough but fair leader I believe and he kept his country safe. Up until 2003, Iraq was one of the safest countries to visit (unless you interfered in internal politics of course). It was and is a shame what they are doing to Saddam. Just because they can't get the REAL villain (Bin Laden and co.), Bush and co. go for the easy option and settle an old dispute for personal reasons. Invading Iraq was an insult to all that died in 9/11. And as for those who think Iraq would be better off without Saddam, just listen to the news!
