Maine is a quiet, beautiful state that seems to be unspoiled. Hopefully it can always stay that way. NOTE: I think it is really ridiculous that some of the reviewers on this website have judged the state of Maine based purely on how many white people live there...if that isn't racist, I don't know what is ! While I think it would be awesome if every state had an equal amount of every color of people, sometimes things don't work out that way, and it doesn't always mean it is because the people in that state are racist. Those remarks are just totally redundant and ignorant..give me a break ! There is absolutely nothing wrong with white people, black people, brown people, or even purple people..give it a rest...
