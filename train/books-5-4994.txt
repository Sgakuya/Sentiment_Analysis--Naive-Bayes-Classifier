One of the cornerstone works of all literature and the true significant startingpoint of the narrative tradition in English. The language is absolutely beautiful, the poetics are of the first order. The tales are humorous, ribald, illuminating in terms of the values of the time in which they were written, inventive (following Boccaccio's models, of course), evocative. The tension between the Pilgrims is very well handled, indicating the class antagonism of early modern England. The Miller's Tale is so damn funny and The Pardoner's Tale is one of the most disconcerting yarns in all of literature. Chaucer was a genius, and when you consider how relatively little he had to go on in terms of influence, forms and conventions, his accomplishment is astounding. And as always, KikiD is displaying gross ignorance and stupidity. How anyone can say that The Canterbury Tales is poorly written is beyond me: especially when it comes from someone who can hardly put together a sentence. The CT is evasive? In what way? If anything, this is one of the most in-your-face works of the classical canon. Condescending? To whom? I rather doubt this idiot has ever read this book. It sure doesn't sound like it. Sounds like the only avid reading KikiD does is on the back of cereal boxes.
