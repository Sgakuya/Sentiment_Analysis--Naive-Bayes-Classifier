Returned from Dallas today 04/10/04 having spent a splendid week in Dallas. The one disappointment from the trip was the visit to Billy Bobs on Sunday night with my friends. We had read articles on the net regarding this mecca of fun and decided to travel 30 miles from Arlington to this venue for our friends Birthday night out. We were welcomed by a bouncer who had the personality of a bear with a sore head and he charged us for the privilege of entering such a FUN venue. There was only a handfull of people in Billy Bobs so that was very disappointing and we decided to have a few beers and play some pool. Half way through our second game of pool they decided to close!!! We explained to them that they advertised opening hours showing closing at 12.30am on Sundays. We had travelled nearly an hour to get there, they charged us to get in, then an hour and a half later they ask us to leave at 10.30 pm - also stopping us finishing a game of pool before leaving!!! That leaved us with a $70 taxi journey for the journey home. Dallas is a wonderful place, so don't be caught out by these so called Tourist traps. Billy Bobs is a truly tacky place!
