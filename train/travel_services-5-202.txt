Ask frequent flyers which airline worldwide enjoys the BEST ONTIME PERFORMANCE RECORD and I'll bet you get the wrong answer. Most people are surprised when they learn that the correct answer is Aeromexico. Over the past 10 years, Aeromexico has achieved better than a 90% on-time rate. I've flown with Aeromexico about 30 times over the last 2 years, and what constantly impresses me about their operation is that the flights ALWAYS go on time -- they're like German trains! I have NEVER had a significantly late flight on Aeromexico. I'm sure they happen sometimes, but for my money, I'll stick with a PROVEN track record -- and that's Aeromexico. Service is also great. Faster checkin lines than you're probably used to with U.S. airlines, plus nice touches that tell you you're a valued customer. Like the candy as you enter the plane, or the FREE beer or margarita during your flight (none of that stupid $4, exact change appreciated nonsense that you get stiffed with on U.S. airlines). Overall, a great airline! Reasonable fares, great service, and the WORLD'S BEST ONTIME RECORD. There are LOTS of good reasons to like these guys...
