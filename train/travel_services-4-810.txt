TriSec - worst public transit system on earth? Compared to where? Clearly exagerated. Yes the MBTA's infrastructure is rather old and could use some updating but it operates just fine and is clearly a commuters best option of getting in and around the city. The system is VERY extensive both in town and the commuter rail out to the suburbs and covers more area than most cities do. Before judging Boston as having the worst transit system on earth try riding transit in Seattle- close to non existant: no trains, all buses and they are still trying to get their act together as they've been trying to plan mass transit there for decades without laying any track. Or try riding transit in Philadelphia. SEPTA's system is very dirty, scary, and ranked very low on this list. I'm pretty satisfied with the MBTA. It works.
