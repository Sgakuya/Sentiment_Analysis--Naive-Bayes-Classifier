As Word seems to be the standard and a rather capable word processing program, it deserves no less than four stars on that basis alone. Word has all the bells and whistles that one would expect and need from a modern word processing program, and it is intuitive to the regular computer user. Moreover, as employers almost invariably ask for resumes in Word format, it is a necessity for this purpose. Nevertheless, since my first modern word processing program was WordPerfect, that program remains the standard for the legal profession in North Carolina, and I like the feel of WordPerfect better, Word only gets four stars to WordPerfect's five.
