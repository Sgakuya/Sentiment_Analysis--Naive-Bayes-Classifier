The setting is picturesque. You can't find a better value. Luxury hotels in the area are reasonable and the rides are awesome. Must ride: Poltergeist; Superman; Scream; Boomerang and Power Surge (stand on the bridge afterwards for the full effect). They have live performances daily, four stages that I know of: Looney Tunes; Tejano; Rock Roll and Country Western. Several lunch locations on site. I like the Buffalo Saloon but stay alert, cause your lunch may be interrupted by a gunfight or two. Don't forget to stop by the water park it's a lot of fun. To top it all off, there s the nightly Boardwalk party and huge fireworks display at closing. Have fun!!!
