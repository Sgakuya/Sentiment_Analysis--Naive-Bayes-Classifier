This movie was inane and disgusting. You know, it really bugs me when films that feel as though they don't really have enough a.) actors who can handle real, funny material, and b.) real, funny material, have to resort to gross-out gay and masturbation jokes. True, the American Pie francise's fan base isn't really made up of disinguished film-goers, I at least have enough faith in these teenagers to recognize a cheap, flailing attempt to get a laugh. Being a teenager, I don't appreciate having my intelligence underestimated, and when I walked out of this movie(which I was only seeing because I was waiting for the next showing of the others-I would not pay to see an American Pie movie)I felt as though my I.Q. had dropped several points. I don't know, I thought I'd give it a chance. The first movie at least had the redeeming Oz-choir girl romance that was sweet for the most part and not all about sex. One has to think, what do the adults, after watching this movie, think about today's teenagers? That we are all sex-obsessed and really stupid? (Jim.) I do not by any means recommend this women exploiting farce of a movie.
