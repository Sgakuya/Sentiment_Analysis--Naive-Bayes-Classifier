W L is the best school in the South. Yes it's full of preppy white kids and social life=frat life. Academically, we work our butts off and the professors are top-notch. As a non-Southerner, I felt out of place there at times, as the country club Southern sect was so foreign to me. Like anywhere, you find your niche, and the more people I got to know, the more diversity I realized there was, hidden behind the frat hair and pearls. It would be easy to write the student body off as homogenous, but get to know them and you realize they're not. Lexington is a very small town with not much to do. I volunteered a lot in the community and got involved in the area, which gave me things to do that other people may not have done. But if you want culture and a fast-paced barhopping college experience, forget it. Lexington doesn't provide that. But what it does, it does well. Hope this helps!
