When you think about it, Las Vegas is really a very bizarre living history museum. What other place on earth could more aptly show the rapid metamorphosis of two equally strange cultures ? Not so very long ago, into this desert wasteland trouped the glitter and tinsel laden, martini-swilling lounge lizards, their bimbo sidekicks, and self-important cheese ball Mafia types. They built their gaudy hotels, played their games, set out their traps, tossed in their lines and went to work. A few decades pass and suddenly a town that was once labeled for adults only now finds itself in competition with Disney for the family vacationer. The old guard has now been replaced by buffed up corporate types in expensive suits who - build their gaudy hotels, play their games, set out their traps, toss in their lines and go to work. Maybe the old town hasn't changed so much as it just added a newer more expensive veneer. (Could this be where Madonna gets her ideas for reinventing herself?)
