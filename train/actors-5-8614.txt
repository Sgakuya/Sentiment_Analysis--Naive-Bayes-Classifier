A woman singing in a night club in a top hat and tails. She is flirting openly with a woman in the audience. She takes a flower from the woman's hair, sniffs it, and throws it to Gary Cooper. The film was Morrocco , the year was 1930, and the singer was Marlene Dietrich. Kenneth Tynan once wrote of her, She has sex, but no particular gender. Nothing could be more true! She Was where femininity and masculinity met. She wore tuxedos and suits in public. She remained married to one man but had countless lovers, men and women. But when one looks at her platinum, marcelled hair and those bewitching eyes, one can only sigh and think Now this is a goddess! And a goddess who lived! Listen to her world weary voice as she sings Falling In Love Again and it'll be no time before you fall in love with her!
