I have never written one of these, ever, but I can't stand Brad Pitt's behaviour lately and his movie Mr & Mrs. Smith was so pitiful I could have cried - that's it - no more Pitt movies for me! As far as I can see from what he shows to the public, he is an absolutely horrible, horrible human being for how he has treated his wife. This goes hand in hand with his terrible acting skills. Yet another actor making a mockery of marriage - why did he even bother - he threw it all away at the first available opportunity - for a cracked individual - we've all seen her in action. Her only apparent attribute looks to be her outward appearance. Jennifer Aniston is obviously a lady with real acting skills, class and beauty and for Brad to leave this woman for that jackass shows his zero intelligence. He is empty and wooden - look at his stint on Friends - an absolute disaster - it was hideous to watch. He should have thrown in the towel after that one. For all those people who think he's hot - get some glasses - other than a decent physique, he's all about the hair - his voice is almost grating it's so dull and you could park a car up his nostrils. They're probably writing all over each other with blood as I type. Creepy bloody people (ha ha). Jennifer is better off. Melanie Griffith was right to monitor the set when her husband was on a movie with the devil woman - Jennifer was just too trusting, poor thing. She will do much better and here's really hoping he will not.
