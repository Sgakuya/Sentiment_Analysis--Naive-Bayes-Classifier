I would eat this chicken before the other bigname place, KFC. The chicken has more of a down-home taste to it. Of course it's greasy and unhealthy, It's fried chicken for God's sake, that is why it's good, LOL. If you don't want to weigh 300 lbs you of course could not eat here every day. The reason it is not as big as KFC is maybe a marketing thing. I do not mean to stereotype, but Church's seem to be located usually in predominately black neighborhoods. At least that seems to be the case in the cities I've been in. I don't know if that's a conscious corporate move but I think they could open more locations.
