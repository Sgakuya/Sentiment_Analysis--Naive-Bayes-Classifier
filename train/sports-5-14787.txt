He deserves a 5 for what he has done on the field for the Cowboys and the NFL. He was the shining star when Dallas was knee deep in controversy. He isn't the best, the fastest, strongest, but he has heart. He holds the NFL rushing record now on paper, but people who follow the game knows that it is only a number. Walter Peyton and Barry Sanders played with at best average lines, and they did more in 10 years than Emmitt did. Emmitt needed more carries than Walter, and that was behind his Pro Bowl line. Walter, while he was still alive, told the media once that he hoped Barry Sanders would break his record. When Barry retired, only then did the Peyton family endorse Emmitt. He's a top 10 all time runningback, but he's not the best.
