This is a wonderfully inventive video. It reminds me of what I used to watch Saturday mornings growing up as a little kid in the suburbs. It is an animated video of a concert that seems to be takeing place on another planet. It is done in an anime type fashion and is executed very well. It is a great break from all the cleche videos of recent months. But, Daft Punk has always made neat groundbreaking video for their neat groundbreaking music. I am a huge fan of this video and this song. I hope it is on rotation for a long time. The ending of the video is rather sad but I believe it has to do with celebrating one last time. Very fresh and different.
