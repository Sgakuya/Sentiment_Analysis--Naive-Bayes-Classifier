I did not find this movie disturbing. I was not nausiated when I left the theater. Had I been alone, I would have left the theater after the first hour of viewing. Benicio del Toro is a superb actor, and he renders just as good a performance to this movie as to any other in which he plays. Unfortunately, the story and plot just were not there to make the movie what it could have and should have been. The movie does not pick up fast enough; nor does it cleanly develop any one of its three stories beyond that of a television series pilot. Additionally, I like to take advantage of many different forms of cinematic entertainment. However the fact that Benicio Del Toro's story is filmed almost entirely in Spanish only hinders English speaking audiences from enjoying the movie. Foreign film is great, but one must be in the mood for foreign film. Moreover, Michael Douglas' politically motivated pontification toward the end of the movie simply turns me off. I do not agree with the implication that the work of law enforcement is useless; nor do I believe that treatment is the only real cure for all abusers. I have never seen Don Cheadle perform badly in anything, but again, I feel that the direction and writing failed him. I believe Soderbergh missed the mark on this one.
