The Gap used to be cool a few years ago, and I even worked there part-time when I was in high school. But, now all of their clothes are... well, blah. They are so boring and dull now. They used to have some cool clothes, but now they have nothing! They have carried the same exact line of clothing for quite a while now (for about two and a half years now from what I have noticed), and they rarely change anything. The only t-shirts that they have now are the plain colored ones, or boring ones that just say GAP on them. The only thing that they are still good for are boxer shorts. Now I pretty much only shop at American Eagle and Abercrombie. At least their clothes have life to them. I haven't really bought anything at the Gap in about three years (since I worked there), and I don't intend to go into that store until they get their act together and get their cool clothes back!
