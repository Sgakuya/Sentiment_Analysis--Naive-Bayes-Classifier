Where else can you hear Walter Brennan sing "Get Along Home, Cindy, Cindy" (and do it well)? Not to be confused with the inferior RIO LOBO, this cherished Western revels in the warm, romantic atmosphere that only Howard Hawks can bring to a tiny frontier town. Dominated by John Wayne's distinctive bow-legged gait (the man couldn't trap a pig in a box canyon) and slow, baritone drawl (his estate should get a dollar for every imitation, and two dollars for every bad one), he's assigned the unenviable task of keeping a suspected killer in town for trial before the killer's crooked brother can spring him (with the help of central-casting bought guns). The Duke's got help, though, in the form of recovering alcoholic Dean Martin (his finest Western performance, including the dulcet tones of "My Rifle, Pony, And Me"), Rick Nelson as visiting cattlehand "Colorado", and the scruffy-jumpy Brennan. Angie Dickinson (looking as sexy as she's ever been) provides the worried break from all the testosterone, and everything finishes up in expected heroic fashion. Has its faults (Nelson got a helluva "reverb" off an 1860s acoustic guitar), but it's still a thoroughbred in a pasture of Shetlands.
