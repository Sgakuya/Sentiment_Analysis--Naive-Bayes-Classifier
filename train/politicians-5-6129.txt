It seems in our country anymore it is looked down upon to have a religious affiliation, or say I believe in God, or I believe in the bible. I am amazed everyday by it. We have the chance to have a man who believes in God, will follow the laws of the land and of his religious views. They can work together. After all, was'nt our country founded upon religious principles. It gave us the freedom we have today. Of course we are not as free as we use to be. We are not even free to think. If we think abortion is wrong we are looked down upon. If we feel being gay is unnatural, we are looked down upon. If we follow the laws of the bible the best we can, we are looked down upon. John Ashcroft has very high morals and principles. I am proud to have a President with such principles, and I am proud to have an Attorney General with such principles. It is so refreshing compared to what we have had for the last 8 years. It is in total contrast. Their is not one person that I have heard that has not said he was a fine man. They just dont believe in his beliefs. Well welcome to America. We dont all have to think alike. He has his rights as much as Janet Reno. What did she prove to be? Stick with it Mr. Ashcroft and dont be intimidated by the extreme leftists, who do not have morals.
