The Bahamas like every other place on earth has its ups and downs - but how can you possibly trash one of the most beautiful places on earth with silly comments that I read here is beyond me. I love it there, I have friends there and I visit often - yes it is crowded but it depends on where you go on the island. The younger tourists especially love it - the clubs the beaches the bars, the five star and fast food restaurants. Nassau is a place where you can have it all - vacation wise. For the older tourists there are 699 more islands in the Bahamas that have a slower pace. As for the poverty - do your research people Nassau has almost no poverty - its just that the poor areas are close to the tourist areas - check this link for further proof. http://www.worldbank.org/data/countrydata/aag/bhs_aag.pdf I suggest that you explore the entire island instead of just being scared of it and see how people really live before you judge it. Nassau also happens to be the most developed and highest income producing Caribbean island - so get your facts straight and go and see for yourself instead of taking all this watered down second hand information as facts.
