Pretty nice place, Pittsburgh is a really nice, clean city, with good people. Philly has that big city atmosphere, although crime is a problem there. And the countryside is great. I dont know why, but my favorite city in Pennsylvania is this little city called Williamsport. It kind of reminds me of just the average american town, i know it is where the little league world series is held. A lot of the small towns scattered around have a unique apeal to them (at least for me) as well. All in all i think i could live in most of PA. EDIT: Whoever made this sight must not be too good in georgraphy, THE CAPITAL OF PENNSYLVANIA IS HARRISBURG, NOT PHILADELPHIA!!! EDIT: Also, what is a Pennsylvania accent, i have never noticed one, i mean, i can notice a sort of italian accent going on in Philadelphia, and in some very rural areas in the extreme south of the state, you can even hear a little southern accent, but i have never heard in general of a Pennnsylvania Accent maybe its something you have to really listen for to notice? Also Dr. Entropy is wrong, the population of PA, while not booming, has gone from 11.8 million in the 90's to over 12.3 million now, that isnt a huge increase, but its not a decrease!
