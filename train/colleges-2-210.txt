After spending 2 years at this business school, I had 2 professors who were really good. Most others took either a very 'global' approach to teaching (ie. they talked about ideas but didn't teach you the details of finance) or had a 'reverse teaching' methodology. First their assign the homework that you need to hand in before class, and then they teach you the material. (maybe a good for marketing but definately doesn't work for finance) The CFA prep course is useless. Overall, I learned a decent amount because I put in a great deal of time and effort. It was definately not the result of the teaching I received. This is a young business school with limited name recognition. The school tries to compare itself to other leading business schools but it has a long way to go. Years down the road, it may become a recognized academic institution but for now I would recommend looking at other options before deciding to study here. Overall, it was an expensive and frustrating experience.
