Vermont is the most beautiful state in the country. A bold statement it is but when taken as a whole no state has such a high percentage of picturesque towns. No state on the east coast has more ski resorts per square mile. I never feel stressed when visiting thi state. In fact, the residents never seemed stressed out and its understandable. The state has the perfect blend of hills, meadows, and forests. In the spring and summer the greenery from the trees and fields is so bright it is similar to what one would expect in Ireland. Taken as a whole, the residents are somewhat reserved but polite and considerate. The brutally cold and snowy winter and early spring prevented me from giving Vermont five stars but to others, the cold climate may be considered a bonus.
