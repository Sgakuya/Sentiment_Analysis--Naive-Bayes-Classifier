Southwest is perfect in every regard. They only fly one type of plane -- Boeing 737s. I heard a horror story of one of the other airlines having a plane that none of the maintenance crew knew anything about or even had any maintenance documentation on. The cabins are clean and the seats are all leather. Compare to other airlines with cloth seats splotched with odd-looking stains. I also like the concept of being awarded for being an early bird. I know I can get an A Boarding Pass (It's even easier now that you can log online after midnight to get your boarding pass). With other stupid airlines, I book weeks in advance and still get stuck in a middle seat between 2 fat dudes with gas. Southwest has an impeccable safety record, yet don't torture you with bombastic 1-hour safety briefs like Untied Airlines. They've taken the ill-fated People's Express concept and made it work.
