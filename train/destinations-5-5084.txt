I live in NY, and I would venture that the Empire State is one of the most diverse ones in the Union. It ranks up there with California, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, and so forth. A top state in education, scenery, population, ethnic and religious diversity, etc. But what is the greatest aspect about the State of New York is its people and its capacity to help its fellow man. You saw the spirit of NY and NYC in the wake of the Sept. 11 tragedies: people pulling together for the sake of unity and to demonstrate our commitment to helping all people regardless of what or who they look like. Governor Pataki and Mayor Guiliani have done an exemplary job in working together to help New Yorkers, and Americans, deal with these catastrophic events. GOD BLESS OUR GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK!!!!!
