He was the first president I got to vote for. And I voted for him twice, though not without some doubts and misgivings. I didn't agree with all his policies, but I'm glad he was there for at least a little while to help keep the country from being taken over by right-wing fundamentalists and oil barons, as we see happening now ..... I don't like the way he used women in his personal life, but I doubt he was really any worse in that sense than a lot of men in his position. Power corrupts. His mistake was in not heeding the lesson of Gary Hart, that the media and the opposition no longer consider a leader's sex life off-limits. And that mistake helped put GW Bush in the white house. In all the impeachment mess, the greater evil lodged with his enemies, who as far as I could see would stop at nothing to bring him down regardless of whatever long term damage it caused. But still, he should have known better. We counted on him, and in the end he let us down....
