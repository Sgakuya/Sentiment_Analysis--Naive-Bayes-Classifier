the truth ... Hello americans , livig in belguim were roads are full of japs and everyone owned one when young because they could not afford the better car hear hear: some japanese cars are indeed verry reliable , a vette might need a bit more maintanance but look at a supra , honda , sabaru older than 10 years ! what do you see ? yes an old car because they lack personality charisma presence , now look at a corvette or a jag or a ferrari older than 10 years and the lines are still breath taking .Each and every corvette had that extra demension that what makes them still awesome even after decades. A sportscar you buy with your heart if you can afford it , yes I drive a vette and I could afford a rari , why ? Because you have to follow your heart and the feelling the car gives you, and if a Supra gives you the feeling by all means go for your dream , singed love on first sight the vette.
