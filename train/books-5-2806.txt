I'm not all that familiar with World War One history, so I'm probably not the best judge of this book, but I found it to be an excellent one-volume overview of a conflict so huge and complex that distilling it down to 400 pages must have taken quite a bit of skill. Keegan writes in a very readable (if unexciting) style, and I found his explanation of the causes of the war to be especially interesting and helpful. My biggest complaint was the scarcity of maps, which would have made it significantly easier to understand some of the key battles. He includes quite a few, but when it comes to picturing strategic situations, one extra map can often be worth more than several pages of text.
