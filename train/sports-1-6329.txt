I can't speak for the rest of the nation, but people in NC don't hate Dook because they are good, citizens of this state hate them because: 1. they are white collar 2. their fans move to the triangle from Vermont, New jersey, etc. and immediately think they are a part of this thing of ours........NC fans are born with it in their blood. 3.any crazy would so obviously get their asses stomped in a barfight in Charlotte, Wilmington, etc., and yet they think they are crazy badasses when all us locals know they are calculus nerds. 4. Carolina is called whiners by them, when we remeber Dook demanding apologies from our boys for scaring coach K's wife. 5. they have this swagger like they are totally out of Carolina's league, while their all time record against us is 94 - 123!6.to put it simply, this is our territory, and they are foreign hords............they are who they are because we were here first( think about it). Dook is the crap on our Nikes and our current squad will prove it soon! I don't understand how they lure recruits. If I were some recruit from Chicago or Charlotte that visited Dook, I would see the volvos , the sweaters tied around the necks, the ugly nerdy chicks, the republican atmosphere, and say, hey, Carolina had students who look and think like me, the girls were hot, players who go here turn into stars, folks here are down to earth........know what I mean? Anyway, trust me Dookies, folks in this state don't hate you because you are good. (if that were the case, why did we still hate you in '95 when you sucked?)
