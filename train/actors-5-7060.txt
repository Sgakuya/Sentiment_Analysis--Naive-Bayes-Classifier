Thanks for the insult, UTVOLUSN. Although I thought Owen Wilson was quite good in Shanghai Noon, (can't really comment on Behind Enemy Lines which I have not seen) his talent comes through in obscure little films like Bottle Rocket which he also wrote with Wes Anderson who directed Rushmore. He also wrote with Anderson the brilliant Royal Tenenbaums and they were nominated this year for an Oscar. He steals Zoolander and probably even Meet the Parents from the always bright and funny Ben Stiller. He's a quite a character with a sharp sense of humor, and I look forward to seeing more of him in the future. I also look forward to more work from Mr. Spacey and Mr. Norton. Dustin's been sitting on his butt too long, and Nic Cage hasn't been any good since the 80s (I prefer Dudley Moore's drunk to his in Leaving Las Vegas ). Keanu and Jason Biggs aren't really my type. But thanks for assuming what other actors a fan of Owen Wilson's would like - you're way off the mark, my friend.
