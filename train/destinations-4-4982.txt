Maine is a nice state. Very scenic rocky Atlantic shorline dotted with lighthouses and quaint seaside New England towns. Portland is a nice city with an old colonial feeling downtown with a handful of bistros, pubs, and shops but there really aint much to do there. Acadia National Park is gorgeous. The further north you go in Maine the nicer it gets. Southern Maine is nice but it is becoming way too crowded in the summer and traffic piles up on Route 1 very frequently, especially in Ogunquit. It seems this area is taking in the overflow from New Hampshire for sprawl and development with extended bedroom communities coming up from Boston and soaring real estate prices. Sugarloaf is the best ski area in New England hands down. Also the lakes and forests in the northern half of the state are a great place for recreation, peace, and solitude.
