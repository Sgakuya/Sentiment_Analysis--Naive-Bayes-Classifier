I really enjoyed my time at Cal Poly Pomona. Even though engineering can be a miserable degree to pursue, I still had fun. The campus has horses, pigs, corn fields, and avocado trees on it. There are so many places to explore. My engineering education was practical and useful, unlike the education from most other schools, which is theoretical and somewhat useless. The campus has the beautiful snow-capped San Gabriel mountains behind it. The summers are wonderfully hot. The students in the dormitories are very nice and outgoing. The school also offers a fun tram to take you from the parking lot to other parts of campus. Cal Poly Pomona has some drawbacks (like mandatory meal plans for freshmen in the dorms), but it's better than most schools.
