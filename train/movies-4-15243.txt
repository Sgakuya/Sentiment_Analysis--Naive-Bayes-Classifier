More of a dramedy to me.Robin Williams is great as the soldier they hired to be a dj for the radio for armed american services. Well done movie. he is real funny when he does his radio bits. very good at adlibbing. Yet we see drama and what the horrors are in vietnam. A young teenage vietnamese boy who he becomes friends with is part of a terrorist group that blows up buildings and kills innocent people. {he only finds this out later} He becomes smitten with a young vietnamese woman. a cute scene when he tries and dates her and her whole family comes along to the movies. this movie goes back and forth the some funny scenes yet still reminds us of the war going on there.
