'One Voice' is a superbly put together album. This is one album which not only features one or two good tracks, but 11 excellent tracks which feature beautiful melodies with superb lyrics. Epic got this CD 100% correct. It makes country music accessible to those who do not normally associate with this genre. I tend to think of it as hybrid country music, featuring measures of pop and rock n'roll to stimulate interest in those who can't normally take country music. Billy Gilman has a superb voice, so perfectly suited to country music. I believe such an artist as he, at his age, might be discovered once in a life time. He has a tremendous future and has the endorsement of Nashville icons. I would suggest those young people who are critics are merely envious of his meteoric success. And so what if his songs are not 100% pure country. If they were, he wouldn't have attracted the interest he has, or sold as many CDs. Blame Epic for that, not Billy, they intended a broader audience. Those I know with the album simply do not want to take it out of their CD players. I am pleased to have hosted a radio program for the CD in Australia. Lindsay Emery
