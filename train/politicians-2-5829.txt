I give Pelosi a two, only because I would want my wife to look like that when she's 80. What a tight little body. Mmmmm. But regarding her ultra-Liberal agenda, my only hope is that her kooky ideas will come crashing down on the House Democrats like a house of cards. Honestly, where is the sense of history when it comes to Liberals? America is great not because of massive social programs and wealth redistrubution. America is at her best when we encourage people to innovate and start new businesses. This creates jobs and benefits EVERYONE. Jesus, we're not gonna get anywhere by demonizing rich people and taxing them to death. We might as well change our name to Sweden. Would that make Pelosi happy? And if I hear one more comment about Bush giving tax breaks to the wealthiest one percent I'm gonna blow my stack. Who the hell do you think pays all the taxes in the first place? Give rich people a break. They really help drive this country. Regarding abichara1882's comments on trade with China: I have to disagree. I think America should stand for a prinicpal above all other economic concerns. Thus, I agree with Pelosi in one respect: shut China out of free trade. The Chinese record on human rights is atrocious. They need us more than we need them. Screw 'em. I'm a quarter Chinese but I hate that Commie regime.
