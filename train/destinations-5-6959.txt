Queen of cities, former mistress of the world, golden Rome. Rome is a very interesting place and one of these places where there is always something to see and if you had a lot of time, could take forever to see. Also, like London, a place where the more things change, the more they stay the same. Only interesting modern structures are Termini station (the most efficient train station in the world, also restored and very convienient), and EUR. Then there is the hidden Rome of the Caesars which abruts out of the ground all over the place. Don't miss sites like the little visited Circus of Maxentius out on the Via Appia Attica and many other sites to extensive to mention here.
