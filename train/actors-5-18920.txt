I just watched Crooklyn last night and that reaffirmed my admiration and respect for Spike Lee as a film maker. He has an amazing ability to draw the audience in. I felt for the characters in the movie and found myself laughing and crying..This was a great story (semi-autobiographical) and his techniques make the movie. I like the distorted elongated images he used when Troy went to visit her relatives down South..His directing (and writing) along with an excellent cast of actors mixed in with another great soundtrack make this a movie worth seeing..along with his others Do the Right Thing Son of Sam being two of my other favorites. I don't always agree with Lee's personal statements.. but I do admire his convictions and his talent.
