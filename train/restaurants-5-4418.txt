Definately the best sit-in restaurant I've ever been to. Beats Applebees, Ruby Tuesdays, and Chili's hands down! I always get the No Rules burger with bacon, cheese, and BBQ sauce. Very delicious. The fries that come with the burger are very tasty, too. The portions are a tad large and I often have to bring it home to finish it! The service is pretty good for the most part, as the people can seat you quickly no matter the crowd. The only thing I don't like about the Outback is that the parking at my local restaurant is absolutely horrible, but that can be overlooked because of the awesome food! I've also tried the Curbside Takeaway and is a good alternative to eating in if you so desire.
