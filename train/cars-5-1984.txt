We have had a 5 speed automatic G35 Coupe for 2 months now. Our first decadent car - and it is a thrill each time just to look at it, to hear that engine growl, and to feel the effortless command of the road. Believe every good thing you read about this car, folks. It is a ball to drive - fiercely quick, handles like nobody's business, brakes unbelievable, effortless passing at any speed. Quality build- feels like a tank, excellent warranties, great dealer network. Another plus - with snows all around, this rear wheel drive car is a champ in the snow. Minuses - rear seat has VERY low headroom. Anyone over 5'6 tall will be at the roofline when sitting fully erect. Slumping required if 4 in the car. Very comfortable for 3, however. Seatbealts a bit difficult to reach. Driver's seat very comfortable, but doesn't recline quite enough for my tastes. Overall: Completely thrilled. Makes going to the store for milk fun - what more need be said?
