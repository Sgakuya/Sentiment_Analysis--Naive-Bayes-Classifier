Released in 1990 and directed by John McTiernan, The Hunt For Red October was the first of the Jack Ryan novels by Tom Clancy to be made into a movie. For the uninitiated, the plot involves a super-silent Russian nuclear missile sub that is on its maiden voyage under the command of Capt. Marko Ramius (Sean Connery). Ramius, his First Officer Vasily Borodin (Sam Neill), and the rest of his officers plan to defect to the U.S. and hand over the submarine. Unaware of his intentions, the U.S. determines that Ramius has gone renegade, sending out the navy to sink her while the Russians (aware of the defection attempt) are out to get the sub as well. On the other hand, Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin) believes that Ramius is defecting and must prove it before the fireworks begin. There is nothing really special about this Cold War themed film save for the performances of the aforementioned cast (especially Connery) as well as Scott Glenn who plays the opposing American submarine captain, James Earl Jones, and Richard Jordan. The bottom line is that The Hunt For Red October is a big budget political action thriller which is better than most due to production and acting.
