Iverson makes the quickest guards in the NBA (i.e. Travis Best, Damon Stoudamire, and--arguably--Michael Jordan Himself) look clumsy and inept on both ends of the court. He has issues to work out with Larry Brown, apparently, but I say that if someone has to go it should be Brown. I'll still be the first to say that Brown, Iverson and owner Croce are the best things to happen to the Sixers franchise since the days of Erving and Mo Cheeks. Trading Iverson, even if it's for a great player like Grant Hill, as papers have hinted, would bring flashbacks of the devestating Barkley trade--a trade that still sends shivers down my spine.
