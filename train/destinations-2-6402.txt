I've had the misfortune of living in the northeastern part of the state for over 2 years now, and I can tell you,that it may be beautiful but BORING and NARROW MINDED. Yes, there is mountains, but there's LOTS of places that have mountains. And the wages are PATHETIC. Yeah, if you want to enjoy country quiet, go ahead, but if you want to struggle in the process - well I sure am not going to! And I grew up in New England, which is very diverse and very open-minded. It must be the over-push on religion but most folks here are VERY one-dimentionsal in the way they look at things and life in general. I will be SO glad the day I move here and go to more open-minded, fun pastures. Write to me at TropicalGreen2@aol.com if you want to add comments.
