i have a 95 grand cherokee with 183,000 miles on it. i purchased it at about 125,000 miles after the transmission had been dealer replaced. after reading a lot about grand cherokees from people familiar with the product, i understand that it is not entirely unreasonable for the tranny to fail at over a hundred thousand (often when it is abused). i am in total agreement that the in line 6 motor is outstanding in its reliability, performance and fuel efficiency. i drive about 800 miles per week or more in often extreme desert heat conditions. this vehicle has performed remarkably in very harsh driving conditions. yes sometimes components fail, but this vehicle is entirely worth every penny i ever put in to it. one day i will happily replace the motor rather than buy an s.u.v. that is bloated in price, not broken in and probably would be a gas hog if it had any size at all. this is the absolute best vehicle i have ever owned and is the perfect size for carrying loads and using for a work vehicle. the outside tire rack is much much better than the full size spare inside for storage reasons. i have had an annoying problem with the lower radiator hose where it won't seal quite completely.. but it is fine when the temperature gets below 100. this vehicle has climbed hills with a full load (note: the overdrive off button is for hill climbing) in 115 degree temperatures and performed perfect. a final note: drive easy on your vehicle, there is a lot of weight and mass and friction and pressure combining with environmental forces and bad driving habits that will destroy your vehicle and often quite soon. take care of it, it will take care of you.
