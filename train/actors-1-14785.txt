Jennifer Lopez does have 2 redeeming values: 1) She continues to associate with the right, career-boosting people in Hollywood (Think Puffy, now Ben Affleck! When Michael Douglas gets tired of Catherine Zeta-Jones, it won't be a surprise if J.Lo steps up to take her place.) 2) She hired a busy publicist who knows how to capitalize on her 'non-white/non-black race' to keep her standing out, marketable, and fascinating to the mainstream impressionable audience. (This 'race' thing is what other A-list female celebs do not have going for them, why you can't even begin to imagine the so-much-more-gorgeous Cameron Diaz successfully having a platinum CD, considering that she's a skilled dancer as well and could probably sing just as good or better (My Best Friend's Wedding karaoke was just an act)) Besides these 2 savvy networking business skills, she's really got no unique, special talents as a performer. But hey, more power, whatever it takes to make you rich and popular, because that's what it's all about these days.
