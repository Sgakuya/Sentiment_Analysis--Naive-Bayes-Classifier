I cannot belive that this wonderful city is so far back. You people are so dangerously stereotypical of the South. Atlanta has so much to do (I would know, I live for part of the year kind of near it). I've got five bucks for anyone who can honestly say that every single one of you who gave Atlanta one star hbhave been there. There's always the occasional Braves game to go to...or if your just not a baseball fan, you can check out the Falcons (football) the Hawks (basketball) or the Beat (women's soccer). And Atlanta is the home of Fairbank Museum, a fascinating little center with a lot of science related stuff, so if you're a chemistry nut, check it out. If you want nature, Atlanta has plenty of that. Atlanta is probably the least religious, the least rednecky city in the state. There are plenty of liberals here. Outside of metroAtlants, the people who prefer peace and quiet can get away from the noise and bustle...and not far away there's little Dunwoody, my hometown, and the closest I'll ever get to heaven. Dunwoody is a magical place. So Atlanta and Georgia (my home and home to R.E.M too) get *****FIVE*****stars! Take care, everyone!
