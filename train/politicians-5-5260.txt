I am an Al Gore supporter. I think people should have looked at the candidates records before voting. I think people should look hard at Texas-polution, bad educational policies (TAAS testing), and environmental practice. Most of all I think people should have been aware and focused on the fact that George Bush is govenor of a state with the lowest wages in the country, San Antonio, particularly because of the high rate of Hispanics. I think it was an outrage that he tried speaking Spanish to fool the Hispanic votors. I think it is shocking that he is so contradicting with his beliefs and that the people think a person who drives irresponsibly, under the influence of alcohol as an adult will bring morality to the white house. I think the only thing it tells our teenagers is it is better to drink than to lie or have sex or it is better to deny it and not get caught... Alls we can do is pray.
