Sirius Executives, Howard... SOMEONE Please take note of the customer service problems and get them fixed. I just purchased my second Sirius system for my wife's car. I have had to call customer service 3 times and all three times the customer service was mind blowing. I heard cursing when the rep. thought he was muted. "son of a bitch this guy!" ,he said. I just asked how to change the frequency on my Sirius hardware. He simply could not understand what I was asking and then he became just plain rude and mean. I own stock in your company,(Heck, I talked my Father into buying stock in Sirius) I believe in your product, and I enjoy the programming much more than any other service currently offered. But if the programming were on somewhere else I would leave. Again, take note of these serious customer service issues and get them fixed. I am certain anyone reading this that works for Sirius is well aware of what I am talking about.
