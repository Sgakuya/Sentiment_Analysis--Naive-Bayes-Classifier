As a Conservative Democrat, I really admire John McCain as a man and as a Senator. This man is a hero of mine for his loyal and brave service during the Vietnam War- and I do mean brave (see Aurielle's comment). He has alienated many members of his own party by supporting campaign finance reform and is not afraid to makethe American people aware of pork-barell bills that simply are a waste of taxpayer's money. He is also one of the leading advocates for the rights of Native Americans. In the last Senatorial election, he gained 40% of the Democratic vote. He is more centric than some of the other right-wing radicals out there.
