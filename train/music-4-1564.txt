i love this band, and it saddens me that such a commercial, over-hyped compliation is released, honestly on adverts things like the band that changed the world- what a load of rubbish. It lacks alot, for instance there is only one song here from there first album bleach the love song about a girl, and crucial tracks from their career are missing, namely polly. but as for the songs that are here the new you know your right shows exactly how much was wrong with kurt, you only need to hear the grinding, churning chorus with its one word pain stated over and over. elsewhere the four Nevermind singles are a vivid reminder of the sucess of nevermind, and 'teen spirit is as exciting as ever. five of the best from In Utero show that there was far more to cobains songwriting than anyone cared to guess. the excellent pennyroyal tea and satire of rape me -these were among his best, and the gripping heart shaped box and splendour of all apologies were better even than smells like... good enough for nirvana, on reflection it is a tragedy that a songwriter with such potential is gone. a great finishing song in where did you sleep last night?
