This is probably the best American city that I have been to. As far as, scenic beauty, San Francisco is gourgeous with nicely designed concrete building, intricate and cultured sub-sections of the city and plenty of art museums. Good place to shop as well. Great moderate climate but a little too foggy. The restaurants are probably right along there with New York, but even more consistently good, rather than hit or miss. For a visit, prepare to take plenty of picture as the city offers tons of incredible visuals. The only thing that disappointed me was the club scene, which after hearing rave reviews, seemed lacking in energy. San Francisco can be little expensive but it is worthy of the 'dough'. People are friendly and laid-back. This place does not seem to have New York's 'toughness' or 'hustle-and-bustle'. Reminds me personally more of Montreal, Toronto or somewhere in Europe.
