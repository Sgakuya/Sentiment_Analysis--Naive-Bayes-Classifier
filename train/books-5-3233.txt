Straub's slow and deliberate pacing of this fine ghost story make it one of the best books I've read in years. A group of older men re-live some hauntings in their past, and have decided that the supernatural goings-on in their small town are lonked and must be stopped. Straub really scared me in several different places with Ghost Story and that's hard to do. His writing style allows the horror to creep up on you, and he is adept at blurring the line between reality and dreamlike unreality. Straub tells stories that force you to slow down and absorb each paragraph. I don't know how he does it, but his writing style really does prevent you from reading too quickly. Ghost Story is a masterpiece.
