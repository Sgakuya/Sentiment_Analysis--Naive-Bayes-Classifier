Wegman's is a fantastic store in almost every way, except that I find the layout to be a bit confusing. The quality and variety of products is great... especially fresh foods like cheese, gourmet items, prepared dishes, baked goods, meat, deli, and produce. Some of the gourmet items are pricey, but not outrageous considering the quality. The service is excellent. The store is beautiful. The only complaint I have is that the store is very large and too spread out. You may have to visit 3 or 4 seperate departments to see one type of item. For example, breads are located in 3 different areas of the store. If they simplify the layout, I'll give 'em 5 Stars.
