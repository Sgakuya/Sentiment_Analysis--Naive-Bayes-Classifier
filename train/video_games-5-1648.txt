This is a recent import to Western countries from Japan. They are gaining in popularity in the UK and I am sure they will be very popular in the USA. The idea is simple - just arrange the numbers 1-9 in each box, row and column so that no number is repeated. The easier sudokus start you off with more numbers filled in, the more difficult with fewer. Just try some of the easier ones, and it will get you hooked. The first day I started doing them, I could not stop and ended up trying to solve one while running on the treadmill. What appeals to me about these puzzles is that, theoretically, a kid could solve them too. You need no mathematical or word skills - just a clear mind.
