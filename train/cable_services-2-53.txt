As a former Comcast customer for many years until we went the way of over 10 million DirecTV subscribers, I must say their service was a cable customer's worst nightmare come true. It took many years for the basic channel package to reach at least CH 70 from about 40, according to my earliest memory. As the years went by, it happened! The price in our bill skyrocketed into the $80 range, which remained until our final bill. We were that close to loosing cable until we decided to go DirecTV. With DirecTV soon to be installed in the next few days, we didn't even bother paying Comcast's bill. A few weeks later, the cable guy from Comcast came by to cut off the service and the rest was history. I wonder if that fellow ever noticed something different about our means of viewing television? If you're looking for a quality cable service, don't mess with Comcast.
