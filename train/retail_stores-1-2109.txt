Radio Shack advertised a personal DVD player with two "ONE-DAY only" rebates, December 23, 2005. Because the combination of rebates resulted in an exceptionally low price, many consumers called Radio Shack's Rebate Center to verify that the rebates were legitimate. After being told that both rebates would be honored, many people bought the DVD players and of course gave them as gifts. About a week later, Radio Shack cancelled the rebates and refused to honor the rebates, claiming the one rebate had EXPIRED (but they were both valid only December 23). ABC News in Philadelphia detailed the story of the company's refusal to honor its own offer; see http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=local&id=3796403. After this story, in which RS offered to honor both rebates for customers who "can prove they called and got bad information", the company STILL refused to honor the rebates. They posted a false advertisement to lure customers into their stores 2 days before Christmas, lied to their own consumers about the validity of the rebates, and then lied to the media about their intention to make good on the deal. STAY AWAY!
