Frogger, a game of survival of the fittest! This particular frog must survive all from dangers out there for a creature of his size, such as cars, trucks, logs, and even turtles can even turn on him if he stays on the shell too long. That's right, a frog's life is just like ours, just trying to survive all the obstacles of daily life and even trying to survive to reach that place called home. Very interesting metaphor this game hides, don't you think? It is to me and that metaphor continues right to this day after being resurrected for the Playstation and PC. The first in the Frogger resurrection remained true to the original released long ago, but as the sequels went on, it was about time to give this frog a retirement plan. Yep, all the constant swishing from just trying to survive should definitely give these folks a clue.
