I love Portland. It's downtown is very inviting and very clean. I never would have thought Portland would be a good dining city but surprisingly the food is great here! For such a small city it has surprising ammenities like the light rail, different neighborhoods with their own character, and outstanding parks. Spring is the best time to be here when the roses are in bloom and the Japanese gardens here are outstanding. Portland has funky vibe with a lot of bookstores and coffee shops. Check out Powells Bookstore, said to be one of the largest in the country, good place to kill a few hours. The only downside to this city is it has very ugly indutsrial areas (but I guess that's an economic neccessity)and as many others stated the finding a good job here can be a challenge to say the least. People here are kinda strange on par with the grungey Seattle vibe but I do find it a bit more friendly than Seattle. Also like Seattle the weather is boring and gray much of the year but summers are gorgeous here.
