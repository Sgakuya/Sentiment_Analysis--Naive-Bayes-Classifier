I ve been living in Chile for two months now as an AFS exchange student before that I knew a girl living in Santiago for almost a year, so I should know more about the country than most others. First: The most fantastic with this country is the very open-minded human beings who live there! :-) For the first time in many years I m actually enjoying being at school! The worst with Chile is the water cuality (with a lot of clorid, witch Chilean think makes the water 'clean tasty') most of the food, except 'empanadas' 'pastel de choclo' (maiz cake). And a shock I got: Santiago is extremely polutioned, a lot more than any other city I ve visited! Now I understand why most environmentalists live in metropols! Beside the people, the nature is fantastic too, from the driest desert in the world, to some of the highest mountains, where you among other things can go rafting, snowboarding paragliding! :-)
