When I walked into a Best Buy for the first time, I knew I'd found my new favorite place to buy stereos, speakers, appliances, music, computers, etc. I hate dealing with pushy salespeople, so the fact that Best Buy is more self-service-oriented is big for me. If I have questions, I can find someone to help me, but otherwise I'm left alone to shop by myself. And the other major advantage of shopping at Best Buy is that they almost always have the lowest prices. It's extremely rare that I buy something at Best Buy and then see it advertised for less somewhere else. In fact, I don't think that's ever happened. About a year ago I bought a laptop computer there that turned out to be defective, and they replaced it right away, no questions asked. The selection is great, you're not attacked by predatory sales people, it's easy to return things, and the prices are low. What else do you want?
