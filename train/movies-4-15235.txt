Typically I wouldn't be caught dead watching a sappy movie such as this, but I found myself sitting with my mother one day watching this, and I loved it. I laughed and I cried. Rarely do I enjoy movies as sappy and romantic as this, but I just found Jack Nicholson's charming performance irresistable. The characters were all very well rounded and developed, and I think that each character in the script underwent a heavy change, whether it be Garret's admittance to loving someone or Aurora's letting go of her somewhat snobbish attitude. I thought that everyone did a fine acting job, espescially Nicholson and McClane. If oyu do not cry while watching this movie, then you have absolutely no emotion.
