I am an employ at McDonalds, and I do not agree with some of these ratings, evidently I work at a really great McDonalds. We do throw our food away after it expires, once something touches a foreign object out it goes, we get really good ratings and hardley no complaints. There are a few things that is wrong, but nothing that could harm customer..I eat there, now how many employs actually eat at where they work? McDonalds works great with my scheadule, and since I'm a college student they repay my tuition...I've been working at the same McDonalds since I was 16 and hopefully I will be working there until I'm out of college.Thanks McDonalds.
