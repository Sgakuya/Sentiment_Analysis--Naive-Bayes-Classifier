a 2.5. A very strange movie. a woman is about to be married. ten years earlier her husband dies jogging in a park. at the same time a boy is born. this boy now 10 appears at her door telling her not to marry since he is her reincarnated husband.we spend the rest of the movie trying to determine if this is true or not.The plot is very odd for one thing. the part that was hard is most of the characters are not even likable. I could have cared less for almost all of them. even the the Woman{played by Nicole Kidman} I do not feel all that bad for.the guy she is about to marry has the personality of a lump of clay and one must wonder what she sees in him.Of course we find the truth at the end.some good acting saves is from being rated as horrible the movie itself is just too strange.
