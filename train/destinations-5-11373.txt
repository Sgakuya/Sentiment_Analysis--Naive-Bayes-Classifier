I can't believe I lived in San Francisco for over a year before visiting Yosemite. People fly in from all over the world to see this place, and there I was, only a three-hour drive away, lazy and ignorant. I'm so glad I finally made the trip. Yosemite has some of the most amazing rock formations I've ever seem. The views from the valley are spectacular - huge sheer rock faces shooting up all around you, a long, lazy mountain stream, and some of the highest waterfalls in the world. The downside is that Yosemite is one of the most heavily trafficked national parks, so it pays to go in the off-season, or at least avoid the weekends if you have to be there in the summer. I went in October, and the crowds were very manageable. I camped in the valley one night and up on the edge one night, and enjoyed both places, although spending some time in the valley is a must. The hike that takes you to Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls is excellent.
