Simply the best WR in my opinion. PLaying 20 years or past your prime will take anyone's game away from them so that is not an excuse to what he did year in and year out (minus the injury year). Some people think Moss or Marvin Harrison will surpass Rice. It's possible, but honestly only Marvin Harrison has a chance out of today's players that are on that path simply because everything that has to do with being able to reach the levels that Rice set are in place with Harrison. He has the conditioning, mental attitude, commitment, talent, intelligence and the players around him, namely a great QB in Manning....Rice always had a QB on the top of their game (Montana, Young, Gannon) and even when catching passes from backup QB's, Rice made them look good when most weren't. Moss don't have a chance simply because of his poor work ethic and attitude and no reciever that relies on speed will ever touch Rice's records because when you turn 33 and up, speed/Stamina will be gone 99% of time and when your speed or stamina is gone, you won't be getting 1000 yards, 10 TD's, 80+ catches a year. Jerry Rice was simply exceptional from rookie to the day he retired. He not only did it for himself, but also for the players around him. When you speak of what a wide-reciever should possess, Jerry Rice had every aspect of that and pushed it to new levels. Bottom line, if any of today's recievers want to be great and take Rice's place in the Hall of fame, they should learn from what rice did just as Rice learned from Steve Largent.
