Job performance-wise, which is truly what really counts, Bill Clinton was one of the BEST Presidents we've ever had, period. Who cares about what he did with an intern on the side! How many more past Presidents in both parties had mistresses or short lived flings that never got caught, and performed their job duties responsibly? Besides, if anything, maybe a nice BJ from Ms. Lewinsky helped Bill deal with the great stress of his job much better. Maybe Bill's marriage was 'on the rocks' and Hillary was being 'less of a wife' to him than when he first got married. Frankly, it's none of our business! What I wish to judge about Bill Clinton is his OVERALL JOB PERFORMANCE, and in short, he was a stellar President. He helped unite this country with his articulate, youthful vigor and diplomacy. He was extremely well-liked and personable. He oversaw one of the greatest economic expansions the United States has EVER seen. The list goes on. The whole Monica Lewinsky scandal and outing was just a desperate ploy by RepubliCONS grasping at straws to gain a political 'come-uppance'. Thankfully, many intelligent Americans saw through this 'smokescreen/diversionary politics', and will judge William Jefferson Clinton for what he truly was. That is, a highly effective well-liked President who made this country PROUD!
