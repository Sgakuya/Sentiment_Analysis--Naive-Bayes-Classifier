I shop at Kroger's only because it is one of 2 grocery stores in our town and the other is even higher priced than Kroger's. (Scott's) They give us a Kroger Plus card then raise the prices so that they can say that they're saving us money-do they think we're so stupid we don't notice? I can tell that the employees are not happy there. Once I went through a line and the cashier was even crying-none of the managers came to take her place so she could pull herself together. When will management realize that happy emplyees mean happy and return customers? There is a Super Wal-mart 25 miles from here, during nice weather that's where I'll be shopping. It's worth the drive-even with the price of gas I'll come out ahead. Wal-mart has better selection, better prices and they always have what they say is on sale in stock.
