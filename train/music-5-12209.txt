LET ME SAY THIS IS THE BEST FRESHMAN EFFORT SINCE DAVE HOLLISTER'S GHETTO HYMNS. THIS IS A BAD BROTHER LYRICALLY AND VOCALLY. AS A FELLOW ARTIST ASPIRING TO MAKE IT IN A BUSINESS WHERE TALENT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER ANYMORE, I'M GLAD TO SEE SOME REAL TALENT GET IN. CARL THOMAS MAKES YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM WITHOUT KNOWING HIM. IF THIS ALBUM IS A PEEK INTO HIS SOUL, THEN I'M A PEEPING TOMASINA (LYNN). WHO ELSE TODAY SOUNDS LIKE SCOTTIE FROM THE WHISPERS, SAM COOKE, WITH THE INTENSITY IN SOME SONGS OF DONNY HATHAWAY. LIKE ME I'M A YOUNG PERSON WITH AN OLD SOUL, IF CARL'S LOOKING FOR A MATCH, I'M HIS FEMALE COUNTERPART. ALL THE BEST TO YOU CARL AS YOU CONTINUE ON YOUR JOURNEY TO FAME AND FORTUNE. BY THE WAY, I WAS AT YOUR SOB'S PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS THE APPRECIATION SERVICE FOR A CERTAIN RECORD EXEC AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOSPEL OR R B YOU ARE ALL THAT!
