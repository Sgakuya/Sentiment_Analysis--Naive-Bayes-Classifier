Des Moines has a very good economy. I wouldnt be suprised if it is in a magazine article, because the economy is growing so fast. Last time I was in Des Moines the construction cranes were out in full-force, it was kind of like Denver during an oil boom 20 years ago. As soon as you hit the Polk County line the office parks filled with insurance companies hit you and bombard you into Downtown Des Moines where lots of tall buildings sit. Des Moines downside is its boring, but with the good economy you can take the 5 hour drive to Chicago on the weekends for entertainment. Here are some economic facts on Des Moines 4 percent payroll growth (November 2003-2004) and a 13 percent increase in construction payroll jobs. Amazing town for jobs!!
