Lets face it good charlotte is another wannabe punk band created by evil corporate idiots who care less about music and only care about making money. The whole punk image thing is only a facade and a fake because they sing pop songs. The album itself shows really no depth whatsoever and is very shallow,childish and predictable and is nowhere near actual punk music.But on the lighter note if you enjoy pop music with catchy beats or clean radio ready so called punk-pop than Good Charlotte is a perfect choice for you. I just wish GC would stop pretending and admit they are nothing but a mainstream boy band that sing pop music.
