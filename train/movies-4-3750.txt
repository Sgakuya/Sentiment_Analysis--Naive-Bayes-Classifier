Starring Carl Weathers as Jericho Action Jackson, Action Jackson is a solid 80s action flick, providing plenty of action and many comedic moments along the way. While I sometimes found some of the one-liners in the film to be cheesy, overall the film mixes comedy and action perfectly (although not nearly to the level of Tango & Cash or Lethal Weapon). Craig T. Nelson does a decent job as the corrupt (and murderous) business tycoon who is out to buy off or kill off his opponents. A solid supporting cast backs Weathers and Nelson up. There are several good action scenes in this film, all leading up to the good fight scene between Weathers and Nelson at the end of the film. Overall, Action Jackson is an above average 80s action flick that is quick, funny at times, and filled with action.
