This place makes me physically sick! I have spent almost $10,000 with them and they can't even fix any of my jewelry!! I purchased, necklaces, bracelets, rings & earings (all diamonds!) and my husband bought our wedding set there. One of my white gold rings turned yellow after just 1 month and they want to charge me to fix it and they will send it off for that - heck no - my wedding set came back looking WAY different after it was sized! Too bad I didn't notice after the 1st piece - maybe because I didn't wear it often. The employees no nothing - none the less enough english to understand my fricken complaint! Wow, aren't there any humans anymore?
