The only baseball team whose history reads like a Dostoevsky novel. Except that if old Fyodor tried to write this stuff, no one would believe it. Baseball has some proud franchises. But the Boston Red Sox are not a franchise. They're an alternative lifestyle. And if that weren't enough, Red Sox fans tend to be bigger students of the game of baseball than any other fans. The conversations heard at Fenway Park are like nothing you'll hear outside New England. Fans understand WHY players make the decisions they do, and they know when a player has made even a modest mental error. They know the rules and strategy of the game better than some of the players they're watching. In a region where almost everyone gets a college education, and an only slightly smaller percentage are rabid about baseball, I suppose it stands to reason. Add to that a charming and noisy if run-down museum of a ballpark, and you pretty much have the ultimate baseball experience.
