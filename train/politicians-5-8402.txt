Reagan was the best President in my 53 years. Carter had to be the worst. When I was a child, I had to do the duck and cover in class and be afraid of being vaporized at any moment. For decades I watched as president after president tried to deal with the Communists, only to be bluffed out time and time again. Kennedy had the chance and the timing to make them back down, but stopped short. He didn't give air support to the Bay of Pigs invasion to cause the problems we had later. If I have learned anything in the years I have watched international affairs, its don't commit unless you are willing to go all the way, even nuclear. Most enemies look forward to the US backing down from them. They see diplomacy as weakness. Bush-1 should have gone into Bagdad the first time, but the UN said we had no mandate for that. Once you commit troops and shed blood, there should be no half measures. Reagan knew this and the Russians were scared of him. They knew he wasn't crazy, but that he meant what he said. They were used to making deals and getting at least most of what they wanted. Reagan didn't blink. Reagan will go down in history as one of the greatest presidents because of his fortitude and idealism.
