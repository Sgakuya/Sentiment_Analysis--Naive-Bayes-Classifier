Who cares if you like his personality or not. What makes him a jerk and Joe DiMaggio classy? They're the same, so make up your mind. And it was because of that personality flaw that he was kept off of the All Century team, so that's not a good argument. And besides, that was in 99. In the last 4 years he's become even greater. He's about to win his 3rd MVP since then, which will give him 6. Twice as many as anyone else and he SHOULD have 8. He also holds the single-season record for most home runs and won a batting title at the age of 38 hitting .370. As Sparky Anderson once said, he may be the greatest defensinve leftfielder of all time. He hits for average and power and plays marvelous defense. Oh yeah, he can steal bases, too. One of 3 40/40 players, ONLY 500/500 player and a perenial 30/30 threat in his hey day. He's not only the greatest player you can see today, he's maybe the greatest of all time. He at least deserves consideration.
