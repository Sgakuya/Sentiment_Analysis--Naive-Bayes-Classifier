I made the mistake of hiring these guys for a cross-country move. They showed up with my stuff nearly two weeks late, but not before completely demolishing a desk. While I was sitting in my empty apartment waiting for them, I was repeatedly lied to about where my belongings were, and I was assured I'd be compensated. Of course, no compensation was forthcoming. I was handed off from one incompetent, lying customer service office to another for several months until they just started ignoring my phone calls and letters. They also ignored Better Business Bureau inquiries. These guys are crooks, and they have dozens of ways of screwing people over. DON'T USE THIS MOVING COMPANY! Avoid moving companies in general, if possible. As much of a headache as it may be to do it yourself, it's better than dealing with these people.
