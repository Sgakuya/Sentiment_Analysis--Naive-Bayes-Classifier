I lived in Jaco for three years. Costa Rica isn;t about the volcanoes and surfing. It is a way of life that I feel I experienced with acceptance and love. I understand not everybody can do what I did. But I did what I did and I explored a culture that is very diverse and I think less stressful and loving and natural thsn a North American can fully appreciate until they live there. Not in an airconditioned room on the beach but a real home with real food and real tico style. I wish I never left. I only came back here because I needed to find myself. I didn't have any money while I lived there. Yeah try that.. you don't know the beauty of living day to day until you di it. People live and love and go on and on without investment corporations or Walmart or enevelectricity. I would be there in a flash and leave this life behind again if I could. But I got caught in love here. I will never again be free in Costa Rica. But I will never forget that mystic land and its green green beauty.
