I don't support the firing of Jim O'Brien. He didn't get along with the Philly Press? Who cares, he won ten more games then the year before and led the team back to the playoffs. Sam Dalembert was mad about his playing time? Who cares - that's just a clueless 23 year old just learning the game. Rocking the boat again in Philly after they finally were buying into a new system just doesn't make any sense to me. **Jim O'Brien has taken an unbelievable amount of heat from the Philadelphia media, including Stephen A. Smith calling for his firing with about two weeks left in the season. Of course, what Stephen A. missed in his analysis is that the Sixers won 10 more games than last year, won 8 of their final 10, and qualified for the playoffs for the first time since Larry Brown was here (another coach that Stephen A. tried to run out of town). I think O'Brien has done a good job, especially when you consider he was introducing a whole new system. Unfortunately for him and the Sixers, Detroit is the worst possible first round match up.
