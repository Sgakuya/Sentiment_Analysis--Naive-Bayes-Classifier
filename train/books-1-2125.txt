Rubbish. Sure, have a comic about politics. Sure, use it to criticise the Bush administration. I have no problem with that. But why use children? There's no disconnect: Peanuts was funny because the characters would engage in adult thought processes but still were children with all their fears and little successes. But the Boondocks characters are just complaining adults, drawn as children. They never do anything but comment on politics or watch press conferences, then leave us with a smart ass line. So, each day has the same message and the strips merge inexorably. Mr. MacGruder, why not have them behave like children every so often? And I hate the style of drawing.
