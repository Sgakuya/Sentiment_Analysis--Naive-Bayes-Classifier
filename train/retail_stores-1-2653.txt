I started working at Kroger right before thanksgiving and filled out all of my paperwork on my first day. As soon as thanksgiving was over they said they didn't need me anymore. I went to get my first check and they said they didn't have one and for me to come back next week. I came back the following week(on a thursday) and they said I still didn't get a paycheck. They said I didn't fill out all of my paperwork. I told them that I filled it out on my first day. They said they lost it. So I went back the following thursday and guess what, they still didn't have one. They told me that my paperwork was turned in on tuesday of that week. Not true I filled it out thursday of the previous week. They do that to a lot of employees. I am so glad I do not work there anymore. Also their prices are high.
