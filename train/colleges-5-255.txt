I'm in my first MBA class at the University of Phoenix, and it is great. After being out of school for nine years, the classroom setting is priceless. Anytime change comes to the world people initially criticize because it is not traditional. This society is not traditional anymore with the advances in technology etc... . The University of Phoenix programs are on the cutting edge of different forms of learning, and is where the future is headed. University of Phoenix graduates will be the new business leaders soon, so we all better adapt and position ourselves for the present and near future. The old business world is dying with scandal and corruption. I would recommend U of P to anyone who wants to be challenged and forced to dialogue with others and grow.
