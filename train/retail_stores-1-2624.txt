These comments are about the SFW in Woodbridge, VA. The first item on my list is the lack of quality of the meat department. They consistently put out meats that are at, or very near their expiration date. Yesterday, I could not find a package of pork chops that was not due to expire on the following day's date. Most meats, especially beef, is very highly overpriced for such poor quality - meats that are turning green and brown are still at prices other grocers charge for quality meats. Pricing is opportunistic -- if an item sells well, you can be assured that the price will be higher the next time you shop. Also, availability of lower priced items is a big concern: I prefer to buy Gwaltney brand sausage, but it has been all but pulled from the shelf, replaced with more expensive brands. On to the Dairy case, where eggs are anything but fresh! Nothing else need be said, as that speaks volumes about the business practices of SFW if they willingly stock dairy products that are nearing spoilage. I love Dijon mustard, but the Richfood brand, that sold for approximately one third of the name brand, was pulled from the shelf. The manager lied to me, saying that they could not get the Richfood product any more. So now I buy the Giant store brand, and am very happy. I consistently purchased calamata olives from the deli, usually one pound a week, with the price high at $5.95 per pound. Then, the olives disappeared. After months of complaining, the olives were finally brought back, but are now at $6.78 per pound. I feel the price was raised unfairly, and was the last straw. I know how much the calamata olives cost in bulk, and it is nowhere the price that would require such a steep jump in price. Additionally, the produce is old, overpriced, and handled very roughly and with no regard for health regulations. I personally witnessed an employee sweep up cherries that had been spilled onto the floor, then put them back into the bin for sale, still covered with dirt from the floor. I brought that matter to the attention of management, but did not see management do anything to correct the situation or remove the cherries from sale until washed. My largest complaint is that there are no telephone numbers, no (valid) e-mail addresses, and no physical addresses for complaints listed on their website. They clearly don't want to hear from their customers, sending a very clear message that they just don't give a damn about the products they sell or the customers that have to consume their overpriced, rotten food!
