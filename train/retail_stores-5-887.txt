Well, the times that I have been in a Lane Bryant store with my Best friend, I have noticed that they are catering to a younger look. Personally, I wouldn't mind looking a little younger, nor would most women. I certainly don't think that Lane Bryant is the place to outfit yourself with a work wardrobe but that doesn't mean that they have a poor selection. In fact, just about every large persons store I have been in seem to want to cater to the working man or woman. In my opinion, Lane Bryant is one of the few stores who recognizes that large people have a socail life too. I applaud them in venturing out to make clothes that don't look like burlap bags!
