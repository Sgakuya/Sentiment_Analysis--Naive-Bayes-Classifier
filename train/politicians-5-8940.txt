A simply awesome president with amazing intelligence and 2nd to none communication skills. To all the holier than thou stiffs out there-what a person does in his personal life is entirely his own business provided that his acts (a) don't financially burden the country(eg dole-bludging) or harm others(eg wife-beating, crack dealing). Clinton's so called 'dispicable' acts did none of these hence he was fully entitled to lie to time/money wasting, sanctimonous investigators(like Starr) about them. Thanks also Bill for your assistance in, among other things, improving the economy, difusing a potentially disasterous situation in Kosovo and helping broker peace in N Ireland
