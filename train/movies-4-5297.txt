I liked this movie it was well done. It is about Dorothy who gets caught up in her house during a tornado which drifts her away to this land and it fell down on the wicked witches sister and Glinda the good witch put the ruby slippers from that witch on her to protect her from the wicked witch while she goes down the yellow brick road to see the wizard to ask him to send her home and on the way she meets a scarecrow,tinman, and the cowardly lion who join her to ask for something from the wizard themselves but on her way she has to deal with the wicked witch when they finally make it to the wizard he tells them he will grant their wishes ONLY if they get the wicked witches broom. When they go back to the wizard the scarecrow aked for the brain he wanted , and the tinman asked for his heart he wanted , and the cowardly lion asked for the nerve he wanted, and Dorothy of course asked for home. It was a very good movie and a unforgetable ending.
