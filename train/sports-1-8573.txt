I can not stand Kobe Bryant now let me say I am not hating on him I just think that he is the most annoying player that ever existed! Lets first start with the fact that everything Kobe does he got from JORDAN!!!!! He can never be Jordan! He can never be what he was!!!! I mean everyone blows him up to be something he is not....lets all remember that there are other GREAT players on the Lakers not just Kobe, he is a ball hog....I mean is it really required that every time you make a hot that you have to get all cocky....ok you made a shot big deal guess what I can make a shot to!!!!! I just can not stand him...he is a ball hog and selfish...the bad thing is his wife is just a cocky as he is....lets get realy why is she really with him......I wish that Kobe could get a wake-up call!!! Bottom Line HE WILL NEVER BE JORDAN!!!!! He needs to get his own game!
