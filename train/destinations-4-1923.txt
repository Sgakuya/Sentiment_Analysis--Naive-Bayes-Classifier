I've lived my whole life in the United States and I really like my country. As a female, I love living in a country where I know I am entitled to a good education, that I don't have to put up with an abusive husband or boyfriend, that I can choose to end a pregnancy (not that I personally would have an abortion), that I can get a good job and support my family, that I can own my own property, and that I can be free to do what I want without living in fear. The US of A isn't perfect, I can admit that. We have our problems and have done some crummy stuff. But what country is perfect? USA is good enough for me.
