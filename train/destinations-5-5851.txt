I think New Jersey is actually a very nice, lovely state. The forests are beautifal, the people are nice (most of the time) and it has a lot of history. Me and my 2 friends were once biking down a road at night and 1 of my friends fell. Someone came up to us and helped my friend up, and I got help. And yes, this was in Jersey. The air is actually pretty clean in most areas. It doesnt smell. It's just different from other states. Its something you have to get use to. I run cross country and track for my school in northern jersey and I have asthma, and i'm fine, and I am not having an asthma attack when I cross that finnish line. New Jersey has a lot of history too. Take a look at the northern valley in northern new jersey. Towns like Closter and Fort Lee have a long line of history. Without NJ, we probably would have not one the revolutionary war. New Jersey is a melting pot of many races and religions. Thats what I like about Jersey. Our accent is also very normal, along with NY. Like for exacmple... We say two as too compared to other states that say twooo. Some people may be rude in NJ, but that doesn't mean the majority is. Im proud to be from Jersey! (srry... just had to say that)
