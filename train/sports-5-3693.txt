With out a doubt the greatest position player of all time. Impossible plays were just a days work for him. Balls other players would look stupid going after he gobbled up with seemingly little effort and throw across his body like no bodies business. His ability to charge a ground ball and bare-hand it was pure magic to watch. And while his bat may not indicate high status, he got hits when they mattered most. In the 1966 World Series the Baltimore Orioles blew away the Dodgers in 4 straight games with the awesome hitting and fielding Brooks Robinson. In 1970 the Big Red Machine proved to be no match for an Orioles team set on avenging '69's loss to the Mets. The Birds took the Series 4-1 for their second title behind the MVP play of Brooks Robinson who made several plays for the ages at third and batted .429.
