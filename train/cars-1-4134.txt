My rating is strictly on the car's looks. My hat goes off to Pontiac for making such ugly products. Its these type of vehicles that make the rest look that much better. Think about it, if everyone drove porches and vettes, there wouldn't be much of a rating scale. I enjoy the opportunity to drive my '99 2-door Tahoe with 20 clockers up to an intersection full of Aztek and Avalanche's. Car-makers realize the growing number of consumers who lack the ability to determine when a car is appealing to the general population or not. This type will often quote things like, My car is not a reflection of my pride. What Country are you from? This is America, Land of Capitalism where success is measured by Materialistic Representation. And lets not forget about those who are obsessed with the enviornment. These consumers expect their cars to be ugly to make a statement that they're doing their part. Therefore, its easy to see how ugly cars are here to stay...I welcome them one and all.
