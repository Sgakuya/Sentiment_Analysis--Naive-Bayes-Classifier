By far the most overrated state! The beaches are too cold and smell bad, they get tons of earthquakes, and one of them in teh near future is expected to make about half of california sink into the ocean. everyone in california has there nose stuck so high in brown air, and think they are so much better. And no, california is not the america of america, because california is not diverse at all, and it sucks, most of america doesnt suck, but calfornia does. yes, it is a lot of people from the midwest that make up much of the population. i have only been there three times, each time i visited one of the cites, san francisco, los angeles, and san diego. they all kind of sucked, mostly los angeles, san francisco would be nice if the people werent all hippies. los angeles literaly appeared to be hell on earth, and san diego was the most clicky and preppy city i have ever seen, it made me think of one of those teen movies like she's all that or bring it on or some other gay movie . the people in california need to come down to earth!
