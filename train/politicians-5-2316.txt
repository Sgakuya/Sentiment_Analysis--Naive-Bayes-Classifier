why are the blacks calling him an uncle tom? because he is a christian and believes people should work for their money instead of having babies so they can get more welfare? stop being jealous that you just dont have it in you to make more of yourselves. condoleeza and colin should be your jessew jackson and al sharptons. they worked to get to where they are...didnt just get people to rally around them by promising to make things easier for the self-imposed underpriviledged. i am not a rich white man but i believe in working and making my own. why cant we all do that and stop blaming rich whitey the republican. that is all that will save this country.
