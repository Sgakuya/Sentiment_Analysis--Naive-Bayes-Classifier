UCI is a university where you can get an excellent education at a reasonable price. Being part of a large statewide system, there is a learning curve to understand how that system works. Timid students won't graduate with as good an education as students who are proactive in obtaining the cirriculum and student-faculty interaction that enrich their experience. Your degree from UCI can get you into that job or graduate school just as easily as a degree from more expensive private schools. The opportunities to receive a superior education are there, you just have to work a little harder to find them. (Signed, a graduate of UCI who has been involved with the campus since 1985)
