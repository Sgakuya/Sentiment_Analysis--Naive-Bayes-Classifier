Sonic is the best place in the world. Not only for the carhops and thier service but for thier food as well. Yes,I will say the food sometimes isn't all that good but i still love the place. I work there and i am proud of it. I live in Tampa,Fl. I think our store is wonderful. I have had people from other city's in Fl.come to the one on Gandy Blvd. because it is better than the ones near them. As for everyone who is putting down sonics I have something to say to you. It is very hard to skate,carry the food,remember all the requirements,take orders,and listen to the managers yelling in your ear for you to do things. There is more than you think there is to serving all customers. We have to take care of things inside before we can ever come outside. Thank you to all the people who praise sonic.
