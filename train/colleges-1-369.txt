This school is relatively poor in many areas. The administration is a nightmare. They always pass the buck and never get anything done. The school is seriously underfunded and provides nothing to graduates students. Your just a number and in most cases treated relatively poor. Montreal is okay if you like bars and restruants but the city is very run down and underdelevopled. There are absolutely no jobs here unless you are bi-lingual. Graduate housing is extremely bad (see 3464 rue hutchison pictures for an example: http://3464hutchison.tripod.com I have no idea whatsoever why McGill has such a good reputation. Schools like Queens Toronto Western Laurier UBC Waterloo are far better both in terms of research and facilties for thier students. There is no reason to choose this school. Maybe for Medical school its okay but otherwise seriously do NOT go to this school especially for graduate studies.
