I have a 2003 extended length Montana. It currently has approx. 41K miles. We started having problems at approx. 20k miles. This is the list of problems so far... -Rear parking aid - sensors in bumper needed replacing -Driver seat warmer - heater element needed replacing -Broken glove box latch A/C - a valve or something needed replacing -cruise control - switch needed replacing -front wheel bearings needed replacing (both sides separate days) -In snow 'storms', I lost AWD and ABS temporarily...sensor -rear windshield wiper went... -The switch for the passenger window went....or 1/2 went. You can open but not close the window with that switch. -I am also experiencing a little radio problem....the sound blanks for a second at a time...like a record skipping. -Compass displays C instead of E intermittently GM seems to think that it is a mistake that we didn't buy the extended warrany. I think this is a cop out. They should make a car that doesn't 'need' you to buy the extended warranty. This is our 4th GM car and it is the only one that we had any real problems with. This van has had frequent visits to the dealer. I feel like this van is falling apart little by llittle.
