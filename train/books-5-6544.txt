I work in a library. A co-worker loaned this book and when she finished, highly recommended it to me. We are both fantasy fans. Now that our credibility has been established, let me HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed fantasy novels. The characters were well developed, the story intriguing and involving, the plot wonderful. I was so involved that, like many readers, I felt I had to share Adrina's sorrow, Vilmos s pain and Seth s anger. I fell in love with them all. I felt Adrina s loneliness, her isolation, and her longing for a normal life. I felt Vilmos s sadness, his need for truth, his struggle with temptation. I felt Seth s fear, his desire and his need. I understood them and wanted to be there with them. At any rate, try it and buy it, if you aren't too critical you ll enjoy it.
