This is obvious, and here's why: Boise State extended the nations longest winning streak to 19 games, the nations longest home winning streak to 24 games, while running their WAC winning streak to 23 straight games and their record on ESPN or ESPN2 to 13-0. Other schools want this guy, other teams have flat out said they don't want to play Boise State, Pat Hill (Fresno St.) recently said that Boise State is one of the best in the country and better than last years Tennessee team and Kansas St. this year, both which Fresno beat. Most of Boise's starters are underclassmen, which Hawkins recruited. This is a no brainer, Hawkins is the 2004 Coach of the year.
