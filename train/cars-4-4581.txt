Just got a used (new looking) 2001 SC Crewcab and so far it been very good. Milage is a bit on the downside, but hey, all the other comparable truck have the same problems. As far as Consumer Report is concern, they're comparing cars to truck, which is silly. And when you look at reliability, Nissan and Toyota, they will alway be a better buy. I rather be driving my truck than having it service all the time like my other olds american car. (hint) As far as people knocking down Nissan, they are all one liners. My neighbor's Ram truck is barely 5 years old, and all the paint on the hood is gone, talk about poor quality.
