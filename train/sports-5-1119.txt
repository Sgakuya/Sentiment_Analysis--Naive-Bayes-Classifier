Pettitte is probably the best left-handed pitchers in the majors ever since 1995 (his rookie year). He displays extreme poise and excellent decision-making even at such a young age. One example was in the 1996 world series when he fielded a groundball with runners on first and second and nonchalantly threw the ball to third. If he had thought about it, the man would have been safe. The Yankees ended up winning the game 1-0 against Smoltz and the Braves. Pettitte also is equipped with the absolute best pickoff move in the league, which is an extremely important factor in games because he can keep baserunners during a big situation in check. His strikeout pitch is the cutter inside to righthanded hitters. His years with the Yankees have included 5 AL pennants and 4 world series titles.
