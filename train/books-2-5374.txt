I had really high hopes for The Poisonwood Bible, but I was disappointed when I read it. The story of a missionary family with four daughters adapting to life in the Belgian Congo certainly had potential, but it fell flat with a slow storyline- especially in the second half of the book. In general, I liked the way the story was told from the perspective of the mother and her daughters, but this was also annoying and confusing at times. As always, I was mesmerized by Kingsolver's writing style, but that wasn't enough to overcome a boring plot. I simply slogged my way through the last half of the book and was extremely relieved when I made it to the end.
