I switched back to AT T a little while back after a miserable experience with MCI and I have been largely satisfied. I have the $.07/minute plan with a $5 monthly fee. While I may be able to save a few bucks somewhere else, after my experience with MCI, I'd rather pay a little extra to avoid any headaches. Also, they have recently added a cool feature. When I make a long distance call, a voice comes on the line that thanks me for using AT T and tells me what time it is in the area that I'm calling. While this may get old after a while, this is a nice feature for someone like me whose long distance calls are primarily to other time zones.
