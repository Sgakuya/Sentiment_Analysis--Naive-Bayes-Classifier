Montreal is a fabulous city. It's very cosmopolitan and international in feeling. It has an A-lister city feel in a more subdued way. There are many good looking people to be found throughout the city and many of them are dressed to the 9's when going out which says a lot about the nightlife here which is very energetic. It seems Montreal has less hang ups about sex than most other North American cities as it is on display all over Ste. Catherines St. The food here is great as is the shopping. The archetecture here is nice with an old world feel in many charming neighborhoods throughout the city. It's a perfect weekend destination. If you are intollerant to being in an environment of french speaking people and you simply can't open your mind and get over that then I wouldn't reccomend coming here, otherwise Montreal is a fantastic city with so much to do.
