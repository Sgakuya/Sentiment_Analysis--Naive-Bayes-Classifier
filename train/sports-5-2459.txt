As far as baseball operations go, this team is the class of the league. Their farm system regularly produces among the best talent in the league. Further, their coaching and front office personnel are continuously snatched by other frnachises due to their prowess. Felip Alou is among the most respected managers in the league, and he regualrly assembles a staff that is quickly preyed upon by wealthier franchises. For identical reasons, there are, around the league, at least four former Expos GM's now running other teams. Unfortunately, the fan base - never strong - has eroded in a city with no baseball tradtion, thereby crippling the operations of what would be wildly successful franchise given the necessary financial support. This, however, is not the organization's fault, and it continues to produce exciting young talent, that inevitably ends up elsewhere shortly afterwards (i.e. Pedro Martinez, Larry Walker, Moises Alou, Randy Johnson, etc.), while running on an austerity budget in hopes of being granted Labatt's Stadium which will hopefully alleviate their financial crisis.
