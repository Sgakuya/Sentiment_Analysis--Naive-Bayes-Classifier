I like Hole's previous CD, Live Through This, much more than this one, but I still think Celebrity Skin is excellent. Based on Live Through This, my expectations for Hole's new CD were very high, and to my surprise I wasn't disappointed. This is one of those rare CDs I can listen to straight through without wanting to skip any of the songs. It's not quite as angry and raw as Live Through This, and sometimes it almost sounds a little too slick or over-produced or something. But that's a small price to pay for great songs like Dying and Northern Star. And Melissa Auf Der Maur's backup vocals turn out to be a great complement to Courtney Love's strong but less-than-perfect voice. If you liked some of the Hole songs from Live Through This and haven't given Celebrity Skin a chance yet, you're missing out.
