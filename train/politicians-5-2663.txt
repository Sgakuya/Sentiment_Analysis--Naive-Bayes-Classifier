I would've voted for him. The sad thing is that it would have been such a clear decision for me and now (as it always seems to be) I'm left with a choice between two people who I find as appealing, intelligent, and as passionate as a cork. I don't know if any of you have ever read the account of McCain's time spent as a POW in Vietnam or not but I read it about 5 years ago in an article in Time or something and I'll tell you it was absolutely incredible. Bombed a village then shot down over that village, ejected and landed in a pond in that same village, both arms broken, sank to the bottom and pulled the life inflater cord with teeth, bobbed to surface and pulled ashore by the villagers he'd just bombed, beaten and stabbed taken to prison and spent the next several years there. Anyone who can go through what he went through, that has the personal resolve to suffer when he doesn't have to (he was offered many times the opportunity to return home because his father was the commander of the naval forces in Asia) and at the same time be subjected to ever harsher conditions for those same convictions is someone you can't help but admire. Has he had his problems? Rage? Broken families? Sure. Has he powered through them all to get to where he his? You bet. Have you ever met someone that you knew wasn't the smartest, wasn't the strongest, or the most creative but they were so driven and they wanted to be successful so badly that you knew at some point they were going to achieve their goals? That's how I see McCain. He'll be back.
