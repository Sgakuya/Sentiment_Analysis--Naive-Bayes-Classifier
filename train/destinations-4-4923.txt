Yeah OK - its dirty - and you gotta deal with the whole poverty thing BUT... People still smile at you, the food is still great and just grab a ride in an old rusty VW Beetle taxi for the ultimate whiteknuckle ride! As third world cities go, I felt comfortable in Lima. Far less agressive people than Bankok or Manila, less hassle than Cairo or Nairobi. The prevalence of Money changers means financial transactions can be done without all the bureaucratic timewasting that happens in other countries, and the busses and taxis are all easy enough to understand. Best thing - Lima is gateway to the Peruvian Andes, why not sidestep Cuzco and the tourists and get a 10 hr bus ride up to Huaraz in the Cordierra Blanca - Worldbeating scenery and you wont have to share it with the hordes!
