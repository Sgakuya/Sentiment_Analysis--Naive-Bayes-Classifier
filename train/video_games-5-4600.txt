It's pathetic that this game is rated so low; it's one of the best games ever made. It has, hands down, the best writing you'll ever find in a game. Mind you, there is lots of text to read, enough to fill a large novel, but it's so well written you probably won't care. You can literally feel the imagination that went into this game seeping out of the screen. It has a refreshingly different RPG plot, with none of that Save the world from the ultimate manifestation of evil business you see in pretty much every other game of the genre. The characters you get in your party are the most well developed and intriguing I've ever seen in a video game, each with such detailed backgrounds you could easily base a game around any one of them. While not technologically groundbreaking, the graphics are very colorful and pleasing to the eye, and further show the imagination of the game's creators. The music, like in everything Black Isle ever made, is awesome. The only criticism I can make of the game is the combat. There just isn't very much of it, and what's there isn't challenging. This wouldn't be as much an issue if the combat system, and the high level spells you can get, weren't so well done. I wanted more opportunities to rain firey death upon my enemies with all those spells you can pick up. But the absolute best, level 9 spells can't even be obtained until the last five minutes of the game, unless you spend days leveling up (bleah), and you never really have a need to use them. Regardless of the lack of combat, though, Torment absolutely rocks. Infinitely better than a certain other, much more popular RPG featuring a main character with memory problems.
