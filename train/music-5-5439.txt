I think this album came out in 1970, heavy rock had only recently appeared with likes of Cream Led Zep, and then Black Sabbath arrived with their eponymous debut album, which I think is pretty good.However, 'Paranoid' is a really, really great metal album.Not surprisingly, it's mostly just classic metal tracks such as 'Iron Man', 'War Pigs', 'Hand of Doom', 'Electric Funeral' etc., there's also the instrumental jam 'Rat Salad' which is great fun.Probably the most unexpected cut is 'Planet Caravan' which I think is brilliant in every respect - the music, the guitar, the vocals - all conjure up great imagery make for quite a haunting song especially amidst the rest.That's not to say the heavier tracks aren't good, in fact they're great, the band are having a blast creating the heaviest, baddest most doom-laden sound around at the time - listening to these makes you realise that all metal bands since owe a lot to this band, and most of it to this album.
