This game took the world by storm, much like Doom did all those years ago and it set the standard of FPS games for the millenium. Though launched in 1998 I was still on my third attempt at Dungeon Keeper and hadn't actually paid for a game since Duke Nukem in 1996. I got my moneys worth though because I ended up playing this about four times. The game starts with you taking a mining carriage into some secret planetary laboratory and reminded me of the beginning to an all action Arnie film, well little did I realise that it was very much like being part of a film and one with a story line too - which is a bonus. It is a First Person Shooter (FPS) which basically means you run around killing anything in sight by using your huge arsenal of bombs, grenades, guns and organic alien launchers and at the same time desperately trying to salvage health, ammo and generally shitting yourself. I think the game took me so long to complete the first time because you would very often find me hiding behind some plant like tentacle plucking up the courage to dive into the jaws of a huge pant-browning monster. Anyway, it sat at the number one FPS spot for 2 years until Medal of Honour swiped the throne.
