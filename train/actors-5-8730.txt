I love her. She is beautiful, talented, intelligent and actually capable of making me cry. No other actress can do that to me. She has moments in Alias that are so heartfelt, and a few moments later she's kicking someone's ass. And 13 Going on 30---what a change for her and she was perfect. Hollywood, as expected, seems to have changed her but she must've known what she was in for. Her first marriage fizzled because of her sudden fame, so now she hangs out with Affleck, bringing more attention to her. But there is a reason Affleck fell for her. If she's as sensitive, charming and empathetic in real life as she is on TV and in the movies (we already know she looks fantastic), what guy, famous or not famous, would NOT fall for her? And for the person who was bummed because ABC is not bringing back Alias, I heard they're not bringing it back because Jen wants to concentrate on her movie career.
