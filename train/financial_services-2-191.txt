First of all I was suppose to be getting free checking while I was a student. Somewhere a long the way they started charging me for this and I don't know how long it was before i realized because they were charging me for the checkcard. When I did discover it they only reimbursed me for the previous two months. I know they have records that go way back before that. They also almost lost some of my money once by not comepletely looking in the envelope. If someone deposits $500 on the slip and you only pull out 200 from the envelope don't you think you will search the envelope to make sure that there wasn't another check in there? Good thing I noticed this early and they found the check STILL in the envelope days later. That whole scenario sounded fishy to me. I just have not been happy with them. I went to them because I was not happy will my last bank and their fees. Now I am looking for a good online bank. I heard of one that might be good.
