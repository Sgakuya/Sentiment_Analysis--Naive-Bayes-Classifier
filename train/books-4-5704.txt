This is the first novel by the former President of the United States. It is a fictional account of the bloody American Revolution, covering the entire colonial period from 1763 thru 1785. It follows the story of Eathan Pratt, his brother Henry, and thier friends. Being a novel set in the Revolution, it would be hard to not mention the major players that founded our great country, George Washington and the rest, and they are mentioned in the story, but the focal point of the novel is the everyday life of the ordinary citizen during this time priod. The charectors are well written and you care about them. The story is well written, but tends to bog down in details. It is an entertaining read and a fine first novel from Jimmy Carter. (Jimmy Carter has written other books, but this is his first work of fiction.)
