i THINK IT IS TIME THAT WE SAW THROUGH cLINTON'S bs AND FINALLY ELECTED A MAN THAT WILL LEAD THIS GREAT COUNTRY INTO THE NEXT CENTURY . mAYBE THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE A BREAK, WILL FINALLY GET ONE. aS FOR ME, I AM TIRED OF WORKING MY TAIL OFF TO TRY TO FEED MY FAMILY AND HAVE THE GOVERNMENT GIVE MY HARD EARNED MONEY TO A PERSON THAT IS ON GOVERNMENT HANDOUT AND HAS BEEN FOR YEARS(BECAUSE THIS IS A GRAVY TRAIN), DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK BUT DRIVES A BETTER CARS THAN i DO, EATS BETTER THAN i DO, AND WEAR MORE DESIGNER CLOTHES THAN i DO. i SAY IT'S PAST TIME FOR A CHANGE, AND i FOR ONE THINK IT'S LONG OVER DUE. iT'S TIME THAT WE REALLY TOOK CARE OF OUR SENIORS, AS THEY HAVE WORKED HARDER THAN WE PROBALLY EVER WILL, AND FOR WHAT? TO TRY TO DECIDE IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AT THE END OF THE MONTH TO BUY THEIR MEDICINE, FOOD OR FUEL OIL TO STAY WARM IN THE WINTER. IT'S A SAD DAY IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN WE THINK MORE OF PETTY THINGS THAN OF OUR ELDERS. I AM A WHITE, FEMALE, REPUBLICAN, AND WANT MY VOICE HEARD AND I HOPE THAT WITH THIS CHANGE, IT WILL BE. UNLIKE THE GORE'S, THE BUSHES WEREN'T BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN THEIR MOUTHES LIKE THE PRESS WANT US TO BELIEVE( IF YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK, YOU WILL SEE THIS) AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY TRULY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO STRIVE TO RAISE A FAMILY, TRY TO TEACH THEM MORALS, AND SENT THEM OFF TO COLLEGE, IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW THAT CAN AFFORD IT. i BELIEVE THAT HE WILL STOP OR TRY TO ATLEAST, ALL THE KIDS GOING TO COLLEGE THAT CAN'T EVEN READ OR WRITE ON A MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL JUST TO PLAY SPORTS ON A SCHOLARSHIP WHEN THERE ARE SOME VERY ACEDEMICALLY ADEPT KIDS OUT THERE THAT CAN'T GO BECAUSE THRY DON'T HAVE THEY MONEY AND CAN'T GET A GRANT OR A SCHOLAESHIP. THESE ARE THE FUTURE DOCTORS, LAWYERS, AND PROFESSIONALS OF THE FUTURE. DO YOU WANT A FOOTBALL PLAYER TO END UP TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN THAT CAN'T EVEN SPELL OR READ IN THEIR GRADE LEVEL, ALL BECAUSE HE LEAD THE FOOTBALL TEAM IN SCORING ONE YEAR AND TOOK THEM TO A BOWL GAME? I THINK NOT. SO THE NEXT TIME YOU HEAR THE GOOD REV. JESSE JACKSON BITCHING ABOUT SOMETHING HE HAS NO BUSINESS TALKING ABOUT, REMEMBER THIS LETTER. HE COULD BE THE NEXT TEACHER SOMEWHERE OR SOMEONE LIKE HIM!! SCARRY THOUGHT, HUH?? GEORGE W. YOU HAVE MY COMPLETE SUPPORT.
