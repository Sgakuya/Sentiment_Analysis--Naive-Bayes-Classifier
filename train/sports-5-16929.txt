What can you say about the Super Bowl champions? I'd like to point out what someone else posted here a few *years* ago. The guy gave them one star. This year anyway. An offensive line who can't block, an immobile QB, and an underachieving defense is not a recipe for success. . Look at the Pats now. They have a great offensive line. An immobile QB? Well, Tom is like Drew in that respect, but he can run around a bit...lol. But the part that really got to me was the underachieving defense bit. I'm sure that was true then. I just love our defense now. Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy are playing better than ever and we've got a *rookie* named Richard Seymour who's turning heads. Willie McGinest and Otis Smith, our veterans, play with more guts and fire than most younger players. This *comment* is already taking too long, but I just wanted to put my two cents in. I enjoyed reading old comments and I've loved watch this team morph into a defensive superpower with Bill Belichick at the helm.
