The Georgia Peach was a menace inside and outside of the baseball diamond. A player who reportedly sharpened his spikes to inflict punishment on his opponents, Ty Cobb played like there was no tomorrow. Fiercely hated during his time, he was not a friendly man towards the press. Nevertheless, who can deny how great he was (with a career batting average of .367)? He can also be listed amongst the few Triple Crown winners in history. Whatever may be said about his rude, disgusting manner in and out of the field, no one can claim him not to be on the short list of greatest players. Ty Cobb definitely belonged.
