To you idiots who are saying Kurt Warner is overrated: overrated compared to who? The fact of the matter is that the guy is one of the best, if not THE best quarterback in football today. His passes are consistently accurate. Sure, he's not absolutely perfect, but what else can you say about someone who came out of nowhere and led his team to the Super Bowl in one year after three losing seasons in a row. It's not just luck or a fluk- Warner is the real deal. I think these folks who say he's overrated are jealous fans of other teams with mediocre QBs. So shut the f--- up! The stats say it all: he consistently throws at least 200 yards and two TDs a game, and is good in the pocket under pressure. Could someone please explain to me why they think those stats are overrated? I'll believe that assertation when the Vikings win the Super Bowl!
