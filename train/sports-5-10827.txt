Will bring Notre Dame back to glory. Already has proven he can be successful at EVERY level of coaching. Won a state championship as a high school head coach. Won bowl games at two different colleges as position coach. Was a position coach at four different positions in the NFL; coached a player to their first Pro-Bowl at each position. Two of those positions he also made the decision to draft that player. Oh, and he also got his first Superbowl ring here too. As offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, helped the Patriots win three Superbowls, and coached Tom Brady from obscurity to three-time SuperBowl MVP. Since taking over at Notre Dame, has recruited arguably the best class in the past 20 years this year, and the recruiting season is only half over. He has led the Irish to a 3-1 record, the only loss coming in overtime to the NCAA's most prolific offense, and compiling wins over a top 25 opponent and a top 5 opponent in the process. Has coached Brady Quinn and Darius Walker into Heisman consideration in 4 games. (Quinn currently 5th in Heisman race, according to ESPN.com) Within two years, everyone will know what I already do. He is the best coach in the NCAA.
