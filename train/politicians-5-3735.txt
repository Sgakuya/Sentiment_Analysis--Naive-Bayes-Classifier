President Elect George Bush is a great man with the highest moral standards of any President Canidate that I have ever read about or had the pleasure to vote for. His ideas for our society far exceed that of any before him. Let him the transitioning office so he can be ready to lead and lead he will. I have heard and read what kind of commander in chief will he make since he only has experience in the Air National Guard. Let me tell you I am in the ANG and know what it takes to be a guardsman. Anyway it will be 100% better than what we have had the last 8 years. President Clinton de-moralized the Military. I proudly support Geroge W. Bush and Dick Cheney. I salute you both. God Bless and may you both prevail.
