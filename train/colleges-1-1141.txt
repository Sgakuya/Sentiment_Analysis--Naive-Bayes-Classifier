Come to Harvard, WHY you ask rather emphatically and sarcastically at the same time? (insert used-car salesman laugh here.) because it's not too late to gain that ever-so-hallowed scintila of pride, that comes with telling people, I went to this college in boston, yeah, Harvard, I think it's called. as you gauge the envious reactions of your lowly,worthless, and bitter peers, for it is they who must return to the cold and unforgiving land of mediocrity. and reality, turns out. and that's not all!!!!! once you're finished paying of your loans, you can finally return to earth, and realize ever-so bitterly, that YOU WILL NEVER PAY OFF YOUR LOANS, YOU ARE NO LONGER CAPABLE OF EXPERIENCING HUMAN EMOTION, and NOBODY CARES THAT YOU WENT TO HARVARD. my advice, go to a state school, then a good grad school, get a JOB, and then LIVE day by day, experiencing joy in the humble form of a chocolate chip cookie, or an evening sunset, and then somberly await the day of your . because, in the end, life is short, and I would rather die than go to harvard. thank you.
