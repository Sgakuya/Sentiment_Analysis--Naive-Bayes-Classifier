Decent prices at Wal Mart on many different items and for the most part the employees have been helpful. One must allot a significant amount of time before shopping, however. The parking lots are usually full and the stores (esp. the one in Lakeland, FL) is crowded with overweight rednecks. It is rare to hear an excuse me as one of these monstrosities cuts in front of you to grab the cheapest item off the shelf. Also, the buildings are a real eyesore with its behemoth, boxy shape and litter scattered throughout the parking lot. Our Super Hell Mart now has a McDonald's. So, after not being greeted by the 104 yr.old hag at the entrance, dodging aroung the slowpokes, and waiting forever in the check-out lines you can sit down to the most unhealthy food. America at its best/worst.
