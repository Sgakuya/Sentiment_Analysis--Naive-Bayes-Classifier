I have lived in the D.C. area/region for most of my life, it is a good place to visit, just don't live here. Upside: would be things like the monuments, museums, historical places of interest, churches, universities, restaurants, pubs, shopping. Downside: Over all it is a bad place to live. Most of the people are generally aloof, greedy, clickish, cold, phony, rude, arrogant and self consumed. As a single male this place is terrible. The females are basically very liberal, snooty, spoiled, unapproachable man hating east coast elitist. Sadly women go for either 2 extremes here, either that mythical creature (Mr every) or a gangsta, little middle ground. Definately a shortage of single unattached women to boot. The cost of living here is unreal, especially real estate and rent. Traffic...I hate to even go there, put it this way, I usually drive between 2-3 hour a day commuting to and from work. The climate is usually humid, cloudy and rainy during the Summer, Fall is by far the best time of year, the remaining months are cool and gloomy. Conclusion: If your thinking about living here...reconsider!
