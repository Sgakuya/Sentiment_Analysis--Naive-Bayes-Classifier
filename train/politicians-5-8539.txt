He may be the best American president of the 20th century. He campaigned on the ideals and moral principles that made our country great to begin with. He was the same man as a president as he had been as a candidate, not moving to the center as many presidents do after getting into office. He did not let his opponents intimidate him. There is not room here to write a book answering the objections his opponents have of his presidency. But I'll just say that virtually all of them have become clich s, and are not the results of good research. His economic policies rescued us from disaster. They created wealth and jobs which benefited everyone - yes, including the poor (more jobs = less poor). More important than that, he is the primary person responsible for the Berlin Wall coming down. He communicated well because he was genuine and it showed. He lifted the spirits of the American people and went out with a legacy like no other president yet has in my lifetime.
