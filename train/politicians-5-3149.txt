Best president to serve during my lifetime so far. His moral failings had nothing to do with his ability to be an effective leader despite the throngs of self-righteous, hand wringing conservatives who kept insisting that character counts except when it comes to the likes of Henry Hyde, Bob Barr, Tom Delay, and Bob Livingston, just to name a few. He survived and did a good job in spite of politically motivated witch hunts orchestrated by the likes of Richard Melon Scaife. Despite numerous attempts to discredit the Clinton administration by individuals with the unmitigated temerity to call themselves patriots , Clinton served two full terms of office and did so with distinction. He turned a huge deficit caused by Reagan's out of control defense spending into a surplus (only to be wiped out by George W. Bush and his tax cut to the rich), and he is responsible for significant improvements in the quality of air, water, and education. Bill Clinton will go down as a great American president, and if you don't agree you can kiss my a**!
