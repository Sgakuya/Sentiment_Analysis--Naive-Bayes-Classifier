What is there to say about Johnny Depp? I personally think Johnny Depp is a wonderful actor...he is very classic looking, he has got those beautiful eyes, that i got trapped into, and his adorable smile, its enough to make me melt...plus..he doesnt go around with lots of girls getting married and the next day gets divorced...from what i see and have heard...he is a wonderful person...watching his movies has inspired me to better in my acting...what i see he does, i want to do just as good as he does...like in sleepy hollow...he made the character so real...that there really was a Ichabod Crane, that looked like him and acted in every way like him...he is a true actor...he does his own stunts...how much more could he be committed to what he loves? i wish that someday i could meet with him...and get to know him...but over all, i think johnny depp is a great actor,i dont think he could ever make a movie that is bad...keep up the good work mr.depp...and for all of you who dont like johnny, try and find a actor and actress just like him! i will always be a Johnny Depp fan always and 4-EVER! here is my email if you would like to email me voodeauxmeow@aol.com
