My 83-year-old grandmother had an Alltel phone to use for emergencies only so she had a very limited plan (local area calls, 60 minutes per month). She had to move from North Carolina to Alabama for health reasons this year and wanted to keep the same phone. First problem is that there is no Alltel store where she moved. Second problem is that her plan no longer exists so she would have to switch to a plan that costs at least $10/month more than she was paying, not something she can easily afford, especially for a service plan that is more than she needs. So she had to close her account. Alltel charged her a $150 early disconnect penalty and will not waive it, despite the fact that my grandmother had to move to an area with no Alltel service. What kind of company charges such ridiculous fees to a little old lady, or to anyone for that matter, when they can no longer offer you your existing service??!
