This movie has not aged well--there are scenes (and lines of dialogue) that in 1973 must have been shocking and scary, but now seem ripe for spoofing (and in fact they have been spoofed): Father, I'm afraid my daughter.....may be possessed. What's that? Holy Water. Keep it away! But the movie still gets a thumbs up for me for its atmosphere. Chillingly directed by William Friedkin, you can literally feel the goosebumps during those horrible bedroom scenes. And there are some scenes that remain shocking--could they get away with some of the scenes today? Probably, but this most certainly would get the NC-17. Question--HOW did this get shown on network TV?
