Despite it's reputation for heavy rainfall, each time I have been to Seattle, the weather has been clear and sunny. Maybe it's just luck of the draw I don't know. First thing you notice about this town is the proliferation of coffee houses all over the place. The city is probably best known for the Space Needle, which was built for a World Fair in the 1960's. There's a mediocre revolving restaurant upstairs but the view makes it worthwhile, especially for first timers. There are some poorer areas of the city, but all and all it's one of the better North American cities. The natural surroundings of the city can't be beat. If you like the outdoors, this is the place for you. Skiing, boating, hiking and biking are just some of the things you can do in the area.
