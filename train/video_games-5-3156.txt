I think Silent Hill 2 is the best game out at the moment. People say that it is scary, but I think it is more disturbing. Its got great graphics,gameplay and music. The sounds are fantastic - they just freak you out. If you dont get scared easy you will with this game. The FMVs are absolutly mouth watering. The gameplay is excellent - it was that good that at the beginning I didn't know that I had to play. I thought it was still the FMV. Then there is the sound and the music. They just put them in the right places to scare you! The monsters are even scarier than Silent Hill. If you wanna get freaked by a game this is the one - but remember if your gonna play it keep a pair of clean underware next to you cause your gonna need it !!!
