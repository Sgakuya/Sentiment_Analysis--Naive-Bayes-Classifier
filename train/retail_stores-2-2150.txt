Radio Shack has gotten progressivly worse over the years. I still go there for items you can't find retail anywhere else. When I do visit my local Radio Shack stores (four in My imeadite area) it seems they have less and less in the store, when I ask about a product they used to carry I am told we no longer stock that item. Radio Shack seems to be going the way of consumer electronics only TV's,VCR's,DVD playiers ect. Why shop here when I can get the same or better at any number of eletronic stores and get it cheaper. Let's face it, Radio Shack is expensive and there selection is next to nothing. All the good stuff they were known for, Coax cable,RF connectors,Antennas,Radio gear ect is slowly being phazed out.Why may you ask, because this merchandice does not sell quickly and there for does not turn a quick enough profit. If we can't turn a fast buck on our items, we do'nt want it in our stores is the Shack's way of thinking, if we do'nt sell X number of Cat # 27-499 discontinue it seems to be the order of the day at coroporate HQ. This, and only this reason is why Radio Shack no longer has a catalog. Here today gone tommorow Radio Shack's new slogan I think it works quite well.
