Tortola is the largest of the British Virgin Islands, but it is still incredibly low-key and unspoiled compared to the U.S. Virgins that are nearby. There is only one city on the island, Road Town (pop: 8000 or so), so don't come to Tortola expecting to shop! There are several nice beaches with the bluest water and lush landscapes given the mountainous nature of the BVI's and Tortola especially. I'm not a big snorkler, but that and sailing are major pastimes in the BVIs. The people are super-friendly and crime is not a concern. There is a decidedly upbeat vibe throughout the island -- especially at the Bomba Shack, the incredible reggae club that's open on Wed, Sun and full moons. It's truly just a shack, with graffiti all over it ( $50 fine for breaking the shack ), but fun and lively as can be. We stayed at a small resort called Frenchman's Cay on the West End, which has an excellent restaurant and package deal that includes a rental jeep so you can explore the many beaches -- the remote Smuggler's Cove, with its honor bar (a fridge of beer and a cigar box where you leave $3 per bottle) was our favorite. The accomodations at Frenchman's were nothing special, but I have heard similar complaints about pricier resorts like Long Bay and Fort Recovery. We took a day at a Marriott in St. Thomas at the end of the trip to get a day at a hotel with real amenities . If you go to Tortola, you should do a day trip to visit the wonderful Baths of Virgin Gorda, or escape to even less populated islands like Anegada. In all, we had a wonderful time and already miss the warm sun and cool breezes!
