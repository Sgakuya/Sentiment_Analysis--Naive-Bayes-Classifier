Boston is one of my favorite cities in this country. There's tons of history here; do the Freedom Trail to get the full sense of it. It's a great city to walk. The North End is my favorite area of town. Wherever you go, there are a lot of green areas throughout town that are good for jogging. Very livable city, it can get cold though. There's tons of stuff to do outside the city; visiting Lexington and Concord, the site of the shot heard around the world was very interesting. Lots of Revolutionary War history here. There are a few nice beaches in the area, but they're too cold for me. I'm used to swimming in 80 degree water in Miami!
