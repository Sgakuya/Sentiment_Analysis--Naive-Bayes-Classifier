Alot of Goldeneye purists say this game was a rip-off or was too over the top with its alien-related plot. But the point that they so consistently miss is that while Bond definitely set the standard for first-person shooters, it suffered from the same ailments that all pioneers face: flaws. It may be debatable just how perfect Perfect Dark is, but it's damn close. I can remember the Goldeneye days and the huge list of things that never made sense, If only they would have done this..., or I wish this was possible... Perfect Dark satisfied nearly every requirement on my Goldeneye Fix List. Everything to computer opponents with improved AI, customizable weapon sets and even things I didn't think of like secondary weapon functions are what sets this game apart. Perfect Dark is the best, scratch that, only example of a game company that really took the time to improve on their existing product.
