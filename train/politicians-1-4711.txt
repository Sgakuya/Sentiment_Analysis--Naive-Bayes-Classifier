This is the guy who voted in favor of keeping Mandela in jail, and voted against Head Start because we didn't have the money then. In the private sector he made 20 million bucks (nothing at all to do with the government, he says) and gave one or two percent to charity. What a sterling example of compassionate conservatism. Incidentally, I do think it is possible to be a compassionate conservative--such a person might believe that private charities do a much better job helping the poor than the government. Right or wrong, that's a defensible position. But Cheney's own record doesn't suggest any great interest in compassionate endeavors of any sort.
