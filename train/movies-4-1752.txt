this is some sick ****. i didn't think i could ever hate carrie ann moss, but wow, was she evil. i just wanted to get that out of the way. you find out why she was bad at the end, and you hate her less... man, she's hot. anyway, run down: joe pantoliano was great; this may be his best work, and he's brilliant. i would have liked guy pearce more, but his character was such a wank throughout the movie, and an even bigger wank when you find out why, and between his hair and some of the production values, this felt like a usa network production. it's a thrilling story, and i don't mean to come down on it, but you can't even blink if you hope to keep up with everything. it left me in awe. i don't think i could watch it again, but i recommend it.
