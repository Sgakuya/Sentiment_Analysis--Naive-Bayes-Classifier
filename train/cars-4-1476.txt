This is my second day of ownership of a '03 model and after trying out a lot of other cars over the years (I haven't owned a car since '96 but have driven many) I have to say that I am completely blown away by the superiority of this make, compared to all the other half-ass attempts (at muscle cars) over the years, even by Ford itself! In a way, I think that this car could be the shape of things to come, in that the advancements in automotive technology via F1 racing, NASCAR, etc., have trickled down to the consumer level where cars are now produced that are several times more efficient -and powerful-than their predecessors from the '60's and '70's. I only hope that I will still be young enough to appreciate how the next generation of vehicles will evolve, especially with the onset of non-fossil fuel engines.
