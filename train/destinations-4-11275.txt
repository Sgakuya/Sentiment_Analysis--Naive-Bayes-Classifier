This was our second trip to EuroDisney in about 5 years, each time with a grandson in tow. We liked it both times, and consider it much better than the Florida equivalent. The addition of decent food, alcohol, and a little chic goes a long way to mitigating the unremitting crassness of this type of thing. The staff are extremely friendly, particularly if you bother to use a little French, and have a satisfying irony about their job that stops you falling completely for the Disney patter. The food is a bit expensive but, unlike the parent park, at least it is enjoyable. For example, the dorade with asparagus and artichoke I had on our last day would have baffled any American theme park chef. Combine that with interesting wine and there is just no contest, DLP wins hands down! As to the rides etc., well it's so easy to find something to moan about. The way to look at it is in terms of can you fill your time, and do you have fun doing it? Answer, YES! My only criticism is that the use of French all the time ruins presentations to children from other countries. Adults have no excuse, they should learn a bit of French, but kids really have enough boring learning to do without that. This is particularly irksome when one considers that there are comparatively few French kids around.
