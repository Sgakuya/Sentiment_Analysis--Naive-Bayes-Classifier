Senator Mc Cain just as well admit he is a right wing Democrat and since he has already teamed up with Liberman, maby they can both run against President Bush next election. (He will defeat them again!) I am very disappointed in Mr. McCains move to the right. He is now sponsoring a bill with Liberal Liberman to do background checks on gun shows where more than 75 guns are sold. How could this even be enforced, supervised, or known until the show is over? He did little to support his partys choice when he lost, or since then for that matter. Instead to get publicity he runs to the Demo's camp and adjenda. I am ashamed of his present and post election conduct. I shall not vote for him again.
