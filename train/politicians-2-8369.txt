When you look back on Reagan (Hero of the 1980s) legacy in 2004, you have to ask yourself the question: At what price did this man defeat communism? The answer is .. the evil organisation that this man helped to create .. Al Qaeda. Reagan was the hardest critic of Soviet communism ever to sit as US President. So much so that he would support any Capitalist despot to defeat any kind of communist threat. The most infamous despots Reagan's admin. supported were the Saudi fighers who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan. At least when Afghanistan was communist, it had a government that didn't enforce extreme dress code or tell you what you should eat or drink. In fact, the communist government was the most liberal Afghanistan had for decades. And most Afghans saw it that way and all. When the Taliban took over Afghanistan, they became the puppets of the Saudi terrorists that the CIA (under Reagan's direction) had initially set up to fight with the Afghans to defeat communism. It was Bin Laden and especially his mad Egyptian doctor (if he even was one, probably a quack whop bought his MD doctorate from a diploma mill) friend who ran Afghanistan. And these Egyptians and Saudis ran things worse than the Russians would have done! Mark my word on that. But, they weren't communist. And the US ignored them .. until 9/11. Only for Reagan, the USSR might still be there. Only for Reagan, Europe might still be the divided battle-ground-to-be. But, only for Reagan, it is definite that Al Qaeda would not exist, that 9/11 wouldn't have happened or that the Afghan people wouldn't have suffered as much. Which would I rather as an enemy? The Russians (who, like the US, didn't want a major war) or Al Qaeda (who openly seek world war 3 and the apocalypse, so they can then rule their feudal Mad Max-style post nuclear wilderness)? The answer is, well, obvious. The Russians of course.
