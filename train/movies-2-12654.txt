Terrence Malick's new film is as ambitious a mess as I have seen in a very long time. Less a feature film than a series of History Channel-style re-enactments, it is expertly photographed and cinematically breath-taking. Malick's camera lingers over lush foliage and running streams with a loving, contemplative skill. The many close-ups of the actors are as beautiful as the scenery. Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas and Colin Farrell's John Smith are as beautiful as the New World forests, and Malick lingers over the contours of their faces and bodies. What the movie lacks, however, is energy and narrative focus. New World seems almost to have been filmed without benefit of a screenplay. It is composed of tiny vignettes that don't add up to a very cohesive whole. The movie comes to life a bit in its last quarter when Christian Bale's John Rolfe arrives to court Pocahontas and take her to the court of King James I, but it is too little too late. The oppresiveness of New World bogs it down and leaves its poetic promise unfulfilled.
