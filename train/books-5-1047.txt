I would agree with you on that one, I was rootin' for Dumbledore also, but I guess that says something that even with all the evidence pointing the other way, I still believed him. I for sure cried, as I have with the last two as well, and man, it's all getting so complicated! If any doubt remains that this is no longer a children's series, I'm sure that this book with extinguish this. I found myself having to reread a few things to make sure I got all the facts right, I can't imagine a kid reading through and going...oh yeah! I gotta say, I did miss Fred and George as regular characters, there wasn't much in this book to lighten the mood as they have done so well. Very depressing, but still fantastic...the next book's gotta be like 1000 pages, there's so much left to do!
