I have visited Maine several times, and with every visit find it to be more beautiful, charming, relaxing, friendly, and interesting than before. Locals are very accepting of travelers, including the ones like myself, who by the way, ARE from the south. My husband and I have always been treated with respect, and with invitations to return anytime. Whether this is the nature of the people or their response to our actions - polite, friendly, generous tippers as opposed to Mr. Cobb's assessment below is of no consequence. We truly love everything about this wonderful state -the scenery, the coast, the food, the people, and the break from the South's oppressive summertime heat.
