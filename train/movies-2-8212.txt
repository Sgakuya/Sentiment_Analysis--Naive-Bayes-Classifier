Once again,what can we expect from the wacky(unfunny) Farrelly (John Hughes wanna-bees) Brothers! It sucked! To all you moron desperate kinda laughing fans,...check out a movie by the above mentioned Mr.Hughes. Or if you don't do that research stuff, watch Home Alone. It was out before the Farrelly dorks were still in diapers and is basically the same comedy but with a much more respectful touch. But that's just my uptight opinion. Keep laffin' u' silly moron kids! P.S.-I mentioned Mr.Hughes because I get that sneeeekin' kinda suspishin that the Farrelly dorks mighta' been inspired (copied) Planes,Trains, Automobiles. The problem is the Hughes movie is actually funny!!! Ta,Ta!
