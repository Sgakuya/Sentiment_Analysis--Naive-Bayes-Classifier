After doing extensive research on prices, Publix, by far is the most expensive. Stores, for the most part are clean and well lighted. The biggest downfall for Publix is the ability to support and service the customer. At most any time, you will find rude personnel, grocery checkers who don't ever say hello because of ongoing weekend plans with their dates, and a general non-caring attitude which starts from the management level and filters down to the carry-out help. The meat department offers most all cuts of meat however, the meat tends to be tougher and less flavorful over other grocers meat due to the selection of lesser grade beef which Publix has chosen to sell. This was not always the case. So, if you are in for a great steak, bypass Publix. You will certainly be glad you did. As with most things these days, it is necessary to visit a variety of grocery stores to ensure you get the freshest product, the best prices, and the best customer service. I do believe Publix offers some of the freshest products but fails to deliver on the best prices and the best customer service. It all depends on what you are looking for.
