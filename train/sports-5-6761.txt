The Utah Jazz were predicted before the end of the pre-season that they would only win 7 games for the whole year. The Jazz weren't as good as they were a few years ago, but they are also rebuilding a new team right now and that takes time. Every team has ups and downs. The Jazz almost made the playoffs last year, and that by far exceeded the number of wins than what was expected. Jerry Sloan is an excellent coach and it's beginning to show now that the big stars aren't taking the credit away from him. Yes he has never won a championship, and he probably never will, but that doesn't mean he can't coach well. People are still winners if they don't get the gold, not everybody will get 1st.
