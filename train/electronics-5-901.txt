The SonyEricsson T616 is a excellent phone. The main reason that I purchased it was it's design. It's small and convenient to carry, and I get so many compliments about how good it looks. It includes just about every feature you could ask for. It's text messaging features are really easy to use, thanks to the phone's good implementation of T9. The built-in camera isn't of great quality, but for multimedia messaging, it's more than adequate. It's included ringtones are all very good, and it's MIDI capabilities mean that it's easy to customize, although I do wish sometimes that it were a little louder. It also runs mobile java applications and includes some very fun games. I've downloaded a few more, and this phone can really help prevent boredom! Battery life is good. I can usually go about a week without charging it, and when I do charge it, it's very quick. Call quality is very good. It's easily one of the better quality phones that I've used. I have had people tell me that it sound more like a regular phone than a cell phone! Overall, I'm very impressed with this phone and recommend it to my friends all the time. It's not perfect, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone considering it.
