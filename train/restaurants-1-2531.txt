Easily the worst quality fast food I've sampled of any major fast food chain. Hell, even Burger King in my opinion is twice as good -no exaggeration whatsoever. (I frequent Burger King quite often and am not embarrassed to admit it.) Mc Donald's is about the only fast food chain whose fast food I truly don't like and wouldn't even eat if it was free (though Arctic Circle comes close). The much-touted fries are about the only item that's decent but fries are fries: there isn't much distinction between fries from fast food chain to fast food chain. Fries aren't the primary reason why I do fast food anyways. Also it would be hard to botch something as simple as fries, even McDonald's would be hard-pressed to botch it. The sandwiches are absolutely terrible and low-quality. I find Burger King's Whopper twice as good as the Big Mac. Why, of all fast food chains, we intelligent Americans have made McDonald's the most popular in the world -indeed our 'flagship' restaurant- is absolutely pathetic and incomprehensible. I also seem to notice more McDonald's commercials than any other fast food chain commercials. Absolutely pathetic.
