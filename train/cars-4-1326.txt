IF you are consider the 1.8T 4-cyl version, then my rating is 5-star for sure. The price is right considering the comfort, drivability, safety, power, and reliability. I will say that you're far better off with the 4-cyl with a turbo than with the naturally aspirated 6-cyl. The 4-cyl feels zippier because it has low end horsepower and handles the slightly heavy passat well. I agree that they are getting a little pricy for what you get, but I'm quite pleased with mine for the money we paid. VW makes a good car, and in recent years a very reliable and confortable car at that. It really just comes down to price. I highly recommend test driving though - you really can't tell from what people write in here whether you'll like one or not, but my suspicion is that you will, and I test drive a LOT of cars and put TONS of miles on my passat. Not quite track-worthy, but definitely sporty considering it's size, power, and luxury - you'll be surprised in a good way! UPDATE: After 50,000 miles, the car feels a little less reliable - seat belts don't rewind well, interior panels creak and rattle, front suspension squeaks a little. I still LOVE to drive it after 50k, but VW could have done a better job putting it together.
