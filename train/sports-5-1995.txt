The Yankees, admit it or not, are without question the best baseball team. Anyone who doesn't like them is most likely a Boston fan. Can you blame them? I don't think so. The Yanks could give 26 reasons to why they should not like them. And here they are--1923, 1927, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1943, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1977, 1978, 1996, 1998, 1999, and yes 2000. The most recent defense that the Red Sox up in Loserville have is 1918?!?!?! That's sad. But the past doesn't lie. You'd think that after 82 years that they would get the point that they sucked, but I guess they are in denial. How sad.
