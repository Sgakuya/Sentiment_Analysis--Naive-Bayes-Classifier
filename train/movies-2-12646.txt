Not for the kids; not really for the adults either. Mean-spirited and unfunny movie about a dude (Ice Cube) trying to court a divorcee with 2 of the stupidest and brattiest kids on earth (It is painfully obvious the husband divorced her just to get away from those awful kids). Oh for fun as Cube has to drive the kids from Portland to Vancouver to meet his mom in his brand new Lincoln Navigator. With these 2 kids doing everything from illegally operating a vehicle to signalling to a truck driver that they are being kidnapped to incessant spilling and puking, the Navigator doesn't stand a chance. That's basically the movie. Also the first time I seen a lead character talk in ebonics throughout a mainstream film.
