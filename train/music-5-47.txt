I definately think this is the best album ever made. When I first got this album I had no idea it would have the impact it did on me. It's spanning varitey of styles has opened up my mind to other types of music besides your typical rock. Tonight, Tonight I think is the best song on this album simply because of the brilliant use of symphony layered with regular guitar and drums. Some of the other songs that are really great include the hits like 1979, Zero, and Bullet, but there are tones of not-so-well known songs such as Thru The Eyes Of Ruby and Bodies. Like said before, there are a couple of not so great songs on this album but with 28 songs, it's to be expected. I can't understand why more people don't appreciate the talent of this band. There should be way more opinions on this page to support such a masterpiecs.
