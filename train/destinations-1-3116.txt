Whoever thinks Toronto is "world class", "friendly", "sophisticated", "center of the universe" or any combination of these, should go immediately to the ER and have their head checked. You shouldn't be walking the streets without some sort of prescription drug (although if you are a Torontonian you are probably taking some sort of anti-depressant or ilicit drug) I have unfortunately lived here for 2 years and it is the biggest wannabe copycat I have seen since Shawn Desman. Oh, New Yorkers like to honk their horns, I'll honk mine too. Oh, New Yorkers wear big ugly furry boots with tassles hanging off of them that look like a dog threw up, I'll take Daddy's Amex and buy a dozen pairs. The people are STUCK UP, especially the gold digging bitches (Toronto has the DUMBEST girls on the face of the earth) who only talk to people with a "C" in front of their title. Toronto will never be New York no matter how much it wants to imitate our friends from the south. Remember what happened to Milli Vanilli? GET YOUR OWN IDENTITY! I give it 1 star only because I am Canadian and am, since moving to Toronto, embarrassed to say that.
