At first glance, LA's tough to get around, overcrowded, traffic's a mess and public transportation is basically non-existent. Gotta watch where you're going or you'll wind up in Compton. It's funny that there's no real downtown; you'd think the downtown was where the large buildings are at but you'd be mistaken. That's the financial district and all in all is pretty ghetto. Weather is great but you've got the smog. People are cool; some say fake but who cares really. If you want a great time, what you need to do is befriend some locals. The club scene is like no other but you need to know someone who can get you into the best spots out in Hollywood. And all means, spend some time on the beach scene...Manhattan, Redondo, Hermosa, Venice...the list goes on and on...
