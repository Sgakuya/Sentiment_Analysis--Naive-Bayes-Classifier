This man was a bad youngster(Booze and Drugs), a bad student(C Average at Yale and worse), a bad businessman(Oil failed), a terrible soldier(AWOL), a questionable father(Boozer daughters), and a puppet(Cheney/Rumsfeld). The guy thinks he is John Wayne and is playing shoot-em-up with our American Soldiers. He may be a great American, but he is a lousy human being, and a terrible President. Going to church every Sunday and hating Gays does not make you a good Christian. Watch the man speak. Listen to him stutter and trip through his words. Watch him smirk. How can someone like this in a President? The Cheny/Rumsfeld gang were on the Clintons 24/7/365 until the day he left office. They threw a fit like the little children they are and now have finally gotten their way. Look at them. Look at their sneering,smirking,snarling faces. These are old sour men. Is it that hard?
