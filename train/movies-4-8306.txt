Really now, are people so offended by this movie just because it's a commentary on religion? Kevin Smith's fourth installment in the View Askew series shows a great progression in character development from the previous movies (don't get me wrong, I loved Clerks , even though the tone of the entire script was the same for pretty much everyone). Anyway, it brings up many interesting concepts about religion (not about God being female, or Jesus being black, but things like 'it's not what we have faith in, it's that we HAVE faith' (not a direct quote from the movie, just the jist of it, I think, haven't seen it in a while)). If you're easily offended, or just don't want to see Chris Rock fall stark naked from the sky, this movie isn't for you. Otherwise, I loved it (and I especially liked the Buddy Christ !)
