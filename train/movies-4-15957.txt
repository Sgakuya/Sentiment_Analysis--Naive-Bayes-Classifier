this was pretty good. Sam is a man with a 7 year old daughter. Sam is academically challenged with autistic tendancies. He is a devoted dad who is trying to raise his daughter alone. They have a wonderful father daughter relationship and are very happy together. When Lucy starts school the trouble starts. of course the all knowing staff and social worker think the girl is better off being raised by someone more qualifiedso they take her away. SAm finds a lawyer who ends up taking his case. they go through the usual court case and so called well meaning people who fight to keep the little girl away from her daddy. Thank goodness the end is a happy one. Sean Penn does a great job as Sam the devoted dad trying to get back his daughter, the little girl is adorable and has a terrific insight about what a good dad really is. {she is really kind of wise beyond her years} a very likable movie.
