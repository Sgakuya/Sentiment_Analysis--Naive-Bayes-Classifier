In 1975,this was the first album to enter the Billboard charts at #1. 27 years on,i'm inclined to think Elton (and lyricist Bernie Taupin)'s autobiographical album may even be his best,along with Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.It continues to grow with repeated listening,has unexpected depth,a brilliant fusion of music and lyrics,and feels like a well-balanced whole,without a weak link(even the less instantly appealing songs come to play their part).Someone Saved My Life Tonight is,for me,Elton's most sublime moment,and the closing Curtains (forgive the pun)also wonderful.A genuine classic that deserves greater respect.
