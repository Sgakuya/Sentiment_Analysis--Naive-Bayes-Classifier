I love Ozzy Osbourne. In my opinion, Ozzy,Alice Cooper,Motley Crue, and Dio are the alltime best performers in the history of hard rock and heavy metal. However, I can not justify giving this album a good review. It quite simply is the poorest effort of Ozzy's long and successful career. There really aren't any great tracks and they sound like leftovers from the 0zzmosis album, which sadly is Ozzy's second worst CD. I know it sounds like I am badmouthing Osbourne but I am still a fan. I am just saddened by this CD. I thought when Zakk Wylde rejoined the band, Ozzy's music would once again become inspired. However, Wylde was basically used as a session player and did not write any of the songs. Not to criticize anyone else but I was reading comments on this CD and someone admitted it was a terrible Ozzy album but still gave it five stars. I don't think that is right or doing this board a service. Ozzy has plenty of awesome music to purchase, so I will forgive him for this album. My recommendation is to pick up all of his solo stuff through No More Tears and some of the classic Sabbath material, but skip this one unless you are a diehard.
