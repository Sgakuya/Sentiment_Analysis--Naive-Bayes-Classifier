Whatever you think about Nixon, the truth behind the Watergate break-in is that he did not have anything to do with it, nor did he even know who was behind it. The White House tapes clearly prove that when the break-in occurred, he asked his aids who was behind it. Nixon thought it was the work of the FBI or CIA or some other group. And, like we know, secret agents in the FBI were behind it, namely G. Gordon Liddy. Liddy was an undercover working for the FBI. All this is established facts that can not be disputed by informed persons. Nixon was set up! All of his conversations were being listened in on by anti-American elements. Look up the recently disclosed tapes where Billy Graham and Nixon discussed the dire state of affairs concerning our media. Here's just one link- http://www.post-gazette.com/columnists/20020306sally104col2p2.asp - The same elements that control our media control the disloyal agents working within the FBI. Nixon was not liked because he was well aware of those elements. So, they took him out. Nixon was always a pawn in the big game, but he was starting to ask all the 'wrong' questions. He became a threat. Also, his demise helped aid the demoralization process going on in America since the end of World War Two, all part of the plan to weaken the foundations of America and make it more controllable for the one world gov't. But the media continues to insinuate that Nixon ordered the break-in, which is completely false. Upon hearing about the break-in, Nixon did decide to keep any new information about the break-in under wraps until (his words) we find out who was behind it . So, don't accept what the media will lead you to believe. The media has a hidden agenda and they don't mind deceiving the American public for their part in following the insidious plans of global dominance for the benefit of the O.W.G.
