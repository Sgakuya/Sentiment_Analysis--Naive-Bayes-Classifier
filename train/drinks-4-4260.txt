We have to differentiate the specific blends of rums when people give their opinions. I have had good and bad Bacardi, so please be specific as to the type of rum your commenting on thanks. Having said that, I was in the Dom. Rep. and became a fan of amber anejo Brugal. An aquaintance (who used to work for Bacardi) suggested I try Bacardi's amber Anejo. Unfortunately the liquor stores don't carry that particular rum where I live but replaced it with an 8 year amber/gold rum which I did try. This I found to be very easy drinking, smooth and silky, nice flavours, little after-taste, an all occassion drink. Though at this point in my research I still prefer the full bodied flavour of Matusalem. I do enjoy Bacardi's Ciclon amber rum (infused with 10% tequilla & lime juice) both straight and mixes well with anything, especially fruit juices, sprite/7-up.
