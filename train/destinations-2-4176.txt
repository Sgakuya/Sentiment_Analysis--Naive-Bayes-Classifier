About the only nice things about Windsor are the sights of the Detroit skyline and the fact that the streets are cleaner and safer and the parks greener than Detroit. But, the place revels in being the sleazy harlot for Detroit. What a reputation to cherish! Big gambling, big strip clubs and legal age 19 drinking. I heard when I was there that one strip club even advertised in the University of Windsor (used to called Assumption University before it was sold to the government years ago) student paper for young women students to rub their booty on men for tuition money. I would think the early devout Catholic French settlers would be rolling in their graves over what their town has become.
