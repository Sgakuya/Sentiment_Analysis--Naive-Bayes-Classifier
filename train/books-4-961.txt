I agree that this book dragged on a bit much, but you could say that about the Goblet of Fire as well. I, too, found myself not caring about certain things and I agree that Sirius shouldn't have been killed, but I wouldn't write him off just yet. Luna Lovegood gave some pretty good foreshadowing that he just might come back, say, in book 7 (because he can't come back in 6 - that would be too soon. The whole death would be a petty tease and his return wouldn't be nearly as exciting). Overall, this book carries one incredible story rather well. I almost feel bad for J.K. though, because I think after book 3, she has a lot to live up to, and I think she's trying to do that by making the books extra long (with some shock factor in the end - Cedric: Dead. Sirius: Dead. see a pattern?), rather than extra good. Prisoner of Azkaban is still the best of the bunch. Order is a close second.
