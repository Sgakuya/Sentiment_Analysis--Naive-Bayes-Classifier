Galway is a great city, especially for young people and people interested in sports, music and/or beer. There is a large number of pubs with daily jam sessions or concerts (mostly irish folk), a large student population, a lot of pubs showing sports events and a couple of sports venues in the vicinity (Terryland Park for Soccer and Pearse Stadium for GAA sports). Also it's a great base for tours of the lake Lough Corrib, the Aran Islands in the Atlantic, the Cliffs of Moher to the south or the holy mountain Croagh Patrick and Clare Island to the north. It's not all that easy getting transportation to all of these places, but that is a problem common to all of the Irish republic. I've met a lot of friendly people in the city, and in addition to all this, it is a very nice and beautiful city in itself.
