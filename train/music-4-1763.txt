I am new to Radiohead. My first Radiohead CD was OK Computer which I really like. The more I listen to it the more I like it. So my boyfriend just bought Kid A (personally, I wanted to go back in Radiohead time and get The Bends but was over-ruled). In listening to it a couple of times, the more I like it. I am starting to see a pattern in Radiohead. They are so talented and their music is so different, it just takes a while to get used to it. Kid A is a great CD and I really recommend it to anyone who has patience with listening to a CD at least a few times before giving up on it. You will not be disappointed.
