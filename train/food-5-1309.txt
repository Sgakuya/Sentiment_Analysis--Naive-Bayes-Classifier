I enjoyed Werther's Original since I arrived in the UK in 1991 from France. I would like to share with you all my amazing discovery last week of one metal werther's original oval metal box containing one unopened plastic bag of sweets. After looking at the best by date printed on the bottom of the box, I decided to open it and eat one. It was delicious and as good as new. I wanted a second opinion so I offered one to one of my colleagues who was fully aware of the date shown, and he agreed with me. He could not feel any difference with brand new ones. I have not being sick or had any digestive problem whatsoever since. The best by date was May 1999. If you find a box with some sweets in it, you might want to choose to try one before you bin them just because of the best by date. Raphael in Glasgow 20 December 2005
