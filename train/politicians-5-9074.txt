He was the greatest President we have ever had! Far better than the sorry excuse of a President we have now. Why anyone would vote for a bush is a mystery to me. I wish Clinton could have ran for another term. He was so good, and very good for the environment, civil rights, womens issues. He and his Democrat constituents helped to creat many new jobs! Now, we have a bush. The stock market has dropped, gas has gone up, pollution is on the rise, health care continues to rise. I really wish the Clintons were here. On the other hand...my wife had sexy dreams about him. She loves him more than I do, and for different reasons for sure!
