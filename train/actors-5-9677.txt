I don't think I have ever seen Cate Blanchett perform a role, that was not completely believable. She's been in several questionable films (Bandits, The Gift), but her presence was the saving grace. She's a true chamelion on screen, with excellent poise and charisma. She chooses unique roles, which showcase her range ensure that she's never typecase. Standout Performances for me were: Elizabeth, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Oscar and Lucinda and her brief appearance in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (she played Galadriel brilliantly, really bringing the etherial beauty of the character to light. Pure magic to watch!)
