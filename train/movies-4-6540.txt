A funny movie. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are both great as the two leads. Oscar was recently divorced and lives in an apartment in New York. Felix just separated from his wife has nowhere to go and moves in with pal Oscar. The trouble starts because these men are as different as night and day. Oscar is gruff, sloppy, and has a what the Hell attitude, likes a game of poker with the guys. Felix is fussy, a neat freak. allergic to just about everything. The clash in personalities, is what makes the movie funny. Just trying to live under the same roof. One scene in particular is when Felix is in a restaurant with Oscar and his allergies act up. He makes all these loud noises to clear his nasal passages and the reactions Ocar gives along with the patrons in the restaurant are funny. Well done movie.
