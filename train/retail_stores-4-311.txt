Of the mall based women's sleaze wear stores, Vicky's Secret is the best. Most women who aren't so wrapped up in themselves they demand their boob slings to be custom made are thrilled to recieve their items, especuially given most men apparently think going into the panty store is the same as publically announcing they are homosexual. In other words, if you wanna get laid, shop here! The prices might be high, but the cootch is free afterward (granted, it's never free....you can either pay a hooker, or shop for your date, but at least your date has been slightly fewer places than the average prostitiute...hopefully).
