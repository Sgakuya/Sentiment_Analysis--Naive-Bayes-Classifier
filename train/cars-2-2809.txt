Nice styling, weak engines, if you want a nice stang u have to pay around 40 -45k for a saleen, rousch or the cobra not worth it they all still have the wimpy 4.6, the 5.0's were great engines drove one decent accelaeration, mediocore handling, so-so body quality,. In my opinion ever since i think it was 86-87 when both stangs and maros had 5.0's GM put TPI ( Tuned Port Injection-quite possibly the best type of fuel injection yet) in the maros-fbirds- I think that gave it 65 horse more than reular 5.0 but anyway thats when maros-fbirds got better than stangs buy credit to ford they lasted longer than the GM's. Overall okbut today they are a disgrace to old ones which would get 4-5 stars.
