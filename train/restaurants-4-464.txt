Wendy's is one of the better fast food chains that exist. Usually, most hamburgers in fast food chains taste horrible. Wendy's, however, makes a pretty decent one (not one that will always wanna get, but better than MickeyD's and BK). I'm sure it's not that healthy of a sandwich. The best thing wendy's has to offer is their chicken sandwiches and their biggie fries (especially when they're just made hot).Most of their business most likely comes from those items, and anything in the 99 cent menu. Their salads are ok. I honestly expected better. They're too fancy for salads (such as the Manarin). All in all, if I want something fast and I'm in a hurry, I'm going to Wendy's.
