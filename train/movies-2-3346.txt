After reading all the reviews on this Web site, I thought Romeo Must Die was going to be a pretty good movie. Turns out it kind of stinks. The fight scenes were creative, but nothing too unique or exciting. The acting was almost universally terrible. And as far as the screenplay, let's just say there's no danger of it picking up an Academy Award. I'm not sure I can even recommend Romeo Must Die as a rental, unless you're really, really desperate for a poor-to-mediocre martial arts film. The only redeeming quality about this movie was that in the middle of fight scenes they sometimes use a special effect that makes it look like you're seeing an X-ray of someone's bone as it's being broken. Not exactly the best incentive for seeing a movie, I guess, but that's about all Romeo Must Die has to offer.
