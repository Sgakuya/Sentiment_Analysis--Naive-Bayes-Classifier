This movie wasn't what I expected. I thought it was going to be strictly an action movie with great, if unrealistic, stunts. Instead, the movie was more of Mission Impossible meets The Brady Bunch Movie. Much of the humor was a bit over the top, yet it was still quite funny (but, not as funny as the trailer for Dude, Where's My Car? , but that's another story). Of the three ladies, I think Cameron Diaz impressed me the most. I have been telling friends that I didn't think she was that hot. Well, I take that back. She looks great. And, she proved herself as one of the better comedic actresses in Hollywood. Bill Murray was perfect as Bosley, perhaps his funniest role since Stripes. Don't go to this film expecting too much and I think you'll enjoy what you'll see.
