Rating 4.6 ::you can make some really cool websites with this and it has alot of options! I have not yet discovered all of them! The key things I found interesting were: CSS (cascadoing style sheet sets)/DHTML/Java/Frames/ASP/Coldfusion/ASP.net apps/JSP/PHP and more! you can do all this within dreamweaver! I find that to be good one stop website app.The only gripe is that it can be RAM/CPU cycle hungry. I recommend running win2000/XP (or on linux with most of the vutual machine/win-Lin environments aval.) with more than 128MB RAM/ 750+MHZ PIII/AMD duron/atlon Processor and 16MB Video memory for graphic intensive websites.
