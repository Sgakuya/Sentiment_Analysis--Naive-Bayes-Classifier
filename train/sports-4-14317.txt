The original Barry Sanders. Gayle Sayers took some punishing hits (such was the era in which he played) and never backed down. Jim Brown's crushing style caused opponents to look silly because no one wanted to tackle him after the first time. While no opponent ever got leveled by Sayers, they were made to look like fools time and again by his near superhuman agility and speed. A premier rusher and formidable receiver, Sayers also was the all-time top kick returner when he retired (after only 7 seasons, of which only 4 1/2 were healthy). As I've mentioned with Jim Brown, you have to actually see Gayle Sayers in action to truly appreciate what he brought to the game. If you can, catch an episode of NFL films that showcases him. Remember that the players of that era had to face shoulders to the jaw, forearms to the head, clotheslines, and chop blocks. Sadly, it was just those things that cut short the career of a player who may has easily been the all-time leader in countless categories. If you appreciate Barry Sanders, watch Gayle Sayers. Cuts, jukes, spins, and afterburners that no one could match made him one of the best ever.
