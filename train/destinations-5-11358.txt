I lived in Arizona for 33 years before I finally saw this awesome hole in the ground. It really is awesome. Like other reviews have said, pictures cannot do it justice. This should be on everyone's list of places to see before you die! The only drawback is that the NATIONAL PARK SERVICE (a misnomer if I ever heard one!) has seen fit to demand an enterance fee. This is unthinkable and unforgivable. Something this wonderful and beautiful deserves to be free and open to anyone and everyone who wants to see it, and not be treated like a sideshow attraction or a movie.
