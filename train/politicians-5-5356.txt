I'm a gore Gal!!!!! I love this guy. Who gives a hoot about the war issues or the who has more experience issue, its over with people get over it. Get those critique glasses off your face and realize that we have to live here and so do our next 7 generations. The enviroment and educational issues are much more important. You can not eat money or e-mail someone who can not read or typoe or even more importantly have access to a computer. I know AL can not please all the people all the time but future generations will read about him as the first, proactive, forward moving, innovative, caring, and sincer President the US has had to date. Next to maybe Roosevelt. But Roosevelt had other issues to handle. These issues nowdays are more problematic and AL has all the right stuff to handle all the financial, economic, domestic, and foriegn calls with grace, not to mention that gal pal he has to help him, and his hip family too. And by the way I really think Al is going to take this job to new heights. Bush is a loafer, think about it. Yes, I'm a Gore Gal, maybe I'll write a song and you'all will hear it some day. GO Buddy Gore!!!
