Pretty boring and useless, i drive through virginia a lot, about 4 times a year to be exact, when i am going back and forth from North Crapolina to New York (fortunetly i won't have to do that soon because i will be moving back to new york) it is just very dull, you never see people around, i drive through Richmond every time, and the city is just dead! I guess it has a lot of colonial history, but it think i would rather visit massachusets or maybe pennsylvania for that. OH YEAH AND INDIO70 IS WRONG, Richmond was deffinetly southern, from the few people that i actually saw around that dull city, all of them were southern, they had the southern accent, the pure hate for all things progressive, and were very ugly, yeah, that was the south, the 30 foot tall cigarette you see when driving in is proof enough!
