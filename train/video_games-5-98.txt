This may be simply the greatest game of all time. It has been well surpassed in terms of sophistication of graphics and gameplay, but in the way of game design, Doom may well have done it best. The eerie atmosphere, the music, the sound, the simplicity of gameplay, the scary monsters, the impact on the industry, the invention of deathmatch and other multiplayer gaming as we know it, and the first major game to include what is now known as mod-support, all add up to classic that is hard to dispute as king of games. If you've never played it, I recommend you buy the recently-released Doom Collector's Edition Trilogy, which comes with Ultimate Doom, Doom II, and Final Doom, and then download a source-port like Doomsday (www.doomsdayhq.com) to experience the games in hi-res, with support for 3D acceleration and polygonal models.
