I added Peanut Butter to this list largely because I wasn't sure if there were any other variations of it that I wasn't aware of. The object of the game is simple and similar to Spoons, except it is largely a collective effort. Two teams of two square off with partners sitting opposite each other. The object of the game is to get four of a kind and then to let your partner know by flashing him the secret signal that is determined prior to the game. Possibly the hardest thing about this game is coming up with a relatively subtle signal. Overall, Peanut Butter (or whatever you want to call it- this is what it's known as around these parts) is a solid game that is fun and entertaining to play with friends.
