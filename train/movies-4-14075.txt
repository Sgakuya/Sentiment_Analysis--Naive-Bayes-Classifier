This is a movie that my entire family loves and always gives the thumbs-up to. On a cold Saturday night when we're all staying in together what can be better than a worthy movie to make your weekend? We've watched loads...'The Bridges of Madison County', 'Shakespeare in Love', 'Memento'...all fine films. But 'Field of Dreams' is arguably the one we take in most of all. Watch it and it's easy to see why...a straightfoward, simple story about a farmer who hears a voice whilst out in his corn field...he fears he's going crazy, but soon learns better...this voice could actually be a blessing on his confused life, if he does what he says...build 'it' and 'he' will come. The result? He tears down his cornfield and builds a baseball pitch, in the hope of attracting the 'ghosts' of dead baseball players. Result...success, but that's only the start of a long and powerful spiritual journey upon which he must embark to achieve his overall aim. Beautifully delivered with some fine performances, and moments of chill, poignence and warmth, this is a modern classic through and through. What's that you say? You don't like baseball? No problem. I don't care for it that much either, but I love this film. The script may present it with as much passion as a religion, but believe me, it's the basic underlying principles to the whole thing that make it so compelling; that is, 'if you believe in the impossible, the incredible can happen' - follow your dreams and you can achieve the best. (Be sure to watch the opening sequence carefully.) So, why have I only given it four stars? Simple. Amy Madigan. I know I said there were great performances but we all agree that she is the film's only real weak point, delivering a streak of childishness and odd acting that probably wasn't the script's intention. Sorry if you're reading, Madigan, no harm is meant.
