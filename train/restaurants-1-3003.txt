I went to the Baskin & Robbins at 302 5th Avenue Sunday evening (9/4/2005). I ordered an item that was on a photo. I asked the man to give me that item but to substitute the ice cream pictured on the photo with no sugar added ice cream -- keep all of the other ingredients the same. Photo: 2 scoops of regular ice cream substitute those 2 scoops with no sugar added ice cream Whipped cream Chocolate chips Brownie Is that simple enough? No. He struggled to see the picture which was facing me, then proceeded to give me one scoop of the sugar-free ice cream and one scoop of the wrong ice cream in a tiny cup. Problem #1 He didnt comprehend what I ordered and was not familiar with the product. Once I realized that he didn't know what he was doing, I asked another employee who seemed to be able to communicate better. The second man put a cherry and nuts on the item. Problem #2 - There were neither cherries nor nuts on the photo of the item that I ordered. I pointed this out by peeling the photo off and showing it to the men so that they could see what my order looks like. He scraped some nuts off, piled on whip cream and put it on the counter. Instead of the item I ordered, he prepared 2 scoops of no sugar added ice cream with whipped cream in a cup. He said that it can't be prepared like the picture because they don't have what's on the picture. Problem #3 - Tell the customer that you are missing ingredients required to prepare what they ordered at the time of the order. Don't assume that it is okay to substitute ingredients (nuts instead of chocolate chips), omit key ingredients (brownie) and add additional ingredients (cherry). What do you want me to do? He asked impatiently. I told him to keep it as lesson to be learned about communicating, and walked out angry that they had attitudes when they were in the wrong!
