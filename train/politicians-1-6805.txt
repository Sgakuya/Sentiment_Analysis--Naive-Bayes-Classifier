A truly dangerous character. Here's an inconsequential opportunist who represents no discernible constituency or group, yet trumps up some sort of phony think tank as his home 20 in a pathetic attempt to establish credibility. This only works on the droolers who have less than two brain cells. Bauer is essentially a Johnny One Note alarmist who has no use for the separation of church and state and wants to shove his mutant Christian morality down everybody else's throat. And we're expected to be grateful for this because supposedly it's good for us. This is the type of pinhead who emboldens other anti-abortion wackos to commit crimes against humanity, to harm and kill innocent people for the sake of an ill-advised and illogical political agenda. Bauer should shut his ignorant trap and actually do something that benefits the children we have living in the world already instead of manipulating programmed religious nonthinkers and wasting the time of everybody else by incessantly pushing hot button issues and coming up with no plausible solutions or answers. Maybe he should be lobbying heavily for better education, universal health care for children, crack-downs on deadbeat fathers. He should be putting together adoption support networks that would empty the orphanages and charity wards of every unwanted child instead of stroking his own ego and muddying the waters of public discourse with his platitudes and nonsense.
