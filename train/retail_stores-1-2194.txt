I recently applied at said retailer. After completing three separate interviews all handled in a professional manner, I was scheduled to meet the Store Manager at a prescribed time. I waited over an hour and thirty minutes without an acknowledgement or information of any kind. When I inquired as to when I might possibly be seen, I was told that I was next. This is now almost two hours past our appointment and I had another meeting to attend. When I asked to be rescheduled, I was told that the Manager now had no interest in meeting me. What kind of organization survives with this kind of H.R. skills? I now know why Frys sales people by and large have little knowledge and poor customer service. Their management does not respect the individual or his time and this attitude filters down to the floor.
