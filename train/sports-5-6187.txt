update: playing defense is unheard of durham?? how many national defensive player awards have we won? i think Duke's not too bad in that department. iluvseanmay you are mistaken this is a quote taken from an article from the acc website about Williams being a contender for player of the year Williams is the league's leading rebounder (11.4 rpg) and shot blocker (3.69 bpg). so you might wanna get your fact straights, and quite frankly even if you still think sean may is better you cant justify a one star rating seeing as he clearly is not Terrible UPDATE acc defensive player of the year...where was sean? UPDATE like omg sheldon williams is totally not cute, i would like so totally not date him, but sean may is like super gorgeous, i know this has like nothing to do with basketball skill in anyway but like what else can i say i like just so totally want sean may to marry me, sorry if i'm like really annoying because i cant like stick to the issues.
