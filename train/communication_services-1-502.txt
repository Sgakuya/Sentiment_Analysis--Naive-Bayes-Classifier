We have been with Alltel for a few years now. We just started having problems with them. It is terrible. We have to go to the store and have our bill fixed every month. They charge us roaming charges that we are not suppose to get. We switched plans to avoid this and now they are saying we owe money that we do not. The store has even told us we do not owe the money, but customer service says we do and they cut off our phones. I would not recommend Alltel to anyone. It is a bigger hassel than it is worth. I wish we did not even have a cell phone. We are almost up on our contract and we will switch to someone else.
