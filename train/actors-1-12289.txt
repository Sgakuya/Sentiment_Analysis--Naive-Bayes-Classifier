Honestly, Halle Berry is really all looks and no real talent. If you call monster's ball good acting then I really have nothing to say to you. So she took off her clothes -oooh, I'm sure that was very hard for sweet, innocent Halle Berry to do!(sacarsm) The Academy Awards believed that it was time for an African American woman to win so that it would look good on the academy and Halle Berry was more or less the scapegoat. There is nothing extraordinary about Halle Berry - people are just fascinated by her beauty. Her beauty has gotten her so many roles that could have gone to other actresses who would have done a better acting job.
