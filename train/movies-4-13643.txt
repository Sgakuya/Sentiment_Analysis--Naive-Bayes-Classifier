An intense, at times chilling movie which showcases the amzazing acting abilities of Edward Norton. Norton is so convincing - so charismatic - and so articulate in expressing the racial hatred of his skinhead character, that i left this movie more depressed about the prospects for racial harmony in the US, than I was when I went in. Clearly the movie tries to show hope through Norton's transformation - but for me, the impact was the exact opposite. There are always going to be downtrodden people looking for a scapegoat for their situation, and there will always be charismatic people like Norton's character to organize these losers, and to direct their collective hate towards one group or another.
