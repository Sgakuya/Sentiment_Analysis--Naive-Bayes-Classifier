I ordered a couch. They brought me the wrong couch. After repeated calls and delivery appointments booked, I never recieved the proper couch that I bought. I would set a deliver time with them and they wouldn't show up. After six months of no couch I had to ask for my money back. The Bay never apologized or even cared that I didn't get what I bought. The phone staff are pathetic, they don't care about anything. It's like talking to a brick wall. I am amazed they are still in business. My advice is don't buy anything that has to be delivered from The Bay - you will regret it. A friend of mine went and bought a couch from The Bay after I did - I told him not to do it, but he did anyways. It was suppose to be delivered on a specific day two weeks after the purchase - but it never showed up. He called them everyday 2 or 3 times a day after that - he got his couch 1.5 months.
