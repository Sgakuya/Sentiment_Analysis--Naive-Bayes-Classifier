One of the best representatives of America in a long time. Her stances on Bosnia and Kosovo reflect an empathy and sincere desire not to see our boys, as well as other NATO peacekeeping forces, die unnecessarily. Like it or not, the world sees the U.S. either as a meddlesome imperialist (which we have shown ourselves to be - witness Lebanon, Grenada, Somalia, Vietnam, etc.) or as representatives of the little guy who is being harrassed by larger 'bullies' (such as sticking up for democratic elections in Haiti, Panama, the Philippines, South Africa, Namibia, etc.) While most of these examples did not take place while she was secretary of state, she has proven herself more understanding of other peoples and cultures and has not seen the world in U.S.-good, everyone-else-evil terms. Bill Clinton may have goofed with Aspin, but Albright has proven to be a gem. I hope she continues her truly humanitarian ways.
