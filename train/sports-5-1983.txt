The greatest team in the history of all of professional sports and my absolute favorite by far. They're truly the team of the '90s (most certainly not the Braves, who only won 1 world series in the decade), the century, and the millenium. I am a die-hard fan. Out of the 160 games they played this year, I watched at least 3 innings of 154 of those. Of course since they are the 3-time reigning champions, they are subject and sought after for pointless ridicule. The Yankees are a team of class, professionalism, and sportsmanship beyond all others. They are the definition of excellence. Well, the series is now over and the Yankees FULL season win record stands at 125 games and the Mariners, despite a 116-win regular season, finished with only 120 wins after the Yankees won in 5. They have clinched their 38th AL pennant They just go about and do business without getting their emotions too high or too low. A brief history of this New York franchise: The Yankees moved from a defunct Baltimore club in 1903 to NY. They were known as the Highlanders until 1913. They got the interlocking NY in 1909. They play at the best and most historic place in sports, The House That Ruth Built Yankee Stadium, which they moved to in 1923 after playing in the Polo Grounds and being forced to leave by the Giants, who thought the Yanks were stealing all the attention from them (the two actually faced each other in the 1921 world series which was an experimental best of 9 series and the Giants won in 8). So many of the greatest players have played for the Yankees: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle, Berra, Rizutto, Ford, Jackson, Mattingly, Boggs. Now the new names are added: Jeter, Williams, O'Neill, Posada, Martinez, Rivera. 26 world series since 1923. They won a world series in '27 with murders row featuring Ruth, Gehrig, Combs, and Lazerri won with Ruth hitting 60 home runs during the season. They won the famous 1932 world series where George Herman Babe Ruth called his shot against the Cubs. They won 4 in a row from '36-'39 and then in 1941, '43, '47, and 5 in a row from '49-'53. They had a great series in which they lost in '55 against Brooklyn in 7, then won in '56 with Mantle winning the triple crown. They routed the rest of the league in '61 when Mantle had 54 homers and Maris had 61. They won in '77 and '78 back to back with Reggie Jackson, Gossage, Willie Randolph, Chris Chambliss, Guidry, etc. They then got Mattingly in the early '80s and he was a hall of fame first baseman but retired before ever winning a world series. Then, in the early '90s, they acquired the core of their team: O'Neill, Williams, and Boggs (for '96, and he had the best eye I've ever seen at the plate. He is one of the best hitters for average after WWII.) They completed the great feat of coming back from 0-2 in the '96 series against Atlanta. They then lost in the first round in '97, followed by the historic 114 win '98 season. They went 11-2 in the playoffs that year and won the World Series in a sweep, swept the Braves in '99, and beat the Mets in the Subway Series last year in 2000. The great thing about this team is that they home-grow most of their great players: Jeter, Pettitte, Rivera, Williams, Soriano, Posada, etc. They also have the best bullpen which has propelled them to the last 4 out of 5 world series and 3 in a row. If they are lacking in an area, they acquire that talent. In '96, they got Cecil Fielder, in '98 they picked up Knoblauch and Brosius up in the offseason, in 2000, they picked up Justice during the season. Well, I could speak so much more about the greatest sports team in history, but there it is, a very brief history and opinion of the New York Yankees.
