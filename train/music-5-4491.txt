Skisero stated: clay should just walk out on stage, pull his pants down, spread his cheeks, and take a big dump on the stage. it would be better than inflicting the atmosphere w/his junky music, and much more artistic a statement. I genuinely believe in everyone's God-given right to his or her own opinion, as well as their right to express the same. I hope that you will respect mine, as well. I truly believe that in addition to a man or woman's actions, their words, whether spoken, written or sung are outward expressions of the true inner person. That being the stated criteria of judgment which I use, Clay Aiken has more class, taste, character and integrity, in addition to artistic ability, than you dared to have attempted to express in your immature and unimaginative two sentences. If you have personally witnessed Clay Aiken in concert and this is honestly how you felt about it, so be it. However, if you have never see Clay Aiken perform live and see how he relates to his audience on every level and how his voice, wit and personality have matured over the last two years, then you have no sound and first-hand proof on which to base your opinion, as we are rating Clay Aiken (in Concert Tours). I, on the other hand, have been to several and am qualified in my opinion. Thank you.
