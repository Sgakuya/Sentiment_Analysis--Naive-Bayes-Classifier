I thought this was a very good movie. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. Kevin Spacey plays an alien who has been institutionalized for psychological problems. Jeff Bridges plays the psychiatrist. Both of these men do an outstanding job. It's a well-written mix of astrophysics and psychology and is somewhat of a mystery itself. I'm not entirely sure of the credibility of some of the psychological concepts they explore, such as hypnotic regression (it is possible to create false memories, but Bridges relies on them nonetheless) or the ability to perform hypnosis on a non-human if they exist, but unless you're really nitpicky like me, it probably doesn't matter. It's definitely worth seeing.
