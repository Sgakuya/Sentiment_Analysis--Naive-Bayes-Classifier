Let's just say that this is not a soup for a person on the go. And it ends up costing more too. When you get it out of a can you need to mix it with milk (especialy if you buy broccoli and cheese) it calls for one can of milk and the soup. Well for this you nees to be at home the soup plus the milk does not fit in to a bowl. Less milk nees to be used. After microwaving the soulp and milk are still not mixed the condensed chunks of soup are just chilling there. You nees a goog tool to mix it up and that will cause a mess. So you pay about $1.29 for the soup and another 1.99 for milk. Oh, and milk needs to be in a cold place. So if you are looking for a quick on the go lunch I would not recoment it. But the flavor is good.
