I've lived in Calgary my whole life and I continue to be amazed by Banff everytime I go. It CAN be expensive, but it doesn't have to be. You just have to know where to go. The Hostel is nice and it's $25 a night. The Red Carpet Inn is also pretty nice and one of the lower priced hotels. Also, if you're not into hardcore hiking, Tunnel Mountain is close to the town site and a fairly easy hike, as is Norquay - a nice place to go for a picnic and you can drive all the way up. It has a fantastic view. For dubber check out The Grizzly House. It is AMAZING! Well worth the money, though it is quite expensive. You can try elk and bear meat in a very authentic atmosphere. Reserve early. If that's not your style, Melissa's also has really excellent food. For night life, Wild Bill's is good, they have bands on weekends, more pub than club. If you're looking for a club atmosphere, Aurora is wild! Check out the Banff Hot Springs, nothing is better after a hike!
