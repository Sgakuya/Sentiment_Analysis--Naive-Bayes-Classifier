All my life (49 yrs.) I have been taught if it isn't Hills Brothers it isn't coffee. My mother is 83 yrs old and has drank an average of 20-30 cups(8 oz @) per day and hasn't ever found anything to be as good. My grandmother lived to be over 95 yrs old and loved a good cup of coffee too. All these younger people want that coffee from these little franchises that stink of old burnt bad roasted beans. I would love to work for Hills Bros. and campaign to keep them going forever. So would my children and step-children. Even my grand children like to play at grown-up with the coffee milk (thats three to four table spoons approx. of coffee to 3/4 cup of milk 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and powdered milk mixed for them to add). Serve with homemade biscuits and either jam/marmolade or honey. Nothing like teaching ediquette at an early age. My granddaughter Veronica had at age 3 the idea she had to raise her pinkey like great grand mother Mimi and become a princess and a real lady.
