When I first saw Dakota in Man on Fire, I was sheer awe struck at her ability to bring out such emotion on screen. I completely broke down at the end of that movie. As an actor, she has an amazing sense of the roles she plays and the ability to become her character on screen. I went on to see Hide and Seek, where her performance was astounding and right up there with Deniro. Seeing her in I am Sam was one of the greatest joys and I feel she completely deserved the screen actors guild award (which she won for her performance in that movie at the age of 7). Dreamer was truly one of the most touching family movies I have ever seen and am not surprised that the director replaced a boy role with Dakota Fanning. I most recently saw Uptown Girls and was actually touched very deeply by it. Dakota role was essential to have a realistic performance in that film and I felt she captured her character completely. Plus it was adorable watching her in that role. I have not yet seen War of the Worlds, but hear that at the end of the movie, it is not Tom Cruise that everyone remembers, it is Dakota Fanning. She has touched me as an actor, and I hope she will have a long successful career. Plus, she is soooo cute.
