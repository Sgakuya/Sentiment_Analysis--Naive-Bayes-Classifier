King's Quest 8: Mask... is a great game in its own right. It is really sad however, that Roberta Williams decided to take it the direction she did. The KQ series has always had a reputation for non-violence and wholesome family fun. Now, gone is the Disney charm that made the series famous, to be replaced with dark environments, blood vomiting monsters, throat slitting, and beheading. At its core, however, is an actual adventure game, with good puzzles. It is also huge, and the music is great. I think they deliberately left out the number 8, though, as this is not really a continuation of the series as much as it is an offshoot. Instead of chronicling the adventures of one of the royal family of Daventry, instead it tells the tale of Connor McLyrr. Not much is known about him, except he is from the village of Daventry. Anyway, a monk has apparently broken the sacred Mask of Eternity, causing a vile tempest to turn everyone into stone, except our hero. He was spared, apparently, because a piece of the mask landed at his feet, protecting him. Connor must, as he learns from a half-frozen wizard, he must seek the other pieces of the mask in 6 other lands, restore the mask to its rightful place, and kill the evil monk who caused the damage. I wish it had more to do with the other KQ's. King's Quest 7 was the last true KQ game.
