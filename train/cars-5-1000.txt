I have a 2001 Camry and so far its amazing but it has some bad qualities: 1- Should have parking sensors 2- Should have a cruise control 3- Power Stearing is not as strong as an american car 4- Should come with atleast a 15 tires ( Standard ) 5- Body should be a bit solid Good Qualities: 1- Economical car it terms of fuel comsumption and spare parts 2- Powerful engine specialy the V6 3.0 LTRS 3- Powerful AC 4- Standard sound system is not bad 5- Clear and smooth dimensions to see 6- very comfortable seats 7- Amazing saftey features Therfore guys its strongly recomended for families who are targeting a combination of a luxary and an ecnomical car with an attarctive look
