After hearing about Jesse Jackson's love child, I think that Jackson has an obligation to step down from the ministry. A minister should live a life of honor and integrity. If you can't do that, don't become a minister! It sounds pretty simple. I wouldn't go to an obese nutritionist, for example, or a dentist missing a front tooth. Expectations are attached to every profession, and they're no secret. What's even worse about this situation (besides the fact that Jackson's love child will not be brought up in a stable two-parent family) is Jackson's hypocrisy. That he was counseling Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal while carrying on his own sleazy affair is reprehensible. I find it hard to believe that anyone would seek spiritual advice from Jackson after he thumbed his nose at everything he supposedly represented.
