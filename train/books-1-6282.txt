Found this book at the dollar store, should have left it there. This man goes onto ONE fire, and it makes him an expert on the subject (including the eating preferences of Hispanics and Native Americans). He explains how hard it is to become a wildfire fighter, but he didn't explain why he didn't even try at all. This book is written in the tones of those awful narrations on TV (World's Wildest Police Chases). Exxagerated descriptions of typical events. I think the author would have done better to have at least tried to become a wildfire fighter; went out to fight fires for several seasons; and then sat down to write a book about it. This isn't his story, this is a story that somebody else told to him. In my opinion, I overpaid.
