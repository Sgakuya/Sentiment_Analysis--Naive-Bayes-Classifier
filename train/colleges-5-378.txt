Well, technically I am not enrolled in the business school ie. the MBA program. However, I am a BCOM student (that is McGill's term for an undergraduate management student). While the core management courses are at sometimes questionable, McGill's reputation, faculty, and diversity make it an excellent choice. As an undergraduate student you are given the ability to take management courses in conjunction with those in the arts and sciences. This allows one to gain a greater perspective, and provides a relief from the monotany of the management core. Montreal, is also an undeniable benefit of studying at McGill, it provides numerous cultural diversions and an atmosphere conducive to studying business. I have enjoyed both the classes and the diverse student body. I highly recommend this school!
