I have installed windows in my home @ 26752 Calaroga Ave, Hayward, CA, 94545 from Home Depot Fremont (Relo) 43900 Icehouse Terrace, Fremont CA 94538,(510)490-0191. I have spend $3200 on windows. After the installation when Hayward city did inspection on my property and told me that Bedroom windows are wrong. Window opening should be more that it was. They gave me a ticket to replace them. I spoke to Home depot manger about this. I told them the product they sell me is not per coded. He told me that he can't do anything it was not Home depot responsibility for the size while they charge me $ 50 for size. Their representative went to my property for sizes. My question is How stupid and unprofessional they are? How they can sell unsafe, not per coded product to the customer. My advise not to buy any product from them. make sure you check everything before you buy and have them write on a paper for you or they will cheat with you the way they did with me.
