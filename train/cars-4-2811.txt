Never owned one, but drove many. The first was a black 1965 260 small block V8 three speed pony car with a center tunnel shifter. It was great fun and simple. You could really throw it through the turns and when it, as always, broke loose, get it back easily on those bias ply tires used back then. Then came the 1970 army green 302 four speed. This remains my favorite all-time body style even today. The louvers were great and it was all around fun to drive. The 1971 got too big and sloppy. Then came the Charley's Angel's years which, well, enough said? Finally Ford woke up and built the modern Mustang. Unbelievably the 2000 through 2004 were the best built cars in America (Yep, check the stats) with a great power plant and good handling. They were also the most expensive cars to own in total cost per mile ("And that's a bad thing", Martha Stewart). The truth is that they have evolved from the early practicality of an economy car to expensive and impractical toys for a small market segment who feel compelled to drive machines that exude testosterone type images and project unsubstantiated masculinity. They are, however, fast and fun if you like those things. Personally, I have always preferred the small four cylinder types that can pass up service stations more than twice a week. So the next time you're out there plowing down a country road in your Ford Mustang, look in the rear view mirror, it could be me you see sitting behind the wheel of my Focus SVT, bored at the slow pace and anxiously waiting for you to hit the highway and finally pull away at 10 to 15 miles per gallon!
