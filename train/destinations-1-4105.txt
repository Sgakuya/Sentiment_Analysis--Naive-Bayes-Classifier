Las Vegas is America at it's worst. Having been here three months, and having come prepared to have a great time, with little or no preconceptions about the city, it has been the most disappointing and depressing place I've visited. If you venture from the cheeseball kitsch (which most don't) of the strip, you'll find a city that feeds on it's poor (an overwhelmingly ubiquitous bunch) and serves to provide only the most hollow entertainment for the lowest common denominator and line the pockets of the richest among them. If that is your cup of tea, come visit, by all means. (And the weather, for most of the year, leads one to wonder why the World's Largest Adult Playground was built in a totally uninhabitable environment). It smacks of an unfortunate experience that I had as a teenager, when my family visited the Virgin Islands; we were whisked from the airport to the resort via taxi and passed some of the most underdeveloped, depressed areas i've ever seen. But enfolded in the lush resort, the gates shut securely behind us, the false poshness of the area only served to remind me of the poverty outside. Few other guests in the resort seemed to be affected; but the only locals I saw for the entire visit were changing the sheets. It is the same dynamic here.
