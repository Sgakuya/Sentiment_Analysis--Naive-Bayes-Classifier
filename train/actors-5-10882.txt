One of the few times great beauty met great talent. She was splendid in Giant , showed extreme versatility in Butterfield 8 , stunning in Cleopatra and continues to blow me away each time I have the strength to sit through Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf . On the private level you have to give her some credit - she seems to have a big heart and puts a lot of effort into trying to help people. If she just wouldn't come off with that Oprah-esque goddess/guru to the entire world attitude. Nice of you to help Liz but with your screwed up personal history I'm afraid we can only get so serious about your less than qualified advice on life. Squirt of perfume anyone?
