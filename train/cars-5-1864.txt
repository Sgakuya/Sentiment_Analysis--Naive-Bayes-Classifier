I agree with Astrol. If those people who had rated the Hyundai Sonata actually driven it, I'm sure they would have given it a higher score. I have driven several different sports sedans, and I would give the Sonata the highest bang for the buck award. It has it all - quickness, handling, styling, and safety. One test drive and I knew I had to buy this car. I chose the GLS model with the V-6, as the 4 cylinder made a little too much noise. If I had a choice between a BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Saturn, or Hyundai, and money was not important, of course I would go for the BMW or Lexus. But since it is, the Saturn or the Hyundai would be the top on my list, and when you add the 100,000 mile warranty, hands down I would take the Hyundai. I drive over a 100 miles a day, and I love doing it in the comfort of my Hyundai.
