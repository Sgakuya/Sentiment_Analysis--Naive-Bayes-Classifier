SORRY,I KNOW NADER CAN'T WIN,AND EVEN IF HE DID HE COULDN'T GOVERN.HE'D HAVE ALMOST NO VOTES IN LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO GET HIS AGENDA THRU.YOU GOTTA START SOMEWHERE, THOUGH AND THE THOUGHT OF GIVING MY VOTE TO A DIME STORE PHONY LIKE AL TURNS MY STOMACH.I'D PREFER GORE OVER BUSH,BUT ONLY IN THE SAME WAY I'D PREFER DYING INSTANTLY IN A CAR CRASH OVER BEING THROWN THRU THE WINDSHIELD AND INTO THE TREE I JUST HIT SCREW AL GORE, SCREW W, AND SCREW THE CONDITIONING THAT HAS LED US TO ACCEPT THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM AS THE WAY THINGS SHOULD BE.THIS ISN'T A HORSERACE.YOU DON'T WIN ANYTHING IF THE GUY YOU VOTED FOR GETS IN.AND YOU LOSE BIG TIME IF YOU THINK LIKE THAT.NADER IS THE ONLY ONE WHO'S TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.MAYBE--A BIG MAYBE,IT WILL GET THE ATTENTION OF THE SO CALLLED DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT THEY HAVE ABANDONED THEIR CORE CONSTITUENCY---PROBABLY NOT.WE'RE DOOMED.
