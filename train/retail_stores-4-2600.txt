as a food lion employee, i can give you all my honest opinions whether you like them or not. first, food lions are usually dirty, but this is mostly because of the retards running them. newer fl's are clean, organized, and mostly good. produce is good, but that's only because we display it that way. meat- i dont know, i'd buy somewhere else anyway. prices---yes, prices are a little high, but we give AWESOME customer service. try getting that at your local wal-mart. We are not a union shop, nor will we ever if i have a hand in it, unions tend to screw everything up more than it was before, trust me my dad lost his job because of a union. In summary people, it's not the associate's fault prices are higher than a competitor, you cant find something you found at another store, or that the company doesnt have handles on our paper bags, if you dont like it, sorry. Rude people need not shop here, nice people we will bendover backwards for. get over yourselves people. work retail for a year, and see what i mean
