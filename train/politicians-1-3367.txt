I only gave Dubya a "1" rating because this site does not have negative numbers. Bush is much more stupid than my dog; although, in reality, this may not be a fair comparison, as my dog is a border-collie mix, and border collies are acknowledged as a smart breed. Bush possesses a classic quality of using really stupid reasoning to effect policy that negatively affects not only Americans, but people throughout the world. I am proud of my country, and especially the soldiers who protect our freedom; it is criminal that an idiot like Bush is able to command them to put their lives on the line for some bullsh*t like oil. We all know that nobody would care about or interfere in the events in the Middle East if they didn't have a buttload of oil. With luck I will some day be able again to tell people that I am a native Texan when the memory of Bush's moronic legacy fades a little. Then again, this is only an opinion; I hope that the small percentage of far-right constituents who can read and understand simple sentences are not offended by my views.
