Definitely the most gorgeous city on the face of this planet! Contrary to what many people say, most of the people are quite friendly. I have been there twice now, and each time I had a wonderul expeience with the Parisians. Monmarte is my favorite section during the day. I love strolling through the streets watching the artists paint. The best onion soup you'll ever has is also in Monmarte. Of course there are all the wonderful museums. Last time I was there we visited the catacombs, which is abolutely amazing. If you ever get a chance, visit Claude Monet's home in Giverny. You can truly see how he was inspired to paint all those water lily paintings. L love Paris!
