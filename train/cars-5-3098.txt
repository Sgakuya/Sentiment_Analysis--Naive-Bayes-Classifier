Hey bopeep! I noticed not very many people have found your commment helpful. Smart arent they? I have a Dodge Stealth r/t if you know what that is. Probably in the same class as the Supra. Have not had any problems with it and its performance is great! I also noticed you get desperate and you keep resorting back to Chrysler and not the topic, Dodge Viper. Ugly? YOU have to be kidding, most normal people including myself think it looks a hell of a lot better than that low profile supra. FAce it I can tell you are afraid to stand up to a Viper. YOu cant get it through your head that a Viper looks better, would smoke you any day, and has a lot of American Pride put into it. When you insult the great Dodge Viper you insult america. Go live in Japan with your precious supra. MOran.
