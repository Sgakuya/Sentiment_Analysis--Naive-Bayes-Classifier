Minkeydude obviously has the type of narrow, uncreative closed mind that would exclude him from being considered for acceptance in the #1 international business school in America. The school sits on the donated site of the famous Thunderbird Army Air Corps of WWII fame, west of Phoenix, thus the name. The student center/cafe sits in the old control tower, and one of the old large hangars has been converted into a large assembly hall. The old runways are gone and replaced with lush Sonoran Desert landscaping- pretty unique and good-looking campus today. And you can now relax, Minkey, because T-Bird is now called Thunderbird, the Garvin School of Management - a married couple of grads started a business out of their garage and made hundreds of millions, donating a mere $60 million to T-Bird. So it is Thunderbird (Garvin School of Management) now. As a T-Bird grad who attended before and after the major changes of 1990 (Many new buildings and services in Glendale, doubling of student population) I can say for certain that the reputation has always been great overseas, but now it is also solid with employers who 1. know about the school and 2. desire employees with the multi-cultural business skills and flexibility so essential to business success today. One Minus: My weakness was finance and I did not get everything I wanted from the program but I also chose the marketing track. Two of my jobs over the past decade were secured from T-Bird alumni referrals. My salary offers have been at or above the MBA average, and I('m sure my MIM gave me a leg up in securing two overseas assignments, and I also knew once I got there how to be successful, thanks in part to the T-Bird training. I am also amazed at how many successful independent business owners T-Bird churns out. I worked in college for a multi-millionaire real estate investor and restaurant owner and only a decade later found out he was also a T-Bird.
