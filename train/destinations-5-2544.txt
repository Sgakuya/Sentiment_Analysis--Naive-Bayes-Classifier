I have been to Maui twice first time was on my honeymoon we took a 7 day cruise to all the Hawaiian Islands and decided we liked Maui the best, so we decided to go back and stay at Maui for 10 days for our 1 year anniversary and it was the BEST vacation I have ever been on in my life. We are going back in two months for our 2year anniversary. The road to Hanna was fun and we saw lots of breathtaking scenery. It was also cool driving to the Volcano. The big beach was nice there was also a nice beach on the road to Hana that is very secluded. Maui is awesome, we plan to go back every year for our anniversary. Opakapaka fish is to die for, it is so delicious definately get it when you go to Maui. If you are looking for a nice hotel at an affordable price stay at Kanaplai Shores very nice has a fitness center and spa and is right on the ocean. I can't wait to go back in two months.
