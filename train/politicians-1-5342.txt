Can someone please tell me what in the heck is wrong with the american people today? Come on people! I have to belive that all the supporters of Gore are Jerry springer fans. I mean, if you are going to support a lieing ,snake, kiss ass, pathetic excuse for an administration then go back to your soaps and talk shows where your mentality can be put to use. Americans want change and to move on. When I see Gore using celebrities, Mtv, Jesse Jackson, and dont for get his loyal kiss to good ol Tipper( that made me throw up) I just cant belive people are buying into his lies. Wake up!!!!!! Please, for the sake of our children, vote for honesty, vote Bush.
