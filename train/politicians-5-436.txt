Mr. Blair; You are going through a tough time right now in trying to do the right thing for your people as well as for the world. I hope that you can hold on and stick with your convictions. It is rare in this day and age to see two leaders like yourself and President Bush, who are brave enough to stand for a principle and stick with it. The people who are railing against you do not have the ability to see in the future, nor do they have the stomach to correct wrongs around them according to the need. My sympathy is with you, and I and my family thank you for your bravery. You will be rewarded in History, I am sure. Just in case History is altered, there will be many Ann Frank-type History Books,(thanks to self-publishing) which will record the truth. Sincerely, M. Friend
