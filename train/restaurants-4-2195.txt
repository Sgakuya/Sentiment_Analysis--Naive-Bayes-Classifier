There's nothing like getting a Tripleberry smoothie at Orange Julius to pick you up. It's pretty hit-or-miss when it comes to which flavors suit the individual, and there are some that you're probably going to think taste horrible, but you find the right flavor, it's great. At some locations (perhaps all, I don't know for sure), they have the option of adding vitamins and such into the drink for an extra boost (Never tried it myself, honestly, but it's kind of neat to know that they offer it). If you try it once and the flavor's not for you, I'd encourage you to not get discouraged and try to find another flavor that might be suitable to your palate.
