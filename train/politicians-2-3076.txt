Here I'm rating Bill Clinton's ability as a politician and not his policy proposals. He was a very talented politician, but a very good liar as well. However, despite his talents and popularity, he was never able to get a solid mandate from the people. First off, he never won a solid plurality of the people's votes. In 1992, he only got 43% of the vote, in 1996, he only got 49% of the vote, and both times he ran against fairly weak opponents. It's a shame because despite all of his talents and all the potential that he had, Clinton utterly failed in administering the executive office. He had no cohesive foreign policy and his domestic agenda was tied down by a hostile Congress. Probably what kept him from accomplishing a lot of his goals was the fact that he never had a mandate. Much of it had to do with the fact that the man himself was flawed morally. I hate to judge these types of things, but lets face it, the guy shot himself in the foot so many times by doing low things like appointing cronies career public official positions in the White House and accepting campaign donations from dubious donors. The sex scandals showed that Clinton didn't have enough character to tell the truth, to stay loyal to his wife, and his lack of self control. But that should have stayed out of the public eye, that was between him and his wife ultimately. Some people claim that Clinton had an active governing style, but I would say that it was very passive and highly reactive. Overall, he didn't have a big vision for the United States despite all the talk about building bridges to the 21st Century.
