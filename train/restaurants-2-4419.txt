I am more of a sea food and chicken person but I often like a steak. I found that when I went here 2 times my meat was raw even after I said medium to well done. It was medium rare. I was left to starve waiting for 15 or 20 min to get my steak back. I heard that someone kept sending there meat back too for rawness and someone saw the waitress throw the meat on the floor after it was cooked again. GROSS! Its all very greasy too. the meat flavor is not bad but you have to ask for well done to get medium and also the meat is kind of thick. Its always croweded and a 45 min wait or more and its not worth the wait!
