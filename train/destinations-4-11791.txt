The World Famous San Diego Zoo is truly the King of Zoos. Every species of animal you would ever care to see is featured there. Their gorilla exhibit is superlative. And though you get rushed through the panda exhibit, where else would you even get to see a panda. Other personal favorites are the hippos and the children's zoo area. However, there is just a bit too much zoo for a family of 4 to handle. You will be exhausted (it's hilly) if you try to do the entire zoo in a day. There is also an overabundance of bird and reptile exhibits that, while many species are majestic, you start to say, see one snake you seen them all. The zoo has gotten much more commercialized than my last visit there in 1997. It seems they have replaced beasts with bistros. In the final analysis, something to the magnitude of the Philadelphia Zoo is more palatable.
