I think what separates Matrix Reloaded from the majority of Hollywood blockbusters out there is that not only were there jaw dropping special effects - there were - but there was also enough ideology/philosophy mixed in to make you feel like you are watching something with substance. I never thought I would actually say this, but Keanu was great - not just passable - but great in his role as the christ-like Neo, and Lawrence Fishburne was charismatic and powerful - especially in his unflinching descriptions of his faith (though he seemed a little too chubby to be a believable bad ass). Throw in some great bit characters like the incomparable Monica Bellucci and the lock maker, and you have a very good, very entertaining movie.
