This was defenitely a good seat-of-the-pants car-oriented thriller. There were no boring moments and the character development was very followable throughout the movie. The reason why we do not give this movie a five-star rating is because, at the beginning, when the Porsche is being stolen, in the first scene, when it races away it is shown to be having trouble even keeping up with a Honda Civic!! That defenitely bombed the realistic effect right off the bat! The destruction of the Shelby Mustang 500 was defentitely a tear jerker (it certainly didn't sound like a 429 powered car though, more like a rodded 302). I for one am here to testifly that the smoking of tires went on long after the movie ended! In conclusion, I want to say that I would love to see it again!
