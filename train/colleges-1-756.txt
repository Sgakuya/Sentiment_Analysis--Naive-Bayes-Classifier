Capella University was a complete waste of time and money. The only rigorous experiences you can expect are their attempts to drain your pocketbook. Having attended real universities, prior to paying a huge amount of money to Capella, I was appalled at the lack of academic integrity basically, pay your money and you'll finish. One of the bizarre things you'll notice about Capella and their students is that they refer to themselves as "learners" - that should be almost offensive to anyone who is really concerned with the attainment of a genuinely rigorous educational undertaking: a cat can learn to use a litter box, a rat can learn to use a Skinner box, a dog can learn to drool when a bell has been struck. Learning can be a passive activity that also implies there is a finite point at which it stops (which is what you'll experience at Capella). A student, on the other hand is one who is actively engaged in the acquisition of new knowledge; a process that never stops. If you want to be a learner who merely connects the dots of poorly written (and generic) syllabi created by faculty that really aren't actively engaged in teaching Capella is the choice for you. Spend your money and get your piece of worthless paper.
