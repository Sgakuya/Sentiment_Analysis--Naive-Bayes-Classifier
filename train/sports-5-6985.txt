Larry Joe Bird is the best player ever. I give him the edge over MJ because he's the best all around player and a player with the most heart. Someone mentioned he had 69 triple doubles, i've seen a clip where he runs 3/4 the court and dives headfirst into the tables for a loose ball. I've seen him make routine passes that were just mind bending, and i've seen him clutch shoot in every situation possible. Just because he couldn't dunk and wow the fans every time like michael doesn't mean he's less a player. Michael is no doubt the most popular because he's the most spetacular to watch. Yet Larry Joe Bird is the best because he is the best of the best.
