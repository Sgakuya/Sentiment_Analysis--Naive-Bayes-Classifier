The man is scum. And if it isn't enough that we had to endure him for eight miserable years, he continues his shameless self-promotion, no matter what the cost. I deplore this man and feel he has taken this country so far into ruin that we may never recover all the way. An egomaniac such as WJClinton should be muzzled and kept in a cage. His narcissistic behavior is an indication of mental illness. He is ILL. I am so sick of seeing his ugly face on television, and I know I'm not the only person who thinks so. His exit on President Bush's inauguration day was a prime example of his love affair with his own image. All of that hoopla was orchestrated by the Jerk himself, to appear wildly popular. Shame on him. What a sleaze!!
