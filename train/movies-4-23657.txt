I really liked the first Matrix and i don't know what I was expecting with this one but I was a little bit disappointed in the storyline.The whole love story thing was a little much. Although it pretty much explained itself in the end. I also love when movies start with excitement and then do that whole explain what happened in the end thing I think after the third one comes out a lot of things in the movie that seemed like they were going nowhere will be explained so I'm not really that upset. Okay, I will admit that i really liked the love scene (that's just because I could see myself in Trinity's place *hee* I love that man) It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't the first Matrix either. But that happens a lot with sequels because the first movie is always something new and then the second and third movies go into the story more so they have to do different stuff to keep the audience's attention. Anyway, I give it 2 thumbs up!
