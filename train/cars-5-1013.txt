I have a car (91 Camry), not a hobby. It's a great car for those who have a life and need to get to it. Those who believe that a life will somehow fall into their laps because of their vehicle are doomed to be disappointed by the Camry, as well as generally in life. It won't beat many cars off the line, but it handles well enough to be easily controlled at well above the speed limit on the highway (don't try this at home, kids ;-). The few minutes which I lose to more powerful cars initially I easily regain once up to speed, as the owners of more conspicuous cars slow down to avoid yet another speeding ticket. Their higher insurance rates and deplorable gas mileage make me smile while I zip past them. If you're a mechanic and like to spend time fixing your car, base your self worth on the attention that your car gets, have money to burn, or simply don't have anything better to spend your money on, then the Camry is not for you. If you have places to go and people to see, as they say, then it's a damn fine way to travel, without wasting gas, money, and time, and without being harassed by police and other distractions.
