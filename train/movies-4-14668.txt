A movie about dancers with the majority of the lead roles both acted and danced by dancers--a refreshing change of pace! The movie has a lot of dancing-only scenes, which is great for dancing enthusiasts or dancers but may be too much for those not into ballet or dance in general. I thought the music for most of the dance scenes could have been done in a more original fashion. Also, finally a movie that shows how purely athletic, and he-man , male dancers can be! This is pretty much a chick-flick, though, overall. Great to see dancers dancing their own roles, easy-on-the-brain plot, few but great male dancing scenes included, a very entertaiing, feel-good movie for anyone who is a dance, esp. a ballet, enthusiast!
