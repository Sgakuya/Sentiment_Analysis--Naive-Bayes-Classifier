I read the HUGE 600 page version of this book a few summers ago. . .yes, it has long-winded chapters. . .yes, it sometimes seems like Melville was paid by the word. It was on its way to 2 stars but for a terrific ending. . .problem is, it takes a LONG TIME to get to that ending. Ocean trip is a metaphor for the travelling/expansion/conquest of America (among several messages/metaphors/ect.) Chasing the White Whale does represent an ultimate obsession we all deal with at some point in our lives. . .Racial issues raised in the book make it ahead of its time. I don't think it's Great Literature but it is a quintessential American book and doesn't deserve revisionist anti-dead-white-male literary bashing necessary for acceptance by leftist faculty and grad students.
