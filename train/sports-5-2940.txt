Great player. Yes. Great person. From what I heard: no, but I personally didn't know him, so I can't judge him on that. He made baseball into what it is today. He was the best all-around player (in terms of pitching and hiting goes). He lived in a baseball society that if you hit 30 home runs, you were like a king. He was hitting 50 every season, imagine how he was treated! Every pitcher feared the Babe. If he had not pitched in his career, maybe he would have 800 home runs! Yes, maybe he showed off and would taunt the opposing pitcher, but who doesn't? When Sammy Soso hits one out, he does that leap thing. When Ken Griffey Jr. hits one he stares at the ball for a while, trots around the bases and has that look like he expects the pitcher to fear him. They are fan favorites in the league. He's slow? So is McGwire (think I spelled it wrong!) but he is loved by so many. For some of you, stop trying to dis the greatest ever, but respect him as he shaped out what is know as: BASEBALL.
