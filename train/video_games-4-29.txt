For the person who loves blowing people away such as in a Doom-style game, then stop reading this review. This game isn't for you. If prefer to stealthily walk up behind a person and whack him unconscious this game is for you. You reprise your role as Garrett, master thief. Set in a time period which can only be described as medieval meets the steam age your ultimate goal is to uncover the plans of the city sheriff and a madman named Karras. Karras has made your life difficult. Why? Well it appears he is creating cyborg-like people and motorized machines that can be described as steam run terminators. Thus the name of the title, The Metal Age. These creations hinder your task as a thief by working as security guards, but also their is something much sinister behind the plans of Karras and his minions. Unlike the human guard who can be dispatched by knocking them out cold, or a quick arrow to the heart, these machines are much savvy. They are difficult to knock out, they are good at tracking you, and so requiring the use of your handy water arrows to kill the fire that runs these steam-driven terminators . It takes a precise shot and thus adds to your challenge. Machines aside, one of the more intriguing missions requires you to sneak your friend into a castle to meet his lover who has been locked up by a cruel mistress, and to harm absolutely no one or the mission is finished. Of course how can you resist helping yourself to the valuables while inside the place...no harm there! Another challenging mission is following a guard (guards are your enemies, you ARE a wanted thief after all) in the shadows without being spotted. It will probably take you several tries. If you liked the first Thief you'll love this game. The graphics and colors have been improved and the video sequences are well done. I didn't care for fighting zombies in the first game and fortunately there is little of that here. If you are up to the challenge, Garrett and wealth await you!
