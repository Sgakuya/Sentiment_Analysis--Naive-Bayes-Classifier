About twice a year, suddenly, unexplicably, I get a craving for a Burger King Whopper. I pass by the nutrition information sign's warnings that the sandwich I'm about to consume contains 64 grams of fat, belly up to the stainless steel counter, and order a fast-food burger the size of my head. Ten minutes later, I survey the aftermath... a plastic tray bearing a paper liner covered in ketchup and french fry crumbs, mayo drips, mustard spatters, a stray pickle, a few sesame seeds, a tree's worth of crumpled up napkins, half of a suicide soda (usually a conglomeration of orange pop, dr. pepper, cola, and sprite), and a crumpled up Whopper wrapper. Mighty satisfactial. Half an hour later, my body revolts against me. How could you do this to us?!? Severe cramps. I feel like I've eaten a bucket of Elmer's glue or raw horsemeat. NEVER again, I claim, usually out loud. Never again... four months later, the cravings return. Don't ask me why. Mind control. It's all mind control.
