As a fan of both Samuel Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, I was disappointed with Rules of Engagement. The premise is that Jackson, a soldier assigned to protect a U.S. embassy in the Middle East, orders his men to fire on a crowd of protesters (including women and children). There is an international outrage, and the government wants to make Jackson a scapegoat, claiming that he acted inappropriately. Jackson then gets Jones to serve as his lawyer. The movie raised some important moral issues associated with the modern military, but other than that I didn't get much out of it. The acting, script, and storyline were all mediocre at best, dull and misleading at worst.
