I thought I heard some poor underinformed muscle car dummy whining about the Corvette lagging behind in technology because they still use a pushrod V8. When changing to the LS-1 engine GM did extensive research with all valve train configurations, and found they could fit the most HORSEPOWER in the smallest SPACE using the push rod setup. What are the three main items on the bottom line in engine design? Power, Reliability, and Fuel Economy. Show me a car with the performance numbers of the 2006 Corvette that still gets about 30 mpg highway (Motor Trend) overhead cams, multiple valves, or not. If you can ride in a 2006 Z06 Vette and you are able to remove the smile from your face by 2007, then you go ahead and complain about "lagging behind in technology."
