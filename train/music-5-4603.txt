I saw The Who several times on their last tour and they were great. For one, like now, they hadn't put out a new album. As a result, the concert was a parade of greatest hits. Second, they still had great chemistry and energy on stage. Sure, Pete wasn't busting any guitars these days, but they really look like they were happy to be out there. Lastly, if I understand correctly, these shows will be in smaller venues which is a recipe for great shows. The first time I saw them on the last tour was in a small hockey arena in upstate NY and it was incredible (fortunately, I had brought ear plugs because they were using the same sound system that they were going to use at stadiums later in the tour).
