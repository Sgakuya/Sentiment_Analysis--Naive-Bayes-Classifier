Jesse Jackson is a true criminal who belongs behind bars. His phony Rainbow Coalition and sidearm group Operation Push is nothing but a tool to extort large sums of money from businesses attempting to conduct safe and normal operations in predominately black neighborhoods. This has been SOP in the cities of Chicago and Detroit for almost 30 years. I know for a fact, because I personally delivered corporate dollars to Jesse for the undisputed purpose of restricting criminal activities (robberies, thefts, property damage, etc.) from occuring at our places of business. The FBI has been wise to this for many years but refuses to take action out of fear of a black uprising. Jesse eventually sacrificed his brother-in-law, who went to prison for Jesse's illegal activities, but the FBI refuses to go after Jesse directly. How long will America allow this criminal to breath our air? Is anybody out there ready, willing and able to finally eliminate him?
