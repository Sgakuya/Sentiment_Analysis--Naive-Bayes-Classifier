Savannah has done a good job preserving its historic architecture. There are plenty of small parks in the city where you can relax. Also, they throw a fun St. Patrick's Day celebration. Just a few miles away is Tybee Island, where you can relax on the beach. There are plenty of historic memorials nearby too, such as Fort Pulaski. Shopping and radio stations are very good for a city its size. Also, driving habits in Savannah are good compared with the rest of Georgia, especially north of the fall line. On the downside, the quickest way for most of the rest of Georgia to get to Savannah is I-16, which is a very boring drive.
