 A Confederacy of Dunces is one of the best books I have ever read. The story revolves around the unforgettable Ignatius Reilly, a bizarre young man who lives in New Orleans with his mother and spends his days recording his world view on Big Chief tablets. At his mother's urging, Ignatius finds work, and the book chronicles his hilarious adventures at various jobs, including a stint as a hot dog vendor in the French Quarter. The story is incredibly funny, but it's also very touching. Even more interesting is the story behind the book. The author, John Kennedy Toole, committed suicide at 32, before the book was published. His mother was convinced that the book had merit, and somehow she persuaded a Loyola professor to read it. The professor immediately recognized the young man's talent. In 1981, the book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. If you enjoy high comedy and excellent writing, I highly recommend this book.
