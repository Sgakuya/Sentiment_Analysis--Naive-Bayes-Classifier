Harrison Ford has been a tremendous part of my life since I was 11 - that was a looong time ago. At first he was a schoolgirl's crush and I published a fanzine on him, then I went through my college/grad school years as a snot-headed English/Cinema Studies major putting him down a bit. I went through the old cliche Brando-De Niro phase and nodded my head vigorously when Bryant Gumbel in an '88 Today interview asked (or commented) why Harrison wasn't considered a great actor. Now in recent years I have tried to come down to earth and see him for what he is: a solid actor (with admittedly limited range but even De Niro has his limits), a hero, and most importantly a team player. But allow me to scream childishly, Harrison, what's with you and all these young actresses??!
