If I had to rate one item/place/thing on this site a 5 above all else - it is Berlin. There is no other place I would rather be and no other city - American, European or otherwise - can compare. If you are travelling to Western Europe, I hardly think your trip is complete without a few days in Berlin. From the open-air concerts to the Reichstag to the outdoor cafes near Potsdamer Platz and Alexanderplatz, to anything your senses want to take in - the time seems to stand still while you soak up the warmth of character, hospitality and true fun that is the new Berlin. I recommend in addition to the "usual" sights: the Indian restaurants near Oranienstrasse, the shopping near Unter Den Linden, Queen Nefertiti's bust at the Agyptologische Musee, Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg, and Schloss Charlottenburg to name a few. See you at World Cup 2006.
