Judy Garland is probably best remembered and engraved in people's minds as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, but Judy has brought so much more to life in my eyes. The Wizard of Oz was the first movie of hers I saw and I was so mesmerized by her that I thought she was magical. I will always remember her singing Over the Rainbow and it will make me smile because she has brought magic into many children's lives through the years. Aside from The Wizard of Oz her performances in Meet Me in St. Louis and A Star is Born are priceless. She had a wonderful voice and I will never forget it. I realize that she is known as such a tragic figure and it really is sad because she was such a humorous person with so much vitality and life. It breaks my heart to know that her life was taken extremely too soon. Her memory will always remain with me and through the eyes of children forever.
