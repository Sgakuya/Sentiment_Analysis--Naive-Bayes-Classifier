Ladainian Tomlinson is the real deal.LT has had no serious inury yet and will break emmitts rushing record unless he does get seriuosly hurt.It ain't all about stats either, look att his best games of the year and look at the teams they played.220 agianst denver (#1 against run) they win in overtime.217 agianst the defending champs (they won).153 against the raiders (#3 defense in NFL last season) won again in overtime.The most impressing thing to me is how strong he finishes these games, against denver he had 57 in overtime alone, still running over men down field.Against Oakland the 19 yard run that won it in overtime splitting a linebacker and a safty for the win.How many times did the #1 rusher (Ricky Williams) lead his team past opponents in overtime after 35 carries.Wait I forgot he plays for the chargers.But wait didnt they pick up all pro reciever David Boston and all pro fullback Lorenzo Neal.Last six years Neals running back who he blocked for has rushed for a thousand yards.Now he's blocking for LT. Drew Brees has found a big play reciever in Boston. That alone is going to force the defense to step back instead of putting 8 even 9 guys to the line.LT's also eating 8 small meals a day instead of three large meals so he can lose weight to get faster and quicker. LT faster and quicker? yes, and you better believe it.He was 220 pounds last year, now hes dropping to 215. Theres no doubt in mind that LT will dominant next year with marty ball. Ladies and gentlemen believe me when I say that LT is the real deal and that he will re write the record books just like he already has re written the chargers franchise records. Enough stats for you PBeavr. And im 16 years old.
