I was at the 94 Orange Bowl when Tommie Frazier outplayed Charlie Ward. Make no mistake Ward was great at everything. Had the NFL not viewed black OB's through such a 1940's prisim Charlie Ward would have been great there as well. Since Andre Ware failed in the NFL people were wary of anoter black QB. Before the draft Ward told the NFL not to draft him if he wasn't a #1 rd pick. Look at the film and he was much better than McNabb. This was before 1998 when the NFL finally accepted black athletes as QB. Sad but true. Daunte Culpepper was a phenom and that is what it takes for someone to change their view. Then Vick came along and now the black QB is widely accepted. However, many in the NFL and fans remain skeptical. This bias cost Frazier the Heisman in 1995 as well.
