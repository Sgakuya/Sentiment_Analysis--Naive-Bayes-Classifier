I've read many of your comments; some I totally agree with and others sound downright ignorant!!! Let me share this with y'all...I'm African-American, and live in Philadelphia...I've lived here my entire life. However, I was born in Knoxville, and as a child/teenager I would spend my entire summers on the East Side of the state. I've never experienced racism in Tennessee, but I have been called the N word while living in Philadelphia... Let me just point out that Tennessee has some of most breathtaking scenes man could ever behold!!! I love the state that I was born in, and it is my intentions to relocate there one day...
