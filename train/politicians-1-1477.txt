Let us review a few things. Pinochet - Took power through military coup. During this, was supported by USA. Built up money through vast national resources. Killed thousands of innocent people to consolidate power. Hmm, who does this sound like? The answer: The Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussain. Yet, of course, one fatal difference emerges. Pinochet was content to remain serving US interests. Saddam got too independent for his own good in American eyes, and so was stopped. Other than that, I see little difference between the two bloody dictators. Except of course that conservatives still see him as a saviour of Chile. The hypocrasy shown by the right is again, despicable. I think the thousands of people killed or hurt by Pinochet's bloody regime would not agree that the saviour of Chile was Pinochet. And where did they get their facts on Allende? Allende was not communist, in fact he was barely a socialist in his views and still tolerated capitalism. Neither was he a terrible politician . He was not the best, that is true,but any man who could unite splinter left-wing groups, get a socialist-policied government elected, and get more popular (see my 2nd point for an explaination) in the face of US economic blockades for no reason other than it didn't like Allende's government, World Bank loans reneged on, and a continual terrorist problem fron fascist death-squads, the man must have had something going for him. Second point: It was not 34% that got Allende's Popular Unity group elected. It was 36%. This is irrelevent, but do try and get the facts right. What you seem to be implying, though, is that you have to have at least 51% of the vote to be considered the true government. Democracy doesn't work like that, dear. The government is the party with the highest percentage of the popular vote, and with more than two parties in the running, as is the case in most countries, it becomes very difficult for any party to gain 51% or above. The last time it happened in Britain was 50 years ago, but you don't exactly say that it is not a valid government. I doubt either of the US major parties got more than 51% in the last elections either. And anyway, it wasn't because of the low majority the Allende government had that caused Pinochet to start the coup. The plot for the coup started when the government increased it's electoral percentage to 44%, so vote numbers are woefully irrelevent to this. Pinochet was a dictatorial murderer, who should have been indicted for human rights abuses years ago.
