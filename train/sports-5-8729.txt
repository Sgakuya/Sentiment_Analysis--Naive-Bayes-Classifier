Bobby Jackson was wrong about Dirk being a soft player. I'm tired of people assuming all white players are soft. In one game against the Spurs, Dirk got his tooth knocked out, instead of sitting out the whole game he came back and finished the game. Since Steve Nash and Michael Finley left, Dirk is finally becoming a leader. He doesn't settle for 3 pointers as much, now he drives to the basket. He's a fun player to watch and he's on a really good squad this year. If the national media actually paid attention, they would see an excellent b-ball player. I'm not a homer, but I think he's a top 5 or definite top 10 player.
