The Mazda RX-7, specially the FD3S (Third Generation RX-7), encompasses the soul of the rotary enthusiast. It is one of my dream cars to acquire and tune. I've seen many a clean tuned machine being produced out of Japan and a few here in the United States. It's high revving 13B-REW motor is one of my favorite designs of automotive artistry ever produced. Many people complain about the Rotary being hard to maintain or hard to tune, but those people normally have either 1) received a used car that was poorly taken care of (worn apex seals etc), 2) just attempted to increase the boost pressure, without properly taking care of the boost control and cooling, or 3) [my favorite], is just ignorant on how the rotary machine actually works and just f*cks it up.
