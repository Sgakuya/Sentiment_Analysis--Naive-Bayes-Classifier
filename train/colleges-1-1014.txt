I'm a senior and absolutely hate the college. In high school I was an A student and didn't even work to my potential. At Chicago, I work my ass off just to maintain a 2.5 GPA. I tried to transfer out during my first 2 years at Chicago, but I could't make a good school because of my Chicago grades- and I can't even think about applying to graduate school. I'm majoring in Economics at Chicago and the tests are so difficult and I have to repeat 2 courses that I failed. The Professors only really care about the graduate students here. There is NO school spirit here, the athletic facilities are horrible, the surrounding neighborhood is a dangerous all black ghetto, and most people at elite east coast private universities consider Chicago a safety school because of its high accaptance rate. I'm so depressed and jealous of my friends at Michigan who have high GPAs and are having a great time in college.
