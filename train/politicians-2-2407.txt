He never was all that impressive until 9-11 and I believe that is why he was put on this planet, to help people during 9-11, but he would not make a good president, how can any Repub support a man who believes in pro-choice, allowing gays to be married? A man who IMMORALLY lived with his girlfriend while still married?? The guy is a joke otherwise, his wife kicked him out of the mayors mansion, he lived in an apartment with his girlfriend while his non-elected wife lived in the mayors mansion--LOL, if he can't stand up to that, he won't be effective against terrorists. Plus, I wrote off New York when the world was sending them money to help rebuild, to help displaced people, to help get business back in business again, and HIS idea was to then spend New Yorks money on a new basebal stadium, talk about an idiot!! That is why I am GLAD that NY did not get the Olympics, or other large venue stuff now, because obvioiusly they want to collect sympathy money and spend their own money on trivial stuff like baseball stadiums!
