Romeo and Juliet was a movie created by Baz Luhrman. Although this movie didn't agree with all of Shakespeare's original play--Romeo and Juliet, it did have several good points. One such point was the vows exchanged in the pool. Water is the sign of life and the scene in the pool supported this. I also liked how he created their costumes to match who they really were in the movie. Such as Juliet, who was really an angel to all, and Paris, a guy that represented what everyone wanted to be. This movie wasn't the very best Romeo and Juliet, but it wasn't the worst. One last thing that I liked about this movie was the way the ending. It made the movie more ironic and dramatic. Instead of having Juliet wake up to find Romeo dead, and eventually kill herself, she woke up all happy and then turned sad as she found out what Romeo had just done. The music also added a nice touch!
