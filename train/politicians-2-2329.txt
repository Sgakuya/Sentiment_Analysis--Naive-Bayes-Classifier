I don't think that we really have enough information regarding Colin Powell. He readily admits that were it not for affirmative action he would not be where he is. He appears to be pretty middle of the road on everything. His selection as Secretary of State seems to be more politically calculated than one based on merit as a statesman. I will wait untill I have more information before I draw conclusions, but I am guarded over rating him to highly. I do not understand his or the administrations attitude toward Israeli action in response to Palestinian behavior. It seems to be almost anti-Isreal, which to me shows a lack of understanding here. The administration certainly does not represent me in its approach.
