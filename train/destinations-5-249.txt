I have been all over the world and Sydney is my favorite city. I have visited twice and I have only scratched the surface of the list of things to do. Great public transportation (no need to take cabs). Diverse restaurants. Nice folks (I did take a cab from the airport to our hotel and left my camera in the cab. The driver brought it back before I realized it was missing!). Great shopping (The Rocks and elsewhere). Very clean. Festive atmosphere. The one downside is the price of the international class hotels but many of the little historic hotels (particularly over the Irish Pubs) have been restored into boutique hotels that are quite resonably priced. They are exactly the sort of places that I seek out.
