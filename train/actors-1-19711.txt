Schwimm (I like to call him Schwimm ) has never portrayed a likable character: not on TV, not in movies, and not in any public appearances. It's not that he's a master of playing annoying characters; he's just annoying. There are other actors who almost always play unlikable characters (e.g. Phillip Seymour Hoffman) but are obviously great actors. Schwi (I like to call him Schwi now) is not a great actor. Like Tom Cruise, he is always the same character: himself. Unlike Tom Cruise, he has zero charisma. So, Wimmer, I wish you luck in all your future abysmal movies and Hollywood Squares appearances, and I hope your eyebrows mutate into ravenous fleshworms that burrow an intricate network of tunnels and nests in your cranial cavity.
