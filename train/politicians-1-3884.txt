As I was watching the presidential debates, I noticed something about Bush. I thought it was my imagination, but after telling someone else, she said that she had noticed the same thing. What we had noticed was that Bush looked scared. Then since the second debate I have heard some women from Texas, that were interviewed and they all said that Mr Bush couldn,t be trusted to keep his word. That coupled with the fact that he seems to think the only way to correct social problems is to execute prisoners makes me concerned about him as the next president. ( of course that would be one way of lowering the population of this country). Maybe I'm not understanding him, but he talkes about being a compassionate Conservative and how he wants to help everyone, but his state is not ranked very high when it comes to the less fortunate in having health insurance coverage. When the presidential campaign began I wasn't certain about which candidate I would support because Al Gore was not a very interesting man, but with what I see about G.W. Bush I can't trust him. ( As I watch him I sometimes wonder whether his family talked him into this race and he wasn't really sure about it).
