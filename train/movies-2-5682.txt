An overblown piece of racist garbage. I can't begin to list all the things I hate about this ode to the good old days of slavery. This single film has done more damage than any other you can name, this side of Triumph of the Will. It perpetuates the myth of the genteel Old South and the evil Yankees, while pretending that all the slaves were happy darkies who positively enjoyed the privilege of being owned by a bunch of white jerks. The only true line in the film is Gable's: The South has nothing but cotton and arrogance. And aside from everything else, I could never figure out why anyone thought Scarlett O'Hara was worth the time of day. I just wanted to slap her silly! Anyone who takes this film seriously should be required to view Glory about ten times-- maybe then they'd understand what the Old South was really like, and what the Civil War was really about.
