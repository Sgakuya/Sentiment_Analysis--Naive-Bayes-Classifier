Every single Delta flight that I have been on has been hideously and inexcusably delayed. I missed my mother-in-law's funeral due to Delta's inefficiency (a 3 hour delay which could have been avoided). The planes are old and shabby and some of the cabin crew in economy class are rude and dismissive. And they don't even fly wide body on their longhaul routes - they have 8 777s in their entire fleet, no 747s, resorting instead to decrepit 767s for 8-10 hour flights. Food is awful, and now they have a policy of charging for snacks on domestic flights and non-softs on international flights. An average 2 hour flight delay on each of the four sectors I flew recently. I hear they're going bust and I say good riddance.
