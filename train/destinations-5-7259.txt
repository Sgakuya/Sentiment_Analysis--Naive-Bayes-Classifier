I agree with the previous poster about the bagpipes in Edingburgh being unforgettable. I would make only one ammendment. They sound so peaceful and idyllic from a distance but up close and personal it just sounds like loud obnoxious screeching. For instance when you step out of the rail station and there's a guy on the sidewalk playing for tips and you feel like someone just suckered punched you when you stepped around the corner because it's so loud and overpowering. However, a couple of blocks away you don't believe it was the same guy as it softens. The city though is incredible such a beautiful place it really is incredible. I would go back there in a second. The castle it's enormous and a definite must see. Everything about Edinburgh was great the buildings, the streets, the people.. on that note we were supposed to stay with a relative and there was a mix up so we were in some random pub with our packs, met some locals and stayed at their place over night. How's that for nice?! How many times have you invited perfect strangers in need to stay with you?
