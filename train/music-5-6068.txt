Who says the first disc of Garage Inc. sucks? The first album is by far better than the second. I've listened to Metallica since Master of Puppets, so I'm not just jumping on any bandwagon! This CD just goes to show that a band canb grow musically and still remember their roots. And to all the morons who say Me tallica has sold out, Guess what, when a band makes money, they are not selling out. When a band changes their style, they are not selling out, they're trying to be musically diverse and grow into a new sound which noit everyone will like. One more thing, when the band cuts their hair, THEY RE NOT SELLING OUT!!!!! MTID!!!!!(Metallica 'til I die!
