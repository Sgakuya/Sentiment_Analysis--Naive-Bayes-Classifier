This book was a tremendous let down for me, in part because I had such high expectations. Camus took a powerful concept (a town shut off from the world, being ravaged by a plague) and turned it into a dry, soulless documentary. Camus takes great pains not to allow the story's narrator to inject any emotion into the story - instead focusing on a factual examination of how the plague affected the dynamics of the town. The result for me was that I felt nothing for the story's characters, I never really got to understand what made the town tick, and I could have cared less if people lived or died - it just never seemed real to me. Maybe the translation was bad, maybe I missed the point, but in my humble opinion, the Plague is not worth reading.
