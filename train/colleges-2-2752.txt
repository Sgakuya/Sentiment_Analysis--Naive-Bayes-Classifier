I have been working with University of Phoenix for a year now, and I still have not been able to get my first course started. I am a doctoral student, and because of a mishap during my first course, I had to start all over. The professor would not discuss a missing assignment that was due to a technology error. Despite hard evidence to support my case for a grade change, or even a grade review, I was not heard. In fact, there IS no policy for grevances other than a very mild procedure for cases "other than everyday emergencies.) I was also lied to about the costs and give three different stories by my academic and financial advisors. By the way, they are not counselors, but advisors, and they don't have supervisors, they have managers. The university is a for-profit organization and as such, does not work in the interest of education...only the bottom line.
