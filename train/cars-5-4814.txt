This has been my favorite truck ever since I was 9 years old. They were always big and powerful, and now, with the reintruduction of the Hemi engine, the Dodge Ram has become even more of a giant in the truck category. And, to fill the performance truck niche, the Ram SRT-4 is one of the leaders in the industry with unrivaled power and torque. Sure, people can gripe about whats wrong with the ram, but no truck is perfect. The Dodge Ram has been around long enough now, however, that most if not all of the kinks have probably been worked out. The truck will tow, haul, and perform just like the day you bought it even at 100,000 miles. What more could you ask for in a truck?
