I love Charlize Theron so much, she is one of my all time favorite actresses. She seems soft and delicate, retaining much of that classical beauty that seems so overlooked in Hollywood with the drudgery of modernism. I love her lips, and her seductive eyes- a lot of people say she has a chubby face, but i think that adds greatly to her beauty and gives her that 'welcome home' smile. As for her acting, I find that she gives stunning performances in emotional roles- a beauty disheveled and misplaced in such roles in the Devil's Advocate. Sweet November (although somewhat of a bland movie) was given great light by this sweet young actress. I really hope that director take her into some really powerful films I have a feeling she'll do real well.
