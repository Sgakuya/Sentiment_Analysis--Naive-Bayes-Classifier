I don't know what they put in this stuff, but it's addictive! It's a japanese treat, a little stick-shaped buscuit coated with a silky frosting-like coating in all sorts of flavors (strawberry is my favorite); there's chocolate, too, for the chocolate lovers. It's so easy to polish off a whole box without even thinking about it. Just a question: I've searched, and I've searched, but I can't figure out what makes Men's Pocky for MEN only!! It's supposed to be a dark, bitter chocolate coating, but no one has really figured out a satisfactory reason for it, and since the Pocky website is in Japanese, it's not like I can figure it out from them. If anyone knows, please post or message me about it!
