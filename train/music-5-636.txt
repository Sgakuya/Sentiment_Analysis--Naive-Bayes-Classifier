5.0 out of 5.0 Stars: Amazing!---Pearl Jma really pulled out all of the stops on this one!1998's Yield is one of the finest pieces of music Pearl Jam has ever created, and it is one of my favorite albums of all time. I will try not to make this review as intricate and in-depth to the extent of where I mention and review every indiviudual title on this album, for I fear that I will go off-topic and ramble about how much I love Pearl Jam, but what I will say is that there is such a number of variable songs that increase in quality and entertainment with age. Do The Evolution is one of their heaviest and most-rocking performances to date, and a true return to their early 1990's form. Faithfull and In Hiding are truly great, accessible, up-beat rockers. All Those Yesterdays and No Way are great reminescent, reflective piece of music that are quite simple to sing-along to. Although, I find every song on this album superb (Yes, even the Red Dot Song . I perceive it as a humorous, light-beated break from the agressive, hard-edged Do The Evolution ). I suggest this album to anyone who is displeased with the majority of the repetitive, monotonous music that is being released today and wants to relive the genius that is Pearl Jam, or anyone who just wants to put a great piece of rock history in their collection. Great Album.
