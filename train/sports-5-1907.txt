Someone here said that buying a championship is easy when you have Steinbrenner's deep pockets. Might be something to that. However, George wasn't around for the full 23 (or thereabouts) championships that this glorious team has won. It's obviously the great talent that has graced Yankee Stadium over the decades that is its shining glory. And I suppose that through the years other deep pockets (beside Steinbrenner) helped. But that takes nothing away from my admiration for this team. Loved them from my boyhood days in the early 50s and still cherish my Mickey Mantle baseball card which I have somehow managed to hold onto (along with a Whitey Ford).
