I don't think I'll ever forget the day my Soarer arrived. It's unbelieveable to think that everyone I showed it to thought it was brand new. What other 8 year old car could do that? I always challenge people to look at the cars of 1994, or even back to the very early 90's when this model was released. Does a 1991 Merc or BMW turn heads. No. Does a Soarer. Oh yes. This car is totally unrivalled. No other manufacturer can offer the bullet proof Toyota reliability, world class luxury, looks to kill and amazing power. My 3L 6 out performs all the other cars I've driven, including the V8 BMW 540i and Commodore SS V8. My first car was a Soarer - my last car will be a Soarer.
