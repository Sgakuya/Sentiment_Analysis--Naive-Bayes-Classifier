Certainly the best burger place in America. It puts McDonald's to shame. This is the only burger joint in the country where you get fresh meat cooked right when you order it. Their fries are my favorite. They make Burger King fries (with that sickening crispy coating) taste like garbage. They even make a good chicken sandwhich and Manderin chicken salad. Good chili too. I won't comment on the service really, because it totally depends on where you go. A fast food restaraunt in a bad neighborhood means you're going to get lousy service. A fast food restaraunt in the suburbs usually means quality treatment and speedy service.
