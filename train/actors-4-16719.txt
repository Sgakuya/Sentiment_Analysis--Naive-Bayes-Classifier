Originally, I would have given him a 5, but currently I really have to say that I don't like his character on GH (Jason) very much. I liked his character with Robin, sometimes with Carly, loved him with Elizabeth, but ever since he's been with Courtney, I just haven't been able to stand him. I think that the writers are totally messing his character up because he is totally out of character!!! I don't care if he's with NOBODY as long as it's not Courtney. I just think that ever since they've been together, Jason is completlu boring. I want to see my hard core enforcer back. Not this mushy, lovey dovey Borg, because it's really sickining to watch. GIVE ME BACK MY BRUTAL JASON MORGAN, and THEN I'll give him 5 stars!!!
