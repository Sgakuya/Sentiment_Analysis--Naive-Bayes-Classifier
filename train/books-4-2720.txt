I am your average 27 year old person, wife, mother. I am not any self-help, motivational, needy freak! However, I recently purchased this book. My husband and I saw an ad for it and actually got excited. I am about halfway through the book, and have to admit that Bill Phillips is quite the motivator. I am more interested in the excercise and nutritional program rather that the pep talks but he does a good job. If you are looking for a guide to healthy eating (for the rest of your life, not crash dieting) and some good advice on excercise programs, pick up this book. If you are in need of motivation and true stories accompanied with before and after pictures, this is also the book for you! I will let you know how it goes once we start the program!
