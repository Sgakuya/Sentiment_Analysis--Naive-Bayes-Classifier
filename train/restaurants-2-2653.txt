Was the place to go when you were young. They, like many other chains, seem to have made ingredient changes over the years, thereby losing the original flavour many of us grew up knowing. The question of cooking the fries in oil with beef flavouring is one example. The small chains have been picking up the extra business quite easily. If not for its history, it may well have bit the dust years ago. (Does anyone recall identical chains such as Carroll's?) With way too many worldwide franchises (hey I've seen 3 McDo's in a span of six city blocks), they now seem to be attempting to stay afloat by masquerading as a toy store that sells food . Also, if you aren't exactly thrilled by whining and often screaming children, be forewarned.
