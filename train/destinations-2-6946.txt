I like scotland and i've lived there for years, but...i must be honest, Glasgow is the worse place in Scotland. If you visit Scotland....Glasgow is just a place for shopping, it's more or less like London in England...it's a mess. It's pretty grey also...not a lot of green at all i mean. There's few parks...a lot of different shops...you can buy anything you like... but Glasgow is not the essence of Scotland..I prefer to go towards John O groats...that's where you discover the real Scotland. Even if Glasgow is really poor as city i didnt rate it as terrible cos i like scots as people and the country is nice a lot
