My best friend took my husband and I there, saying that this place was close-to-orgasm kinda good; of course, it had a tough act to follow, when we just ate at the place with the absolute best ribs in Baltimore (but, that's an entirely different story). The place was packed, as to be expected anywhere on a Friday night, but there was a line out the door. And it was still chilly outside. Priced kinda high, but you get a lot for your buck: the small is still pretty decently sized. It was kinda neat to have all the fixin's folded and molded into the ice cream itself; quality of the product is pretty decent, well, certainly better than, say, Friendly's. I appreciate them singing for their tips, but yeah, that does get annoying after the first fifteen times; I wanted to do a tip-and-run, but I inadvertently found a way to curb the singing politely; ask a question right before or while you're leaving your tip; by the time they're done answering it, it'll have been too late for the song, anyway. I don't have the same enthusiasm for this place as my friend did, but it was still okay.
