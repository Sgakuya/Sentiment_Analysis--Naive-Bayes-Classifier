I remember reading a long time ago now that this woman had a technically perfect face - I recently read the same thing about Elizabeth Hurley. Maybe there s some kind of correlation here, because neither woman appears to have been given the gift of being able to act. Not surprising they were able to use those allegedly perfect looks to begile some producer or film executive into giving them the chance, but sorry I just don t think Catherine Denueve has left a very strong impression in the film world (do you really ever hear people sitting around discussing their favorite Catherine Denueve movie?). Apparently the general public has had similar feelings over the years because she is rarely seen beyond old magazine covers and 8X10 glossies. Gets my vote as one of the top ten most forgettable people in show biz.
