It's a challenging album, it sold squat at the time, not surprisingly, as it had little to nothing to do with most 60's rock: and fans of his R&B based material, or the band Them, or any other style he delves into, may very well be disappointed, as there are no hits or particularly well-known tunes on it. The songs are long, meandering, sometimes inscrutable, and jazz based- it's actually a kind of jazz album more than anything else, though there is some soul influence also.Lyrically very impressive, and a passionate performance all around. This is the type of album that musicians themselves and hard core music afficionados almost inevitably appreciate more than the general public would.
