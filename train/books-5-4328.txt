I don't know how I can do justice to the Divine Comedy in a comment on an opinion website. What am I going to say--that it is one of the great glories of western civilization, and I think everyone should go out and read it? Not everyone can, in our attention-deficit-disorder, fast-food, sound-bite age; few people have the concentration or focus to grapple with this colossal, incredibly detailed, perfectly symmetrical work. A whole universe is contained in these pages. Written before 1320, it is really late Medieval in thought, but Renaissance in passion and energy. An interesting sidelight is that few commentators have noticed just how heretical it was to place Beatrice on a par with Jesus Christ in Paradiso (Beatrice was the girl Dante had loved and idolized in his youth). The third section, Paradiso, is the hardest for a contemporary reader to understand, but in many ways the most beautiful. Read it and you will never forget the River of Light, or the Mystic Rose. There was only one Dante. Read him.
