I don't know what has happened to the Kay Jeweler's stores in everyone else's areas, but I absolutely LOVE my Kay Jeweler store (located in the Mercer Mall in Bluefield, WV). My first piece of jewelry from Kay's was my engagement ring, which consisted of a solitare and wrap totaling 1ctw. It is as beautiful now as it was 8 1/2 yrs. ago. I have had them sized once, and (since I'm a little rough on rings) a prong fixed on two different occassions, as well as one of the diamonds reset in the wrap. My husband purchased the ESP plan, and I have never paid the first penny for any repairs, nor have I had any trouble from any of the associates to have these repairs done. Also, my rings have been returned to me by the scheduled time for pick-up. I have since acquired another diamond cluster ring, a diamond necklace, a pair of diamond earrings, a pair of 2-tone gold hoop earrings, and numerous other pieces from Kay's. I do not even shop at another jewelry store and neither does my husband, nor will we as long as Kay's continues the wonderful service they have given us.
