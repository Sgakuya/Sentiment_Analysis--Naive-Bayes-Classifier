Jawad had possibly my favorite one liner of all time. When asked if he found Cameron Indoor Stadium intimidating, Jawad said, What's so intimidating about a bunch of shirtless nerds in bowties and clown makeup? I love that. Because ya know, Jawad is known as a very quiet, intense, cool customer, and he just came with that out of nowhere. I forget who he's with in the summer league, but I hope they pick him up. He took some flack during his 4 years on the Hill, but he shut them all up in the end, hitting 3 huge 3's in the Championship game. And he absolutely torched that Michigan State team that really didn't belong on the same court with us, in the natl. semifinal. Remember, that Mich St. team that was going to beat Carolina because they were tough? Yep, they got a whoopin'. Jawad had 20 pts, 7 boards, and 2 blocks in that game. I just saw Rashad had a nice game against them also - 17 pts, 4 assist, 2 steals, and the biggest block of his life. Anyway, Jawad will make it. He's got that athletic Carolina style that is perfectly suited for the NBA.
