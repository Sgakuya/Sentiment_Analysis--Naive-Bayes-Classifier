Georgia...ahh, when I hear that word, several beautiful things come to mind. My home, for one, warm weather, lush greenery, friendly people, R.E.M. music, summers, the list goes on. Yes, my friends, Georgia is a wonderful, overlooked place. How DARE anyone call it's people rednecks! I feel that having lived in Georgia gives a person bragging rights. We are proud to be from the South, proud of our lovely state, and we are willing to stand up to idiots that say Georgia is a racist, Bible-belt state! Cause it's NOT TRUE! It is my home, and that in itself deserves five stars. All, especially New York, must bow to Georgia!
