Got my eye on him because he's a good coach in a tough spot. Wake's a small private school in the super competitve ACC. Grobe has done some fine work at Wake and it goes beyond the outwardly overall record some may look at at first glance. Wake is competitive and can beat it's ACC competition if you dont bring your A game. he's going a great job, but Wake may always be a middle-of-the-pack ACC team. Good enough to scare FSU, VT, and Miami, but not strong enough to get back vs lateral competiton vs Md., UVA., GT, BC, UNC, NCST. Someone's gotta lose when all these school play one another and I think Wake will get the defeats. Grobe should recognize this and bolt to school where he can rebuild a program with low expectations and some upside -a place like Indiana or Kentucky would be better places for him. I'd also take the Syracuse or Pittsburgh job if I were him and they became available.
