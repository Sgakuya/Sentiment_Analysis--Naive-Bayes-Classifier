I received my Master's degree in CIS from UoP in 2001. My experience was good. No matter where you go, you get out of the education what you put into it. I have taken some flack since I graduated. The bottom line is that you will have to prove yourself more than others based on a degree from UoP, and you may get offered less money than someone from another university, but you will still get your foot in the door rather than closed in your face. Why did I chose UoP? Convenience. For the computer field, I will be studying for the rest of my life whether I went to UoP or Stanford. UoP just made it easier for me to do what I was already doing and will continue to do. I just hope the reputation picks up. I teach college courses now for additional income because of a UoP Masters. It really is worth the time and expense.
