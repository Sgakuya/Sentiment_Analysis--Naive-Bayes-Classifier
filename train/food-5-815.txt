Oh I'm sorry all you whiners that Grape Nuts aren't sprinkled with pounds of sugar for your childish immature tastes and are too hard on your immature, undeveloped, unhardened dentures. Please! Give me a break. This is high quality cereal for mature people with discerning tastes. Cocoa crisps and other sugary crap cereals in contrast are extremely low-quality and artificial-tasting compared to grape nuts. I eat grape nuts for health reasons but by FAR primarily for the TASTE. Yes, that's right -the TASTE. Love it especially the old fashioned way -with cold milk. In fact it's about the only cereal that I ever eat. Awesome stuff.
