Ronald Reagan was the Republicans' FDR. He is the greatest president so far in my lifetime. That does not, however, mean he was perfect. Don't count me among the leftist bashers on this page, but also don't lump me in with the do-no-wrong hagiographers. Reagan ran up the national debt, and his second term was deeply tarnished by Iran-Contra. But he also was instrumental in staring down Soviet-style communism and winning the Cold War, all without firing a single shot. He was the Great Communicator who won the war of ideas. Indeed, "Mister Gorbachev, tear down this wall!" stands as one of the most rousing moments in 20th-century American political history. But his most important contribution was that he made Americans feel proud to be Americans again, after the stagflation, long gas lines, Watergate scandal, and Vietnam hangover that afflicted the national psyche in the 1970s. It truly was "morning in America" again when Reagan came into office and revitalized the American spirit. In our current era of harsh political division, we desperately need another Ronald Reagan who can inspire and unite us with an uplifting vision that sees the good in America and works at every turn to promote it.
