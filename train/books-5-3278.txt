Unlike the other posters here, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is the tale of a 9-year old girl who gets lost in the woods, and the trials and tribulations she endures while trying to get out. The introduction of the monster was pure Stephen King, and most definetly not necessary for the success of the book. The sheer suspense of wondering if a 9-year old possess the intelligence to survive in the wild on her own makes for a powerful story all on its own. If you read this book looking for traditional Stephen King, I can assure you you will be dissappointed. If you read this book for the premise I described above, I can almost assure you you'll enjoy it.
