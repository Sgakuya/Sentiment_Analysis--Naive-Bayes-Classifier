Certainly seems to fall into the category of been there, done that and undeniably some things far better than others. Cher is kind of an enigma who has had both huge successes and crashing failures as she has darted in and out of the public eye over the years. She is at once a passable yet not-really-too-great singer, for the most part an above average actress, and seems to have some common sense in spite of a tendency to embrace plastic surgery with nearly the same religious zeal (if not somewhat less tragic outcome) of Michael Jackson. I appreciated her recent remarks concerning reality TV when she said something to the effect why do these people enjoy making fools of themselves? Although I may have taken those comments more seriously if she did not appear to have half her original face now residing behind her head.
