I will never again step foot in a wal-mart store. On october 10 I went in and was greeted good morning and 15 min. later as I was leaving the store the same greeter stopped me and asked for my reciept. After digging it out of my wallet and handing it to her she started to compare what was on my reciept and what was in my cart. I then asked what this was all about and she told me, It's my job to check anything that's not bagged . Well, I have never been so insulted or humiliated before. I have been shopping for about 30 years and have never been treated the way I was leaving the store. I then asked for a manager and was told, it's the store policy to check anything unbagged . I did have other stuff that was bagged so it's not like all I had did not have a bag. I was so angry by this time that I turned around and said in earshot of everyone that I,as a paying customer, was being treated like a thief and would not buy anything from this store. I returned all my purchases and left, telling them that their policy was horrible and that I would never be back. Wal-mart behaves in a very abusive manner and something needs to be done about it.
