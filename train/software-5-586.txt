I'm not very technical, and searched for a long time to figure out how to display an RSS feed on my Blogger.com/Blogspot blog. I did all kind of searches, and asked all kinds of people, and couldn't figure it out until I found Jawfish. Jawfish is really easy to work with - you just copy a line of code and paste it into your blogspot.com template, and then use the Jawfish tool to format your feed (spacing, font, display, etc.). It's not free, but it's cheap - if i remember correctly, it's like $20 for up to 10 feeds. If you have a blogger.com blog and are looking to display RSS feeds, Jawfish is definitely the way to go.
