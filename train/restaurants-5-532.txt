Very unhealthy for you if you eat a whole burrito, but man oh boy is it ever tasty! This is terrific food, and a brilliant idea by McDonalds. I won't touch a McDonalds with a 10 foot pole, but I'll eat at Chipotle once or twice a month if I can behave (even though it's nearly as bad for you). If you haven't tried one, you should ... that is UNLESS you are not good with disapline and might start eating there every day, which is easy to do. My only complaint: at our local restaurants, I feel like they always give the ladies more meat than they do to the guys! Once in a while a woman will make my burrito and give me a ton of meat, but usually they skimp on it (especially the dudes). Oh well - still more than I can eat in one sitting!
