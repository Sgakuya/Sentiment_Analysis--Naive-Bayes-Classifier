June 1, 2004 -- A World Health Organization study released Tuesday shows that rates of most mental illness are far higher in the U.S. than in any other country in the world....Overall, the survey of more than 60,000 adults in 14 countries showed a 27% rate of mental disorders in the U.S. population for a list of diseases. That list includes: depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance abuse. The U.S. rate was substantially higher than that of any other country measured, including other industrialized nations such as Belgium, which showed a 12% illness rate. WE'RE #1!!!! (Note: My own, more informal studies indicate that the rate of mental illness in Baltimore approaches 50% of the population; in DC, nearly 100% of the population. Further studies in progress...)
