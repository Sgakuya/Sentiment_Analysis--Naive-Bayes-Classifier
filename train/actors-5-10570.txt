I am shocked that she is being rated so low! How can anyone hate Drew Barrymore? Look at that smile! She lights up the screen! Yes, she had some troubles in the past. What teenager didn't? Drew's only sin is that she went thorough her adolescent melodrama in the public eye. But her story is not so different from a million kids out there. I love a good comeback story. Everyone wrote her off as another child actor cliche but she triumphed against adversity and become a very successful professional. How can anyone begrudge her that? Count me in with the legion of Drew Barrymore fans. Not every film she does is a master piece, but she's consistantly the best part of whatever she does.
