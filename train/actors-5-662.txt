Walter Matthau will be remembered as one of the best actors of our time. His style fell into the slightly cantankerous but lovable man next door type and he played these parts realistically and with an instinctive talent that morphed him into his character. He really seemed to become his characters and never seemed exactly the same in each role. His Oscar Madison was so believable the viewer bought him totally as the cleanliness-challenged sports writer. His brilliant portrayal as George Burns' sidekick in The Sunshine Boys convinced the viewer he really must have been in vaudeville. His Grumpy Old Man films with Jack Lemmon were a lesson in perfect chemistry. His understated demeanor coupled with Jack Lemmon's high strung style really hit the mark. Matthau, along with other greats such as Lemmon and Burns, were so talented their performances sometimes seemed almost mystical. Now all three have passed away. It makes one wonder if they are playing to rave reviews somewhere up in heaven.....
