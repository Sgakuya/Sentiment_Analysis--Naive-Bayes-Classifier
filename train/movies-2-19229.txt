Bad, but bad in a good way if your idea of good is cliche creeps and same-ol, same-ol special effects. Is it me, or are special effects not so special anymore. Too good for thier own good. Nothing left to the imagination (On the other hand, I hated Blair Witch because it was the opposite end of the spectrum. Two wrongs don't make a right, right?) My biggest peeve was/is seeing way-too-attractive, twentyish actors portraying average looking late-twenty, early-thirtyish individuals. Really, I'm supposed to believe that this chick is the mother of a twelve year-old and TWO other kids. When did she get pregnant, at 14, 17 and 20? Amazing how she maintained that perfectly girlish figure...or not. Oh, and that final scene. I've seen it before and it was scarier the first time. You know, when it was titled, The Ring.
