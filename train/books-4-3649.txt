George Orwell (Eric Blair) wrote this novel in 1948 and just reversed the last two digits to give his allegorical novel of a hypersocialist world a name. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is an Everyman of this futuristic world who is slowly but surely molded into an automaton whose only link with a world that still retains a semblance of individual thinking and free will is the poem Oranges and Lemons and a meadow where he and his lover meet in vain but discreet hopes of escaping Big Brother. Orwell believed that machinery would replace human thought and speech; a sterile environment where everything is reduced to absolute efficiency as reflected in loss of language. I enjoyed this book when I was in high school and it amuses me that people think that humans will be entirely replaced by machinery. Remember that machines are only as intelligent as the people who program and operate them; I feel it is possible to co-exist with machinery (read: computers et. al.)because, in our day and time, to ignore technology and science would be to severely limit, but not totally remove ourselves from, the world in which we function. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to see how absolute power can corrupt in an absolute form. Great reading.
