This is a country that I would like to get lost in for a while. I have only had the chance to be in Spain for one week of vacation, but I loved every minute of it. The cities - Madrid, Barcelona, Granada - are magnificent. Tons of cultural stuff to do, a great nightlife, beautiful friendly people, etc. The beaches are pretty, with a cultural scene all their own. Spain has all of the beauty and history of other parts of Western Europe without the stodginess of England, the arrogance of France, or antiscepticness (this is not a word) of Switzerland. The only other country that would compare, in my opinion, is Italy.
