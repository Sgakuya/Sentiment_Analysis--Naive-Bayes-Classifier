I became interested in reading this book after my husband had to read it for one of his elective history classes about the South. He raved about it and I would hear him cackling with laughter while reading it. It took me almost a year to read it because I kept pre-empting it for other books, but it was a fascinating and hilarious (sometimes sobering) read nonetheless. I especially loved the chapters about the Civil War reenactors. They really are hardcore - only wear authentic buttons, drink from authentic cups, etc. The chapters that delved into racial issues were also interesting but not glossy or fluffy. Horwitz's point is that on some level, we are all still dealing with the racial strife that affected our country during and after the Civil War - whether we choose to face it or not.
