I have had very good luck with Northwest - and I fly a lot. They fly in to the more remote areas I need to go and their pricing is always right up there with the other discount airlines. I have never been bumped from a flight, but have volunteered and been very well reimbursed for doing so. Flight attendants are helpful and will do their best to make sure families can sit together and they can prove magical at getting the overhead compartments as full as posible so everyone has leg room. Except for normal weather delay problems, their flights are almost always on time and if running late, will make up for it in the air so you wind up arriving on time. Unfortunately, they do fly a LOT of the airbus planes, as do most of the less expensive airlines, so they are cramped for space. This isn't first class travel (even in First Class) but of the discount airlines, I have found Northwest to be one of the best.
