May 3, 2003, 8:30PM, we stopped at the Burger King in Salisbury, NC. There were NO customers in the restaurant at the time. We went to the counter to place our order. The young woman there said she would be back. Other employees walked past who said nothing did nothing. The employee who said she would come back never came back. As far as we could tell, the restaurant only had one drive-through customer. After waiting a while, we walked out of the restaurant started looking for another place to eat. In my opinion, the entire staff of the Salisbury, NC, Burger King working the night of 05-03-03 should be terminated. They had time to smoke cigarettes inside outside the building, but no time to take a customer's order. somethings dreadfully wrong here.
