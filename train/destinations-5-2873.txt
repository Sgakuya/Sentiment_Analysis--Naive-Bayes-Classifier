I was stationed here in the Navy on Staten Island from 1991 to 1995 and to my pleasant surprise I fell in love with it. This is the best city and I have been to alot of other cities. However, things have changed since the early '90's. Rampant republicanism; the liberal/artist aspect of it has sort of died and been replaced by rich people and commercialism. And of course, the World Trade Center, two beautiful towers surrounded by gorgeous landscaping, are gone. But, there's still alot to do there and it's still alot of fun to ride the subway, people watch and walk the streets of midtown. Plenty of sports teams to follow (GO YANKEES!), Broadway shows, rock concerts, movie premieres, gorgeously sexy women in high heels and possiblities that you wouldn't get elsewhere. This city still has more than most despite the terrorists and the GOP. Go New York!
