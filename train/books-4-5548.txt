It has been awhile since I have read this book. but it is about a young girl named Icy Sparks, it takes place in the deep south in the 1950s she lives with her grandparents because her mother is dead. Icy has some very odd symptoms that ostrcizes her from her peers and most other adults {we find out at the end of the book that Icy has Tourettes syndrome} but as a child she is never diagnosed. It is a very sad book because Icy suffers the cruelness, and rejection from others. For awhile she is even but in a mental institution since others just assume she is crazy Of course she is not.this book gives the readers an example of being different It is a real heartbreaking book.to read. but well written.
