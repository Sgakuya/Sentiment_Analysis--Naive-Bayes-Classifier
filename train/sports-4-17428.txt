What a turnaround! This team seems to get better every week and has picked up momentum at the perfect time. Last weekend's gavme vs the Dolphins was closer than I would have expected, but it was a divisional game and they tend to be nailbiters. I've been impressed with the way that Buffalo has not only won(I don't have the standings in front of me but they're either 5-7 or 6-6) but by the margins of their victories. They have absolutely crushed the teams they have played and if you placed Buffalo in the weak NFC, esp. the West they would easily get into the playoffs. And with the reputation Buffalo has for their loyal fans those fans will show up to attend win/lose and some of these previous reviews I find disappointing and typical of fans in most markets. Fans who assign one star just after a few weeks of football. I know that in Tampa all the fans stashed away their Brooks, Rice and Alstott jerseys after the team lost its first four games. Now I see all those ridiculous Bucs flags wedged into the car windows.
