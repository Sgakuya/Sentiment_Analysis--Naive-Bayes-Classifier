It was fine in the beginning - I sang its praises far and wide. Then my rentals started showing up 6+ days after they were mailed and many days after the due date. Sometimes they showed up in those white windowed envelopes from the post office claiming the item was damaged in the mail. I saw no damage other than the floppy side of the envelope was folded over. I'm sure that Netflix consulted with and had their envelopes approved by the USPS, but I'm also certain that the postal workers don't like dealing with the floppy envelopes - they probably don't go through the automatic scanners very well. I think it may be possible that my post office is just putting them in those white damage envelopes to prove a point - they hate them. As well, they keep going missing on their way back to Netflix. AND THE BIGGEST SCAM IS THE LACK OF PHONE NUMBER ON THE SITE. The CSR told me how to find it after I did a search on the web for Netflix Phone Number - she said it was on my credit card statement. Huh - why wouldn't it be on the Customer Service page? She also acted as if it wasn't deliberate on Netflix's part to hide the number from its customers. Sure!
