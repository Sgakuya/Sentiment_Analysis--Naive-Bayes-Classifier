This is such a great album! The only one on the earth that I will actually use the word perfect to describe! I don't know what it is, but the E Street Band is so amazing, and the songs on this particular album are PRICELESS!!!! I would recommend it to anyone who likes music at all, and of course to all of the Bruce fans, save for the fact that they all already own it, to be sure! I wouldn't change a thing about it, and from Thunder Road , to Jungleland , and every song in between, you will be taken on the ride of your life! Buy it now! Don't wait another second! This album is magical! I don't know any other way to describe it! The rock n roll sound, the heartfelt lyrics, the magic of the boss and the band with their whole hearts in it! Nothing can compare! I was Born to Run, with this album as my soundtrack, forever!
