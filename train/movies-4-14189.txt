First of all I must admit that I've never seen Cate in a movie before (or rather I just didn't care...) but this one opened my eyes: Cate is such a talented actress and she was acting just great in Elizabeth!!! So the reason for me rating this movie only good is not Cate's fault but the one of the screenwriters: I'm a realy big fan of Queen Elizabeth and the Elizabethan Age, so it happens that I know quite a lot about this queen's life. And I feel sorry that such a gorgeous movie mixed up some happenings... They're making really huge timewarps and Robert and Elizabeth were fighting almost all of their lifes with each other - but the queen never abolished him for long, for she couldn't stand time without her sweet Robin around her. Beside that, there are few other mistakes but I can excuse them because this IS a good movie and the actors all do their best!!!! Anyways, I don't know if tis comment is helpful or whatever but I hope it makes you feel urged toget into a library and do some readings on this astonishing woman (Elizabeth, mind you!;-)
