Honolulu is not the nicest part of Hawaii. Waikiki reminds me a lot of Miami Beach, which is right across the bridge from where I live. The city is nothing to write home about. Pearl Harbor is very interesting. The damage inflicted on our fleet was so immense that petroleum is still leaking from the USS Arizona, which was sunk on that morning in December 7, 1941. I went there on a day when they were honoring veterans who were there on the day that the Japanese bombed the fleet. It was sad hearing them reminisce about that day when they lost a lot of their friends. But anyways, for the real Hawaiian experience, go to the Big Island or Maui. Very beautiful islands and great beaches. Honolulu and the island of Oahu are very similar to any other American city, but it does have great beaches as well.
