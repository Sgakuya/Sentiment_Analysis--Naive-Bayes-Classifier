Pamela Lee Anderson is the most beutifulest person in the world! She has a way with herself. She knows she is beutiful but doesn't throw it into people's face. When I get older I want to follow in her path. Her modeling has really influenced me and my modeling career. I have pictures all over my room of her I think that she is a great person. She can carry herself well and knows how to dress. Most girls are very jealous of her why wouldn't young and older girls not be!? She has been a role model for me since I was 2 years old. I am 13 now and still love her and please about her breast implants it's not like she was the ONLY person in the world that ever had the operation. If you don't like her simply don't look and/or change the channel. It's all about jealousy!
