I recently signed up for Sprint PCS service and although I had an incredible headache with the Sprint PCS people,- first they didn't have the phone I asked for because of backorder and then when I bought this one instead they gave me the wrong activation code so I had to wait another day - in any case it was to some degree a blessing in disguise because I love this phone. Great size, clean, sharp design but more importantly it works great, has a long battery life, gets a strong signal in places where a friend of mine who has an older phone doesn't and it's dual band so I can use it on analog networks as well. Not to forget I got a $50 rebate from Best Buy.
