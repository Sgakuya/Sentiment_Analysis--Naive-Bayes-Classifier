This album along with all the others is excellent. Now for those little kids who say Korn sold out , that is the most generic and trendy thing to say and a stupid reason to not like a perfectly good band. Now for those old guys saying the band sucks just because. Well its becvause youre not openminded and have to stick to the old, and what are you doing with a Korn cd anyway? Follow the Leader was a breakthrough of creativity for Korn and just because it was popular, you people try to say they sold out so you can look like non-conformists which is popular these days. I don't what you people are saying about the earlier albums being harder, because Head and Munky use a more wicked Ibanez distortion on their new ones. Fieldy also has seemed to customize his bass sound even more on Follow the Leader and i think it sounds wicked. Korn has an immense amount of talent, their song structure, well thought out, pain filled lyrics, fieldy's bass playing. So for those who say that Korn is not talented and play easy stuff, well I'll believe you when i can hear YOU play, and frankly, you probably have no idea what the difference between an Ibanez RG720 and an Ibanez Universe, you probably didnt even know what i just said. So shut up you hypocrites.
