I hadn't been keeping up with the metal world last year when I noticed on the rack that there was a new Maiden album featuring - what? - Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith?!!? So, having a little extra cash (and a recommendation from the guy at the store), I brought Brave New World home. After hearing this album, I have vowed to never write off another washed-up band ever again. This is the best Iron Maiden album since 1988. Brave New World is now one of the brightest stars in my entire CD collection. As a long-standing Maiden fan, my prayers have been answered with this album. Bruce Dickinson is in fine voice, Steve Harris breezes through with his signature bass patterns, and has rediscovered his songwriting skills. The triple guitar attack used here is not always obvious to the ear, but at times it shines through nicely. The songs are meaty and long, maybe a bit too long but most Iron Maiden fans won't even notice. Brave New World could have (and should have) been released right after Seventh Son of a Seventh Son . I can't stress this point enough; I am a harsh critic when it comes to metal music but I was FLOORED by this album. All those years of embarassing themselves have been forgiven. All Iron Maiden fans of old owe it to themselves to buy this album. Honestly, those who have bagged on Brave New World are either deaf or have not heard the album.
