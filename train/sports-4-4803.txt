It may have happened in the past, but I don't remember another time that there have been this many good, young coaches in the country. Bill Self, Tommy Amaker, Steve Alford, Mike Brey, Matt Doherty, Quinn Snyder, Buzz Peterson, and now Jay Wright. One of the primary reasons that Steve Lappas was fired was so that Villanova would not miss out on Wright. He's a good recruiter (who else could have gotten Speedy Claxton to Hempstead, NY) and his Hofstra team really impressed me in the tournament against a UCLA squad that played tough against Duke (and may have won had Jason Williams not scored 19 straight in the second half). This is a smart move by Nova who should move back among the top teams in the Big East.
