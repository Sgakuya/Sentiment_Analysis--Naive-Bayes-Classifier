I love my 2000 Tj Jeep Wrangler. I have owned many cars and trucks but this is my favorite. Its small enough to park anywhere but its big enough to get respect from the other cars on the road. Snow ,rain, mud ,sun ,onroad offroad or whatever my Jeep gets me there. If youre looking for luxury look away but if you want realworld transportation Jeep rules .Make sure you get a hardtop and a 6 cyl engine and the auto transmission . Dont get real offroad tires for street (they make lots of noise) .Insurance is cheap , repairs are cheap (huge aftermarket supplies too ) ,gas mileage aint bad for a 4x4 and it never goes out of style. I bought mine new in 2000 and when its time Im getting another one.
