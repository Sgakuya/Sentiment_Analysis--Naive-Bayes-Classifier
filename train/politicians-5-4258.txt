Nader is the only candidate I can vote for in this election. As I see it, I have no other choice. He is the only candidate who I can support because he is the only one I strongly agree with on all the major issues. I, too, check in on his website on a regular basis and every time I do, I am reassured in my decision to vote for him. Nader brings a breath of fresh air to an otherwise stale election year. I support his stance on NAFTA. I am currently doing a major group report on it for a Global Politics course and I cannot see how everyone could possibly benefit from it. I support his stance on the death penalty. I agree with him on a women's right to choose. He is demonstrating more support for enviornmental issues right now than any other candidate. A vote for Nader is not a wasted vote. A vote for Nader is a vote for Ralph Nader. If half the people actually voted for the third party candidates they supported but think they would waste their votes on, then we may actually see a third party candidate elected as president. If people understood that their beliefs should be more important than who is going to win and who is going to lose an election, then perhaps our society would be better off today. I have listened to the two major party candidates in debates and they spend more time telling each other that they agree than actually discussing issues. I want more from my next president than either Gore or Bush can offer. This November, I will vote Nader. My husband is voting for another third party candidate. Neither of us feel that we are wasting our votes.
