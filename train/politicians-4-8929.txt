Aside from his extra-marital indescretions, the man lead this country to one of the most economically prosperous eras in recent history. That does not excuse what he did. But NOBODY can judge--he's only human. To you hypocritical Republicans-- judge not lest ye be judged. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone I'm a Christian, but I belive that no man shall be judged by any other man--especially one who belongs to a political party. The comments Ted Nickelson made about clinton are completely stupid. the undermanned state of the military is the direct result of the first bush administration handing out pink slips to 31% of the military (all 4 branches of the military) because there was no perceived threat to America at the time and the administration was trying to save money. I'm in the military, I know for a fact. And to say that Osama bin Laden's actions were influenced by Clinton's policy-- how the hell is that possible when it was the first bush administration that established permanent bases in the middle east in the first place. Like it or not, THAT spiked anti- American sentiment even more. I'm sure bin Laden was not lashing out because of Clinton's affair.
