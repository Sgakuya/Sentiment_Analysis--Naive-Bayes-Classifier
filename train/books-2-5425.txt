All my friends loved this book, so I read it at their recommendation. I really don't see what the hype is all about. The plot was very nice, if not all too familiar, but their was very little characters development. The characters are all one sided. Jamie is ALWAYS sweet, and Landon is the stereotypical rich preppy boy. REAL people are NOT like that. They have many elements, and Nicholas Sparks just cannot convey them properly. I think he would be a good oral storyteller, but as for actually putting it in paper, his style just doesn't cut it. However, the movie based on the book added a lot of surprises to the original characters personalities, so it was a lot more interesting. If you want a true comparison, watch the movie first and then see how much less flavorful the book is.
