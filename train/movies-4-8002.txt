Stripes (1981) is essentially a tried and true fish out of water film, namely misfits in the Army, directed by Ivan Reitman. With nothing better to do, best buddies John Winger (Bill Murray) and Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) join the Army and get assigned to a platoon of other misfits. While in basic training, the pair must deal with their no-nonsense Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates), the swarthy, incompetent Captain Stillman (John Larroquette), and some sympathetic and sexy female MPs. After Hulka is accidentally injured by his own soldiers, the platoon finishes their own training, impressing the general so much that they get assigned to a secret project in Europe involving a high-tech tank disguised as an RV. In the end, Winger and Ziskey create an incident with the Soviets when they joyride across the Iron Curtain. This film was clearly Bill Murray's to make or break; however, the supporting cast (eg John Candy, Judge Reinhold, et al) and Harold Ramis' dry wit put the devil in the details making it above average. Without those ingredients, Stripes would just be another film in the tired formula of misfits ultimately making good.
