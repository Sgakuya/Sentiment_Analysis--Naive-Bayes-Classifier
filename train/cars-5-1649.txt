This car has incredibly distintive features, and is not another generic cookie-cutter vehicle that appeals to the blanded-out masses...I admit the rear of the vehicle looked a little unusual at first, but it grew on me...The car has very monte-carloesque lines, rides very smoothly, handles incredibly, and is not ugly as some have suggested...The only recomendation i would make to GM is to offer a V8 engine with at least 325 horses....The turbo-charged 3.8 is a good start, but a V8 is necessary for performance enthusiasts who don't mind a little more fuel consumption....But in the meantime, my 3.8, 200hp Monte is great...great response, and looks very cool, despite what some people say...
