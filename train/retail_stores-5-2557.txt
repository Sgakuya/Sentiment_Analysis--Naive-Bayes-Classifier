i have been working for albertsons in omaha nebraska for about 5months. i think it is a great store! of course you might think i am saying this since i work there. one of the greatest things for the customer is gettign accurate pricing. if something scans wrong, you get it FREE, if you are not satisfied with something, you get your money back, and or get that item FREE, and maybe an extra!! i am a cashier, and i have to say i agree, most cashiers are slow. i however am fast and you can tell im happy when im working with the GENUINE smile and greetings. if you have an opinion on how an albertsons is, then take a look at the staff and NOT the building or the items in stock. please consider alberstons has been a leader in the business for many years. if you think the lighting is poor, it is probably because of the cutbacks from thefts and vandalism. unfortunately, most all stores are making a profit hence the prices......but that is how the employees and farmers make a living. i hope i have made a good point LOL.
