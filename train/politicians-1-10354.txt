This is wrote September 2003 and we are in a Iraq war that is ready to disgrace the US. Bush says that the intelligence is fine but there is no way around that either he is wrong or intellligence is wrong. There is nothing being done to find out what went wrong to lead us to 9/11. US pays more in intelligence that the rest of the world combined and with the time and all involved there is no way 9/11 should of happened without being known. After a great economy count them 2 huge tax cuts to the very rich and the economy goes down the drain. National debt rising faster than the speed to caculate. To top it off blame it all on someone else even after 3 years. I can add he will trash the enviroment, take away thing that vets should keep, lie about job creation and other lies, take away American freedom in the name of security, show he has will disregard any opinion that he don't like to get the world to think we have lost our mind, and say he is doing it all in a Christin manner(read the Bible). I go back to FDR and have looked at all our presidents. In short simple terms Bush is the worst of the lot but we have had some very good presidents. In my lifetime HST and FDR stand out as good examples.
