The greatest franchise in all of sports. It is owned by the fans. The fans are the most knowledgable in the game, too. We don't blindly boo our own players like Philly fans, and we aren't jealous of any other fans anywhere. We can out-drink any other fans, too. Lambeau Field is the Mecca of NFL stadiums. Everyone knows it. There is no experience like going to a game. You just feel the electricity and a buzz that can't be described. The waiting list for season tickets has over 57,000 people on it. Enough said about that. This team also has the league's best player by far, Brett Favre. He is the toughest and most fun to watch. The only people who disagree are those moron Bears and Vikings fans that are jealous cause thier teams blow and never even make it to the playoffs. Screw off you gay bitches who have no clue what football is. The Green Bay Packers is the greatest team of all time. Favre is God!
