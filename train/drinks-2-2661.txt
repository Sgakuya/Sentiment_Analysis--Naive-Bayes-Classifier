I like the coffee, it's good. I'm not sure what I think of the program tho. Initally it was good, got the coffee I ordered, was billed and sent them a check. I decided to use my credit card to pay for ONE order and on the thing you send back with payment there is a box marked check here to authorize this and all future shipment payments to this card (something to that effect anyway) I DID NOT check that box. now,I assumed without that box checked, I would continue to be billed for my shipments. This didn't happen. Now tell me why they would put that check box there if they are going to auto debit you anyway? Also it seems like now that they have my credit card number I am getting all kinds of shipments I didn't order and of course paying for them via automatic debit I didn't authorize. I'm pretty crabby about it. In a nut shell, the coffee is good, the program sucks...
