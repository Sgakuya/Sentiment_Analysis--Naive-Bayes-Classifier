I live an hour south of Seattle, and I have to say it is the most AWESOME city in the Pacific Northwest....I mean, its practically the only city in the PNW. (Portland is lame). How can people complain about the rain, sports, and Starbucks? Those are some of the best things about Seattle. The rain makes this place beautiful, the Seahawks are going to win Superbowl XL, and Starbucks keeps everyone fed and caffeinated. Personally, I could live off their caramel frappacinos. And it really doesn't matter that the traffic in Seattle sucks, 'cuz when you get where you want to get you have a great time. My favorite spots in Seattle is the Ivars on the boardwalk (where seagulls will practically sit down with you and eat your fries), the Pike Place market, and the International Fountain at Seattle Center. Seattle has great entertainment...Death Cab for Cutie. Beautiful sights...Space needle, Mt. Rainier. And the best atmosphere...independent but fun-loving people. If it didn't cost so much I'd be living in Seattle right now. SEATTLE ROCKS!....literally, it has great alternative rock bands.
