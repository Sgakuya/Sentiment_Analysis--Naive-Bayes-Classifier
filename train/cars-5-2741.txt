I own a 2000 BMW 323Ci convertible, and it is the most comfortable, best handling car I've ever driven. Performance is very good for a convertible with a 170hp engine. The model I own comes with a silky smooth 5 speed gearbox which, in my opinion, is the only way to go with this particular model. While 170hp may not sound like much horsepower, this car has a decent amount of torque (181 lb-ft). If you stomp on the pedal, this car takes off like a rocket, emitting a very sweet growl. The interior is beautifully finished, with light maple wood trim throughout. The six-disc CD changer is great, much better than a single disc in dash player. I suppose the only downsides to this car is it's maintainance costs, blind spots, and the lack of ooomph that BMWs much stronger 3.0 liter six delivers. Overall, this or another 3-series convertible is the best luxury convertible for under 40K
