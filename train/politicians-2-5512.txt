There have been several ideas that Senator Kerry has offered to his masses in recent weeks that just don't sit well with me. His most recent dogbone would be a new entitlement program that offers government funded college educations for those young people who volunteer to help out in their communities and abroad for two years. That's great, but the idea includes pay and expenses, but the details aren't clear because of the election. Does Kerry understand how much money a four year education costs at a big state school these days? Let's see some averages for residents. Tuition $6700, Room and board $6500, Misc.$3900. That's probably more money then the average worker pays in taxes each year, so if you do the math, every dollar of one or more person's taxes each year will go to pay for one student. That's one of the biggest reasons many young people join the military. The only trouble is they have to sign up for four years, not two. I thought Senator Kerry was a supporter of the military. It's probably not his fault that his handlers let him offer the new Peace Corps idea.You see in order to stay out of trouble on the campaign trail you have to be able to think and you have to make sure the people you talk to understand that words really don't have meaning. It's doubtful an idea like this will ever pass. While it sounds (and feels) Utopian, such a place doesn't exist. I wish him luck, but if he wins will there be ketchup served at state dinners?
