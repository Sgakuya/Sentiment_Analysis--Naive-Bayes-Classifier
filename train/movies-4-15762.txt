This was one of those movies I liked enough to buy. It does a great job of portraying the samurai lifestyle (which was very unique and interesting). However, it's not realistic at all, and I find it as somewhat of a disgrace to the memory of the samurai. Ken Watanabe is excellent. So are all of the other Japanese actors and actresses involved in the film. Tom Cruise is not the right person for his part, and his role in the story was so unrealistic that I wanted to puke. The Meiji restoration was an important event in Japanese history, and this movie does a horrible job portraying it. And the whole second half is WAY too dramatic. I was really hoping that Tom Cruise would die off like the rest of the Samurai, but much to my dismay (and that of many others) he didn't. Although this film is horrible in a lot of respects, I find that for some reason I like it. It's a good look at another culture if nothing else.
