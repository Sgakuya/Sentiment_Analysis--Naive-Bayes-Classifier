This is what the DS was made for, the touch screen works seamlesly with the onscreen action and the microphone blow section is perfectly done. There is a huge selection of mini games this time around from maze games to a task where you have to make a young lady sniff up a large drop of dripping snot as the lights of a tokyo city scape twinkle in the backgound. Wario is on good form as he drops his Gba sp down a drain and mugs the kind sole who fishes it out for him and obtains a new DS for his trouble, after working out that hitting said console does nothing he uses the stick thing to touch the screen and is dragged into a strange world of mini games, retro nuts and mad doctorsand ther creations. I realy can't recomend this game enough.
