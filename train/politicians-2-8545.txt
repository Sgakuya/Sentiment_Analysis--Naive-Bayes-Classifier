I was a kid during the Reagan years and didn't really know what went on then. It wasn't all bad but not all good, either. Reagan had a couple good qualities: he stood up to Gorbachev and Communisim and effectively ended the Cold War without luanching nuclear missiles. He also reinstilled a sense of pride and patriotism in America and made us proud of our country again, something that was all but lost in the Carter years following Vietnam and the Watergate scandal. But let's face the fact that Reagan's trickle down economics did not work. Look at the rate of homelessness and how it shot up in the 1980s, and who can forget the farm crisis? He also supported corrupt Central American dictatorships and I think the delayed release of the Iranian hostages was totally staged for the benefit of making Reagan look like the hero! The so-called Great Communicator only held a handful of press conferences the whole time he was president, making you think he either didn't know what was going on or he didn't want the American people to know! Also, he showed amazing insensitivity to AIDS victims and did nothing to quell it and the drug epidemic in the country. Honestly, Nancy, did the Just say no campaign really work?! His wife and children were a total embrassment to his country. What a witch Nancy was- selfish, coldhearted (more so than Hillary Clinton!) and insensitive. I think Nancy was the real driving force behind Reagan being president, who I think really wanted to retire and settle down, but power and control freak Nancy pushed him into running for president again. What worries me is the fact he might have been in the early stages of Alzheimer's when he was still president! YIKES! God forbid he would've asked, Gee honey, what does this button do?
