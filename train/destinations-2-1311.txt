Why is Poland so high up on this list? The food is mostly sausages and potatoes, so don't go if you're on a diet. The vodka will blind you. There are some totally hot women there, until they open their mouth and you realise that dental hygiene is non-existent there. Also, you will be robbed. There is no way to avoid being robbed, so just prepare yourself for the eventuality. UPDATE: I know that the stereotype of Polish people being stupid is false, every Pole I've ever met has been exceedingly intelligent. However, they have historically attempted to fight everyone on horseback, from the Vikings to the German blitzkrieg, and they were among the most efficient countries at murdering and persecuting their Jewish population. My friends found Poland to be scenically and architecturally dull, and filled with rude people. And for those who felt the need to message me with obscenities about this review, I was being more or less tongue in cheek, but I suppose I'm not surprised that subtlety escapes you.
