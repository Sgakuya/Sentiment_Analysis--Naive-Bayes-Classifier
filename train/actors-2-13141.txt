Susan Sarandon is a phenomenally talented actress and I've respected and enjoyed her work for years. I don't care what her political views are (in fact, I don't care what any of her views are); she absolutely has the same first amendment right to free speech that all Americans enjoy. She has the right to speak and I have the right to ignore her. What I find both amusing and irritating is that she and Tim Robbins seem to think that they speak for people other than themselves - no one speaks for me except me! I need no assistance with that, thank you very much. Will I continue to enjoy her work? I don't know. Both she and Tim Robbins have really pissed me off with their rather personal attacks on the President. I don't love him, either, but I respect him because for at least another year (barring unforeseen circumstances) he's the guy sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office. I think he's owed that - I respected Bill Clinton right up until the day Bush took over. It took tremendous effort, but I did it. But don't take my word for anything; don't take Susan's or Tim's and especially not Michael Moore's - he's not a well man at all. Watch the news, read the papers, listen to people with whom you agree and then to people with whom you disagree - educate yourself on the issues and the players and form your own opinions. There are alot of places on this planet where people are not free to do that - to have that right and not exercise it is a damn shame and an insult to everyone who's fought and died to give that right to you and then those who've done the same to protect that right. One last thing - my favorite definition of patriotism is loving your country despite its government. It's true; you can look it up ...
