Wow I am suprised to see some people say that the locals were unfriendly. I suppose it depends on who you are or your timing. PRAHA is AMAZING and it will touch you. If you have Praguer friends it could make a difference. If you stick around Prague 2 and some Prague 3 district you will be happy. EVERYONE I met was super friendly and giving (green) and I saw great music acts and DJ's. I understand there are loads of tourists but like any great city you will find this. Just blow it off, and good luck in having a time like I did, I was truly touched by this amazing city with amazing people. Also, the world famous beers are famous for a reason. Also highly recommended is Cesky Krumlov, about a 3.5 hour bus or train ride. Fat...
