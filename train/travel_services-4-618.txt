Yes, it's totally chaotic with people running around speaking every language under the sun, but I kind of get a kick out of this airport. It's modern and relatively clean, and so powerfully air conditioned that you will think that you are in Alaska and not Miami. It seems to be reasonably well laid out with no Dallas-esque hikes to catch your flight. My least favorite spot on the planet is also at this airport...once you walk out of the airport from baggage claim, you will find yourself under this overpass in a steaming, polluted little stretch that will make your head spin. After the air conditioning of the airport, the heat is intense, and the fumes from all of the cars and buses will make you sick to your stomach. My advice to you is to wait for your ride inside if at all possible...
