Samuel Adams Boston Lager is my second beer after Guinness. It is consistently excellent in bottles or on draft (as opposed to (say) Guinness which is only consistent on draft), and this reliance is to be admired given that this micro brew is actually mass produced. Samuel Adams never tastes brassy or overly fruity (if fruity at all) even after switching from a stout on the same night (which can be a problem for most other lighter tasting beers). Unfortunately, it is my understanding that Samuel Adams has fallen out of favor recently as younger drinkers consider this brew as old school or their father's beer.
