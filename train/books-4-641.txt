The Secret Garden is the story of Mary Lennox who arrives in London to live with her uncle in Yorkshire. She's an incredibly spoilt, cynical little girl whose parents died of cholera in India. Her uncle is a hermit and doesn't bother with her too much so Mary is left to explore what the outside world has to offer. She befriends Dickon who is great with animals and at making things grow, together they explore a secret garden that hasn't been taken care of in years. Around that time Mary begins to wonder what's really going on in the old mansion, who's crying at night? I really enjoyed reading this book because it was so different from what I would usually read. The language was, at times, a bit difficult but it was entertaining nonetheless. It might not be the easiest book for children to understand but this is a book that everyone should read.
