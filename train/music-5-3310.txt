Possibly the best Lp Queen has ever put out. It's also one of the best albums ever made. Queen's songwriting abilities (individually or as one group) is just astonishing. They can go from simple little diddies (Lazing on A Sunday Sfternoon, Seaside Rondezvous) to theatrical epics (The Prophet's Song, Bohemian Rhapsidy). The mood the music takes on varies as well from soft emmotional melodies (Love of My Life, Good Company) to strait up hard rocking classics (Death on two legs (dedicated to....), I'm In Love With My Car). A perfectly pieced 45 minute presentation that will leave everyone's jaw dropping in amazement).
