TR may not have been an intellectual powerhouse (how many of our Presidents haven been?), but he is one of the most fascinating and charismatic world figures of the early 1900s. He defies easy categorization. Take, for example, the fact that he was a soldier who romanticized war and believed profoundly in the virtue of physical bravery, yet he won the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the end of hostilities between Russian and Japan. Or the fact that he was a pro-business Republican, and yet he directly challenged the rights of monopolistic corporations (although his successor, Taft, busted twice as many trusts as the legendary Trust Buster). Or the fact that he was raised in New York City society with a silver spoon in his mouth, but he spent a great deal of his time roughing it with ranchers and outdoorsmen in the West. Roosevelt was unique. He was a passionate romantic, often bull-headed and self-righteous, with a legacy that includes unprecedented (at the time) land conservation (not, as he was careful to stress, preservation), increased executive power, and a little waterway called the Panama Canal. One final note: while still Vice-President, Roosevelt went on a hunting trip and, after his dogs cornered a mountain lion, he leaped in and killed the lion by stabbing it in the back with a knife. Can you picture Al Gore doing that? Politics just isn t what it used to be, I guess.
