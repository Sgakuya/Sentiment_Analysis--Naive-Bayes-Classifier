Such a great place to visit. I visited for the NFL Tokyo 2003 game. The people there are extremely nice, and the whole city is SO CLEAN! I thought it was impossible for a city larger than NYC to be like that but it is. They are much more technologically advanced than the U.S.! I mean the toilets (well, you'd have to check it out for yourself) but they're too cool. The subway system is very helpful, and there are many great attractions. If you visit, be sure to check out Tokyo Dome City and Tokyo Disneyland, both world class attractions. Akasaka and Shinjinku are also great. The city is safe, and crime is virtually non-exsistent. You will be safe walking on the street at any hour. If you ever get a chance, make sure to visit Tokyo!
