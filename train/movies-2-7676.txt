Ironically, a five-star rating was given by MikeMyersFan3 (possible bias- no, NO WAY, impossible) with the comment you're suppose to give a REASON why you didn't enjoy the movie... blah blah blah (I left the grammatical error intact to illustrate his or her stupidity), though this person fails to provide a valid reason as to why he or she LIKED the movie. A similar ignorance can be found in many of the other positive comments, leading me to believe that this movie is beloved by a large number of hypocrits who can't back up why they LIKE the movie. Why can't they back up their love of the movie? Perhaps because there is not much to like about it. There is little substance, a concept that has been done MANY time before, and jokes are repeated to the point where they lose the little effect they had in the first place. There are worse movies out there, but this movie is by no means good.
