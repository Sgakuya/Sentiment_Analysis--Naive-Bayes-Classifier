Canada has its faults. Maybe they're letting in too many people and the locals can be kind of cold and bitter. However, compared to America and its Americans, it's worlds better. I've come to appreciate Canada a lot more, and their resistance to vapid, evil American culture. Yes, I say evil because the people here are damn near that. I think I will soon either move to either Canada or Australia within 10 years. I can't think of a single place I'd like to move to in America that would help me escape the lunacy. Every time I go overseas, it's like getting detoxed off of American poison. Americans and their culture are just disgusting and depressing. The party will soon end there...trust me.
