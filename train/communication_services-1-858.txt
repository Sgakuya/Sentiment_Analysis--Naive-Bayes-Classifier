I purchased two LG phones from Telus Mobility. I was assured it would have excellent reception. It drops calls, has terrible static and roams at will. Customer Service told me "It is a low end phone and the sales man probably didn't know and that I should have done my homework"! They're right there, I should have investigated their customer service history as well. THEY REPLACED ONE PHONE FREE WHEN MY SON TOOK OUT A NEW THREE YEAR CONTRACT BECAUSE HE HAD PAID TELUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT A NEW PHONE "They are running a business" In other words Profits come before customer satisfaction. CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLD ME THEY SUPPLY A SERVICE NOT PHONES. SEE CAPS ABOVE. Contradition? I will investigate other companies and make an informed decision then change. I will also watch Marketplace weekly as they have great shows about large corporations including customer service issues. I am going to urge the CRTC to regulate the industry and the government to implement laws to protect customers from large corporations. I am going to be informed, very vocal...a hard nosed customer. I will recommend, as always, good customer service and products.
