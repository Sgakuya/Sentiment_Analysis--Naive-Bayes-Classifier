This woman did more to exacerbate the social and economic divisions in a nation that saw race riots in Brixton and Manchester and other economically disadvantaged cities in Britain during her tenure as Prime Minister. Her steely determination to live her life and govern her nation is admirable based upon her principles, yet this is the same person who roundly demonized Neil Kinnock and the Labor Party and made them out to be the second coming of Attila the Hun and his minions. Her stubborn refusal to assist John Major and the Conservatives once she was elected to the emasculated House of Lords with several NATO allies to help Germany re-unify by pandering to traditional British fears of losing their insular island identity and raising the specter of a strong, unified Germany bent upon Lebensraum and subverting British identity to that of a Europe dominated by Berlin is at best disingenuous and at worst abhorrent and reprehensible. Her devotion to Ronald Reagan (he affectionately called her Maggie ) often superseded (inter)national policy and more than once caused NATO allies to grouse at her chauvinism towards projects not originally Anglo-American. Her attitudes towards the Irish, Scots and Continental Europe was patronizing and out of touch with the common people. Lest we forget, this woman originated from common stock and rose to positions of influence and power, but seemed to forget where she came from. She's the British equivalent of a Re-smug-lican and history will judge her several decades hence.
