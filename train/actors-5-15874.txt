I think Ted King is KING, and GH did a wonderful thing in bringing him back to GH. This is the first time in atleast 10 years that I find GH fascinating. Ted has not come in just being a no non-sense bad man, he has portrayed the Lorenzo character as Human. Not only can he act the bad man part perfectly, he can be compassionate and sincere. He has made GH an obsession for me, and that has not been the case for me since Luke and Laura storyline. It is unbelievable to me that there is someone on this show that makes me feel HAPPY when I watch it. I was just going through the motions with GH for years, but Ted turned that all around for me. I think his and Tamara's character would be great together. I have noticed that Tamara is a much better actress with Ted than with anyone else on the show. I guess he does that to people. He doesn't overact like so many characters on the show do when they feel threatened of a new man or woman in town. He has a lot to be up against, and so far he is holding his own PERFECTLY, except the cheap shots the veteran actors take at him whenever they feel threatened by his presence.
