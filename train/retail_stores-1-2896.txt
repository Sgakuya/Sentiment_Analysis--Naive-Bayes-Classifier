My husband bought me a movado watch at Whitehall Jewelers in the Springfield Mall, Springfield, PA. I tried it on, and couldn't close the clasp. I went back to the store, within the 30 day return period, and was greeted by a sullen, defensive assistant store manager. While he took the watch and proceeded to try jamming the clasp closed, the salesgirl tried to sell me another watch. I didn't want another watch, I just wanted to return the one I had. The assistant manager continually jammed the clasp until it closed, then said See? It closes. He could not then re-open the clasp, and I told him as he worked at it furiously, that I would never go through that to take a watch off and on. He prodded and pulled at it repeatedly, as I insisted on the return and the salesgirl kept showing me other watches. After no fewer than 10 times of insisting that they take my return, the assistant manager pulled out a jewelry scope, looked over the watch, and told me IT HAD BEEN WORN!! This watch was a $495 dollar watch, that was impossible to wear. He then got on the phone to someone he wouldn't let me speak with, and whispered whatever, then told me he wouldn't be taking the watch back today. I was angry, and told him to call the person back, which he wouldn't do. He gave me a customer serice number, telling me the guy who could answer my questions was on vacation. When I said I'd talk to anyone who could do something, he threatened to call security. I feel certain that their goal is to out-wait the 30 day return period so I can't give it back. Luckily, it was charged, and I lodged a dispute for the charge and it has been removed. I still have the broken watch, and will be happy to give it to them if they want it. I will NEVER buy anything here again, and wish we had read the reviews before buying there this time.
