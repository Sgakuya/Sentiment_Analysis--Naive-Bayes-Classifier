This game is just plain fun. Duke Nukem is a well-deserved critique on society. The game incorporates sex, violence, and bad language in an incredibly fun fashion. It goes right up there with Doom. The weapons are incredibly fun and clever, and Duke is funny. The man who gave Duke his voice got an award for his work, and rightfully so. Duke's witty remarks are perfectly timed and perfectly funny. The actual game is fun. You blast your way through an alien-ravaged L.A., through banks, casinos, strip clubs, comic shops, restaurants, theaters, hotels, and other urban locales. It is a fun, colorful. It is like playing a racy comic book.
