It was love at first sight. When I saw my first Dodge Ram in 1994 when Dodge released its new rig-like look. My friend's dad bought a baby blue 1500 4x4 with a v6 (I think) and took us for a drive on some some hilly roads in the Pennsylvania countryside. He floored it right before we hit this one hill and we must have gotten at least 3 feet of air. My teacher told us a story about how his wife was driving a Honda Accord and a guy in a Dodge Ram ran a red and slammed into the driver side of her car and she flipped over three times and landed upside down. Thankfully she was okay. The Honda was totalled and he said the Ram had minimal damage if any. Thats why they call it a Ram.
