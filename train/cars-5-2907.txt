I sold my 1995 Mustang V6 Automatic (hardtop) to get my current 1997 Camaro Z28 Automatic (with t-tops). Obviously, the Camaro is a lot faster. The automatic in the Mustang always seemed to be in the wrong gear and the transmission shifted very very slowly. The auto in the Camaro has very firm shifts and the overdrive gear does not get anoying like it did in the Mustang. Handling wise, I loved how the Mustang corner carved. The Camaro has a much bulkier feel around the corners and is not as much fun to drive. The Camaro interior has a much more cockpit like feel and is much more roomy. I am very tall so the Mustang did not give me any room to move. It quality of the interior is the same. Exterior styling is vastly different. The Mustang has more of the appearance of a normal sporty car whereas the Camaro is very flat, with a mean look to it. The Mustang was okay for a v6 car, but I needed more. The Z28, with 285hp is blast go fast in. The tires are very easy to break free, even from a 30mph roll. The exhaust note is great. The engine is very loud, which I like, but it scares my female passengers :) I drive this car all year (even in the worst Wisconsin weather) and with the traction control on, I have had no problems of any kind! The Camaro begs to be driven hard. For the price that you pay for the Camaro, you can not get a faster, better handling, and better looking car.
