A gorgeous campus with a great faculty and a gentility found only at Southern schools. I attended 20 years ago when the state of Louisiana was flush with cash and riding on a wave of oil revenues. The education I received seemed to be as good as or better than that of my classmates in graduate school (Georgetown). The only criticisms I have are that there are too many students struggling with the course work who may not need to be at a university of this caliber (blame that on the state's penchant for liberal admissions policies), which seems to drag down the overall quality of education for all. The other gripe I have is something that the school can't control...the weather is HORRIBLY hot and humid most of the year!
