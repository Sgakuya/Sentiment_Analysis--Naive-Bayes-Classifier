Abraham Lincoln was the worse president of the 1800's. Before being elected in 1860, he promoted very high tariffs and using them to build railroads, canals, roads and other government projects that helped support Northern industries. However, most of the money from the tariffs were collected by the south. The South got sick of paying Northern corporate welfare and left the union. It gets worse, during the war Lincoln did everything unconstitutional he could do for his own political advantage. He shut down newspapers that disagreed with him, suspended habeas corpus, imprisoned civilians without trials, and went to war all without Congressional authority. He was first and foremost a politican, no better than George Bush or Bill Clinton.
