Bingley, Darcy, Bennet, and lots of bore. This novel is written in the most illegible, incomprhensible brand of the English language ever manuscipted. Jane Austen may have written a great soap opera to some but I HATE saop operas, although I am not a fan of literature, this Austen novel is the worst of the lot. High School and College English professors who require their students to read this book are putting them through a version of the Chinese water torture. This novel does nothing but go around in circles, going on excursions all around England. And this 17th century English class structure is all white protestant, so there might be pride but certainly no prejudice involved. If you want to experience bad, see the movie starring Colin Firth as Darcy, this version is even worse
