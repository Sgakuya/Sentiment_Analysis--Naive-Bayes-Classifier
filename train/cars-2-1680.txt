1997 3.0 12 valve 155hp. Well, it's quiet. At present it's very quiet indeed since it blew a head gasket at 116k miles. The economy was never anything to write home about, 20mpg in mixed driving. For a 6'3 guy there isn't much head or leg room. The radio/tape is a but antique and very hard to replace with anything decent, a fitting kit and a lot of wires is required to add an after market system, the mach system radio is actually in the trunk! The worst problem, other than the fact that it's currently dead, is the dumb gearbox. It is very reluctant to kick down and you can't select 2nd, so in the mountains it's always trying to get 3rd if you ease off for a moment on a steep climb, then the engine chugs when you give it gas. At moderate speed and light throttle, like 50mph on the freeway, if you give it a little gas it shifts UP! Anyway, it has been a thoroughly unpleasant experience. On the positive side it is obvious that Ford made significant efforts for crash worthiness, which unhappily I have not had the chance to test (yes, I'd like to crash it into something solid).
