I HATE it! I had the misfortune of using it for over a year and it was the most frustrating, unstable, bug loaded program I ever used! The longer I used it the more problems appeared, first crashes, then GPU issues, then Direct X issues, 2 things that I tried to fix all the time by downloading every possible upgrade and fix, then DirectDraw(!!!!) problems, every driver I downloaded from the official Inno3D site was identified by DirectDiag as unchecked by microsoft , then IE started to crash because of DIRECTX problems, later i couldn't use Javascript stuff (like pressing yes or no under the comments left by other users of this site), then it started to crash and return the registry back in time, giving me error messages about missing files of programs and games that i already deleted and magically re appeared on the add\remove list, for some reason system restore remembered no dates at all, then it started to refuse to shut down properly, and when it did shut down it gave me a mesaage that the registry file got currupted, every possible game lagged (well, 3d game) because of memory leaks, it trashed my C drive and mind you this is with no viruses, of course I can't be sure about the last 2 months since when it currupted my office and anti virus I couldn't re install it cus even after I deleted it it insisted that I have the newer version, when I bought a cd burner and it identified every cd as audio and refused to burn cd's I just formatted the computer to get rid of everything and be able to return to the good old Windows 98 SE. DON T BUY THIS OS!!!
