Bob Stoops is by far the best college in football. He took over a program that was in the lowest point in hits history (3 worst consecutive years, 2 worst overall years in school history) and instantly turned it into a winner, taking OU to the national championship in only his second year...he's competed in the national title game a second time, and came up short to LSU. By all accounts he is a family man, and one of the most solid citizens around. He has done so much for the reputation of college football, acting with class while others are getting caught with strippers, drinking at college fraternity houses, etc. His players are graduating at higher rate than anyone in the Big XII and at a high rate for Division 1 football players. His players stay out of trouble for the most part, with a rare exception here and there (like any other program). And, speaking from personal experience (going to a game at OU and having OU come to our home stadium this past season), OU has some of the nicest and classiest football fans going...I heard from some friends who are LSU alums talking about how nice the OU fans were at the Sugar Bowl, which is odd considering LSU fans are obnoxious as heck, right there with Texas and Auburn fans. Bob Stoops is the epitome of what all college football coaches should be. He never makes excuses for losing, he is gracious in victory, is unpredictable in every way, and is one heck of a gambler when a game is on the line (also got to see that first hand this past season). All in all, he is a 6 star coach on a scale that tops out at 5. Too bad he's not he coach here in 'Bama!
