I called to change a reservation. They quoted me at a ridiculously high rate. But, that was OK. I didn't mind that part. The part I did mind was when the customer service agent acted really rude and obnoxiouis. She was very blunt. And didn't say "thanks" or "your welcome" or anything. When I told her, "Mam, It's OK, I'll just try and find a different rate", she totally blew up on me. She said, "Well, sir, I'm sorry but thats how it is. You missed your reservation." Sounded like she was offended that I wasn't going to book with them again. Then I said, "It's OK, thanks anyways." And she just hung up. Won't deal with them ever again just because of hot headed customer service people acting like they deserve my business or something.
