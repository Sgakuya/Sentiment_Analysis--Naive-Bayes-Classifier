The L.A. airport wants to renovate this sorry excuse for an airport. I have a better idea...blow it up, start from scratch, and we will have a MUCH better airport. This airport has NO redeeming qualities to it! The layout is horrible! The people who work there (regardless of airline or vendor) are totally incompetent. I would have to place a plastic bag over my head for five minutes to kill enough brain cells to understand how they think. If you have to buy food, avoid the Burger King in Terminal 4 as the lines are always long and those who work there are complete morons. The flight attendants based out of there are really nice, though. If you have to get to the airport from somewhere else, the 405 and 105 freeways are giant parking lots during all hours of the day and night. In summary, fly out of Long Beach, John Wayne, Burbank or Ontario before EVER flying out of this place. Connect through LAX if you have to, but if you are going to the L.A. area, use alternate airports as ALL are much better!
