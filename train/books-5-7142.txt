I've read several reviews about the new book, Runes of the Earth. It seems that the majority praise Donaldson's earlier work, but debase, Runes of the Earth. Their primary argument is It is not original, and, We've seen this before! I'll admit that this novel would have a hard time standing on its own, but does it have to? So what if some ideas rely heavily on the past. I am actually impressed how Donaldson interwove this book with the previous series. Runes of the Earth, isn't meant to be like a new series, but the beginning of the completion of an epic. The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is meant to be the culmination of centuries of Lord Foul's antagonism. Yes, Linden Avery is yet again the heroine. And, yes, the Hurachai haven't yet learned from their mistakes. However, I've invested into Linden Avery emotionally in The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. Who else would I want to see save The Land? Furthermore, who else but the Hurachai would be so relentlessly prideful to surrender The Land in the name of service? Maybe Runes of the Earth is not completely original but its immensely plausible and satisyfing. Since this a continuation, I wouldn't recommend reading, Runes of the Earth, alone. Read the complete epic, and invest into the characters. Five stars for the ENTIRE series.
