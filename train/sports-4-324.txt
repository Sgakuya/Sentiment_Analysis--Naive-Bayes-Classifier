I'm not one to make a fuss about the amount of money any athlete makes, but this guys behaviour has always irritated me a touch. Asking to have the fences moved in when he went to Texas seemed a trifle much. Given the fact that he had just stuck his hand about eight inches up the Golden Gooses ass, they should have moved them out. As one of the three top shortstops of this era, it is impossible to look at Rodriguez without comparing him to Jeter and Garciaparra. Well here is my contribution to that debate. I would take Jeter or Garciaparra on the basepaths, Garciaparra or Jeter with the leather on, Garciaparra or Jeter throwing, Jeter or Garciaparra in the dugout, Garciaparra or Jeter in the clubhouse, and Rodriguez only with the wood in his hand. And Derek and Nomar can hit a little too.
