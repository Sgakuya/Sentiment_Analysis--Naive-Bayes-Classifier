I usually will smoke Marlboro Reds or Camel Turkish Royals. Occasionally I'll buy a pack of Marlboro Lights 100's, tear off the filter, and smoke these puppies backwards. So I figured if I'm gonna try Parliament I might as well go witht the full flavor. I'm not addicted, but I appreciate smoking, and especially love to smoke a flavorful, aromatic cigarette (I don't smoke cigars because I like to inhale a lot). P-Full Flavors tasted very rubbery and chemically, and the taste especially lingered on my lips. The smoke was not smooth, either. The smell reminded me of cheap bowling alleys or vegas casino, it was more of a charred tobacco smell. When smoked three of these babies in a row it gave me a stomach ache (and Lucky's or de-filtered Light 100's never did so).
