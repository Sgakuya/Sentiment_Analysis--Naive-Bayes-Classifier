In 1996 I purchased my first Land Cruiser. My Daughter had just born and needed more space for travelling. I sold it last year with 137,000 miles. NEVER had a problem with the vehicle. Just needed a change. My daugter cried and reminded me of all the fun times she had in it. I Told her i was going to get a Denalli she threw a fit. Now I drive a 1999 Land Cruiser with no problem so far. I WOULD RATHER DRIVE A LAND CRUISER or DRIVE NOTHING. Comfort, speed, room, ETC. Just wonderful. If you can get a well maintained one like did its worth it. It will run in the low 20's or in my case 19's. Bout from a wonderful couple upstate New York. They purchased the NEW 2006 which has GPS.
