Oh ... my ... God! If sex could be packaged, Cage is what it would look like! He's one of the most gorgeous men on screen - those eyes, that smile... I've seen just about every film he's ever made and I can't say I've disliked any of them (with the exception of Raising Arizona which didn't exactly float my boat). He's weird, wacky and out there - and it shows in the roles he picks. He deserved his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas - he was absolutely amazing - he was brilliant in City of Angels and as the bad boy in Face / Off , I would have run off with him in a second . Nic, when you get tired of Lisa Marie, there's a 5'11 Australian blonde sitting here waiting for you! LOL!
