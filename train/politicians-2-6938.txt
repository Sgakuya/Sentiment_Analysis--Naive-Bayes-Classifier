Jesse Jackson is out of gas as a political leader. His failure lies in his inability to change with the times, making him largely irrelevant today in the civil rights movement. He was a close associate of Martin Luther King Jr. and has led various liberal civil rights organizations since then. Jackson uses race too much as a flashpoint. Black businessmen who might be unethical get a pass in his book because of their skin color. Blackmailing companies that don't hire that many blacks is also not right. Unfortunately this guy is the most prominent civil rights leader in the country right now. Time to field for new talent and ideas. It's time to move beyond the old victimization track.
