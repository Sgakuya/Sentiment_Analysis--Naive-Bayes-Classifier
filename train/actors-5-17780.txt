Rebecca Herbst is a wonderful actress. I became impressed with her during her characters rape storyline. I find her to be very subtle and natural in her role as Liz. She had amazing chemistry and was very in tune with Jonathan Jackson's Lucky. They were magic together, absolutely flawless. I also enjoyed her work with Steve Burton's Jason. Rebecca's character is often short-sided by poorly thought out characterization of Liz. Many times I'm left saying Huh? after watching Liz, but RH always gives her scenes her all. Now she's being wasted in a silly storyline opposite one of the weakest actors on General Hospital. But, she still manages to do a great job and keeps me caring about Liz. And that's no easy task considering what she's given to work with.
