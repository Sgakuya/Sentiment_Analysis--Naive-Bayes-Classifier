I have had my 03' 4x2 edge standard cab about a month. At first I looked at the chevy's but decided Ford was a much better buy for the money. Best decision I ever made, my edge drives with the suspension and feel of a much larger truck, it's 3.0 ltr engine displaces all the power I need and still delivers good fuel economy. All this with awesome looks and very affordable. The only negative reading Iv'e done ot this site is about the clutch I suspect these people must ride their clutches alot, no truck will stand up to that. Granted all auto makers produce lemons occasionally. As for me I am very happy with my choice, I highly recommend this truck to anyone that wants a quality built, attractive light duty truck at an affordable price. Ford you out did yourself this time
