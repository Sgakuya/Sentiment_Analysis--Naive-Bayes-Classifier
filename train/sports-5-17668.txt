I live in Wisconsin, everyone, almost is a Packer fan, except me; however, the Packers are not the topic of discussion. I had the pleasure of sitting in a room with many Packers enthusiats when the 2002-03 Jets dominated the Packers 42-17 in the Meadowlands Complex. I told them all week long that the Jets were the team to beat in that game. Why? The Jets were 1) fighting for their playoff lives. After seeing the Patriots beat the Dolphins, a Jets win put them in position to not only win the division, but put both the Patriots and Dolphins out of the playoffs. 2) Young, 3rd year QB Chad Pennington out of Marshall University. Pennington is a very accurate passer and always maintains his poise, he is comfortable in the pocket even when it is collapsing around him. This event doesn't occur often; however, as the O-Line headed by Center Kevin Mawae does an excellent job up front. Pennington threw to Randy Moss in college. Even though Randy is not a model person, it gave Pennington a chance to prove his stuff. In the NFL he has Wayne Chrebet, Lavernaeus Coles, Richie Anderson, and Curtis Martin, all accomplished players. 3) Special Teams was the Jets best area this year. Santana Moss is the best punt returner this season and Chad Morton leads Kickoff return yardage. John Hall is a great kicker. 4) Herman Edwards. He had to break up a couple fights in practice before Week 17. His team started 1 - 4 and didn't appear to be on the verge of anything, but his players gelled and the Defense stepped up. On January 12, 2003 the Jets have a huge opportunity to do something they haven't done in a while, get to the AFC Conference Championship game, but they have to beat Oakland in California. While Oakland is a good team, the Jets are on a serious hot streak outscoring the last two opponents Indianapolis and Green Bay 41 - 0 and 42 - 17, respectively. I think that the way the Jets are playing, they can have a special season.
