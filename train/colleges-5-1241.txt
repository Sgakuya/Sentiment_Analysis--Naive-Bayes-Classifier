My son is a spohmore in high school here in NJ, and Columbia is one of the schools he is interested in. Could someone please answer some of our questions? What is the core curriculum that some of the posts have criticized? Also, I have heard so many different things from parents about the Ivy league schools and getting admitted. One told me that you have to be in honors or AP in every class. My is in all honors this year except for math, which we just recently dropped down to college prep because of the teacher. However, AP's start next year, and he is taking a competitive course load, so I am hoping the schools will not mind that he is getting an A+ in college prep math. He will be taking AP US history, AP European History (first one in the school to take the two together), AP English, AP Environmental Science, Asian Studies Honors, and Spanish 4 Honors, and Advanced math/precal CP. He is debating whether to take Bio AP next year or senior year. He is in the Science League, Academic Decatholon, and runs Cross Country/Track. Right now, his GPA is over a 4, but with the AP's next year, that should go up even more, hopefully. He is liberal minded when it comes to politics, so hopefully from what I am reading here, he will fit with Columbia. Any suggestions to help gain admission, would be great. Thanks!!!
