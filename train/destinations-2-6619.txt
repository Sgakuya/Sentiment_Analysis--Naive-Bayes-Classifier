I spent one day in Arkansas and I have to say, I wasn't impressed. It reminds me too much of Tennessee. Just a lot of crap as one the RIA reviews claimed. The northwestern part of the state seemed nicest overall b/c of the hills and thick forests. But just like Tennessee there was widespread poverty, cars on blocks, poorly built homes, Waffle Houses, and excessive trash on the interstates and state roads. At first sight I could tell Little Rock's infrastructure was in poor shape. The city has buildings that need rennovation or to be torn down completely and start from scratch. And what's up the roads? Enormous potholes are widespread and on-ramps that are the length of my driveway requiring the driver to go 0-60 in three seconds.
