All you haters get it straight, Kobe is the best all-around player in basketball today. It has nothing to do with his rape case, but his skill. Kobe is the best 2-guard in the game. For all of you that say Kobe can't lead his team to the playoffs, remember he was injured for 5 weeks last year and he and Lamar Odom only played together in about 40 or so games. They would've squeaked by had he had a healthy season. Shaq and Kobe needed each other to win their championships, so I don't know what the hell people are talking about when they say Kobe rode Shaq's coat tails to 3 titles. If memory serves me correctly, Shaq went to the Finals with Penny and he got his ass served by Olaujuwon. And I'm not even gonna count last year where the Heat lost to the Pistons. Kobe's good. Admit it. There's times where he will hog the ball and try to take the game into his own hands, but you can't deny his talent.
