He's one of the best comedians out there- and there's no doubt that comedy is his forte. If he sticks to that, Martin will continue to have a successful career. As President X-D said, he is good in serious roles, but his specialty is most definately comedy. This Wild and Crazy guy is one of the funniest men on the planet. The Jerk , Roxanne , Father of the Bride and Bowfinger were all great performances from this talented actor/comedian. However, his best performance was most definately in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles . He and John Candy had so much chemistry in that film, and I've never laughed so hard in my life. He was also great at the Oscars a few months ago.
