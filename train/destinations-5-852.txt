TDoter think that our neighbour in the south is more popular? Last time I checked crazy men dont crash planes into Canadian buildings. Also we may not have a large military but Canada's armed forces and military history take way to much flack, we're also in the thick of things. In pretty much every major war, we have combat troops on the ground in afghanistan, only other country with combat troops there is the states. We were in both world wars year befor the states and with a higher precentage of our population and to top it off canadian conscripts have never seen combat, hell the US goes to the war and the next day they bring up the draft.
