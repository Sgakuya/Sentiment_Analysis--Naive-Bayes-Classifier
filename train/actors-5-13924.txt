There are alot of braindead jealous people out there who just don't see how good Julia Roberts is. You know, she didn't just win that Oscar for nothing. Its so sad that today society doesn't see good acting talent and become jealous because they can't have it. Julia is a fabulous actress and her smile (note to glorybox3) is what makes her extremely special, she is so casual looking, and she does not look like an ugly seahorse(Johnny Roulette). And why do people judge so quickly before they actually meet or even know a person? It seems that most of society wants to do is hate stars so that they can justify who they are themselves (sorry guys and girls, this is the general truth) and I really want to stand up for who I think is one of the best actresses ever.
