Starbucks is generally not only a place you can get a good cup of java, but you can sit down and relax and take a load off for a while. They generally have nice jazzy music on and sometimes provide reading materials. I like that they try to educate the consumer on different types of coffees and where they come from. If you are overwhelmed you can pick up a pamphlet that describes the types of beans to help you decide what you might like. They also often show the stages a bean goes thru so you can see how dark it gets at various stages of the process. I enjoy not only the lattes, but also the teas they have. They also have really good seasonal items like Egg Nog Lattes and Carmel Apple Cider. Yum!
