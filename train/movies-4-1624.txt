With an acting line-up that includes Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey, Seven was bound (no pun intended) to be a good movie. But if you're looking for a feel-good action flick, you should definitely look elsewhere. Seven is dark and disturbing from start to finish. I don't want to give anything away if you haven't already seen it, but let me just say that this movie does not conform to traditional plot lines. This is NOT a good date movie. But if you're in the mood for a movie with great acting (especially from Kevin Spacey) and a dark story that will turn your stomach, Seven is a highly recommended rental.
