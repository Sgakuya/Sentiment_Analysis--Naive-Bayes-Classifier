This has been a crappy school for decades. Back when it was known as Glassboro State College, it was about the third or fourth best teachers college in the New Jersey state college system, which isn't saying much. I had a friend who went there so I visited the school several times: the people who went there were idiots. And, typical of state colleges in New Jersey, the administration Powers That Be decided to change the name of the school in hopes that it would lend credibility, cachet and class to the institution, sorta like calling an outhouse a surface closet. You can't make turkey salad out of tuna salad, and people in the know about this end up condemning the school for it pretension. Bad enough the school sucks, but to be intellectually dishonest, to boot, is going a bit too far. This was also the case with Trenton State, which was a perfectly good school of its kind, now calling itself The College of New Jersey. Well folks, that's the original name of Princeton University and for Trenton State to appropriate that in hopes of making itself sound so hoity-toity is pretty pukesome. In addition, Jersey City State now calls itself City University of New Jersey. Perhaps these second-rate schools would do better to heighten admissions standards, strengthen their curriculum, hire more capable instructors, encourage more competition in the classroom and do whatever else is necessary and possible to improve the quality of education afforded there rather than trying to BS the public with fancy, dishonest names.
