I haven't seen a tremendous amount of his work, but just finished watching "The Bishop's Wife" which was a charming holiday fairy-tale for adults (not that it's germane to a critique of Grant, but Loretta Young is absolutely lovely in the film). I can't say that Grant was a great actor based on the work of his that I've seen, but he did light comedy very well, and had an insouciant charm that's still irresistable all these years later. And I can safely guess that he was second only to Clark Gable as a favorite of the female viewership. Wonder if there was anything to those rumors about him and Randolph Scott...(not that there's anything wrong with it if they're true...)
