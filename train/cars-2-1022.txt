For some reason Toyota seems to feel that quality/reliability and style/dynamic ecxitement are mutually exclusive qualities. And there are obviously many who share this view. Wintess yet another in a long line of well-built, reliable and entirely forgettable automotive appliances: the new Camry. Of course there is nothing really terribly wrong with this vehicle. Except the complete absence of a soul. It is as dull and uninspiring as a bar of soap - no doubt there's a class-action liability suit waiting for all the drivers who fall asleep while operating a Camry. There are many loyal Toyota fans who celebrate this very absence of any discernible personality as a virtue. I am not among them. An automotive sensory deprivation tank will never be my willing vehicle of choice. Face it - the Camry is nothing but a well-built Buick. Yawn. Somebody wake me when Toyota does something interesting.
