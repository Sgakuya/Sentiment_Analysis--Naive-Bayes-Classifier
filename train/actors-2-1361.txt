AHHHHH. DENIRO IS A GREAT ACTOR. BUT I THINK THATS WHERE HIS GREATNESS STOPS. DID ANYONE CATCH HIM ON CSPAN TONITE @ THE GORE SUPPORT RALLY...WHAT THE HECK WERE HE, BEN AFLACK, GLEN CLOSE, STEVIE WONDER OTHERS DOING THERE ? DENIRO STANDS UP AND SUPPORTS GORE ON GORES ENVIRONMENT, GUN CONTROL, WAR, ECONOMIC ISSUES, THEN STATES THAT HE WAS THERE BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN ?? DENIRO, IF YOURE SO CONCERNED FOR YOURE CHILDREN WHY THE HECK DO YOU MAKE SOME OF THE MOST VIOLENT MOVIES ON THE SILVER SCREEN? OH, ITS ACTING ? WELL, AREN'T POLITICS ACTING? HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT THAT DUMB ASS ANYWAY, BECAUSE HE IS A DEMOCRAT ? IT WAS EMBARASSING TO SEE DENIRO AND THE REST OF THOSE HOLLYWOOD CRONIES ON THAT STAGE. TALK ABOUT A SAD, PATHETIC LOOKING BUNCH. IT WAS LIKE A LAST DITCH EFFORT BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO SAVE THE ELECTIONS. I THINK EVEN GORE WAS EMBARRASSED. I KNOW AS A DEMOCRAT I CERTAINLY WAS AND DENIRO, I THOUGHT YOU WERE BETTER THAN THAT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE SMARTER THAN THAT, BUT I GUESS I WAS WRONG... WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT POLITICAL SATAIRE YOU WERE IN, WAG THE DOG WELL, YOU REALLY WAGGED IT... LATER.. ZORRO2U2
