Whenever a Mets fan hears someone touted as a five tool player we chuckle reminicing the Alex Ochoa's and Carl Everetts who passed through the Mets uni's over the years- But this guy is truly the real deal. He's worth every penny of his 110 million. He tracks balls in center better than anyone who's ever donned the Mets uni, hits for power and average, steals bases and hits in the clutch. From watching him last year in the playoffs and seeing him so far this year I'd be hard pressed to think of many other guys I'd want playing center for my team. He's also a great club house guy and seems to be great with the fans and media.
