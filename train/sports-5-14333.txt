This man, in my opinion, is the greatest QB of all time. I hear all this crap about rings but you put Marino as QB on Aikman's, Elway's or Montana's teams and he has those rings and any of those other QB's on the Dolphins they have none! Why? NO DEFENSE! The majority of Marino's career his defenses ranked in the lower to mid 20's which is ridiculous! The Big 3 in Big D were still around but after free agency broke up Jimmy's Jugernaut....NO TITLES! Montana in KC....NO TITLES! He had a higher ranked def. in KC than Marino ever had in the majority of his career and Montana couldn't get it done. Why? Teams win titles in team sports...this isn't golf and tennis, folks. Marino took Miami to the playoffs in years they probably had no business making because of HIS arm! Also, look at the title teams of Bradshaw, Montana, Aikman and Elway....all their defense ranked in the Top 10....some of those No. 1. No, Marino wouldn't have had 48 TD passes with Emmitt Smith, Franco Harris or Terrell Davis in the backfield but he'd have those rings on those teams!
