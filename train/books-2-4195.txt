Well...I read Catcher in the Rye because I didn't have much of anything else to read and I thought it might be worthwhile. Overall, it wasn't. Salinger makes some interesting observations about life, and the story was rather interesting in its one-dimensionality. BUT..its faults are more numerous than its merits. For one thing, as you probably already know from reading some of my other comments, I'm 15. And I can say with great assurance that Holden Caulfield is NOT the embodiment of teenage angst. I felt no real sympathy for him. I know some kids who are pretty dense, but nowhere near as obnoxiously pessimistic as Caulfield. Caulfield is just an ass who shuffles around complaining about everything, getting depressed easily and cursing a lot. Some of the other characters, like Ackley, were interesting, but Caulfield is just annoying. He's not a thing like my peers. And the book seemed to have little purpose. I understand that the whole part where Caulfield talks about wanting to be the catcher in the rye is symbolic, but even knowing what it's supposed to mean doesn't help me see some profound wisdom in this 26 chapters of babble. I will do Salinger the justice to say, however, that in writing deliberately badly to make it seem as if an actual adolescent were writing his book, if that IS what he was trying to do, succeeded admirably. But overall, it's just a lousy book and a waste of time.
