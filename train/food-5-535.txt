Jerry Seinfeld turned me on to two things: Cereals and Pez. So let's talk about Lucky Charms. It was the first phase in my cereal obsession, which will never end. For basically a year straight I ate them for breakfast and dinner every single day. This is no lie. I would always save the marshmallows until the end, because one should always save the best for last. The rainbows were my particular favorite, and they were saved until the very end. Toward the end of my phase, I began to purchase the generic brand (Magic Stars at my local supermarket) because the not-marshmallow part (I hate to say it because I feel loyalty towards the General Mills Lucky Charms) is better. At this point in time, Lucky Charms are still able to be consumed. I could never give this cereal less than five stars because of all the precious time we have spent together.
