I've tried getting used to this water but it always tastes like plastic, very badly! I've bought from many different sources as well as different states and the results are always the same. Horrible, horrible taste. Most other bottled water does not taste this bad. I have noticed other purified water using "Reverse Osmosis" to taste similarly bad. Maybe some people are very sensitive to this and other not. That's the only reason I can think of as to why this water is even ACCEPTABLE to public use. I would like to add that I do like the oversized mouth piece as it makes refilling with "better" water easier. That's the only reason I buy it. Of course I could just buy an empty water jug. I'm a little wacko. I also grew up on well water and everyone I know has different opinion on what they feel water "should" taste like. I can't stand drinking the well water at home, but a Brita or Pur filter system seems to make it perfect... for me of course! Oh and another thing! This tastes exactly like "distilled" water that I find at the supermarket. It's as if the water absorbs the flavour of whatever it touches, in this case... plastic! The same company that sells these jugs of water also sells regular "Spring Water" that is supposedly not distilled and it does not taste like plastic it tastes perfect to me. Am I crazy? I know why you would use distilled water over regular in cooking, but is normal for drinking? Not in my experience. Whether or not Aquafina is "distilled" or not I don't know, but this is the closest description I can think of as to why I dislike the taste so much.
