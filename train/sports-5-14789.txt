I've never been a Cowboys fan, but Emmitt Smith has been a pleasure to watch over his career. I don't think it's fair to judge his accolades and yards gained by saying it's all due to the offensive line , as some people say. I think Walter Payton is superior, but nobody breaks the all-time rushing record like Smith did unless they are great players in their own right. I think Parcells should start Emmitt next season, as he provides a quality presence in the backfield, even if it's only for another year. Keeping Emmitt Smith will allow Parcells to concentrate on other problems the Cowboys have (and there are MANY problems with that team, make no mistake). If Smith starts, I have no doubt that he could go for yet another 1000 yard season.
