I would give him four and a half stars, if there was such a rating. He distinguished himself on Broadway, as well as in films, spending a lot of time back east. Among his films, which go back to 1929, I have great fondness for The Mark of Zorro,(1940). Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell are a very beautiful couple in this intriguing tale of a hero, who has to appear foppish in order to avoid suspicion so he can accomplish his goal of conquering evil. Gale Sondergaard, Basil Rathbone, and Eugene Palette, are very strong in supporting roles. But Rouben Mamoulian also shined in more serious fare. He directed Frederic March to his, March's, first Academy Award. (Mr. March tied with Wallace Beery, who actually finished a couple of ballots behind. He, March did not protest in the least, according to reports.) Mr. Mamoulian also directed William Holden, in Golden Boy. Holden is extremely appealing in this, his film debut. Rouben Mamoulian teamed again with Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell, in Blood and Sand. In addtion, this film contains the ravishing presence of Rita Hayworth. He directed many diverse talents. Among them, are Helen Morgan, Gary Cooper, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Maurice Chevalier, Miriam Hopkins, Jeanette McDonald, Myrna Loy, and so many others. Among his films, I find myself coming back to The Mark of Zorro, every now and again. The sword fight is always exciting to me. It is an example of Mamoulian's great talent.
