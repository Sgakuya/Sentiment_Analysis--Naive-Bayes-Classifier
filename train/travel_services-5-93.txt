Southwest is the only airline (that I have found) that will take child alone. My 8 year old daughter flies to California from Kansas City twice a year. I can always count on the security taking ALL percausions when she travels. A steweredess is assigned to her from the moment she climbs on the plane until she reaches her destination. Granted she has to be on a straight through flight. It is an extra $50 or so for her travel this way but it is worth every penny. If I had to do go w/ her, it would cost me time lost from my job plus an extra $300 for my ticket. Her ticket this summer was a measley $218 round trip. As for the food, I just pack her a Lunchable and a Capri Sun and off she goes. They give her coloring books and she has got to visit the cockpit once. The way they work their security w/ this is she has to wear a tag w/ the name, address and phone # of 2 people that can be contacted when she lands (if need be). They have to have proper ID before she allowed to go w/ that person. My parents picked her up this year and even though she came off the plane rushing to the them and giving them huge hugs, my parents still had to present ID's. Very please w/ this airline.
