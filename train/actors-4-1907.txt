Almost great. I have been very impressed with his work over the past 10 or so years. I would prefer he try a few roles that do not feature such eccentric characters. Just to see if he can pull off a great performance without hiding behind the characters extreme nature. I enjoy that as well. Capt. Jack Sparrow and his role in From Hell or Sleepy Hallow are all above average. Something more down to earth like What's Eating Gilbert Grape. That had some eccentricity to it but not like the others. He is a 4 1/2 right now and has many good roles left in him. I enjoyed his Sparrow character very much and thought he made that movie the success it was more than any other actor involved. Past roles may have been better but I'd like to see him win the Academy Award for Sparrow.
