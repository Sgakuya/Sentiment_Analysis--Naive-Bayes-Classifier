A tale of uncovered deceit and all of the consequences which come with it, and in essence this movie is a 'lesson' to both men and women. No one is more to blame than the other. Affairs are healthy and more married couples have them then people would like to admit. I know because I have had several. Go ahead hate me, I don't care. If two, or three, adults choose to be naughty and misbehave by having an affair that's their business. It has become part of the American gaming system. Have affairs to add more conflict and chaos to your personal life. Why? Because it's fun, it isn't any more complicated than that. Yes, it's wrong, and it feels good when you're with that other woman and the viscious lascivious intercourse that passes between us. Embrace it with that 'junior high' romanticism, because that's what it all comes to. That is the simple equation. To misbehave. To be nasty. It's like being young again, and people eat it up. The truth is they need an updated story that would best fit the America of today. Here's a basic storyline for that; A married woman and mother of one little girl starts having an affair with two people. A young seventeen yearold boy and a gay woman equal to her age. The wife and mother comes to find out that the boy and the woman are mother and son. Then the husband finds out. You see, as adults it is important to cheat and to lie and to deceive, but at what level? Where is the line drawn? Is there a line? If there is, 'cross it'! So, in my opinion, see this Adrian Lynn film, it is an artful design of the human nature.
