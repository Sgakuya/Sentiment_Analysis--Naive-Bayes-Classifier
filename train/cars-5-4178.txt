I have a 2005 Subaru outback wagon, and I LOVE IT!!! it has absoutly no squeeks, or rattles what so ever. My wife has a 2000 Outback wagon that has 285,000 miles, and needles to say, it has absoutly no problems either!! And for those of you that say there is no power under the hood...well your wrong!! Both my subarus cruise at 85 without a problem, and they have even more throttle to give! I LOVE both of my Subarus!!! Plus their EASY on fuel.. and it dosn't take $50.00 to fill em up either!!! They have taken us EVERYWHERE we want to go without any hesitation! Hey every once in a while we go off the beaten path, where only jeeps and trucks dare to venture... and we have NEVER got stuck!! They also are great on long trips!! VERY COMFY and extremly spacious!!! I LOVE THE CARS!!!! PERIOD.
