Actually, Solenoid, I think morons who write or say things such as that just do it because they think it makes them look modern, or they think they'll better fit in. Some may do it because they're upset at the way white people in fly over country vote. Either way, it shows their obvious bias, reverse racism, and ignorance. I find it amazing when I travel the country that the places I find the most extreme bigots is now in the north eastern states. On whole, fly over country has come to grips with race. Of course you will have your exceptions, but I find the most evil, foul mouthed, narrow minded, ignorant racists to be from states like Oregon, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, etc. Now, by no means am I pointing a finger at anyone in particular, I'm just sharing a personal observation. For once, those of us in fly over country may have the moral upper hand...
