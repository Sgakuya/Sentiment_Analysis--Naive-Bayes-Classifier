Have you heard the alleged victim's stories? she admitted to sleeping with other guys and they found two other men's leftovers in her underwear. This guy is hands down one of the most consistently dominant players in the NBA both defensively and offensively. No one else turns up their game better in the 4th quarter. Also, guess who else had an affair? MICHAEL JORDAN!!! Kobe gets no love just because he was ACCUSED of rape? Please. He's very religious and headstrong who was born to play basketball. Pure talent. He's absolutely in the top 5 players in the NBA. Just look at his resume: all-NBA, all-defensive, 40+ pts 19 times last year en route to 32 pt average (maybe the year before last), the list goes on. You simply can't make an argument that he isn't the best guard at this moment. The scary thing is he's only 25 and is nowhere near his prime.
