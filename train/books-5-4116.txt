I guess there are lots of different ways to use art to express the tragedy of war. You can be openly forceful, like the movie Apocalypse Now. You can be understated, like Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. Or you can use humor, like the movie Life is Beautiful or Joseph Heller's Catch-22. Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five draws liberally from each approach. Sometimes Vonnegut will throw out an amazingly direct and forceful image (young civilian girls boiling to death in a watertower), sometimes he'll make his point with understatement (the train car death of the soldier who keeps saying I've seen worse than this ), and at all times he uses humor to attach us to the characters and make us laugh at the absurdity of the situations. The end result is an amazingly cohesive and entertaining story about the fire bombing of Dresden.
