Who can ever forget Mooky and Sal, Jade and Buggin' Out, Sweet Dick Willie and ML, Radio Raheem, Pino, Vito, Da Mayor, Mother Sista, LOVE and HATE, and -- best of all -- Lovedaddy keepin it cool on WLUV! This was a revolutionary film when it came out, and that's the double truth, Ruth. Unfortunately, it hasn't aged that well. As good as Fight the Power still sounds, the cartoonish us vs. them racial squabbling sounds pretty irrelevant in year 2000. That's a good thing, but it undermines incindiary directors like Spike Lee, whose work really seems dated, forever attached to a brief moment in time when the revolutionary rhetoric of Public Enemy actually seemed grounded in reality. That's no longer the case.
