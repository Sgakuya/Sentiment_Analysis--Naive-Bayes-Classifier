Mantle's rating depends heavily on what we are rating, and this has never really been discussed. If we are talking about a player in his prime, Mantle is clearly a Five and very possibly the greatest player in history. His offensive production for that period is really only equaled by Ruth, Williams, and Hornsby in their primes. However, Mantle was a very good to excellent Center Fielder, Ruth was, in his prime, a good unspectacular outfielder, Willims, in his best offensive years, was innattentive in the field and Hornsby was, by reputation, a bad Second Baseman. This is all leaving out Wagner and maybe that is the only thing to do as he never got to hit the lively ball. If we are looking at his career, we have a different story. It doesn't matter much if it was his fault. Some kid who died at twelve in a car accident MIGHT have been the greatest player of all time and we will never know. Mantle might have been the greatest ever but injuries and his bad attitude toward training and rehab left him with the career he had. I would rank him behind Mays, Cobb and Speaker as CF, just ahead of DiMaggio. That puts the Mick well down the list of all-time great players, although still on it.
