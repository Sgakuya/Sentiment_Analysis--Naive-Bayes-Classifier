My home state. I grew up in Seward, and then moved to Ketchikan when i was 15. Later I moved down to the lower 48 (ithaca, ny). I hope I can go back. Alaska is, in my opinion, the best state. It is so intouch with nature. Even in the biggest cities (Anchorage & Fairbanks) you can see moose and eagles. Salmon fishing is a big industry, and it's fun. The locals are some of the nicest and most interesting people you'll encounter. some downsides - the cost of living is very high. earthquakes (not any worse than california), and the weather is a put down for some people. alaska deserves more than a 5 star rating. i love it so much.
