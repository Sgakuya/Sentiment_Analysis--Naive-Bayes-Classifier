To all those with the little harsh comments to the beautiful Halle Berry, here's some little words of advice: STOP HATING!!!!! For one Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Yeah you may not think she's that pretty but it does not matter. Beauty is way past skin deep. It does not matter what percentage of her is black and what percentage of her is white. She is still a person. No one ever said you had to be 100% black to win that oscar. She won that oscar because she rightfully deserved it. She may not be 100% african american, but whether she claims her deadbeat dad or not, she is still black. And don't get me wrong, Angela Basset is a magnificent actor and I love her dearly. But Halle is my absolute favorite because of her willingness. I respect the fact that she is willing to flash her chest for a million dollars. I respect that she knows that in order to be an successful actress, you have to have the strength of will to do anything in the acting business, even if it is something that you don't really want to do. You have to think about your money in the process if you want to really be successful. She probably got paid a million dollars to let the light beam on her chest in Swordfish for just 10 seconds. And hell, she got the body. So I say if you got it flaunt it. You could me half a million to flash my chest for a whole minute and I don't have half the body she have. So you go on Halle Berry. Shake them Haters off!!! I am your #1 fan and I idolize you so to hell with them.
