The number one person who stands to benefit from the debacle for the Democrats that was the 2004 election is Al Gore. Frankly, he's the only person left of any significant stature who can win a national election for the Democrats. Sure, many of the pundits have dismissed him as over the hill and half-baked, but Gore has a southern-base, reasonable positions, coherent, and lucid political ideas, and the executive experience needed to run the country. He's also hardly a leftist like many would like to portray him as. He is prone to exagerration at times, but isn't any politician. In terms of experience, knowledge, depth, and political talent, Gore is the best that Democrats have. 2008, if he chooses to run, will be his year.
