Houstons was originally a fine steak house. They changed their name and concept to be able to expand their menu and once again proved the forula that if it ain't broke, you don;t fix it. Two friends and I have had three bad meals at three different Houston's in the past year. Waiters are routinely rude and snobbish; when I asked one at the most recent visit how long ago they had changed from being a steak house to a restaurant, this little a#@hole had the temerity to tell me they had always been a restaurant, and never a steak house. The food was cold, not as described (in the overly long spiel by same snot-nosed cretin) and generally such a bad experience, I wrote to the company to complain. Their response was to send me a gift certificate which I gave to my plumber when he came to unclog my disposal. I will not be going back to Houston's unless it is the only place to eat left.
