You know Gruden did wonderful things with this very talented team last year, and they deserved to win the Super Bowl. They were truly strong on both sides of the ball, although their defense were what won them games by forcing turnovers and stopping the run. My question is, what the hell happened to these guys over the off-season? I hear about Warren Sapp skipping across the field trying to prove something to opponents before games, and bringing that tired 'oh it's because I'm black' argument into the picture. Now I thought Warren was a cool and funny dude, but my opinion of him has changed. Keyshawn I always knew was a sour and callous individual, but Warren? I don't understand these guys. Obviously the Super Bowl went to their head and they forgot about getting it done as a TEAM and not bringing individuals into the spotlight. Poor Gruden, Brad Johnson, John Lynch, and Michael Pittman, who are all team players, are overshadowed by the idiot Sapp and whiny Keyshawn breaking this team down. Those two are supposed to help lead this team to a repeat, and now it looks like they'll be lucky to snag 9-7 and a wildcard??? Just how many sacks does Sapp have? None???
