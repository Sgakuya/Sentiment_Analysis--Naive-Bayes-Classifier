I don't know what the previous user has rated - certainly not a Murano. Or may be he is an employee of GM. Anyway, I own my Murano for a month now and I am in love with this beauty. Have in mind that I am anti-SUV guy, in general. My previous car was a Honda Civic HX, which was my perfect car, giving me 40 mpg. The Murano was the only vehicle that brought me into the fold of the gas-guzzler but, this is not such. The CVT (Continuous Variable Transmission) which was on the HX also, does its magic here too. I am getting 22 mpg, easy. Not to mention the luxurious, comfortable drive and amenities. A GREAT buy, definitely.
