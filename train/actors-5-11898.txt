Angelina is one of the best actresses ever. Some critics will tell you that yes, some of the movies she has been in have been horrible, but they will also tell you that she is the only good part of the movie. Many people saw Playing by Heart a boring and bogged-down filmand what happened? She won Breakthrough Actress for it. That should tell you something, the movie can be absolutely terrible, but as soon as she is on the screen, you can tell she is pouring her heart and soul in that specific character and no one can resist liking an Angelina character because of it. She is a natural actress and you can sense her amazing elegance in all her movies. She is a rare and stunning beauty with a look that captivates you and keeps you interested in anything that she is doing and you can't talk about Angelina without mention those beautiful luscious lips of hers. On a more personal note, she is my inspiration. She is so open and free and can do what she pleases and not feel wrong about. She could conquer the world if she felt like it. I think her personality is so intriguing and maybe that's why everyone likes her acting so much because it spils into her characters. I admire her and she has made me fell that through doing whatever I want (within reason), I can accomplish anything. And the awesome thing is, I'm not the only one, she makes many other people feel the same way I do and I find that just perfect... -Kate
