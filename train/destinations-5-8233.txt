How ignorant are you people? Those tigers are worth millions of dollars. They are treated like royalty and probably are better fed than any of you fools crying animal abuse . Do you honestly believe that Seigfried and Roy, who make millions of dollars and are under constant scrutiny as celebrities, would take these tigers who are directly responsible for their wealth and the wealth of the Mirage business concern, would abuse their investment? Does that make SENSE to you? If I operated an auto show, do you think I would treat my show vehicles well or poorly? Think carefully, if you're able. Most of you are foolish children with no sense at all making blanket statements in the name of the fad of the month. Think before you speak.
