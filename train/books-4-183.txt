this is Dave Pelzers third book on the trilogy of his life {so far} this starts up at the beginning of his adulthood and takes himself up until somewhere in his thirties. He gets married has a son, joins the airforce learns to be a pilot, gets divorced and remarried. I read his two books. A Child Called It. {his horrible abuse he endured from his monster of a mother} His second the Lost Boy, book talks of his life in the foster care system and then this one A Man Named Dave. I find him to be a remarkable man who has risen above his childhood to become a successful man. It would nice to at least read this book to see what became of him
