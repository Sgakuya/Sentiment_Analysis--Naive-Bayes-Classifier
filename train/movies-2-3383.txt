I think anyone foolish enough to rent this movie (including myself) deserves exactly what they get. Clearly this is a bad movie. The actors are all second-rate, the plot is irrational, and the movie was only made to squeeze $7.50 out of every member of the Dawson's Creek crowd. So why did I rent it? Because I'm a sucker for bad teen movies (and TV shows), and I held out a small hope that The Skulls might just be bad enough to be entertaining. No luck. Joshua Jackson cannot carry a movie by himself, even with a lot of help, and the only help he had in this movie was Leslie Bibb (who really is beautiful) - the rest of the cast was a joke. And I counted maybe 20 different times where the plot just didn't make sense. Take, for instance, the fact that this supposedly secret society, the Skulls, has its own building in the middle of campus with a huge steel Skulls logo on top. Pretty sneaky. Even if you like bad movies, save yourself some time and skip this one.
