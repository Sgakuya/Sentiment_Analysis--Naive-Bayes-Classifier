Based on a series of off-the-wall stories originally published in NATIONAL LAMPOON, 1987's O.C. AND STIGGS was a project that, in retrospect, director Robert Altman probably wished he could take back. A raunchy teen comedy was a big shifting of the gears for him, but it did produce what is now considered to be a minor cult phenomenon. The plot revolves around two rambunctious Arizona teens: Oliver Cromwell (O.C.) Ogilvie (Dan Jenkins) and his partner-in-rhyme Mark Stiggs (Neil Barry) who, upon finding out that O.C.'s grandfather (the dearly-missed Ray Walston) has his insurance cancelled by uber-nerd suburbanite salesman Randall Schwabb (character great Paul Dooley), lead a summer-long campaign to settle the score with Schwabb and company. In between the mischief and anarchy, they take time out for a quest to see World music ska superstars King Sunny Ade and his African Beats in concert (really nice to hear different kinds of music coming out of this era). Blanketed by quality co-star vignettes from Dennis Hopper, Jane Curtin, Martin Mull, Tina Louise, Jon Cryer, and the finger-lickin' Cynthia Nixon. Long-forgotten amidst the better John Hughes vehicles of the day, it's still worth a gander if you're into the kookiness of sub-Hollywood genre flops.
