Although I can see where those are coming from who say that this story is overrated, it has to be understood that this book was written at a time when many of the topics in it were considered sacred and vile to talk about aloud. This book was a huge turning point in literature and although it may be hard for us now to understand, it needs to be said. I belive that this was a great story about a boy growing up. Yes he does walk around a lot but I belive that there is more to it than just walking around, it is about self discovery and that is why so many teenagers connect with it. You should not go into this story expecting a story full of twists, turns and heavy climaxes but rather a story of human emotion and development. It is simple, and it is beautiful.
