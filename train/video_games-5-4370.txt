AN AWESOME GAME, PERHAPS THE BEST RTS EVE MADE!!! I was a Die Hard Warcraft Fan, a friend had told me about Starcraft, and I bought it, it was cool from what she had said. SHE WASN'T EVEN CLOSE TO DESCRIBING HOW GREAT IT WAS! Even today, even with my Warcraft 3, I still constantently play Starcraft, the campaign, playing against coms, playing against my friends, playing against random individuals, and playing my own custom campaigns. The storyline/campaign is awesome, I loved the Warcraft 2 campaign, the WC 3 campaign, and The WC 1 campaign was alright (kinda boring and quick though) THE STARCRAFT CAMPAIGN THOUGH WAS THE GREATEST!!! I could play the Terran campaign 100 times and not be tired of it. The same goes for the Protoss. The Only low part of the game was the Zerg campaign, which occasionaly got boing. OTHER THAN THE ZERG PART THOUGH THIS GAME IS FLAWLESS!!! ITS EVEN BETTER FOR ITS TIME 1998!!! AND THE ENDING, ITS EPIC!!! The Ending of Warcraft 1 was alright, WC 2 was kinda cool, Beyond the Dark Portal was cool, WC 3 pretty awesome, Frozen Throne was pretty epic too, BUT NOT AS GREAT AS STARCRAFT!!! Tassadar's sacrifice was epic. A GREAT GAME A MUST HAVE! (And if you like it get Warcraft it also rules.)
