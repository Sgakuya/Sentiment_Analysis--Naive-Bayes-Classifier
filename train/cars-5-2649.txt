i would say that the skyline and the supra are the best cars made in the world.. nothing tops them... skyline r34 doesn't have 280 horsepower.. thats way way way off.. it has 330 WHEEL HORSEPOWER (thats right WHEEL HORSEPOWER) stock from rb26dett motor.. the turbo's aren't that small! if i had a pick betwee a skyline and a supra.. i would say skyline for the name and being all wheel drive is awesome.. but when it comes to top end skyline has no chance at all.. go to sound-performance.com i live around them they have a 1400 horsepower turbo kit for supra.. and they have a record for worlds fastest full weight supra over 3800 lbs running 9.001 with 1157rwhp and 900 tq... its full weight .. either car i would love to have em.. nismo or trd i got love for em both
