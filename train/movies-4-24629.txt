I just got back from seeing this movie and I must say that I was impressed...MARK WAHLBERG was great!! He played the role of Leo Davidson perfectly! I read someone else's comment who said he couldn't act, but I have to ask If he couldnt act why do you think he was chosen to have the lead role in the sequal of one of the best movies of all time?!?!?!?! He was great! And the people who played the apes...my goodness they were excellent! I saw the making of this movie on HBO and geez they had to sit through hours of makeup... :(...and they had to practice runnin and walking like apes...it was crazy! although it paid off because everything they did was extrordinary. THe makeup artists deserve a lot of applause! It takes a very talented person to turn a human into and ape...hehe...All of the actors were great...I mean people should really respect this movie for all of the hard work that the people involved in this feature had to put up with...This movie had comedy, action, adventure, and a lil bit of fright...It was great wen Marky was makin his speech to the people..I even felt a chill run through me at that time...! I loved the voice of that scary ape...it was great wen he said kill them all ..ooh i luved it...!! Although I luved it wen Mark said, Don't send a monkey out to do a man's job. ..or however it went...hehe..I liked it! The one part I didnt care that much for was the ending....It was not what I had in mind. Although it was surprising..It wasnt something I like for an ending(which kinda made it seem that there is goin ta be another sequal to it)...Over all the movie deserves some major Awards!!! Well I guess thats all I really wanna say so Im going to go but,Im not goin ta say it was better than the original because Ive never seen the movie..and I believe originals are alwayz the best so that is why I gave this movie 4 stars n not 5. But other than that I think it was very well done!
