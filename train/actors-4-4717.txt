Matt Dillon is a very talented actor in my opinion. Ever since The Outsiders , he has always done well in the roles that he has played. I enjoyed his performance in In and Out and To Die For with Nicole Kidman. He was also impressive in There's Something About Mary . His more recent role in Wild Things was wonderful- I really enjoyed his performance in that thriller. He made the transition from good guy to bad guy very well in that film. In the final analysis, Matt Dillon is a wonderful actor whose talent is being wasted in supportive roles. He deserves his own leading role so he can boost himself into true stardom.
