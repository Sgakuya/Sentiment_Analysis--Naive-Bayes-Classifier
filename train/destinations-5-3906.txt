I've travelled a good bit and find Pittsburgh to be one of 4 cities in which I would live in the world ( Melbourne, Aus, New Orleans, LA, and Vancouver BC, CA being the others). It's amazingly full of activity opportunities especially given its size (less that 400K), incredibly affordable, beautiful geographically (no where prettier than western Pa in Autumn), and conveniently located. Yes, its true, it is struggling to overcome economic and geographic blights; but it is making headway. Time will tell if its going to make it. The biggest challenges, are that its constantly misperceived as its old uber polluted past, and that most Americans want a remote control life. Its why they love cities like LA, NYC, and Las Vegas. They want to roll out of their doors and experience a life that's already been arranged for them. Pittsburgh doesn't coddle those with a desire for a cafeteiria style life. You've got to actually entertain yourself here, and I think that's why there is so much polarization on this town. If you are a self starter and able to self entertain, you don't have enough time to enjoy it all. If you need your fun spoon-fed to you in nice packets of pre-arranged convenience, you'll be left wondering what everyone is is doing all the time and somehow feel as though you are being left out.
