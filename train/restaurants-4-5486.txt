I use to work at Pondarosa as a cook....I can give you a little behind the scenes at the one I worked at, I don't know if they are all ran the same way, which I doubt, because they all have different owners who buy these stores out and pay corperate for using their name. The kitchen was clean, the food came in often and moved, meaning fresh product...The steaks aren't prime USDA, but for the price what do you expect. The all you can eat steak with buffet is an excellent choice for anyone hungry and that can pack away the food. The steaks were pretty standard, they would taste better after we would brush butter on them. Also we had lobster tails, they were small and came in frozen, but the price was very attractive, $12.99 for a steak and lobster just cannot be beat and you get a potato also....Overall Ponderosa is a pretty good place and you can always count on getting plenty to eat.
