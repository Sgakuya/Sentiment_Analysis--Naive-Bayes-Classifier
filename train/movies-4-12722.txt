I guess anyone who is familiar with my political beliefs is probably expecting me to praise this film as the single greatest work of expository journalism in the history of motion pictures. Well, it's not. There certainly was a lot to like about it, but it made me kind of angry (I know that was the point, but I mean I was a little angry with the film-makers). I think that Michael Moore has a lot of really important things to say, and we need more people to say the things he says, but I have a problem with the way he says them. I found BFC to be exceptionally manipulative. And I don't like Moore's interviewing style. He is not interested in discussion or debate, he only wants to lull the subject into a complacent sense of comfort and then blindside them with a barrage of loaded questions. He also likes to carefully edit things to make his opponents look even more ridiculous. These are GOP tactics, and Moore has enough material that can speak for itself without having to resort to cheap shots at unarmed opponents. Yes, Charlton Heston's opinions are pretty appalling, and I don't necessarily feel sorry for him, but I don't see the point in bothering Dick Clark about his business practices. Or going and pointing accusing fingers at employees at the K-Mart headquarters, as if they were each individually responsible for the Columbine tragedy. The parts of this film I enjoyed most were those when Moore wasn't onscreen. It's too bad, the subject matter of this film is too important to be the subject of a film that is so blatantly manipulative and insulting. It makes it too easy for conservatives to attack it, which is a shame since the ideas and material are sound and should be beyond reproach. Too bad Michael Moore is such a putz.
