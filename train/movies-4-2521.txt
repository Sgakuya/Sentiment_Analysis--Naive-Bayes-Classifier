I usually don t like westerns, but this one was actually good. I think that the Old West was recreated very realistically. The small Western town and the incredible vistas helped recreate that world for me. I absolutely loved Robert Duvall and thought he was perfect as the boss. He definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance. The story of a group of free-range cowboys fighting against a rancher and his hired hands was interesting and engaging. The only complaint I have is that the movie was a little too slow at times. But other than that, I enjoyed it. If you like Westerns, you'll probably like this movie. If you don't like them, I still say give it a chance. It has a good story and beautiful scenary to look at.
