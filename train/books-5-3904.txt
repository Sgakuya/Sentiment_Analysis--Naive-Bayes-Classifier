One of the Bard's greatest plays, whoever that Bard really was. Dark, spare, brief, yet a chilling view of ambition and its capacity to corrupt. Nothing Fancy Dan about this one, with the most brutal-sounding language in any play of the Shakespearian canon. Maybe some of the posters on this page should grow up a little, experience more in life and read more widely before they condemn major works of literature as boring. Yeah, Shakepeare's been boring readers for hundreds of years, boring the countless millions who still come out to see his plays, boring the people who pay to see movies based on his plays, boring the people who speak a language that is heavily sprinkled with the sayings, turns of phases and expressions he coined. It's interesting that well-educated, cultured and sophisticated people don't find Shakepeare boring at all, yet ill-educated, immature, crude, unsophisticated louts can't sit still long enough to savor the man's greatness.
