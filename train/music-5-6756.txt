This CD is one of the best CDs I have bought in a long time. I have been a fan of Godsmack since their really early days, and this CD is a prime example of Godsmack's musical talent. From the electrifying opening track Sick Of Life , to the high-energy, pure power-driven instrumental Vampires , to the mystical, tribal sound of Spiral , Godsmack's sophomore effort takes you on a wild ride. Overall, the CD seems to be a little more darker and heavier than their self-titled debut, which is just as good. One thing that is unique about Godsmack is their use of guitar solos, in which you hear on just about every song. You don't hear solos like that in nu-metal nowadays, it is very rare. But Godsmack pulls them off amazingly. The guitar riffs are heavy, Sully's vocals are excellent (he has some powerful vocals for such a small guy!) nd the melodies are beautiful...Sully sings from his Wiccan heart. All in all, it's a terrific CD. I recommend it to any fan of hard rock/metal, or to anyone that is looking to get into a band with a high level of talent...they are truly gifted and not so superficial like a lot of today's metal bands.
