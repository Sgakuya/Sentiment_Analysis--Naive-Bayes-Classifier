John Kerry was a strong-willed, independent personality as a child and he is a great presidential candidate now. If you want a politician with real ideas and not just what his aides tell him, vote Kerry in 2004. The reason many Dems criticize the War on Terrorism because it has been used by the Republicans as an excuse to attack Iraq (citing Al-Quada Connections and weapons of mass destruction when there is no intelligence to suggest that whatsoever). In fact, there is now evidence that the Bush administration falsified intelligence and mislead the gullible (and easily branwashed) American people in order to pull the most reprehensible politcial stunt ever (going to war with a 3rd world country over false pretenses). It takes a smart Democrat like John Kerry to realize a War on Terror consisting of brute force alone (without analyzing one's own self) will turn out to be another War on Drugs .
