It always troubles me to see people trash Puerto Rico when, for the most part, they never left the airport, or got further than a stone's throw from the airport. There is so much more the island has to offer, in fact I have lived in PR for more than 5 years and I love it. Sure, as some have pointedd out, San Juan is a city with crime. No doubt about it. You put a few million people in a city and you have crime. But you find the same thing in New York, Philadelphia, LA, Detroit or any American city as well. Use common sense! As a rule the people are hospitable and friendly. Again, sure there are the bad apples, but I would encourage you to show me any place that does not. San Juan and Puerto Rico is what you make it. If you want your steak n' taters, and gall-durned everybody oughta speak 'american' , then PR is not for you. Wherever I have traveled in this world, I am usually embarrassed by Americans. Here is no exception.
