The hoax of the 21st century is blaming Bush for the economy. In 1997 Alan Greenspan warned that a stock market crash was inevitable, calling it irrational exuberance. The stock market was so overvalued and was so corrupt (Enron, etc.) in the 1990s, that a crash was inevitable. Then the Fed raised interest rate six times in a short period and flooded the economy with cash in preparation for Y2K. Then in 2000, the last year of the Clinton administration, the market started to collapse; companies started to lose money and then lose their capital (the market crash). A few months before taking office, Bush warned of a recession, but was berated by Democrats for causing a decline in consumer confidence. They wanted him silent so that they could blame him when he took office. But the crash started months before Bush took office; the companies, having lost capital and being unable to borrow with high interest rates (which have since plummeted) laid off their workers and went out of business. THe economy isn't a water faucet that turns on and off immediately; it takes months or years for a cycle to occur. The recession and job losses aren't Bush's fault or Clinton's, just a stock market that went crazy followed by 911. Bush has the market and economy back on track. Thank God that Gore wasn't elected--that would have been awful. And Richard Clarke has obviously been telling lies about Bush on terrorism; he has contradicted his story many times. It's a shame that Clarke can make so much money on the tragedy of 911, making money off the death of 3000 people--in a book that coincidentally came out just before the hearings. Is it also a coincidence that Clarke is now teaching a course with Bush's rival, John Kerry's, foreign policy advisor. Since Clarke is working with Kerry's people, he obviously wants to help Kerry by telling lies about Bush.
