George W. Bush doesn't have as much experience as other candidates in that election. When the winner of the election was in dispute, he should have gave up because he knew the American people elected Al Gore and he also knew Florida elected Al Gore counting all the votes. If he really believed he was the true winner, he would have allowed the votes to continue to be recounted. He didn't because he knew they would prove he was the loser. The Americans who did vote for him made a big mistake because he doesn't know how to get along with world leaders or deal with problems well. He doesn't care about Global Warming or the average American citizen. His main concern is paying off the corporations that put him in power and are using him to achieve their goals. He also killed more people than any other politician when he was governor of Texas. Now the federal government is starting to execute people again. He says he doesn't believe anyone he has killed was innocent, which is insane.
