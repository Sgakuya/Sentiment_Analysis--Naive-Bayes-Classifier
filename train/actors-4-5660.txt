Eddie Murphy is a brilliant comedian and a slightly above average actor. He's probably one of the better actor-comedians in Hollywood today. I enjoyed his earlier works more than his newer works (such as Beverly Hills Cop and 48 Hours). Coming to America was a pretty funny music which introduced Murphy's forte of playing multiple characters in his movies. I really enjoyed Dr. Dolittle and its sequel. However, Murphy's best work in my opinion was probably in Trading Places . It really was Murphy's breakthrough role in Hollywood and gave promise to this man's post-SNL career. Who can deny that this man has a certain dedication to his acting that is rare in Hollywood today. Shrek and The Nutty Professor and its sequel are just a few more movies to add to this actor's impressive resume. I'm looking forward to more work from Eddie Murphy.
