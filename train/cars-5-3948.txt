I researched mid-size SUVs for 8 months beore buying my CRV. Major deciding factors for me were safety ratings and repair records for the line of cars. I'm always amazed at people who spend no time researching these two things before they buy! The CRV has top ratings for both safety and repair record, great gas mileage, A+ resale value, comfortable seats and ride and ease of changing seats for loading space. I think people who complain of the power of the car (and it is less powerful than many) just need more power, either for personal gratification or existing driving habits. I don't need more power than this car has! I love my CRV, and I think I drove them all before buying.
