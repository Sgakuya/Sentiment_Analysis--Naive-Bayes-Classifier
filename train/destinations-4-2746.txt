A good city. I went there for a WWII history trip and actually ended up going on a job interview there. The city is large enough to have all the elements a major city would have. It was clean and there was plenty to do, mostly tourist-relating or tourist-involved things. Pearl Harbor is a must see place as is the Punch Bowl. They keep the Tourist on Waikiki and the mountians around the city are green and beautiful, esp, when the clouds roll across. You can also have the freshest fruits to eat. The cost of living is high and if you're not Hawaiian or aisan , you might feel out of place. It also feels far removed from the mainland. This does cause problems as far as news goes. The Sports reports actually tell you not to watch the screen if you dont want to know the Sports scores in advance. If I was younger, I could consider living here. If ( when) I win the lottery I'd buy a place there. Expect to see a rainbow every day.
