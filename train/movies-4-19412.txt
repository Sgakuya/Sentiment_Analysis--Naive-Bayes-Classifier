I truely did enjoy this very original and darkly disturbing horror film. I would catagorize this fil as more of a mystery than actual horror. I found it above the standards of most horror films in that it relise alot on the atmosphere and the mood of the cinematography rather than sheer teen gutting. Actually, this film is pretty much refreshingly teen free! This was made back when horror and suspence was still aimed at a mature and thoughtful audience. I wish I was alive to have witnessed the glory days. Alice,Sweet Alice holds tight to its vision and mastery of suspence. A true gem of 70's horror suspence. Truelly chilling.
