A nice little car with awesome gas mileage. Tons of room inside despite the deceptive looks of the outside. The interior is, admittedly, a little bland but it does the trick for a vehicle as cheap as this. Standard features are plentiful for something so modestly priced and you'll be hard pressed to find a value as genuine as this one. Options can be added later for a truly customized car, which is one of the cooler features of the Scion brand. I love the fact that it's not the same looking as most other cars out there (until they gain more popularity), and I get looks everywhere I go. It's not for everyone, but those that enjoy these cars will really LOVE them. A great car for a first-time purchaser such as myself and definitely worth every penny so far.
