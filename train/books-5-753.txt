Roald Dahl's modern day fairy tale, The Witches, is absolutely irresistible. The story revolves around a young boy who finds out that witches really do exist, and then he goes on a crusade to stop them. The story is very exciting from beginning to end, especially the scenes in which the young boy is plotting against the witches, and there is also a lot of humor. In one of my favorite scenes, the young boy has to tell his friend's parents that their son has been turned into a mouse. The parents don't take the news well, and what ensues is riotously funny. I read this book aloud to at least seven classes of second-graders over the years, and they always begged me to keep reading.
