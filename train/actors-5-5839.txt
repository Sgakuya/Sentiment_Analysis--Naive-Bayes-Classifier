I have seen all his films, now. The man, simply, has it ! He is absolutely convincing, all the time. No matter, what kind of character, he plays -from Jack Dawson to Arnie Grape. No matter how long he is in the film -from minutes, as in Celabrity or all the time, as in The Beach. He stands out. That is what makes him such a good actor. And apart from that, he has charisma. Something so very absent in most actors, today, good and bad. He is goegeous and sexy from any angle! He has become a star . However, he IS an ACTOR strong and true to his craft. There are good actors, but I had never seen any one one who can communicate on so many different levels, as Leonardo does!
