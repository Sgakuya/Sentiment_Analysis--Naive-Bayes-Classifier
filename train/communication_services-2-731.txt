I used to be a SprintPCS customer from 1995 to 2003, but one final straw pissed me off enough to drop them like a sack of sh*t. SprintPCS saves three address fields for mailing address, home address, and home-site address for taxes and tariffs. I moved from HI to CA in 1999, and SprintPCS easily handled that moved. I moved from CA to NV in 2001, and mysteriously, I was still paying CA taxes and tariffs - CA has some of the highest mobile taxes and tariffs! In 2002, I moved back to HI and called customer service to get it all straighted out. This is how I found out about the 3rd address field. SprintPCS customer service told me they would credit me with any refund I was due over the 2 year period in which my home-site address was being billed wrong. Welp, it's been over half a year, and I haven't seen no refund yet. I tried to get their current 7pm nights promotion upgraded to my account for free, but the customer service SUPERVISOR was adamant on not giving in; they inisted I had to pay $5 more per month (I was already paying $70/month for their vision plan!) and commit to another 2 more years on a service contract. I told them to shove it up their asses and cancel my account.
