Sprint is disappointing. First, they promised a Samsung i700 Pocket PC phone in their press release of March 03. They never produced the phone by second quarter 03 as promised. In the meantime, another carrier did. I'm sure Sprint now wonders why they lost the revenue. If you look at your last Sprint wireless phone bill, you will see a surcharge for the phone number portability act. The federal government directed that Sprint and other wireless carriers must permit you to transfer your cell phone number to a new carrier after November 03 if you change carriers. Knowing they might lose customers, Sprint fought the law in court, and lost. Now they are making customers finance their unsuccessful litigation! Customer service has gotten better, but it took so long to recognize, acknowledge and and fix the problem they lost many customers in the meantime. I hope the company survives because we need competition to keep prices down and service high for everyone, but I sometimes wonder how the company will fare in the future because of their past actions.
