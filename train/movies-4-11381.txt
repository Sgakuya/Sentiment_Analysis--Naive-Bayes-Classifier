I rented this thinking it would be so-so. I actually ended up liking this movie. Hal is a guy who only looks at women for how they look. He wants a 10 and they are way out of his league. He meets Tony Robbins the motivational speaker and they get stuck in an elevator. Tony sort of hypnotises Hal into only seeing a womens inner beauty. now he sees women as beautiful {when they are not all that physically beautiful} he meets Rosemary a very nice lady who he sees as thin and beautiful. She is really 300 pounds . at one point he has a friend who gets him unhypnotised but Hal finds in the end what true love is and liking someone for their inner beauty is more important. It has some funny scenes. A better movie than I thought it would be. Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jason Alexander were all good in their roles.
