I'm not going to lie, I'm a nit-picker when it comes to films and the beginning of Spider-Man 2 was extremely slow in paces, then I understood the screen writers objective as they were trying to establish the conflict of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. To take a well known story and characters from a comic book by adapting it to the big screen is not easy, take a look at the first X-Men, Catwoman and those horrid Batman Returns, Batman Forever and goodness knows how many in that tawdary series. So really and truly I take my hat off to the screenwriters for a good script, the casting director for spot-on casting, even the special effects looked better than before, still cartoonish, but a big improvement overall.
