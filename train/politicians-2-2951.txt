He said the right thing at the right time and the people welcomed the news. Perhaps it's his lack of political experience more than deceit but he wasn't able to deliver the goods as promised. I would hope that now that he has tasted big time politics his promises will be more in line with what he can actually do rather than everything that he would like to see get done. It's one thing to have Vince McMahon run your gimmick in the world of professional wrestling but it's another game altogether when presenting your gimmick to the American public who have their money and general welfare on the line. I'd like to see him have another chance to find out if he has learned what it takes to be a politician who can negotiate and deliver. If he still can't follow through then the voters should pin his shoulders to the mat, count to three, and send him back to the locker room.
