A complete player? Is this some kind of joke? Sprewell has owned the designation of NBA's Most Overrated Player since he wrested the title away from then-teammate Allan Houston in mid-2001. He always had a high scoring average, but only because he was a very average offensive performer on a team with many options that were even worse than him. He may be the worst rebounding swingman in the game, he's turnover prone, a mediocre passer, rarely gets to the foul line, and isn't a high-percentage 3-point shooter. Yet, because he periodically dunks, is often in the news (for ignominious things, no less), and pads his stats by playing a lot of minutes, people mistake him for an effective player. He is a very good defender, but Minnesota would have done well to give Trenton Hassell, an equally inept offensive player but a far cheaper defensive whiz, Sprewell's minutes.
