FIRSTLY: The only people that i've run into so far that are anti bush,are also anti-american government...ie,unamerican or anti-america. Also they seem to be people that have no understanding of politics and how our government works..also they seem to be people that are flaming liberals...you know...drugs should be legalised,prostitution should be legalised, and we shouldn't be told by anyone,police or fed what we can and can't do after 11pm...these are the kinds of idiots that i've noticed seem to have the anti-american,anti-bush attitude...throwbacks from the 70's hippy era and / or school students that we see on the talk shows that have no idea of how government works 'nor why we're even fighting the war to begin with(but yet the media still interviews these young ignorant students as though everyone is supposed to take their attitudes of the war seiously). so next time someone moans and bitches about the american government as though they're nazis,consider the source...unintelligent or just plain not informed(or both).
