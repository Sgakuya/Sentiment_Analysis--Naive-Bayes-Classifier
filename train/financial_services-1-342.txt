I have been a Wachovia (and later Bank One) customer for almost nine years. I endured predatory interest rates as high as 25.5%, rip-off late fees as high as $29.00 and shoddy customer service. I recently managed to pay my balance off. I had called several times as my balance drew close to zero to obtain a pay-off amount, and Bank One's customer service representatives were never able to get me an exact amount, because the balance was changing on a daily basis. As a result, I guessed at the actual payoff amount and subsequently overpaid my final check by 53 cents. No big deal, I thought; Bank One will simply issue me a check for the overpayment. I called in this evening to request that Bank One send me a check for 53 cents and they refused, saying that they don't send checks for less than a dollar. I then asked to have them wire it directly to my checking account and again they refused. Funny how Bank One was always eager to wire money FROM my checking account. Now suddenly they are unable to wire money INTO my checking account. Never mind that there is no policy statement about minimum balance thresholds for credit requests. Never mind that Bank One made thousands of dollars from me over the past nine years. Now they won't refund me 53 measely cents? That is pathetic. What would have happened if my personal policy dictated that I blow off the last 53 cents I owed on my credit card? Without blinking, Bank One would have trashed my credit rating and slapped me with $29.00 monthly late fees for the rest of my natural life. Does Bank One have any sense of decency or fair play? Is there a soul at Bank One? I'm posting this letter all over the Internet and I will bad-mouth Bank One for years to come. I sure hope it was worth my 53 cents.
