He is typical of Hollywood actors of his time in that he tended to play the same role again and again (the aw-shucks good guy), especially in comedies, but he did a real fine job in those dark westerns he appeared in after WWII. I tend to like him more in dramatic roles, but he did well in Harvey and Mr. Smith... He oozed intelligence and sensitivity, but his acting doesn't strike one as being necessarily modern. Alas, he did hang in there too long and ended up making some junk in the later stages of his career, most notably in the Glenn Miller biopic, the Strategic Air Command piece of propaganda and that dreadful FBI movie, but on the whole, his body of work is among the best. However, his politics really sucked, and that gung-ho American superpatriot crap was really heavy-handed, unnecessary, square and nauseatingly goody-goody, especially when you consider he was airing out that nonsense during the Viet Nam era. Kinda out-of-step during one of the darkest periods of American history, a time when one should have been ashamed of simplistic, reductive military answers to complex geopoltiical problems instead of insisting this was A-OK, bombs away. History proved that Jimmy was on the wrong side of the issue, but that does not take anything away from his work as an actor. It's interesting to note that rightwingers are always trashing liberal Hollywood types for voicing their opinions on the issues, but set up conservative Hollywood types who do the same as icons of What's Right With America. Actually, each is just as bad as the other, and it's disingenuous for people to get into that game.
