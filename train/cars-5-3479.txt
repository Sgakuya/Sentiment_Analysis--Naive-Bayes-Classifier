Purchased my Highlander on June 13th and couldn't be happier. A solid feeling vehicle, excellent Toyota reliability. Made in the same plant as the Lexus RX-300. V6 220HP engine, silky smooth transmission, (the exact same engine and transmission as the Lexus RX-300 by the way) plenty of room, huge sunroof. I test drove a number of other SUV's but I can honestly say the ride and general feeling of quality just didn't match. Toyota also covers the engine and powertrain for 5 years/60,000 miles at no extra charge. This is in addition to the 3 years/36,000 bumper-to-bumper. As a suggestion, I would recommend anyone interested in purchasing a new vehicle to go to Edmunds.com and check out 'Town Hall' where you can read the good and bad about just about any vehicle you are thinking about buying. It's based on consumers just like you and me and how they are doing with vehicles they have recently purchased. I was able to obtain a wealth of information there prior to test driving. Also check out the goverments site for recalls www.nhtsa.gov I think there is a link at Edmunds.com I wish everyone the best of luck in seeking out their 'dream car'!!!! Thanks for reading!!! :-)
