I normally don't agree with someone when they say this place sucks but man does it. The river boat gambling in Missouri was one step above church bingo with more degenerates. Maybe I'm a snob but I've been to numerous casinos, from Foxwoods in Connecticut to resorts in Puerto Rico- I go to Las Vegas every year and I grew up 40 minutes from Atlantic City NJ- and St Louis was easily the worst! The boat was hot a muggy inside. You needed to sign up for a gambling card before entering. The circulation was horrible and the roulette tables were stained and nasty- and without the normal digital boards to display the previous numbers. But all that aside it was the people who you were forced to rub elbows with- drunk rednecks and dirtballs betting the rent money (literally), that made this such a poor experience.
