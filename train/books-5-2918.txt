This book is, without any question, one of the best horror novels around. At least, that's what I believe. Carrie is one of King's earliest books (in fact, I believe it's his first one), and even still he manages to make you hang on to every word. This book is not told from one point of view, directly. It is more of a collection of documents, mixed with the actual story telling - but I found this added to the effect. A few moments were a bit tedious, like when that one guy was hanging the buckets of blood above the stage (I can't remember his name off hand), I felt there wasn't a need to become so technical with the descriptions... however that certainly wasn't enough to make me put the book down. You know that something's coming, and that when you turn the page, something is just bound to jump out at you. You know it! Stephen King has that wonderful gift in his writing. If you haven't read it, pick up a copy, I don't care if you've seen the movie or not.
