I am so hooked on this stuff that it's sad. I like the sugar free variety. I'm trying to keep it down to one a day now. There was a time when I was chugging 3 or 4. Red Bull has made my (professional) life possible. The problem is is that it is probably facilitating my demise as well. I have high blood pressure and I'm sure my doctor would sh-- if he knew I am a consumer of this fine product. OBSERVATION: The quality of caffeine has grown dramatically in the last 15 years. If they had had Starbucks and Red Bull back when I was in grad school I'd have never slept. I did it back then with No-Doz and diet pills.
