Alltel does not deserve to get a star. If there were negative stars, this is what they would receive. We have had nothing but problems with their customer service(or lack there of). When we signed our contract, the plan was suppose to include Pittsburgh as a local calling area which we found out was not true when we incurred expensive roaming charges. Then we were incurring roaming charges within our local calling area which we were told was because the towers outside of our calling area were stronger. I paid my bill at the store once(and only once) resulting in my phone service being cancelled for nonpayment then tried to charge me $30 to reactivate the service they cancelled in error. When they cancelled our service, they did not even have the courtesy to notify us our service was terninated. They would not upgrade our phone because the promotions were only for new customers. After receiving a letter that Verizon Wireless is taking over our area, my phone stopped working due to mechanical failure. I called Alltel and they did not even know Verizon was taking over our area and offered me a new phone with a rebate. When I called the number for purchasing, they told me they could not sell me a phone because they no longer service the area. Does the right hand know what the left hand is doing? Finally, I tried to cancel my service because we are now VERIZON customers, I kept getting put on hold and being disconnected . When I finally spoke to a human being, they told me the cancellation department was already closed for the day. Now I have to endure the torture of having to call them one more time (or ten more if I continue to get disconnected again). If they can not even keep the land line connected, what kind of service are they providing? IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING ALLTEL, RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!!!!!
