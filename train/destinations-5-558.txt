I went on vacation last year and found Puerto Rico to be an awsome place, the people are very friendly and do welcome you with open arm's, wether you speak the native language or not, I am not fluent with the spanish language, but the people were friendly, for instance I was walking the streets in the town of (Rincon) looking at the beautiful house's that are for sale because I am looking to buy some realestate on the beachfront, anyway it started to rain and some people who I've never seen in my life offer me and my wife to come in out of the rain so we did and we talked to the guy and he was very pleasant with us and offered us food and beverages until the rain was gone, I also toured the Island and found the people to speak English where ever I went, yes there is trash on the beautiful beaches, that comes from tourist and the natives from what I've seen while I was there... so if there is realy a big issue about trash on the Island, why don't you do somthing about it insted of trash talking about the place !!! I'm from New Jersey, West Ny Nj right acoss the Hudson from Manhattan, and there is crime here wherever you go, here you look at somone, they are ready to take action and use violence, so about crime in Puerto Rico, take a quick glance at where you come from, cause your world is not so perfect !!! Anyone can come and rate this topic of The Shining Star Of The Caribean, and try to sabotage tourism, but it's not going to work for me because I love Puerto Rico even though I am half Caucasian... I think everyone should go and see for themselves, seeing is believing... I am going to Puerto Rico next month to invest and get my piece of the pie before it's all bought up by outsider's who know where to put their money...
