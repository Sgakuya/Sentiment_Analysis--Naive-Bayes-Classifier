I thought this was a very enjoyable movie, tho perhaps subpar for director Jim Jarmusch. Here's a good idea for another film: how about a documentary that shows the reactions of people who rent this, thinking its going to be an action-packed kung-fu movie? If you know anything about Jarmusch's films, its that they're very deliberate and quirky, there's almost always some subtitles and a lot of long shots of people walking. The soundtrack is perfectly suited to the film, which is nothing if not artful. While not as funny/charming as, say, Dead Man or Mystery Train, it's worth watching just for the great scene where an Italian mobster is singing Public Enemy's Cold Lampin with Flavor Flav to himself in the mirror...
