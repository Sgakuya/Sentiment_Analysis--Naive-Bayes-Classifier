Not much appeal in the visual department, with computer graphics and very little action. (I have yet to find it online in color, too.) The variety has also been reduced, with most strips nowadays being conversations between Huey and Caesar regarding celebrities famous in the black community. Still, I never expected so much consistency from a cartoonist so young -- the comic premiered when he was 24. The real delight is also the reason many hate it: blunt, far-left politics. Be sure to recognize this as a satire: the cartoonist does not actually promote Riley's mini-thug life or Huey's early Malcolm X-type belligerence, nor does he think all white kids are as ignorant as Cindy. A somewhat nice haven for those who like his ideas, and a stance for debate for those who don't.
