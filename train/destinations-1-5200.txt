Deffinetly over-rated. People always talk about it being the most naturally beautiful landscapes in America. I mean, not to say it isn't nice, but far from being superior to the rest of the country. You can find places just as beautiful or even more in places like New England or the Rockies. It's average beauty, most states could match it in one way or another. And i am simply refering to the Northern part of the state, with the redwoods and green hills. I really don't see the beauty that you hear about in Southern California, its a desert wasteland that is being polluted by the dirtiest city in America, LA. And if it is so great, then why are they all dumping it for places like, nevada, colorado, idaho and all of those other interior west states. California was a fad. It's growth now is no longer people from other parts of the country seeking life in the promise land . It is mostly growing from illegal immigrants jumping the boarder, and hopeless kids that didn't get into college coming to see if they can make it in showbiz. Not a fraction as glamourous as it likes to make itself look.
