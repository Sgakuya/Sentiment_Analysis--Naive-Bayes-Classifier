Jill Hennessy rules! She can say more with a look than so many actresses can't even get across with the words someone wrote for them! Sadly, that's not the kind of acting that tends to get awards ' the voters seem to *want* over the top performances. Plus Jill's not afraid to step outside her comfort zone for a role she believes in ' check out Chutney Popcorn for a FANTASTIC performance in a role many actresses would have been afraid to take on for fear of being looked down on or alienated by their fans because of the subject matter. From all I've read and seen, Jill acts because she loves it and that's the only reason! And I really love that about her! Go Jill!!
