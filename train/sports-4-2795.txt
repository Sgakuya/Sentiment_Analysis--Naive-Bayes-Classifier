Mike Hargrove was a decent ballplayer and is a top quality manager. He is always a gentleman and almost never loses his temper. That fact is both a plus and a minus. He never causes any bad publicity for his team or his city, that's good. If his team is in a slump, or the players get lazy or lack ambition, and they need a swift kick in the seat of the pants, then Mike Hargrove is lacking. He expects the players to be adults and play for the team and the fans, and that just doesn't automatically happen in modern day baseball. He is a good manager, but not a good babysitter, and both are needed if you want to win the world series.
