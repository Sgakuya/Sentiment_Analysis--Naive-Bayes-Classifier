Over the past few years I've read quite a few WW2 books, and I also read Keegan's book on World War One. Overall, I find Keegan's history to be reasonably even-handed and engaging, and in The Second World War I think he does an admirable job of covering a spectacularly huge event in a single volume. He includes quite a few pictures and maps, which go a long way towards supporting the text. So if you're looking for a relatively short overview of WW2, this isn't a bad choice. But Keegan is a little dry for me. He fails to bring to life the incredibly dynamic key figures of the war - Churchill, Stalin, Hitler, Roosevelt, etc. And compressing The Second World War into a single volume doesn't leave room for Keegan to tell many of the amazing stories of the individual combat soldiers - stories that can really drive home the terrible, heroic, tragic, and sometimes inspiring reality of the war. If you're interested in WW2 books, I'd also recommend Churchill's classic The Second World War as a great overview (certainly biased, but with fascinating first-hand accounts of key events that you can't get in other books), Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose (for a look at the everyday activities of one Company from D-Day to the fall of Germany), American Caesar by William Manchester (a biography of MacArthur that sheds light on the often underrepresented war in the Pacific), and at least one book on the war in the East between Germany and Russia - far too often overlooked by those of us here in the U.S.; you might try Stalingrad (an account of the single most important battle of the entire war) by Antony Beevor, or Forgotten Soldier (a harrowing autobiography by a German soldier who fought on the eastern front) by Guy Sajer.
