I've read this book four times and it never ceases to amaze me. The writing is clever and the characters never seem over-the-top. It tells the story of Rob, a 30-something who's having a hard time coping with his most serious relationship to date going down the drain. To drown his sorrows he starts to think about what went wrong, why all of his relationships have failed and why anyone with the least bit of intellegence would be a Simple Minds fan. This story always remain grounded and nothing is ever 'just great' or 'marvellous'. But that's the great thing about it, it tells the ordinary life of an ordinary man, just trying to get on with his life.
