I will not make excuses for Carolina. But how idiotic are Wake fans for chanting overrated at the North Carolina Tarheels? Especially since Wake played an almost miracle - ish perfect game, while Carolina played absolutely awful, yet stayed within striking distance the whole game. I mean, if we would've played half way decent, Wake wouldn't have had a chance. I thought, being made up of mostly NC natives, Wake fans were smarter than that. You're chanting overrated at a team you're ranked higher than? How pathetic. Even more idiotic, is the fact you chanted that in the first half - AGAINST THE TARHEELS,- you're lucky we didn't come back and win. Then you would've looked real stupid. Do you have ANY IDEA, how many thousands of double digit deficits Carolina has come back from in the past? IDIOTS!
