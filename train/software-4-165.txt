Firefox has increaced funtionality as opposed to IE, with features like tabbed browsing and it's many extensions such as mouse gestures. After using them, these are two functions I would not want to do without. Conversion (ie: learning curve) from IE is also relitively seamless. All of your bookmarks are imported automaticly and the layout is very similar. You'll be used to it within a day of use. In terms of security, it is much better than IE, but certtainly not air tight. As it was predicted, with it's rising popularity, popups are beginning to affect Firefox as well. - I get them every day now (and yes, blocking is on) In the next few months and years, we'll see if Firefox is truly more secure, or if it's original immunity to intrusuions was simply due to it's lack of widespread use. For the most part though, It's excellent. My computer has been relitivle spyware free and although I do get daily popups, it's still 95% less than I get with IE. 4 stars.
