My wife and I have had a Wachovia account for six months. It seems that every week they figure out a way to hit us with at least one insufficient funds fee, regardless of the fact that we keep constant track of our funds. They way the do it is by outright deception, and in some cases, twisting of their own rules. This is the only bank I've ever had where you can deposit CASH, and have a hold placed on it! They'll tell you that you have plenty of money in your account, and later, hit you up with MULTIPLE NSF fees, only to tell you later that the funds weren't actually 'cleared', although your online account may say they are. The only reason I kept them this long is because of both of our work schedules... it's impossible to take the time to open an account elsewhere. Then last week... I deposited my WACHOVIA paycheck and had them deposit it as CASH. Two hours later, I bought something with my card (as a credit purchase) and received an NSF fee. For what??? Even the idiot on the phone had trouble explaining it. I still don't know why! Several days later, I realized we went over the limit by $9. Any other bank I've ever had would've hit us with an NSF fee... and rightly so, however Wachovia hit us with FIVE fees, telling us that they're charging us from the first occurrence of insufficient funds, even though only ONE transaction put us over the limit. $150! My wife spent an hour on the phone in tears telling them that it's four days till Christmas and we need the money to buy our 4-month old presents for her first Christmas. "It was a $9 mistake, we never asked for ANYTHING from you before". They just kept telling us it wasn't they're problem and that's how they run things there. They wouldn't even budge on ONE fee. Thanks for the Holiday cheer, Wachovia! I'm taking a long lunch tomorrow and will be going to another bank to open an account. I cannot afford to pay out $150 three days before Christmas!
