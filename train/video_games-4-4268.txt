A pretty old-school game, I was surprised to see it rated here. For a game from 1996 on the Pentium-1 (and some 486's), it does a solid job. No conference affiliations hurt the realism, but they did a good job of putting the regions together like the real-life conferences. Recruiting is somewhat realistic, but I've had times when a player favored my team, but he signed with another team after I wasted visits on him. When you edit player names, they don't seem to save; I learned this the hard way after spending an hour and a half editing Duke to be the actual 2001 roster, only to see it be for nothing when I started the game again. But despite it's flaws, NCAA offers some fun gameplay and an ahead-of-it's-time season mode. I would recommend it.
