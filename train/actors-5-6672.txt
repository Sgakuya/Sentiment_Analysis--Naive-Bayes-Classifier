What sets this country apart from most of the world is our GLORIOUS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT! Tim Robbins is the most patriotic person in this country because he questions our leaders! He questions our government and he urges all of us to speak our minds in the face of an overwhelming tide of forced partiotism. Many opponents of the war are silenced out of fear from the Patriot-Nazis who send death threats to anyone who speaks out against Bush. Hmm, isn't that how things were run in Iraq? All of you who follow Bush like a bunch of stupid sheep should thank Tim Robbins for standing up for your constitutional rights because it's people like him that remind us in these scary times that exercising Free Speech is the most patriotic act a citizen of this great land can commit! Tim Robbins speaks out against Ashcroft's KGB-like laws and stands up to biased media, death-threats and ignorant rabble-rousers that blindly believe everything the Bush administration spins. He is a real American. It's easy to slap an American flag on the back of your car and call yourself a patriot, it's quite another to stand up in the face of menacing opposition and fight to protect our right to speak out. Think about it people!
