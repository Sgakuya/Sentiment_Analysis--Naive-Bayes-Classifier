I cannot think of a more disgraceful example of an American president than this guy. He takes credit for the good that others do (economics - Greenspan, Republican led Congress), blamed others for the problems he has caused (Whitewater, Monica, hotel White House) and he borders on the brink of being a traitor. Selling codes to the Chinese for Democratic fund raising dollars seems like a good idea, right? Very intelligent man with not a thread of moral fiber in his being. Shame on those who elected him the second time. Damn Ross Perot from giving him his first election win. As time goes on, he will be droping lower and lower in presidential comparisons. Suffered from a disease best identified by Robin Williams - a blood disorder: God didn't give him enough blood to supply his head and his penis at the same time. Good ridance.
