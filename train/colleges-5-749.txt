I'm completing my PhD in psyc next quarter at Capella. It is for REAL. You will EARN your degree. It has been a REWARDING, CHALLENGING, and WONDERFUL experience. I highly recommend Capella to anyone willing to work hard to make their dreams come true. I attended a traditional brick/mortar grad school for a few terms before realizing my travel schedule at work was going to bring things to a halt. Then I found out about Capella and checked it out thoroughly and verified its credentials. Not only is it NOT a degree mill it is MUCH more challenging than a traditional grad program. You see in an online grad school you can't sit at the back of the room and daydream while other students carry the burden. You are engaged and challenged on each posting you make. By the way, I also earned my MS at Capella and I was subsequently hired full-time as an instructor at a community college. Who knows what heights I will reach next with my doctorate from Capella! Too bad we don't have a football team to brag about... LOL
