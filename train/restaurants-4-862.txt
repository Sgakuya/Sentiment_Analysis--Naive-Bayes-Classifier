we also only have 30 min. for lunch, but check this out, The owner of the subway near our work is so cheap!!!! He watches every item that his workers put on the sandwiches, and believe me it's every item!! He yelled at one of the workers for putting too many olives on a sandwich, he doesn't let anyone else touch the register but him. Also, we had all bought gold cards from schools in the area, you get discounts from some restraunts. It had one for subway in our city it was a buy one get one free with the purchase of a drink. The discount didn't say what size the drink had to be, so for all the people that had the discount book he made them buy a large drink. What a jerk!! Then when he realized that the large drink didn't bother some people, he put up a sign saying that the gold card wasn't accepted at his subway anymore. This subway is located on valley blvd. in Fontana, Ca. across the street from Kaiser Hospital. Also, he doesn't hire enough people during lunch hour so the line is always out the door. If someone is looking to open up a subway make one in the area, Make it big and have a lot of staff especially around lunch time.
