Tomlinson is a fantasy stud, that's for sure. While he slipped a bit in 2004, the year before he was top-5 in the NFL in rushing, plus he led the league in receptions! Now, stepping back to objectivity: Many of those catches were short dump-offs from Drew Brees (pre-rejuvenation version) because San Diego had no legit recievers. Still, he's quick, agile, has good vision, and is one of the best backs around. If drafting for real-life, I would take a healthy Priest Holmes, Curtis Martin, Corey Dillon, Shaun Alexander, Edgerrin James, maybe even Tiki Barber or Rudi Johnson before him, because they're all more consistent rushers. Fantasy-wise, though, how can you beat the guy?
