I bought a 1996 Kawasaki 750STS Jetski in summer of 2005. This is my first jet ski. It has a rebuilt motor from SBT and this unit runs great. It is not the fastest craft on the water, but has more than adequate power for a beginner. Top speed is 40mph and will haul a skier/tube easily. It has a very stable hull and is easy to do power slides and 360s. After riding it all summer, I would have to say that it is the best investment in a "toy" that I have ever made. The parts are fairly cheap for these older craft, and if you can find a used one with a good hull and good motor, this is a ski worth looking into, especially if it is your first PWC. Tim Allums P.S. I highly recommend pre-mixing your own oil and gas on any two-stroke motor; that way you'll never have to worry about an oil-injector pump going bad and burning up the motor. This is probably the number one cause of jet ski engine failure. At first I was concerned about the "hassle" of pre-mixing, but it's really no big deal. You can get a pre-mix bottle to accurately meter out how much oil you need at Wal-Mart or any sporting goods store that sells boating stuff.
