whats up jason williams is sweet. he is so under rated because of c web and that peja guy. williams coul;d be a top vote getter for the all stars if he made more points more assists amd less turnovers. he is my favorite player and he should be rated a lot higher by the nba and all the fans. keep an eye on him i do i have wallpaper his home and away jersey and every single card that hass come out of him. so thats what i think i think his passes are sweet and i like it when he is on the bench with the towel over his head and his hands down his pants. well pece peace jason williams all the way. kings nba champs in 2001
