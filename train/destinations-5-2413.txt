Athens, and Greece in general, is a MUST on your itinerary! If you value history, the arts, and some of the most gorgeous shoreline, beaches, and islands anywhere on this planet, you should visit at least once. Make sure you read up on Greece in advance though. I highly recommend some of the major 'travelguides' to take with you, and please be careful when you cross the streets there. They drive like French cab drivers on speed! LOL! P.S. To those that commented about how some Athenians don't like Americans, this is not true. What they don't like (which applies to most countries these days, INCLUDING many Americans themselves) is our foreign policy with assclown Bush in office. Please keep that in mind.
