New York is the greatest city in the USA. It's great because it is a city in every sense of the word. There is just so much to see and do that it never gets boring, is always happening and just has a vibrancy and life that you wont find anywhere else in the US. New York has some of the best bars, restuarants, entertainment venues, shopping,nightlife to offer. Many places you may have heard of are in NYC. It takes a thick skin and some street saavy to get around the city but there is just so much to offer that it makes it's faults enough to deal with. New York is a great walking city as well. Walking and the subway are the best way to go unless you really need to take a cab. Life on the city streets is great as well. It's a great place to just people-watch. I've got a lot of love for New York. I never thought I'd feel that way and that tells me (you) just how great this place really is. Very cosmopolitan as well.
