What is there to be said about playing a Jedi Knight? If you are a Star Wars fan then your dream has always been to wield the mystic yet deadly lightsaber. Factor in the amazing John Williams music, fantastic 3-D backgrounds, smooth and challenging gameplay and a few stormtroopers to MAKE YOUR DAY you know you've got a game that Has The Force. Taking the role of Kyle Kattan you can follow the role as protector or take the path to the Dark Side. The choice is yours and ultimately will affect you in the end. You start with your capable blaster and will graduate to more powerful weapons such as the Rail Gun. Once you find your father's lightsaber and accrue the Power Of The Force, a powerful jedi will you become-as Yoda once told a young Luke Skywalker. Solo play is fantastic with challenging missions, or jump online and whack your friend with a lightsaber. May The Force Be With You!
