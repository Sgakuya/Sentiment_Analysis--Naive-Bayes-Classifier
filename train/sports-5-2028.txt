Fun team to watch. I initially became interested in the A's after reading Billy Beane's book Moneyball. The team consistently finds a way to make the playoffs or be a contender while having one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. By focusing on stats like on base percentage rather that ba or home runs, they are able to get quality players at an affordable price. Once a player gets hot and demands too high a salary, they trade him off and pick up a young pitcher. The two veteran leaders on the team - Zito and Chavez - are only 26 and 27 years old. All in all they're a scrappy team that's passionate about the game. btw, love the Iverson picture.
