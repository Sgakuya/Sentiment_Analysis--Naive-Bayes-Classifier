My flatmate has a book of Calvin Hobbes cartoon strips and being a nosey little girl I decided to read it - and I am so glad I did. Calvin is a very intelligent young boy who has a fantastic vocabulary and kinda speaks to his parents just a tiny bit rudely - hates school and has the most fantastic adventures with Hobbes. I love the time when Calvin made this machine (which was just a cardboard box) and when you went into it, you could become a different animal - Calvin became a tiger just like Hobbes and then Hobbes turned him into the wrong thing - or the one where Calvin duplicates himself! This is absolutely hilarious and I would love to get my hands on more.
