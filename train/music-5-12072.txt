I happen to think that Mary is one of the most beautiful black women on this earth and the fact that she has gotten herself togethr to the point that she wants to reach out to others and give advice on what not to do in this world is great. Mary I don't know if you read this or not but I love you and everything that you stand for you give me hope that I will succeed in this life. Don't worry about what other people have to say as long as you and God got it straight the rest of that bull don't mean nothin' . My mama always said when they talk about you it is cause thay want to be like you. Mary we have all had ours times but if we take the bad and examine it we can find a lesson in it and turn it into something good that will help us and others. So KEEP YOUR HEAD UP SISTA, and keep that good music coming forever. Jacqui from Iowa
