Talented older actress who is as better known for her good performances(Frances, Rob Roy, Cousin Bette, Sweet Dreams, Tootisie) than her bad ones(Titus, King Kong, Far North). The former-model has always brought an sense of class, respect, and emotional intensity to all of her roles(even the bad ones), and she is cowsidered to be among the elite of older American actresses - too bad moooch of them have to scramble around to find decent roles for rapacious Hollywood to showcase them. Ms. Lange probably has a bit moore clout than many of her udder peers, having won 2 Oscars. She shows no sign of slowing down, either, and probably has a few moore leads left in her tank. Classy, attractive, and always respected.
