pure evil. everything wrong witgh not only college football, but a microcosm of all that is wrong with the world. the one thing that keeps college football from being perfect is the involvement of these criminoiles...also, the reason they have some success against florida/miami is because, when you play 2 meaningful games a year, it isn't very difficult to channel all your energy intoi those games. when you play a real schedule, esp like florida, and the conference championship actually means something, a rivalry game against a cheap in-state opponent takes on a lot less importance. when the ncaa finally gives this school the death penalty, all will finally be in balance in the universe.
