When I was a kid, my parents used to use this airlines to ship me and my brothers back and forth to each other after their divorce. My Daddy lived in Orlando, Florida and my Momma lived in Casper, Wyoming. So needless to say we needed a good airline that had good service for children travelling without parents. We usually only flew twice a year, and even though I was a kid, I remember how professional and great they were. We were assigned a flight attendant to look out for us all the way to our destination until our father picked us up at the airport. I remember at the time they always had a warm meal on the plane, which is so rare nowadays. At the time however, they didn't have any entertainment whatsoever, not even the choice to buy a movie or even watch a movie. But overall, I totally enjoyed the experiences I had with this airline. It was also the first airline I ever flew on. Not superb, but really good !
