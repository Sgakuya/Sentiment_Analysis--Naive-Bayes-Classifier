I hate Whitehall Jewelers....DO NOT EVER USE THEM FOR ANYTHING. We have purchased two wedding rings (my first ring and an upgrade) from them, and still get the worst service you can imagine. When I purchased my upgrade in 2002, I bought the extended warranty. Last year, one of my diamonds was cracked. First of all, how do you crack a diamond right? It took them 9 1/2 weeks to get it fixed, and this is after they finally decided that it would be covered under the warranty I purchased. Aug. 4th, I took my ring in to have it sized, and it was promised by 8/8/05. It is not 8/24 and I still don't have it back and they just keep giving me the run around. I will NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN!!!!!
