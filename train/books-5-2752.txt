Great whether you agree or disagree with the Atkins method. It is a fresh look at the different types of diets which may suit different types of people. In particular the diet would be great for Carbohydrate addicts. For all the bad press - the diet has been vindicated now by several studies and has been proven to work for 99% od those who follow it under strict conditions. You can still be smart and get all the nutrients you need without cheating the diet. When you zoom out and look at the BIG PICTURE, these facts solve the problem for anyone in doubt: 1) The diet more closely immitates the diets we were evolved to eat as early man (without large rice/wheat harvests and before manufacturing) 2) Why has there been such an epidemic of obesety and diabetes since the high carb Food Pyramid was introduced. 3) Miraculously, it works. Even if you don't agree with Atkins and all the book achieves is to get people of sugar and refined carbs - it will save the western world from it myriad of health problems stemming from woefully inadequate diets.
