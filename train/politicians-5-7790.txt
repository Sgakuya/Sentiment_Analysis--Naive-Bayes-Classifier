He epitomized honor, civility, and humility. His presence was enough to claim the awe of even his political opponents. Washington is certainly one of the most beloved leaders in all of history and one of the greatest men as well. He made the union and Constitution possible while preserving the notion of a limited central government. He served his nation out of duty not out of a lust for power. As president he refused to give in to some of the more extreme wishes of Hamilton and the Federalists, kept the nation of war with Britain (over the French issue), and set some of the most essential precidents for the republic. The first and best president this country has ever had.
