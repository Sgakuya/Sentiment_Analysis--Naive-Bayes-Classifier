I loved Jesse as a wrestling announcer (I never saw him wrestle though, I got into wrestling just after he had retired and just had started announcing). He's very honest and very funny. Although I am a Republican, if I was a resident in Minnesota in 1998, I would have voted for him for Governor. I agree with him on a lot of issues (e.g. we both favor limited government and I like his call for legalized prostitution). However, I disagree with him vehemently on school vouchers and abortion, and those are two of my most important issues. Also, although I appreciate his honesty, he overgeneralized when he said that religion is a crutch for weak-minded people. It may be a crutch for some people, but not for a lot of Bible believers. I'm a Bible-believing, born-again Christian and a rejecter of evolution because I believe that when one looks objectively at the evidence, they'll realize that Jesus really did rise from the dead and he really was/is the son of God as well as God. And I've NEVER believed in evolution. The Bible says that God created man in his own image, it doesn't say that man was originally an ape and evolved into the image of God.
