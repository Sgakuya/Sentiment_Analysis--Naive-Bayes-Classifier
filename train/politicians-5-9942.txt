Ok, now let me update. George Bush is a great president for two reasons, he will do whatever it takes to protect this and other countries, including taking down an evil dictator, incase you haven't been keeping up to date with the trial (of course not, what am I thinking), People who lived in the country give eye-witness and personal accounts of him killing and torturing innocent people (I think that's proof enough). Go ahead, take Saddam's side. You might as well. You're practically campaigning for the guy. Just admit that you feel bad for him, and that you are just sooo open-minded that you even feel for this mad man. You make me sick. And yes, in my profile I do say that I will listen to the views of others if they are fact-based, logical, and not completely emotional, and I must admit that when it comes to supporting Bush some of it IS emotion. Oh, and the other reason I love my President is because I'm not a government-hating, anti-american, cynical Democrat, and neither is he and that's good enough for me. So would you like to further enlighten me because I think that you are part of a lost cause my friend.
