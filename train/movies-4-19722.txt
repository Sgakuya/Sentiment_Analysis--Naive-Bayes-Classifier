A pretty good movie. Kim Basinger is a woman who takes in a baby left by her drugged out sister, The little girl turns out to have special powers . At first she seem autistic,showing autistic like symtoms such as rocking and seeming unfocused. It turns out the child was born on a special day nine days before Christmas.She is sort of a chosen child who has a special link with God.At age six an evil man who is a satan worshipper kidnaps the child and tries to turn her to satan.Now the aunt has to get the child back and save her. The little girl has some sort of healing power {she brought a bird back to life} and the evil guy knows about this girl and knows about her powers.It has some special effects that are okay,showing the evil bat like ghosts. and the good angels. This is not great movie but has some good scenes and the actors are good.
