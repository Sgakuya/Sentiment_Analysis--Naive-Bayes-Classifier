Have you ridden in one, or just decided you don't like the way it looks? For that matter, have you read the comments of professional test drivers? Have you considered the cost, value and versatility relative to its competition? What use is an opinion on styling? That provides as much insight as saying the old Saab or the current Beatle or Hummer is a poor vehicle because it looks unusual. Go ahead and get an Explorer, or one of the other clone SUVs -- but don't bad rap the Aztek. If you don't realize Pontiac is always an outsider in appearance, you should. I rode in one and listened to its owner rave about every aspect of it. It was marvelous. I will buy one, and thanks to those of you who have written it off for superficial reasons, I'll save 10 grand versus the more conventional look-alikes. Life is too short to worry about appearances or what your neighbors will say -- they probably went for the Eddie Bauer thing (pitiful way to spend money). Get a life, and go for it. Or do you want to just hang with the pack? I won't give it a 5 because I haven't owned one (yet), but I'm tempted to just because I see some very unwarranted low ratings from some folks who probably looked at the Aztek for 30 seconds and formed their opinions.
