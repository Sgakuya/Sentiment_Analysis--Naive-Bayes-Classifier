I own a 97 Grand Cherokee Laredo and it has only given me 2 problems, 2 sensors I have to replace and I'm getting a short in the ignition, but other than that it has been a better choice than a Blazer or Explorer. It only has 132,000 mi and with proper care it should make it to 300, 000 without a problem. Any car can give u problems even new ones, Japanese suv's may be good but they can't tow a boat the same way an Explorer or a Grand Cherokee can. I will buy A 2000 or 2001 Grand Cherokee Limited V8 next year since they are great performers. If u want a worry free car I would advise a European make like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, or BMW because they are better performers than Japanese cars.
