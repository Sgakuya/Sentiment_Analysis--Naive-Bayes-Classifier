This was a good movie it was suspenseful. It starts out with Jesse Bradfords character and he helps the new girl open her locker because it was stuck after that she started to really like him and one day after the went and had lunch together as what he thought was friends but she did not and they decided to go for a swim because he is on the swim team and she wanted to learn how to swim then next thing you know they are making out and he does everything to make sure that his girlfirend does not find out after a while the girl started doing some crazy things that you would not believe. It was like fatal attraction but it was more suspenseful.
