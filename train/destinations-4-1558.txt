Germany invaded Russia, so the idea Russia joined in is silly. The non-agression pact the soviets had with Germany is one of the factors that lead to an earlier German attack on Poland. Hitler was impatient and failed to gain air supremacy for an invasion of England and decided to attack the Soviets. All of his advisors were against this since the real threat to the Reich was in the west. The failure to eliminate a launching point for the west is what lead to failure by the Nazis. And the Soviets were allowed to take over Berlin by the US and British. Patton and Montgomery were both upset that this was to occur. But politics ruled the day much of the time. Communism was also in full force long before WW2 started so the idea they turned to communism afterwards is not valid. As to the ACTUAL topic... I have never been to Russia but have read a few books on it and seen some documentaries on the land and people. It seems very nice and someplace worth visiting. The mixture of so many cultures provides rather unique architecture. I am not sure how much a trip there would cost but the history alone makes it worth at least one trip. I also wouldn't judge a countrys value as a destination based on its politics. Maybe I'd consider a danger factor but that would be rare. China for example would be a great place to visit for myself. Its history and culture are something best seen in person.
