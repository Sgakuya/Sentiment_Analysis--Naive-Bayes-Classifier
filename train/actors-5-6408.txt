The only movies I,ve seen with him are : Dawson's Creek and The Skulls, but what I can say is that he's just gorgeous.He's the person you wanna watch and it's not because he's so cute (in fact, he is).But after watching Dawson's I think that he's a really talented guy, with huge potential.His character Pacey is the most interesting character in the film, mainly because of Josh acting. He plays very convincingly and has great chemistry with his girl partners, especially with Katie Holmes. This chemistry lacked in Dawson and Joey's relationship,that's why Joe and Pacey should stay together.In fact he's the reason for my watching Dawson's.I hope he'll prove his talent and become a top actor. I think he deserves this.
