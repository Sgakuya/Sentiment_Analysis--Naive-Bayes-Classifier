Geeez give the associates of Wal-Mart a break!!! I am a 15 yr associate, when I go into a wal-mart I also am not seeing alot of smiling faces. These workers are under alot of stress most of the time. They are hearing what most of you are complaining about everyday but there is just nothing the workers can do about it. If you will notice when in a wal-mart you will never see managment on the salesfloor this is because they don't care what a customer or an associate thinks, all they care about is the almighty dollar. Wal-Mart workers are just ordinary everyday people that are trying to make a living at a terrible job where they are treated very poorly. The next time you are in a wal-mart and a associate is in your way with a buggy or the lines are long ask to speak to managment write a letter to the president of the company. Please don't blame it on the workers, they probably don't like the conditions that the store is in either but unless the consumers speak out the lines will remain long, because of being understaffed to cut payroll down so there will be a big bonus in the pockets of our almighty managment. Sometimes a wal-mart associate needs a smile and a pleasant person to make them have a better day. If the people who are complaining about shopping there think it's a bad experience,try to imagine working there!!! Smiles are free.
