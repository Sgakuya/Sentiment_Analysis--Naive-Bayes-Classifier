A very good superhero movie, but I don't prefer it over the first Superman, the X-Men or Spider-man. There are a couple of problems I had with the film. First, Jack Nicholson. He's won award after award and good for him. Me, I have never found him to be that great. He's completely overbearing and over the top as the Joker. It's almost like he's trying to out-do Jim Carrey at his own game, which is onscreen stupidity. Also, the whole look of the film in general is too much. It's so outlandish, it's practically unbelievable. They should have focused more on the story and told how he became Batman instead of waiting until the third movie to do that.
