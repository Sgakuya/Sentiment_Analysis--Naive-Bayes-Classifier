I don't believe that Trent Lott should lose his career over the recent statement he made on Strom Thurmond's birthday. He just wanted to make the old man happy on his birthday; I don't believe he wants segregation back and even if he did, there is no way he could bring that about. I think he is a pretty effective Republican caucus leader. This is no way for a man who has had a long and prosperous career to end it. He may have been supportive of segregation a long time ago, but so were a lot of politicians in the South at the time. That does not mean that he wants a return to those days. Unfortunately, Mr. Lott has been turned into a latter day Newt Gingrich; he won't be as effective anymore as Senate leader because others won't want to work with him. The Congress is a collegial body, people mostly argue on the basis of philosophy and not personality. Lott has inflamed plenty of people he will have to work with to get legislation passed. The initial reaction may be overhyped, but the long term implications of this may be that nothing gets done if Mr. Lott remains leader. I believe that he has received a bad deal on this, but if he becomes politically incapacitated, then by all means the Republicans should pick a new leader that will get things done.
