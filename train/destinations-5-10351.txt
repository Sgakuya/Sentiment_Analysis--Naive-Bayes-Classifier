Unfortunately these cigarettes cannot be purchased in the States, however I was travelling in Central Europe and managed to sneak 4 cartons home with me becuase they are ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL! I bought each carton for around $30 ($3 per pack) with the exchange rate, which is just about the same thing that I pay for Marlboro's in Illinois. The Davidoff's I bought were Gold (white and gold packaging) which is their version of lights, although my fiance prefers the darks (black with red and silver writing on the box). These are a FINE smokey-treat, very smooth flavor, body, and aroma. I would recommend Davidoff's to anyone who really considers themselves a smoker, and for those who are unwilling or unable to try these- you really have no idea what you're missing.
