I enjoy Mr. O'Reilly's show and found much of interest in his book. However I must take issue with his some of his views, particularly his apparent dislike of Protestants and Baptists in particular, by the way I'm a Methodist. He critisizes Baptists for attempting to convert Jews. Well Bill, I have news for you, they try to convert everyone including us Methodists, Catholics, Muslims, Wiccans, and if fence posts had souls they would try to convert them too! This is what they do and they don't do it in an offensive way. Unlike some denominations they have never burned so-called heretics at the stake or forcibly baptized anyone. As a general rule they are good people and should be respected as such.
