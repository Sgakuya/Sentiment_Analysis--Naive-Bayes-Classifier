being a lifelong Packer fan, let me be the first to say the rest of you bitter backers should grow up and move on. Look at your reasonings why hes a bad coach, he took another recessing team and turned them into Playoff Contenders. Don't forget about the Championship Ring he already has, the 2nd one he should have had, and the chance for another if Officials hadnt blown his last game as Packer head coach. This man doesn't perform based on which team hes coaching, he has a philosophy and its pretty apparent... West Coast Offense, Win at HOME, take chances when the game could be on the line... compared to your new favorite Shermans philosophy... Run Green, Screw the defense, Win when it falls in our laps, call just plain crappy plays(green bay needs to drop those weak screens) It was pretty nice that the scape goat last year was the D-coordinator(defense looks the same) and the year before it was Brett's thumb... we have a blame coach instead of a results coach. Holmgren made Green Bay the team it still has the potential to be.. and soley for that reason he's a 5... he's improving the Seahawks and making them Super Bowl bound... what did Lombardi do at Washington again? you don't say... and people still call him one of the greatest Coaches of all time.. brought us 5 championships in 8 years with how many teams in the league again? Holmgren should go down with Lombardi and Walsh status and the only way he wont is if uneducated bitter former fans of his style continue to shoot their mouths off. Holmgren, you're missed.
