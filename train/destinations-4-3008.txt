One of the most beautiful settings out of any city I've visited (granted I haven't been outside the continent) Stanley Park adjacent to the city is awesome...like Central Park on a bay with hills. The city center is vibrant and safe, and was filled with people at night. A true urban neighborhood. As for the nightlife, the bars were packed but there were lines EVERYWHERE. BC has a weird crowd control ordinance- it appeared that some people just wait in lines all night. Shopping isn't exactly world-class and the urban areas are actually a bit dirtier than I was expecting from a Canadian city (Portland is cleaner) but people are fun and friendly and very approachable. Would love to visit there again.
