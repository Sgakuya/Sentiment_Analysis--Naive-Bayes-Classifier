Seoul is an awesome city...as I've been here many times with my mother to visit relatives and go sightseeing. The air...yeah...it's freaking dirty. Breathing air in Seoul is equivalent to smoking cigarettes. Nevertheless, the experience of staying in Seoul is great. I remember during my childhood of always visiting Seoul from the US every summer. Whenever it was time to go back home, I'd always cry and have this "sad" feeling. Even when I got back home....I'd be dazed...still yearning to go back for some weird reason. I really want to live in Seoul...however...my Korean language skills isn't too fluent for me to have a job there. Well...I could teach English to Korean students....but like I"ve said...my Korean grammar isn't strong. It's the vibrant lifestyle and the layout of Seoul that makes me like that city. Plus the hot chicks....the homogeneity of the people....I just feel like a part of the Seoul "puzzle." Driving is crazy in Korea to be honest. People make their own "lanes"...as I once was on a three-land freeway...surprised to see the drivers turning it into a five-land freeway. I don't usually catch the bus...but the awesome subway system. I definitely will be going back to visit Seoul this summer!!
