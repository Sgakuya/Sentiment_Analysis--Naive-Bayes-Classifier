We've owned a 2003 LX since September of 2003. We opted for the 2.7 V6 since I owned a Tiburon with same and at 55K had no problems. We had only one issue, that being the check valve on the fuell filler tube going bad soon after we bought the truck. Other than that, for 28K miles it's been trouble free. I don't know where people get the idea that this vehicle with the 2.7 liter doesn't have enough power. It's not a race car but the only time it doesn't accelerate decently is when you start out on an incline and that's due to the tranny not kicking down enough. My wife loves her Santy and we've taken dozens of trips in it and loaded it down with kids, dogs and luggage to the roof and on it as well and have had a blast with it. MPG is usually 22, but drops to 18-19 on the above trips when she's loaded down. I highly recommend this SUV to anyone who isn't worried about impressing the neighbors. It's a bargain and it's fun to drive, too.
