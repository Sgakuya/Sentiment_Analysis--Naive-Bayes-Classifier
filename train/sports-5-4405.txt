How can anybody rate him less than a five? The man is a hall-of-famer. Just look at what he has done with his 04-05 team. This is a team that wasn't expected to fare well in the ACC or in the nation this year, thanks to an extremely short bench. Yet we are 7th (or 10th, depending on the poll) in the nation and at the moment, 3rd in the ACC. He teaches his kids not only about basketball but about life, and he builds relationships and friendships with his players and staff. Did anybody see Beyond the Glory--coach k? That man loves his team and loves his job with every ounce of his heart. And CREEPY? Yes, I find men who write personal $10,000 checks to military installments in Iraq creepy too...wait, no. He has not only invested a ridiculous amount of money in helping others, but his actions have proven that he really cares. After a loss he always credits the other team...he never pulls an it was our worst night of the year, it's always the other team fought hard and deserved to win. CLASS is what we call that. and by the way--give it up with the rat comments. it hasn't stopped him from winning, winning, winning.
