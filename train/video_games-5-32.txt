Then in 2002 it got even better. Working on the engine, gameplay, sound effects and knowing that people had better hardware these days they produced a fine specimen. Concentrating more on light saber battles the interaction was fantastic - no game ever gave me that much excitement in a battle situation - if you saw yoda in Attack of the Clones, well it's like that. The story is pretty smooth and stealth becomes more important than previously - one of the best additions to the armory is the sniper blaster where you can take out aliens way before you get to their vicinity. Oh, and finally you get to shag Jan!
