They are not brilliant, but as mega banks go, Wells Fargo is one of the better options. You have to take a little time to figure out how to avoid the fees (which are certainly NOT the worst in the banking biz), but other than that, they seem to do OK, most of the time. And I guess that's about all I can ask of a bank-- if my money is there, and I don't notice the bank, or screw-ups, I guess they're an OK place. There are a lot of locations where I live, and they own the ATMs at both groceries where I shop-- so no fees there. Any special needs I've had (wire transfers, foreign checks, lost ATM card) were handled without problems. The fact that they are nationwide has been helpful when I've been on the road.
