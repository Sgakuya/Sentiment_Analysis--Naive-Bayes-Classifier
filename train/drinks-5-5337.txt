I never had Yoo-Hoo until I was about 20. The first time I tried it I though it was somewhat nasty. It tasted like a Chocolate flavored non dairy creamer. But then a funny thing happened, I started to crave it. It is in the same category as White Castles, it may be a bit gross, but it has a certain taste that nothing else has. Nothing else tastes like Yoo-Hoo. (True Vess in St. Louis did, and still may, make a similar product that was excellent.) The thing is it does NOT taste like chocolate milk It has its own sweet chocolate taste. If you want C. milk buy it. Yoo-Hoo is surprisingly complex, with a variety of flavors, including a slight note of honey. It has its own sort of creaminess, that is rich, but highly drinkable. It is far more refreshing then chocolate milk, and I say that as a bona fide chocolate milk fanatic. Recently new flavors have come out as part of a campaign to make Yoo-Hoo hip. With the Sole exception of the fudge flavor, they are all lame Actually, they are an abomination,and an affront to all that is good and holy, like putting catsup on a NY strip steak. The fudge flavor is ok, So try a Yoo-Hoo, put away your snob factor, dont try and have it taste like something else. Just drink and enjoy it for its sweet chocolate goodness. Join the people who have been fans of its unique taste for decades. You friends may think you are weird,but you will know whats good.
