I've watched Redick lob threes for 4 years now and one thing is blatantly evident about his game; he is a shooter and that is where it begins and ends. 83% of his game is coming off of screens and shooting open threes. The other 17% of his game is shooting free throws. It is a horrible myth that the kid can score at will. He always underperforms against unc because they are one of the few teams that realize how to guard him; collapse on him after he comes off the pick. If he has a bad night from behind the arc he is useless. I actually hate watching his game because it is so unoriginal and flat. If you ever watch a Duke game, count how many of his shots come off of picks. What's worse, he doesn't even run the pick and roll that effectively. He is so concerned about taking his three that he often fails to feed the screen on an open cut to the basket. How many great shooters have come through college basketball only to sputter into mediocrity in the pros. Until this guy shows me he can score consistently without having to come off a screen or get an open layup, I am not convinced. He cannot create off the dribble, he cannot post up, and the most damning weakness is that he does nothing to make his teammates better. Duke basketball was exciting during the Wojo, Battier, and Jay Williams eras but now it is as unoriginal and uninspired as the fans that populate the stands. Since the return of Roy Williams over in Chapel Hill, I have found the Heels a far more interesting and novel team to watch other than my alma mater UConn - Go Huskies! This season will likely be rough but Williams has already coached that team to play with a level of intensity that makes their games fun to watch. Although I miss the play of Felton. He was one of the most exciting college players of the past decade including Jay Williams and my personal favorite Ben Gordon.
