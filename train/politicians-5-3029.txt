One of the best president's the US has ever had, but I am not a citizen of the US. Unlike Reagan, Clinton was alive and well to do his job. Unlike Bush sr. he knew how to communicate to the people he was there for. Unlike Bush jr. he knew how to make friends. Sure, he had his faults, he made a big mistake with Monica Lewinsky. But aren't mistakes concerning life or death something on a whole other level. Reagan had Iran- Contra, Bush jr. had Iraq, New Orleans. Compared to those three presidents I think Clinton is absolutely the best. He is intelligent, he can inspire and comfort people. He knows what he is talking about unlike Reagan during his presidency or Bush jr. They read aloud what advisors wrote. Clinton will be remembered for his affair that is his own fault. But I will remember more about him: the guy had charisma, the guy tried medicare for all people in the US and failed, the guy made speeches that inspired me, the guy actually loved people, and when the guy laughed I laughed with him. He tried, he failed, too bad.
