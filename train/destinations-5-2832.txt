i love philly! it may not be the best city in the world or have the nicest people, but where have you been where all the people are nice? there's always something goin on here. you can just chill on the block bussin it up. you can get good food at the corner store. if you're the partyin type, you can go out every night. and you don't have to be over 21 to like it here. there is always some excitement for all ages. for tourists, there's south street, penn's landing, center city, the olde city district. we got a lot of problems just like any other city but at least i think we're on our way up. oh and jim's has the best cheesesteaks, rita's is not real philly waterice. you gotta go to the hood for good pretzels and waterice.
