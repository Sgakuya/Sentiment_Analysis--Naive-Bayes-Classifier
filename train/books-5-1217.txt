There was lots of humor I could understand in Calvin and Hobbes when I was younger, and there are things I missed then that are funny to me now. Calvin's snowman masterpieces, Spaceman Spiff Stupendous Man episodes, wild wagon rides filled with philosophical pondering (something I can enjoy now that I couldn't understand when I was younger), picking on Susie, bugging his mom, giving his Dad the stats on how his fathership is going, writing school reports, doing science experiments with his cardboard box--- it's all so classic so amusing. And Hobbes was always there with him. I'll never grow tired of Calvin and Hobbes . Heck, Calvin has a better vocabulary than most people I know!
