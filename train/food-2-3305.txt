Hi! This is Lauren. Personnaly, I find the Kid cuisine meals pretty bad. But some are standable like the taco rollups and the pizza. Don't try the chicken! It's all soggy and wet! Its not even real chicken! I would not reccomend you feed this too much to your kids! Even though I grew up on it when I was younger like 5, I wish I hadn't! You pack in so much stored fat. I call these meals Heart attack by the age of 30. That's the truth. Tell your kids to go for the freshly prepared foods, vegtables, and fruits. You might as well stuff a bag full of sugar down your kids throat and then make them eat butter. That's what eating a Kid Cuisine is equivalent too. Trust me. Don't waste your money on disgusting junk. And.... don't be fooled by the innocent Kiddy colorful box with the duck on it! The food is not what it looks like!
