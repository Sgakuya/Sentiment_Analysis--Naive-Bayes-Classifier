I'm glad I saw Chicken Run, because it's unique and creative, but I just couldn't get into it. The digitally-enhanced claymation is interesting, but it gets old fast. I think Chicken Run would have made a great 5 or 10 minute short film, but it just doesn't cut it as a full-length motion picture. Let it be noted, however, that the audience in the theater didn't seem to agree with me. For some reason I couldn't fathom, they laughed at everything. Here's an example: at one point, a guy poured a bunch of food for the chickens, and one chicken yelled, Oh - my favorite - chicken feed! The audience laughed as if that was the funniest thing they'd ever heard. So if that type of humor sounds really amusing to you, go for it. But if you're looking for a real movie, go see other recent releases like Perfect Storm or The Patriot. And if you're thinking about seeing Chicken Run with kids, be warned that, despite the G rating, there are some scenes that might be scary to really small children (a chicken getting the axe, for instance).
