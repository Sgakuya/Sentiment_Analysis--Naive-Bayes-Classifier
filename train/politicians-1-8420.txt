UPDATE: I also do not feel anyone should have to go thru such a horrible disease as Alzheimer's...I wouldn't wish it on anyone. My sympathies are with the Reagan family and even Reagan's fans. (Especially Redoedo and Solenoid.) As with any president this country has had, I do try to show some respect regardless of how I view their policies and what not. ORIGINAL COMMENT: Over the years I have tried to find something good about this man, and it just seems like such an impossiblity. I have tried and tried. With all presidents of this great country, I have some respect just because they were a leader of this country. But overall, I just didn't care for Ronald Reagan or his antics. I was just a kid during his presidency, but I can remember so much. And almost all the stuff I can remember was not good. I thought it was a travesty that he didn't do anything to try and stop the Cold War with the Soviet Union. I would go home scared so many afternoons from school fearing a nuclear attack from the Soviets. My parents had to calm me down many times. He just was not a good role model for children. And don't even get me started on what he DIDN'T do for AIDS. He turned his back on the citizens of this great country when they needed him the most to stop this epidemic. He did little if nothing to help find programs to find a cure for this disease. As a leader of the greatest free country in the world, you should never have any biases or prejudices towards any group of people when it comes to color or sexual orientation. This country is too diverse for that, but that did not stop Ronald Reagan from turning his back on the gays. I don't think anyone who leads a country with such a diverse crowd of people should ever do that..or any leader for that matter, regardless of the populous...
