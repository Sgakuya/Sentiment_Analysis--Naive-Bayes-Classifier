Georgetown has got to have one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. Set high on a hill above the Potomac River, the campus combines Gothic looking stone buildings with modern buildings, with lots of grass, walkways, and lawns. The academics are top notch - especially in the Foreign Service and Government area, and the extracurriculars are good as well. As far as nighlife and restaurants, you have tons of options. There are about 200 bars and restaurants within walking distance. The housing situation is great as well, with lots of quaint looking DC style row houses made available to students. The campus has a large percentage of international students, which complements the cosmopolitan nature of DC very well. All in all, you can't go wrong with this school - my only complaint was the level of diversity of the non-international students - it seemed that everyone was from some prep school or another, and it got a little annoying.
