Released in 1971 and directed by Don Siegel, Dirty Harry essentially created the modern tough cop film genre. For the uninitiated, the story involves no-nonsense cop Dirty Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) who is working the mean streets of San Francisco. Callahan's personal law enforcement philosophy is based on the ends justifying the means, and he has little respect for legal niceties or reasonable force which does not make him a favorite among his more politically correct minded superiors. After apprehending the latest killer named Scorpio (Andrew Robinson), Callahan only finds that his suspect is released on technicalities resulting in Harry taking matters into his own hands. Notwithstanding that three other actors were offered this part (Frank Sinatra, John Wayne, and Paul Newman), this film is all Eastwood as he delivers one line after another (eg You've got to ask yourself a question: do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk) that are all now immortal. The bottom line is that there is nothing deep about this film, and that is just fine as not all movies need a message. Sometimes entertainment is valuable just for its own sake.
