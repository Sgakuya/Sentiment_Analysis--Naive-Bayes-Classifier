Nah, I was never feeling it as a kid. I was irriated most by the fact that there only seemed to be color on every other page. Why have color televisions replaced black and white ones? Why are the Sunday comics the best ones of the week? It's the color, damnit. When I read books at that young age, my reading came from the pictures. So, as a kid, when my satisfaction of a book centered around the pictures, Where the Wild Things Are just didn't do it for me. Also, those wild things just weren't too cute. If I was going to read about and look at the characters, they might as well have been attractive. Look at movie stars and pop singers. Same concept. This book is just one that adults love, and kids don't care too much for.
