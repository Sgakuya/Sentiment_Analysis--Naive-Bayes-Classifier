It has sort of revolutionized the way I shop. Before, I used to haunt out-of-the-way or obscure bookshops from Providence, Rhode Island, to NY, to the southernmost reaches of PA for that rare volume of literature. Now, all I have to do is go on-line, type in my password, hit enter, and the book, CD, or DVD is on its way. Sometimes I do miss the traveling I used to do and the combing through funky old bookshelves, but Amazon does save me gas money at the very least. The reader reviews can be enlightening or entertaining (I've written a couple myself) and the selection of items is pretty extensive. Some items are very overpriced, and there is occasionally a glitch in the service, but these are problems you can encounter anywhere.
