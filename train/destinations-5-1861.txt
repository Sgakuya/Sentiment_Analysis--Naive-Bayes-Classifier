I think most of these Travel, Food, & Culture comments have greatly missed the point of this rating page. This isn't supposed to be about whether you think the diabolical U.S. and all of its selfish, gun-toting inhabitants should be erased from the planet, or whether you think the U.S. is God's Gift To Freedom and that anyone who says otherwise must be jealous. (Incidentaly, I'm of neither persuasion.) This is supposed to be about how the U.S. rates in terms of travel destinations. Due to its varied climates, borrowed cultures, and burgeoning Service Economy (still under development), I think the U.S. is a prime candidate for tourism. You may think like the old saying, It's a great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. But that doesn't mean America doesn't have a lot to offer for the foreign visitor. (Or domestic tourist, for that matter.)
