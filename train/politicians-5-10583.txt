This is stupid. it is impossible to judge a president before he has finished his term in office. It is even more impossible to judge a president when he has only been president for some five months. People who posted on this page--your comments aren't about Bush's presidency but about your own personal like or dislike of Bush. That's another topic. To scatter your hatreds and loves around certain issues is rather foolish--eg: Bush has made it harder to get an abortion, therefore he's a bad president. That's stupid. Abe Lincoln would never have agreed with abortion, would have prevented you from getting one, and he saved the country. Save petty complaints for later. For now, to even it out, I will give Bush a little push in the right direction to balance the scales. It is only fair to unbalance them when he's stepped down from office.
