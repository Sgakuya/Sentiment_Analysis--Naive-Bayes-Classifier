very addictive. this set includes ff1 and ff2. ff1 is awesome. its cool how they fixed the graphics. i like to name each character after myself and a few friends. monk, warrior, thief and red mage can make a preety good team. its not easy using the mages in this game. so it might be a good idea to use 1 mage. monks don't start out very good but eventually they become the heart of the team. i highly recommend this game to everyone who likes rpg's. i used to hate ff2 but i eventually got to like it. eventually i got the hang of it and it got preety exciting. you don't gain levels in this 1 which is odd for a ff game.
