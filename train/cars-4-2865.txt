I bought a 2001 Audi A4 2.8 in October 2001. Looks-wise, it was one of the best cars on the road. Simply beautiful! But I was never a huge fan of the handling, and eventually, by about 20,000 miles, I started to have some problems with rattling in the dash and really bad brake squeaking. I took it in to the dealership MANY times, and each time was told there was nothing wrong with the car. I ended up trading it in last month for a brand new 2003 Audi A4 1.8. This car is also awesome looking, and I have not had any trouble as yet. Car drives great, but is very bumpy - not a smooth ride. Personally, I love the look of an Audi car so much that I am willing to put with any annoyances here and there. It looks better than a BMW(the Audi's main competitor), but the BMW is the more reliable car.
