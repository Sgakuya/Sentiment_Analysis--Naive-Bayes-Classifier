This team is great they have one of the best running games in the league [ thanks to Shaun Alexander] not to mention koren robinson is a pretty good wr and matt hasslebeck isn't to good but when he retires they'll get someone better they also have marcus trufant who is a great defensive catcher and John Randle who is retiring was a seven time pro bowler and has tons of sacks not to mention Darrel jackson another good wide reciever and seatlle got to the playoffs so they have to be good even if they lost to green Bay not to mention al the players are kind people and always are considerate their naot a holes like a lot of nfl teams
