On 2/7/05 I was shopping in Hecht's at my local shopping center. I found a bathroom rug and seat cover which I really liked because I am presently having my bathroom remodeled and these items were a perfect match. There was a sale sign above the items which stated everything was $9.99, a markdown from $20.00 per item. When I went to pay for the items, the amount rang up at the full price. I mentioned the sign, the clerk looked at the sign and agreed with me. She couldn't find the manager to ask about this but talked to a Hecht's employee walking past who was not able to assist but advised my clerk to ring the items up at the sale price. Instead, the clerk went back to look at the sign. She returned to the register and advised that the sales price was for items on a table on the other side of the sign, not for the items I wanted to purchase. I decided I did not want to purchase the items at full price so left the store. This signage was confusing; in fact, I believe, misleading, perhaps intentionally. Hecht's needs to change their signs to either being printed on only one side or putting the sign in an area where it will pertain to only the sales items. Although I have found many good bargains at Hecht's sales, I find this was misleading advertising and I left the store disappointed.
