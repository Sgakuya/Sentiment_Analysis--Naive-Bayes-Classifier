I have only been to one and so I'm sure that not all of them are this way and that not every employee is this way. I'm just rating my experience. I went in one of their stores by myself to look at diamond rings to see what they have, because I had something specific in mind but was looking around to see if I could find any other ideas to pass along. After about 30-60 minutes someone finally asked me if I had been helped. There were several employees standing around other areas of the store but as soon as I even thought about going up to them someone walked in and they were right there to help them. Every single time leaving me the only person in the store that hadn't been talked to...not even a simple "Hi" as they were getting something for someone else. A few of them made eye contact with me and when I tried to get someone's attention it failed...several times. They just kept ignoring me. I really wanted to leave but I ended up being in a little time crunch and figured that if I could at least see the few rings I wanted to I could inform my messangers to never go to that store again! The person that did finally end up helping me was super nice and I wasn't rude to them. They had been helping this one couple from before I got there so I totally understood their position.
