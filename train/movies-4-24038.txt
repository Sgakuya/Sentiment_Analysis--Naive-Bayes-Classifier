Excellent film. A brilliant piece of artwork, it had every bit the feel of a comic book (even down to the cheesy lines; yeah, the dialogue and acting was dry, but well, what do you want, it's based on a comic book, and from what I understand it's a very faithful representation of the comic). Based on Frank Miller's Sin City, it's a very violent, graphic world that revolves around corrupt city officials, cops and even clergy, the girls of Old Towne and three men, with three stories, who risk everything to protect the girls they care about. Excellent use of black and white imagery with just occasional dashes of color for emphasis, the scenery is excellent. Elijah Wood plays one incredibly demented and freaky bad guy (certainly a long way from being the little hobbit from the Shire). Warning: extreme graphic violence (they've got a thing with beheading, ahem, in many ways) and nudity. If you're seeking an uplifting story of human redemption, this ain't it. Not recommended for the faint-of-heart, but, it is an excellent piece of art, worth watching if you can stomach it.
