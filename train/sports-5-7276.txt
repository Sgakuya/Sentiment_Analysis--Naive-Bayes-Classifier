There has never been a player that was so great for so long, I mean he was still amazing at 42. Easily deserves his ranking amongst the top 3 or 4 players ever, a fine defensive player, and there were times it seemed like you'd be more likely to bench press a rhinoceros 50 times than have the sky hook fail,it was the single most foolproof of all unique shots. I think I saw the sky hook fail ONCE. A truly great part of some great teams in L.A., i regard The Lakers of the 80's as the greatest team ever, such depth with Kareem, Magic, and Worthy, and others too...and don't forget the fine early 70's Bucks teams either.
