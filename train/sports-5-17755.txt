ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? How can anyone justify the fact that the Seahawks are rated so low on this website??? They have one of the best quarterbacks in football, Matt Hasselbeck, and possibly one of the greatest halfbacks of all times in Shaun Alexander. Their coach Mike Holmgren is one of the greats and they have one of the best offensive lines ever, how do you think that Shaun Alexander did so well? Alexander happened to have the most rushing yards in football this year, and also just happened to break the record of most touchdowns in a season, and took home the MVP easily. Lets not forget other players on the team, such as Hutchinson, Jones, Tubbs, Wistrom, Sharper, Jurevicius, Engram, Morris, Wobeck, Jackson, Strong, Tatupu, Trufant, and Dyson you have a ridiculous team. Its disgraceful and disgusting that the Seahawks are rated so low, it speaks loads about this entire website and the people that rate on here, they are totally uninformed and ignorant. The Seahawks should at least be in the top 5 rated NFL teams on here, going 13-3 and making it to the Super Bowl, while having the MVP deserves a little more respect than this crap.
