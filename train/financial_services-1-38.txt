I agree with fred23. Some of these reviews seem to be from employees,perhaps even paid to hype. They certainly appear to be dishonest. US Bank has a terrible reputation for poor customer service and false guarantees. The complaints against US Bank are quite alarming and border on criminal. It is believed that the complaints and lawsuits against US Bank that are available on the Internet are only a small fraction of the problems that that US Bank has. I would not advise anyone to do business with US Bank. Visit the following site for information on US Bank: http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/usbank_complaints/links/
