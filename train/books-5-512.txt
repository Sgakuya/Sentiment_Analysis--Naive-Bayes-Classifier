This one is my favorite out of all of the Harry Potter 5 books so far out. Sirius excapes from jail and then comes to find Harry. Harry thinks that Sirius is after him to kill him. But later finds out that Sirius is his Godfather and is not trying to kill him, but trying to help him. Also in this book Harry, learns how to ward off dementors. I am kinda disappointed though that they killed off Sirius in the 5th book. He was one of the best characters. If one of the most important people in my life died, I would have felt the same way. I don't think that they should have killed Sirius in the 5th book. Oh well, I guess I can't do anything about it. Thank you J.K. Rowling for writing all these good books. This is my favorite out of the 5 that you have out.
