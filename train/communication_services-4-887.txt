After reading some of these reviews, I wonder if I have been bamboozled by STI, but so far everything is fine. I signed up for a new phone with them, love the new phone (LG 225) and the service so far. I like all the features that they offer and the fact that I didn't need to sign up for a 1 or 2 year contract just to get a new phone. After 3 months, if I don't like the service, I can just sign up with someone else. It looks like there have been quite a few comments about the customer service and I have to say that I feel that I am pretty culturally open (I have traveled extensively), but I did have some problems with the customer service in understanding what they were saying sometimes. More importantly, every time I have called, the representative seemed grumpy, like they really don't like their jobs/company and could care less that you are a customer. I live on the west coast and the coverage is through the sprint network which is very weak out here. Looking at the map of coverage it looks like this is not the case out east. Still, it is good enough because it covers the large cities and major corridors. I am waiting for the hidden fees that some people have referred to and am hoping that they do not materialize. So far I have liked the phone and should save around $20 every month over my last plan and I have a new phone which is nice. I have rated this service fairly high because I haven't had any problems and for the savings I can put up with grumpy representatives and less than perfect coverage. Pro: No contract, new phone, no monthly fee, many features Con: Not the best coverage on the West Coast, grumpy help desk
