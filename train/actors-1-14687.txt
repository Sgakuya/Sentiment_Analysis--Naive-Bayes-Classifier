She's the stuff tabloids are made of. Jlo is such a spectacle and to think that such a mediocre Latina is 'representing' us is utterly embarrasing. There are other Latinas who are hotter and more talented than this hoochie with ass for brains. Jho, your movies stink, your music stinks, your clothes look cheap and your perfumes stink. The only person who thinks your the best thing around is you. Men only see you for your ass and that's the only reason why you're still around. I wonder how many Hollywood producers has she had to screw to stay on top? Or better yet, how many taps until they get to the center of that Tootsie Roll?
