I'm glad this country is a republic and on its way to becoming a developed nation. I have been to Yemen and I have never heard anyone talk negatively of America, it was the complete opposite, they knew America is the best place to live in. The deception in the media has lead many people to believe that every country in the Middle East supports terrorism, which was not the case in Yemen. The Yemeni President, in my opinion has done more to promote democracy than any other president in that country's history. He united both North and South Yemen to become one nation. He established a representative government and a democratic system of voting. Women are allowed to vote. I'm proud that the government is not dictatorship.
