Len Bias was simply the best college basketball player I have ever seen. I am 34 years old and have been watching college basketball since I was 6 and NO ONE was better in my lifetime. MJ was amazing, but he HAD a supporting cast of All americans and eventual all pro's and Hall of famers; Bias had none of that. He willed his teams to be very good and he did it pretty much all by himself. It is too difficult to predict what he would have been like as a pro--but ALL the signs sure pointed to super stardom,especially after watching MJ achieve what he did. People may think I am crazy, but I would have taken Bias over MJ all day long back in 86. He was the most special basketball talent I have ever seen.
