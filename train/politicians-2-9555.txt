Though he took office at a terrible time, Jimmy Carter did not help matters much. Carter seemed to think he was smarter and more knowledgeable than all of his advisors which resulted in a failure to properly delegate authority and a bottlenecked decision making process. (In this aspect, Carter was a preview of what a Gore Administration would have been.) His sole material success was the Camp David Accords, which was certainly no small feat. The treaty ended the war between Israel and Egypt in exchange for Egyptian recognition of Israel's political existence. Egypt being Egypt, this had a profound effect in the Arab and Islamic World; nevertheless, notwithstanding this notable achievement, Carter's failures are glaring. His boycott of the Moscow Olympic Games in 1980 was no more than a nominal act, resulting in a retaliatory boycott of the Los Angeles Games in 1984 and an erosion of the very concept of global cooperation at some level. Furthermore, he had no clue as to how to handle the Iranian Hostage Crisis, setting back the American global position of strength, resulting in an overly complex and doomed hostage rescue mission that only served to emphasis this appearance of being impotent and incompetent (though Carter had no other viable choice but to listen to his advisors regarding the details of the mission). Furthermore, Carter failed to get a handle on the inflationary pressures that were plaguing the economy. The bottom line is that Carter exacerbated an already bad situation, resulting in a demand for new patriotism that swept in the Reagan Era.
