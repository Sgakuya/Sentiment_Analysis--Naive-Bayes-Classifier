Vancouver, along with Seattle, is one of my 2 favorite cities. It's never too warm or too cold. There are plenty of skyscrapers and buildings for you city goers, but theres also lots of parks for the nature lovers. You're right on the water, which is always good. Also, you are in the mountains at the same time. You can swim and hike in the same day! Or ski. Whistler mountain, the best ski resort in north america, is in Vancouver. There is also a great marina and a horbor perfect for sailing. And, to top it off, Vancouver has the widest selection of food and cuisine anywhere. So, no matter what you are into, i guarentee you will be into Vancouver!
