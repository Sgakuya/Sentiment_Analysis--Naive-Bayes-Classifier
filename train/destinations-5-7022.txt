The ideal tourist city. Public transportation is a breeze in this city, between the tube (mind the gap), the plentiful, comfortable cabs, and the red double-decker buses. It seems that everywhere you go there is something interesting to see - from art galleries, to ancient buildings, to the theater district - and the city is extremely safe and tourist friendly. Arguably the capital of the world, you will hear every imaginable language as you walk around this city. While the local cuisine gets a bad rap, I was perfectly happy with the pub food, and found there to be a tremendous variety of ethnic restaurants - I thought the Greek and Indian restaurants were especially good. The nighlife is worldclass as well - have a couple pints of bodington's in the local pub, and head for the clubs around ten. Londonders are extremely trendy, and definitely cast off an aura of urban hip. It doesn't hurt that most people speak English either...
