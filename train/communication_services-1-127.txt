MCI is the worst long distance provider. I would rather use two cans and a string than give them any business. Let me run through the littany of problems I have had with them. First month after changing my service with them, rate was wrong and it wasn't being charged to my AMEX card (like it had been previously). Second month, exact same problem. Third month, I got an automated phone call saying that I needed to call them about something with respect to my account. The guy didn't repeat the number, so I called the main number. I was on hold for 15 minutes, then was transferred to another group and got disconnected. I called back, got right through to an customer disservice rep who barely spoke English. Tried to speak to a supervisor and remedial English guy transferred me to a number where there was a recording. Anyone know a good long distance company? Now, two months after first writing this, my account still hasn't been cleared up. They say I owe money when I don't, and two credits that they have issued have been blown out by their computers. Their reps don't read notes in the files and a supervisor has hung up on me because I was being sarcastic. Now that I'm moving maybe I'll be ride of them forever.
