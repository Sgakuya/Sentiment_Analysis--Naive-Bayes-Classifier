charming movie. A 13 year old girl who wants to get in with the popular girls wishes she could be 30. on her birhtday her friend Matt gives her a homemade dollhouse and some magic wishing dust. when she wakes up she is 30. and haves no memory of the last 17 years.she finds out she did end up with those snotty popular girls and acts just like them. she slowly finds out that she did not turn out to be such a nice person herself. she hurt her true friend Matt{she found him as an adult}when they were still kids. she regrets the life she learns she has led and wishes she could have another chance to go back at 13 and start over. won't tell the ending but pretty predictable. Jennifer Garner was good as the girl and convincing as a 13 year old in a 30 year olds body. Likable movie.
