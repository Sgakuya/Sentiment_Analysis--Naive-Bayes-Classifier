Christian Bale is The Best Actor Alive. His limitless range is obvious after you've watched all his films. His performance in Empire of the Sun was simply amazing. Unlike some other actors who only play themselves in different situations, Bale disappears into his characters, like a shape-shifter, he molds himself into a complete new person with distinguished body language, voice, accent and appearance. He transforms himself both physically and mentally and manages to come back to start anew. Just watch him in American Psycho and The Machinist. His performances in both of these films are unforgetable and incredible, worthy of an Oscar nomination. American Psycho is not just a film but a piece of art, not everyone's cup of tea but those who appriciate it know what I mean. Same thing with The Machinist, he literally becomes Trevor Reznik. Each and every time he performs he proves that he has mastered his craft. He is totally believable as Bobby in All the Little Animals. He's so natural and so moving as Laurie in Little Women. He surprises you as Arthur in Velvet Goldmine and mesmerizes you as John Preston in Equilibrium. He always serves the character and not himself with an incredible range and depth. No matter what film he's in, He gives his best performance. This brilliant actor has also performed in Newsies, Swing Kids ,Metroland,Reign of Fire, laurel Canyon and many more. And last but not least he gave us the best Batman ever in Batman Begins. A great movie and a brilliant performance. His upcoming films are The New world, Harsh Times, Rescue Dawn and Prestige.
