I don't agree with Senator McCain on some issues, namely his ideas on campaign finance reform, which at best is an incumbency protection plan and at worst is a violation of the 1st Amendment Right to Free Speech, a candidates ability to advertise on TV is restricted with McCain's legislation. I don't agree with him on foreign policy, which echos by and large George W. Bush. I don't know however if he would have gone to war had he been President, he may have made a different judgement. I salute McCain for at least showing independent judgement as opposed to the rest of the GOP leadership, which is going down the path of big government, high deficits, a larger debt burden, and increased protectionism. I like his economically and even culturally libertarian views on things. The GOP should have nominated him in 2000. They wouldn't have had to resort to counting chads in Florida because he would have beaten Gore by a significant margin. He also has a great personal story, the guy has guts and I respect that.
