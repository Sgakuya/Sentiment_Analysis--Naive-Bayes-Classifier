You could come up with a list of negatives for any president. It's not all his fault - he came into office when the economy was beginning to faulter and when terrorism was once again on the rise. We did capture Saddam. And at least he's taking a pro-active stance on terrorism instead of sitting idly back and waiting for another version of Sept 11th. Some people forget, we live in a democracy and we elected this man as president. Like him or not, he is our current leader and we must support his decisions while he is in office - he has run our country the best he could. You people out there who are not supporting our government and president are part of the problem. If you disagree with Bush then vote for someone else next time.
