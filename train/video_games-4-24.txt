Thief was an exciting entry into a new genre Stealth em Up so the second installment had a lot to live up to. Thank god Eidos had the sense to listen to their customers and take some of those boogie men out, it's the ones they left in that annoyed me but I certainly hadn't played such a dark, lonely and tripped out game as this before. They made the levels huge and it was great to revisit the medieval castles gaurded by the dopy, hungry, moaning soldiers. As much as I loved playing this game I can't help thinking that there could be more to it - especially with todays technology, great news then that they have, after all, decided to give us a third installent end of November 2003!
