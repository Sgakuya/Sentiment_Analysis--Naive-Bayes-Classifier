In reference to all the negative comments made about Cornell, especially by those who aren't students here, I would like to say that Cornell is awesome. Not only is it fantastic, but there is so much potential for every student here. We have an awesome law school, a great medical school, and the best Vet school in the world. Not to mention, great athletics, student organizations, and one of the largest Greek systems in the country. Don't listen to all the negative responses made by people on this poll. They're just trying to make Cornell look bad. I'm a freshman at Cornell and the only suicides I've been here for were made by people who AREN'T CORNELL STUDENTS!!!! Yes, that's correct, there hasn't been a single suicide by a Cornell student since I've been here, so all these people who have so ignorantly commented on Cornell....that just shows their low level of intelligence. Good job all of you. I really hope you aren't Harvard students because that would truly be an embarrassment to the Ivy League. I hope all of you are just spiteful toward Cornell for your own reason. Have a nice day! Let's Go Big Red!!!!!
