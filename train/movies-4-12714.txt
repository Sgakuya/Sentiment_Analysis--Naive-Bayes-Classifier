A powerful film, and a useful corrective to the bombastic garbage heard all the time from the other side (for instance, that nauseating Rush Limbaugh show). This is a documentary which makes as its primary theme how America is ruled by FEAR, and how this is useful and profitable to those in charge. Moore is often accused of only showing one side --and not only is this his right, but this accusation is about as sensible as accusing Jesus of not also representing the Devil's point of view. I am amused more than anything else by the venomous hatred of right-wing commentators--strong evidence that Moore MUST have scored with this one.
