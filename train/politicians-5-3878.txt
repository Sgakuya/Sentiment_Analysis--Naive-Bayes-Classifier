Telling the truth and not lying every other time he speeks thats Bush .Every time Al Gore opens his mouth he cant help but lie! Dem's pick at Bush for his fumble of words and thinks it's funny but can't recognize a liar of there own party. The constitution is being Abused by Al the inventor .If he lies every time we see him on t.v what makes people think he won't lie as the president. I was raised that a lie is a lie big or small it still cant be change it's still a lie.Are the Supporters of Gore willing to say that its okay to lie even if it destroy's the United States?What's your freedom worth to you ?We need a President that is going to be honest and uphold the truth and the constitution of the USA. Respect the men and women of this country that have died to keep it free by fighting the wars from the begining of the United state to now.Wake up America are we going to vote for a man that may send our Men and Women some where to fight for our country and after we get there find out that it was a lie or really diden't need to be there. We may not all agree on every issue but woulen't it be better to be honest than an Al Gore liar. Think America and on November 7th Vote Bush!!!!!
