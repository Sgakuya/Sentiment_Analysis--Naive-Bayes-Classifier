All I have to say is NATIONAL CHAMPIONS!!! and that's it... Posted 3/14--Carolina has the potential to take it all this year... they have worked for everything they have gotten this year and deserve the #1 seed they got. Its going to be amazing if we see them cutting down the nets in St. Louis. I have been a Carolina fan my entire life and I loved Dean and was even fond of Matt Dohrety (Dukeblue4eva:are you on crack? did you really say that Dean Smith doesn't have any brains? meaning he doesn't know how to coach? i'm pretty sure you need to take a step back and re-evaluate) I really think Roy could finally get his championship this year... GO HEELS!!
