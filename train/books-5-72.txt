To my recollection, the best biography I have ever read, not just the story, but the telling of it. From page one it is obviously something special, and it never lets up. However, unlike the other rater (who turned me on to the book, thank you), I found it hopeful more than painful to read, and that's the amazing thing, since the author went through the trials severe as Job. The author was a young Jewish American full of swagger in Detroit when he followed his hero socialist father to Russia to work for the Ford Motor Co, after which he excelled in all things physical, even being dubbed "the Lindbergh of Russia." But then his Kafkaesque nightmare began and he was imprisoned (Stalin era), tortured, starving in Siberia, and yet...he clung tenaciously to optimism and hope, and he fell in love. His love for his parents, siblings, America, and his wonderful Galina are richly conveyed throughout. This book is recommended for men and women, young and old. Apparently (googled), there is a "Christian version" of the book and Herman received Jesus as his Messiah at an old age, but I haven't seen that one.
