Where to begin? Well, the Atlanta area has something for everyone: museums, historical homes, themeparks, shopping, good restaurants, and the like. The outlying areas have all kinds of historical sites, especially if you're a Civil War buff. And there's the quiet country of South Georgia, which is actually a pretty good place to kick back and relax. The cost of living is pretty low even around most of the Atlanta area, so you can enjoy living here on a budget. The downside includes horrendous traffic around Atlanta, sweltering heat/humidity, and what some perceive to be a lack of culture/education/etc. on the part of some of its citizenry. Overall a very nice place to visit, work, and live.
