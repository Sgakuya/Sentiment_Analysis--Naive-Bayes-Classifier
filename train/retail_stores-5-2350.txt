The fact that they don't take debit cards did irritate me at first, but I've never had a problem writing a check there. Some of the Winco stores do take Debit cards, and as far as welfare cards, I don't know of any grocery stores that don't take them. The banks take a chunk of change out of every debit card transaction. Why pad the wallets of wealthy bankers when we can get a better price for food without their fees. The bottom line is, I work hard for my money. When someone offers me more goods for the buck for the same brand names, that makes them my favorite store. I can put up with a rude clerk now and then. Its ruder to charge me outrageously high prices. Winco is one of the last great American grocery chains. At least they dont have to import all of their food from China to offer a good price.
