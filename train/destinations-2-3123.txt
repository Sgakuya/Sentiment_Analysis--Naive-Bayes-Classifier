Toronto is not the city it used to be. Having lived here 36 out of my 37 years I have seen a drastic decline in the standard of living. What was once a very good city is quickly becoming a joke. I'm not sure when it all went wrong but it sure happened in a hurry. What used to be a friendly, clean, somewhat affordable city is now a dirty, ignorant, and extremely expensive place to live. The once proud health care system is in shambles. And the actual care you receive is average at best. Multiculturism is a complete failure in my opinion. Not all, but many newcommers to Toronto couldn't care less about this city, and are looking for a free ride on the taxpayers back. Alot of these people refuse to adapt to our standards and instead continue to be ignorant, pushy, and just plain annoying. So in closing, if you are for some crazy reason planning to come to Toronto for a visit or for good, don't bother it's so not what you think it is. But if you must, one word of advice. Keep your head down, don't smile or say hi to anyone you don't know and by all means stay away for the housing projects if you value your life.
