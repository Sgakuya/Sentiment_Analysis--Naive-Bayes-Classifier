That he is currently 61st on this list is utterly baffling, as his ratio of great performances to the number of films he's appeared in is staggering. Brilliant in virtually every film he's appeared in, and is one of those actors who can make an ok film seem like a great one. Take "Gangs of New York": each time I see it it gets worse. DiCaprio and Diaz were simply miscast, almost to the point of being totally absurd. Jim Broadbent was very good as Boss Tweed, but Day-Lewis made that film, his portrayal of a Know-Nothing type, a crude, violent, boorish, but sometimes amusing butcher/gangster, based on apparently a real 1850's gangster named "Bill the Butcher"( there are a fair amount of historical inaccuracies in the flick) made you feel simultaneously sympathetic and mortified by this thug who could not accept the sweeping social changes of the Civil War era. He made a good, but flawed film seem like a great one with his riveting performance. He was also particularly brilliant in "In the Name of the Father" as a young Belfast kid framed by the British, and many other roles. A superb actor.
