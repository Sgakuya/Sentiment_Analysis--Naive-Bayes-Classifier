I'll tell you why I have such a big problem with Wal Mart. #1)They give the impression that they always have the lowest price; not true. Mant times you can go to any of the discount retailers and finds comparable prices. #2)They give you the impression that they only sell good old american-made products, A big fat lie!. With the exception of the major brands, a lot of their stuff is just foreign junk, not much better than a dollar store. #3)They never have enough cashiers working. They'll have four cash registers open on a Saturday afternoon with ten customers in each line. Come on, now! #4)The way they undercut local merchants to drive them out of business and then jack up the prices after the competition is gone. #5)Last but not least; what's with those employees? I've seen more normal people at carnival freak shows. Is this some kind of secret policy at wal-mart? I gave them a two only because their shelves aren't often empty, unlike Kmart where they never have anything you want.
