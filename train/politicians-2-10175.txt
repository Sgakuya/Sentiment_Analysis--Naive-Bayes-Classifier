There are many things that Bush has done that I agree with but even more that I do not. First of all, anyone who hates the President simply for going to war needs to reevaluate what is truly important. Even though there were no WMDs as Bush expected that should not be blamed on him. He was not the one collecting intelligence. Even if he did know that there were no WMDs Hussein was a brutal dictator. As the strongest world power the US has an obligation to help defend human rights when possible. I just wish that there would be more help in countries like Sudan. After the war is an entirely different thing. He should have had a plan for post war Iraq. When coupled with a poor domestic policy that includes deregulation of the EPA and a terrible economy he is a poor President.
