Once again, we are examining Mel Gibson's acting skills, NOT his political leanings. It's amazing that those on the left complain that Martin Sheen and Susan Sarandon are constantly badmouthed because of their political views, and then in the next breath they can attack Gibson, completely ignoring his obvious acting skills. With over forty films to his credit, Mel Gibson can be considered one of the greatest actors of our time. A look at his resume will show that the man can play any role in any type of film, whether it be action, drama or comedy. Gibson was the perfect selection for the dangerous, short-fused, somewhat eccentric cop, Martin Riggs, in the Lethal Weapon films. The role seemed to come so naturally to Gibson- I honestly can't imagine any other actor playing that role. Gibson also have a very moving performance in both The Man Without A Face and Forever Young. His performance was quite believable in both films, and it was quite moving watching him bond with young Nick Stahl in The Man Without A Face and Elijah Wood in Forever Young. Gibson must be commended for The Man Without A Face, as he directed the film and managed to pull of a fantastic performance. Equally riveting was his performance as William Wallace in Braveheart. The film itself may have lacked historical accuracy, but it was wonderfully written, acted and directed. Gibson was also good in a similar role in another historical drama The Patriot. Gibson is quite charming in romantic comedies as well (What Women Want). The role in that film seemed to come so naturally to him. So, in the final analysis, Mel Gibson has had a colorful career in Hollywood, and the best is yet to come. He takes his work very seriously (both acting and directing), and as a result, Gibson is considered, and rightfully so, to be one of the greatest actors of our time.
