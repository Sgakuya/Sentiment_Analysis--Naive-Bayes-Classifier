Just like how George Bush has turned America from the laughingstock of the world to the most despised nation on the globe, John Howard has changed Australia forever. Gone is the lucky country the friendly country and the fair country. Enter the deputy sheriff, the redneck wonderland and politics built on lies. John Howard will be remembered for his foolish support for the Iraq war, for looking up children behind razor wires and for refusing to sign the Kyoto treaty. The only positive impact John Howard has had on Australia (or the world) during the last decade is that he has reviled the true nature of conservatisms just how filled with filth, nastiness and hatred it is.
