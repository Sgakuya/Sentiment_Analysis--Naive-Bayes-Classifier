What an honorable man. He is the exact opposite of Bill Clinton, who is basically evil with a tie on. Anybody that thinks that Republican African Americans are evil, really have no idea what they are talking about. They know really what there people need. African Americans need vouchers, not a handout. Alan Keyes knows that. He also knows that not only do African Americans need moral values, but that EVERYBODY needs moral values. I know that if he was our president, he would go down as one of the greatest presidents ever. But unfortuneatly, he has developed an Uncle Tom look from some racist liberals. The New York Times, Washington Post, and other newspapers have called Mr. Keyes, Clarence Thomas, and J.C. Watts Uncle Tom's, just because they are conservative. Now that is racism if I ever heard it before, far overshadowing any remark every made by Trent Lott. If anybody were like me, they could see the value that electing a man of great moral, honesty, and people would finally realize than we make mistakes.
