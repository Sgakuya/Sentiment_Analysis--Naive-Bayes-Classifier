THERE IS MORE TO NEW YORK THAN NEW YORK CITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All parts included, it is by far the greatest state in the union! The scenary of rural upstate new york is awsome, especaily in fall. All of the cities, including NYC and in Upstate new york, are full of history, interesting neighborhoods, and yes, contrary to the stereotypes that so many people like to put on us, really nice people. NYC has actually changed for the better since 9/11, and for a city of over 8 million people, it has an incredible sense of community. The cities of upstate new york are where america began after colonial days, and are all, by far, the friendliest cities in america. It is the most diverse of all states and it truly is the symbol of america. I LOVE NEW YORK, AND NOT JUST NYC!
