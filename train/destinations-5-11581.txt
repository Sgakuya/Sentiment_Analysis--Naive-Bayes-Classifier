Ungodly Hot!! BUt the heat just means more girls in short Bikinis. Problem is, with the London Bridge nearby, this place draws alot of family tourists as well. I own a timeshare near the bridge, and the place is always crowded on the week-ends. Still it is a nice place to visit. And it is centerally located in the middle of the TRi-State dsesert region, allowing easy access to the hot bed of world class entertainment, Needles, California! If Las Vegas is too muh for you, it is just a sort drive to Laughlin, a Mini-Vegas with twice the heat! And if that is too much excitement for you, you might try Parker, Arizona, home of not one, but TWO Indian Casinos!! And the Parker Dam. And you want to share your lunch with a Donkey, don't invite MikeHolly over, just go to OATMAN, AZ, where the donkeys run wild in the streets and in the overpriced, cheap souvenier shops! That about covers your entertainment options in this desert area. HAve Fun. And, remember to wear plenty of sunscreen.
