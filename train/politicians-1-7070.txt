this isn't a rating towards Rev. JAckson, but to panthersly, the person who commented on the matter. Just like everyone else who says that they dont condone sin, but whine and cry for your leader who has sinned. Realize the fact that Jesse Jackson has sinned. He is an idol to young african american children and represents them and their community. Such a responsibility requires a person who is almost perfect. You don't be the weak minded one and put yourself in a different perspective of the matter. No matter how you look at it, you will find that the deed is still wrong, regardless of the fact that we all sin or he is Jesse Jackson.
