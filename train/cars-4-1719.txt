This car came as something of a surprise to me. I was fully prepared to dislike it based upon my experience with other Ford products, but this car is clearly a departure for them - almost as if they had someone else build it. I just finished extensive car shopping with my kid sister, and she ended up with a Focus ZX3 hatchback. Styling is unique, and surely not to everyone's taste, but at least it doesn't look like everything else on the road. Surprising amount of interior space, and almost functions like a small wagon with the rear seats folded down. Powerful engine, great handling, excellent quality interior trim. Essentially a lot of car for the money - a great combination of sporting fun and practicality.
