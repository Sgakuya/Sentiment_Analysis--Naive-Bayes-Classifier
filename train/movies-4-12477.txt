I just took my granddaughter and youngest son(13 yrs) to see this movie, the granddaughter was bored and wanted to sleep, in spite of the fact she already had her nap. My son did not like it too much, but I thought it was a pretty good remake. Depp's character was a lot more detailed than Wilder's and as for making a mockery of fat kids, no that wasn't the point. Actually up until around the 80s or so, all kids were treated poorly *to be seen and not heard* so the way the kids were treated by Willy Wonka was realistic of that era. Not to mention he was emotionally disturbed (obviously) and did not like any person, adult and child alike. I am glad this remake was made, it really did give you an insight as to Wonka's mind, where as the other did not.
