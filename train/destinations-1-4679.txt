I would give this place zero stars if I could. I live about 100 miles from St. Louis and I can tell you one thing about it: It is a DUMP. It is the most depressing, scary, dangerous place in the United States and I have been to a lot of places on both coasts and in between. Even thinking about this town gives me goose bumps! And all the other reviewers who gave this place a bad rating, believe EVERY word they said because it is ALL true. Do not visit or even drive through this god forsaken hell hole. If you absolutely must come here I will be praying for you. And it would not hurt to make arrangements beforehand with an undertaker in case you don't make it out alive.
