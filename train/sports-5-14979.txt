Herschel Walker is statistically proven to be one of the top players in NFL, college, and professional history. Herschel's 25,283 all-purpose yards (rushing, receiving, and returns) are THE MOST EVER by any player including more yards than Jerry Rice, Emmitt Smith, Walter Payton, etc. Since 1985, Herschel holds the distinction of having the most rushing yards in a professional season (18 games, 2411 yards) He was also involved in the largest one-sided trade in NFL history. Herschel is still a TOP 10 LEADER (#7) in the NFL with 18,168 all-purpose yards, and played on four different NFL teams (Cowboys, Vikings, Eagles, Giants). Shared same NFL backfield with two other Dallas Cowboys' greats: Tony Dorsett (86-87) and Emmitt Smith (96-97) blocking many times for both. Tony Dorsett demanded a trade when Tom Landry recognized Herschel's superiority and made him Tony's heir apparent. Herschel retired early at 36-years-old considering the fact that he had undiminished talent and was injury free. Herschel is quoted as mentioning a possible comeback like Foreman, though it may have been in jest. He is currently a successful business man, husband, and father. http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/WalkHe00.htm Herschel scored more than 82 NFL touchdowns, and is ranked among the NFL's All-Time Top 50: Rushes: 24, Rushing yards: 24, Rushing TDs: 29t, Yards from scrimmage: 25, Rush/Receive TDs: 38t, THERE MAY BE SOME BIAS BY THE COLLEGE AND NFL ELITE AS HERSCHEL WAS THE FIRST COLLEGE PLAYER TO LEAVE SCHOOL EARLY -- HE PLAYED HIS FIRST THREE (3) PROFESSIONAL YEARS IN THE USFL (7115 ALL-PURPOSE YARDS) AND DOMINATED THAT LEAGUE. MANY GREAT PLAYERS (Reggie White, Jim Kelly, Anthony Carter, Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, etc.) INCLUDING HERSCHEL STARTED IN THE USFL AND WERE LATER NFL ALL-PRO SELECTIONS. THOUGH THE NFL DOES NOT INCLUDE THEIR PREVIOUS PROFESSIONAL STATS INTO THEIR NFL TALLIES. HERSCHEL WAS A THREAT TO SCORE EVERYTIME HE TOUCHED THE BALL AND HIS 82 NFL RUSHING & RECEIVING TOUCHDOWNS IS TESTIMONY TO THIS FACT. HE ALSO HAS SOME NFL TOUCHDOWNS ON KICKOFF RETURNS. HERSCHEL IS FAMOUS FOR BEING THE ONLY PLAYER IN NFL HISTORY TO HAVE THREE (3) PLAYS OF 90+ YARDS IN A SINGLE SEASON (RUSH, RECEPTION, AND RETURN). HERSCHEL WALKER WAS INDUCTED INTO THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL-OF-FAME. HERSCHEL SHOULD ALSO BE SELECTED FOR THE NFL HALL-OF-FAME IN CANTON, OHIO. PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTE FOR HERSCHEL WALKER.
