This was my favorite team when I was a teenager, back in the Don Meredith days. In fact, they were the only team I liked. But a lot has happened since then - Tony Dorsett, Hollywood Henderson, Emmitt Smith, Barry Switzer, Jimmy Johnson have all been annoying people And as I moved across the country, I kept meeting their pushy & obnoxious fans. No decent person can feel good about the way Tom Landry was given the slip either. I've been told that they're the team that started the tradition of falling on the ball to run out the clock (which I don't think should be allowed)...and of having a quarterback take electronic signals from the sidelines. I also think they started the practice of having floozy cheerleaders. With all the good & exciting teams out there, I don't want to waste my time watching Dallas anymore.
