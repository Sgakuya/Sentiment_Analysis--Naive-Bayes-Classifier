The United States has an equal obligation to remove Castro from power, equal to their obligation to remove Saddam. Castro is a brutal dictator and his crimes have far outweighed Batista's for decades. So, why then is this country going after Saddam? Why not Castro? It's all about the oil, right? Wrong. Castro is impotent compared to Saddam. The US has major military installations ON THE ISLAND OF CUBA. Castro's every move is monitored very closely, and he does not pose the same threat as Saddam's Iraq does. Castro will die soon; when that happens, I firmly believe that this country will assist Cuba in developing representative government.
