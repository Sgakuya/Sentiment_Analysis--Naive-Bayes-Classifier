This is my personal favorite.It is absolutely beautiful and extremely easy to navigate and get around in. It doesn't have to have the biggest and tallest roller coaster in the world to be the best in my book. It might not have the tallest roller coaster but it has alot more of them and they are all extremly fun and fast and that's all I really care about. I'd rather have numerous 300 ft.tall roller coasters to ride and ride and ride and ride than to have a 301 ft.tall roller coaster to wait and wait and wait and wait to ride ! And,because there are collectively,so many more roller coasters and many more rides for everyone to use and choose from,I don't have to stand and wait anywhere from 3 to 5 hours in the hot Florida sun,just to get on and ride one time like I do at that one down in Orlando !
