Oh yeah, I forgot about this place. Now I am feeling bitter about amusement parks since this is the one place where I have not really had much fun. And to top it off, I went here twice - the second time just to give it a second chance to see if the first misadventure there was maybe a fluke. Hot - it was so hot there and the lines are so long. Now I know that amusement parks have a reputation of attracting a lot of 'white trash' and that is fine, it is actually one of the amusing things about going to these parks. But the crowd here was so bad and there was no value in the people-watching. Each time I went, there were a couple of the big rides that were closed.. Just not a good experience at all .
