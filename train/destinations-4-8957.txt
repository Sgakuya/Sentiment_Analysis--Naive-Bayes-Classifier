I foung this by accident. I was getting bored with Skoal i went through 2 sleeves of peach in just over a week. about a tin and a pinch a day (normally i get about 6-8 lips a tin) and as good as it tasted i needed a change. I saw husky wintergreen out of the corner of my eye and said id get a tin of that. 4.15 a hell of a lot cheaper than skoal at the place i buy it 8.70 a tin unless i buy sleeves then its 7.50 a tin. yes...expensive...but i wont buy anywhere else because i love the people that own the store. upon opening the tin it was a good wintergreen smell...like gum..wolf and a few other wintergreens smell like windex when u open the tin. it breaks up a little during the pack and breaks up a bit mid spit. cuts your gums good...first buzz ive got in almost 6 monthsgives a good amount of spit...but not too much that if your talking to someone your covering them in sweet tobacco juice. plus...the lid is bad ass...huskys kick ass. Husky gets a 4 because of its bad assness and loses that last start due to the mess of the pack grizz and skoal (minus peach) have easier packs. but its cheap and gets the job done...im all for husky
