AR is my favorite actor due to his politics (he's a socialist), his intelligence, his voice and his ability to play each part as neither totally evil, nor totally good. Within the restrictions of sometimes vile scripts, he is nonetheless able to shine..using the lift of an eyebrow or a quirk of the lips to speak volumes. His best movies have been Bob Roberts , Prince of Thieves and Quigley Down Under .....pictures that otherwise might have been just standard Hollywood formula faire. He has been able to insert the same classical piece in Dark Harbor , Die Hard , and Truly, Madly, Deeply . Watch them back to back and see if you can identify it. Here lately, he's started to pull a John Wayne, playing Alan Rickman playing whatever character but I'll take him any day over the clueless pretty boys that fog the screen. As a woman 4 days older than he is, I can tell you that he still raises my blood pressure to a might O !!!!
