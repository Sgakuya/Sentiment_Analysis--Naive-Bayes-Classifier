An impressive 800+ page tome of culinary history and recipes sweeping from Turkey to Spain. Recipes vary from easy and practical, like how to make hommade ricotta, to complicated and exotic like Black Risotto with cuttlefish from Venice. As a cook I have found this book very useful and have recieved thumbs-up from each dish I have made. Yet the historian side of me loves this book even more as that's what it really is. Wright does an exhaustive job documenting palace records of popes and sultans to see how they really ate as well as showing how impoverished the cuisine of an average 13 cent. peasant was. Also included are social commentaries from Renaissance historians, plenty of maps and surprisingly detailed essays on social and political issues that shaped national cuisines and eating habits of the ancient and medieval Mediterranean. For anyone interested in the real gastronomical story behind Mediterranean cooking, this is and will be the authoritative source for years to come.
