Haha Tom Cruise...never take him back Nicole, you're too good for the likes of him. He could never love you more than himself. Anyway, acting ability. Not bad, comes across as a bit of a cold fish sometimes. We can oh and ah over acting technique, but sometimes its a turn-off when you consciously think my my, that was a fine piece of emoting. Cold mountain was over-rated and Renee wiped the floor with everyone anyway. For all the gossip about Nic and Jude, they never spent enough time on screen together to actually warm it up. But I like her cause she's an Aussie chick made good and I hope she lets grovelling Tom lick the soles of her boots for a while before laughing and running off with Russell Crowe. Hahahah!
