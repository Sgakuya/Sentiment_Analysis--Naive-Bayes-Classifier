Bartolo Colon has everything he needs to become a Hall of Fame pitcher. He throws everything hard. His fastball is over 101 mph at times. His offspeed pitches are as fast as some pitchers heat. He is very strong and durable. He stays healthy, and so far, in his career he has no physical problems. His only flaw is heart. Sometimes, it seems as if he doesn't care if the team wins. Sometimes, he will ask to be taken out of a game because he is tired. He doesn't like to get the signs from the catcher, instead, he gets lazy and wants to rely on the fastball. Even at 100 mph, in the major league, if you show the batters the same pitch every time, eventually they can hit it.
