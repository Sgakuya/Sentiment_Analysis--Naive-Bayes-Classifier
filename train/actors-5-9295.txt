Kathy Bates and Mary Louise Parker are my favorite actresses. I love Kathy Bates because of her ability to do anything, from comedy to thrillers. She is wonderful in everything she does. I would see anything she's in. I was shocked at what some people on this list said about her. I think she is very pretty, just not in the standard way. The thing I admire most about her is the humanity she brings to all her characters. There is a warmth and humor inside her that comes out in all of her characters. This is such a strong quality that I always sympathize with her, even in Misery . Anyone who says she isn't the greatest actress in the world is a cockadoody !
