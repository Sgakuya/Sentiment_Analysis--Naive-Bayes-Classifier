I love Houston. The most diverse population of any city I've ever been to. Who cares about touristy stuff. Plenty to do in this city. Great museums, excellent shopping, vast array of restaurants, excellent nightlife around the entire city, especially downtown. Very prosperous city with lots of young people. Noticed lots of construction downtown with new lofts, apartments and condos. Love the new light rail. Didn't notice any cowboy hats and western stuff. Did notice lots of Porsche's BMW's and Mercedes. Low cost of living, diverse population, sports, the arts, culture, the beach, shopping at its best what more could you ask for. Hot summers yes, but mild fall and winters. Spring is pretty nice too.
