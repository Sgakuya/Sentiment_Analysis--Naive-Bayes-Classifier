One of the best video games of all time and certaintly a smashing piece of electronic entertainment! The sequel to the best N64 game, PERIOD, SSBM takes fighting games to an almost trascendent experience. The graphics flow with a smooth framerate and Nintendo characters are finally given the graphical justice that they deserve. THe sound, on Nintendo's first disc-based system since their aborted Playstation project, is superb and stereophonic. THe controls fit like a glove, if they move a bit faster than the original. Also, all the new stuff is mega-groovy! New characters, items and stages that just kick it! The characters are among the greatest to ever grace the video gaming world--Mario, Pikachu, Peach, Dr. Mario, Luigi, Kirby, Bowser, and more! Highly recommended to anyone who has EVER played video games!
