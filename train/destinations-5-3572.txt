Many of the stereoptypes of Minneapolis stem from its suburbs and not the city itself. The city is incredibly diverse and generally middle-class. The sections of the city which are often categorized as "slums" are actually not that different from the rest of the city in terms of average income and the style of the houses (granted crime is a bit higher in these neighborhoods). Minneapolis' skyline is the best in the Midwest after Chicago. Downtown is filled with shopping and good restaurants. I don't know that much about St. Paul, but based on the two times I have been to Minneapolis, I have nothing bad to say about this region. The highway system is sort of confusing, but if I lived here, I'm sure I could figure it out.
