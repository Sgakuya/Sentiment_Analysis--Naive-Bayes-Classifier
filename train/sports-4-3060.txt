Mickey was my favorite player when I was growing up. He was the ultimate 5-tool player when he was young, but he let his career deteriorate, and because of that, no matter how sentimental, I can't give him 5 stars. No one had more power from both sides of the plate. He could hit for average, field his position and run like the wind. And, under pressure - 18 home runs in the World Series. But, he let alcohol get the best of him, and his career went downhill. But, in the mid-to-late 50s, he was the best in the game - better than Mays, better than Aaron, better than Williams. He was a 5-star player who just refused to remain that way.
