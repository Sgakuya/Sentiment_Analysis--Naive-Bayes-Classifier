Wilt Chamberlain was a great player. He was physically unbelievable. After he retired, he worked out with Schwarzenegger, and bench pressed 500 lbs, which is amazing for a 7 footer. He tried out with the Kansas City Chiefs, and ran a 4.4. He was a high jump champion, and his vertical was measured at 46 inches when he played for the Globetrotters. He was the best passing center ever. He is the only big man to lead the league in assists. He was a dominating rebounder. He pulled down 55 rebounds when facing Bill Russell. He was a great shot blocker. Before it was officially a stat, he blocked 27 shots in a game. He played the great Walt Bellamy, and blocked his first 10 shots one game. No one could stop him. The officials called him unfavorably. Teams would constantly tripple team him. Russell couldn't stop him. The Celtics would use 3 players, and Wilt still averaged 29 and 28 against them. The only player who gave him trouble was Nate Thurman.
