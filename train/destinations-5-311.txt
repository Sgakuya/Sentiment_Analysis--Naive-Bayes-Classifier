I give Adelaide a 5 for two reasons, one is the market. The produce, meat, fish, etc. where fabulous. For my fellow US citizens, think Pike Street in Seattle, Chelse Market in NYC, Eastern Market in Detroit. If you are a foodie like me, the market is not be missed! Second - it is the gateway to Kangaroo Island. Again for my fellow US friends, think African safari Australian style. Make sure to stay at least one night on the island. Most Aussie animals are nocturnal so take a look around at night to see the best wild life. Several companies offer nocturnal tours - ask you B&B host or hotel manager for recommendations. Also DO NOT MISS the stars at night (actually saw the Southern Cross, almost hurts to look at it is so bright). The best way I can describe the night sky is like someone took silver lame fabric and is gently waving it overhead, it is that incredible. I have work for an automotive company who has plants in Australia, one in Adelaide, so I have the opportunity to visit often. Adelaide is a jewel in the rough, you just have to get off the beaten path and know where to look!
