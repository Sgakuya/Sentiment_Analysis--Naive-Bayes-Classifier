How Abraham Lincoln should not be considered anything less than this nation's greatest President is beyond absurdity. Without this great man, there simply would be no United States today. It is true that Lincoln was a controversial figure in his day, exercising extraordinary powers during his Presidency. And Lincoln seemed largely ambivalent at the beginning of his administration to the issue of slavery. However, Lincoln quickly found his mission, as Commander-in-Chief, to preserve and protect his then-rapidly-dividing nation. And as he grew weary over the tragedy of the Civil War, Lincoln began to fully understand the magnitude of slavery and how it tore the United States apart. It is probably safe to say he became an abolitionist as the war exacted a heavier toll on the nation. Notwithstanding the Emancipation Proclamation (which today is considered by many historians to be the greatest political speech written), or his brilliance as the unquestioned leader of an administration full of extremely ambitious individuals, Lincoln proved himself to be the savior of the Union cause- and moreover his country. As such, Lincoln deserves his lofty perch as the greatest of all American Presidents. He honestly was, and to say he isn't is to deny the reality of it.
