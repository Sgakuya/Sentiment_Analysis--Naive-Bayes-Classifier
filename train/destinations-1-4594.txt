Why would you want to visit this toilet unless you had to on business? This is a city with virtually no character or personality, an ugly eyesore totally in the hands of the oil greedheads and real estate developers (Houston is the only so-called major city in the U.S. that does not have zoning laws: my, how reasonable and forward-thinking!!!). A perrenial traffic jam. The climate sucks, you can take in all of the tourist attractions, lame as they may be, in about two days, and the culture level of this dungheap is that of a third world country (but then again, a good deal of Texas is a third world country, so it figures). The home of the criminal conspiracy that tried to pass itself off as a respectable corporation, Enron, a prime supporter of that dimwit in the Oval Office. They should dismantle this grave mistake of a city and start all over again.
