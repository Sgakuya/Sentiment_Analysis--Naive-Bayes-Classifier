my son and i had the pleasure of meeting patrick ewing at a virgin megastore one night after a basketball game. i thought my son was going to pass out. he finally got the nerve to approach and ask for his autograph. patrick at first politely refused . he said he was tired and just wanted to get a movie to watch and relax. my son politely said that it was okay he was just happy to have met one of basketballs greatest. as he turned to walk away patrick ewing said hold on. you deserve to have your autograph you are a respectful young man. thank you for not insisting. he talked with my son a few minutes more and he went to get his movie and my son was in heaven
