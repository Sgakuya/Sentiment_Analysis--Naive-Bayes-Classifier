I was checking out 'scouthoops.com' today, and I became curious about something.......why the hell does Ohio State think they have the best recruiting class of all time coming in 2006 when they don't even have the #1 class in 2006? We do. In fact, with all the jokes and laughing about our upcoming team in '05-'06, I'm laughing for a different reason........by GOLLY, Carolina is about to win it again in '06-'07. For that class, we already have all six scholarships filled. So, that team will have sophomores Green, Hansbrough, Frasor, Ginyard, Copeland. Senior, Reyshawn Terry. Junior, Thomas. If that's not impressived enough, the 7 I just mentioned will be joined by #1 ranked pg, Tywon Lawson, #1 ranked PF Brandon Wright, #1 SG Wayne Ellington, and other top ranked freshmen Alex Stepheson, William Graves (local boy), and Deon Thompson. Once again, the problem in Chapel Hill will not be winning, but deciding who should play. They'll probably have to go back to the blue and white team days of Coach Smith - ......5 take a breather, 5 come in. Everybody said point guard would be an issue for us. The only prob I see is which one to play. Thomas should be excellent by the time Lawson arrives, but Lawson is the best point guard in America. He just got 51 points last night. Ahhh, the problems of a Tarheel fan. And many writers think Ellington is amazing and wouldn't be going to college at all if not for the age limit. So, what if Terry has turned into a top scorer/athlete like many think he will by the time Ellington arrives? In any case, shut up Ohio State, the #1 class in '06 is not something you possess. Look at 'scouthoops.com' and see for yourself. So, go cheat on a test or worry about Northwestern or something. We'll take care of basketball recruiting, thank you.
