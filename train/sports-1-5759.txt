Update for blue tar PISS the bottom line is that you cant beat redick and none of the other guards at unc can did you see that private camp game when redick and mcants played one on one yeah redick won 11 to 6 breaking ankles and anything else that needed to be broke. so you are just a hater and all those stupid numbers you left on my user page about redicks fg% against unc I dont care if he fg% is my dick he can not be stopped by any unc players whether its off a screen or no scrren just face it. Its the truth and it hurts. Now i bet if redick played for unc you would have all good things to say you have so much carolina pride that you wont even give him his props for playing well agaist unc. So you might as well enjoy you little one year title now because next year hopefully duke will win its seventh acc championship in eight years (maryland won the other 1 not lame ### unc)And by GODS grace our fourth national title. And were will unc be? HMMMM. they probably wont even make it to the second round. Yall national champs but yall are not better than your conference champions duke. National champs acc champs HMMMMMMM.
