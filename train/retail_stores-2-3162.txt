I think it's all about false advertising. I joined Netflix because it has a huge selection of DVDS. So far, I think their price is the cheapest. I don't mind paying $25 for the 3-out plan. But their service has been going downhill lately. What I hate most is their delay tactics. I agree with the commements from 'thekickbacksutta.' The more you watch, the slower they are to send you the movies. And that's what bothering me the most. They shouldn't advertise unlimited DVDs on the Web site. If they intend to 'limit' the DVDs you rented out, they should say so on the Web site and people will not be so pi$$ed off. I used to get 22 movies the first month I joined Netflix, then down to 18 the next month, then 16 and now 12 movies a month if I am lucky. I think Netflix is stupid to go for $18/month fee. All they need to do is maintain their good quality and people will try their service eventually. Unfortunately, their bad customer service and 'fraud' advertising are scaring away so many subscribers each month. They should look at their file and see the turnaround numbers. My colleague who decided to join the Free Trial membership was so mad at Netflix. Apparently the 15 day Free trial is not free afterall. He must give Netflix his credit card / bank account in order to join the trial version. Within days, he realised that Netflix already charged him the monthly fees from his bank account. Believe me, he was mad as hell. He is going to cancel the account now.
