I thought Catherine Zeta-Jones was cute in Chicago, but I don't think I would like her a person. She seems so greedy-she sells pictures of her kids for bookoos of money, and then in that lawsuit last year against the paper that published unflatttering pictures of her and her husband, she sneered,A million dollars is not much to us. And when her son was born, she encouraged everyone to contribute to a charitable fund for him.Please! She's already been accused of marrying dessicated old Michael Douglas for his millions, but I'm willing to give her a break on that. She might really love him. But she has shown by her other actions that she is a very greedy and grasping individual.
