Jesse Jackson is a racist individual. He hate white people as much as the kkk hate black people. I could respect the man if he was working hard to create meaningful relations between blacks and whites. But no, he only shows up when it is a potential blach vs white situation. Look at what he did in illinois with the black students. shortly after he made a big problem, one of the boys was arrested for beating up women carring children. Now jesse shows up in the election and cries foul. he plans protests for jan 20 th the day president elect Bush is to become president. He stated this week that republican demonstrators were thugs and adolf hitler tactics were being used by the republicans. If jesse jackson was a true man of the cloth, he would work for new positive experiences for the black man and not open old wounds.
