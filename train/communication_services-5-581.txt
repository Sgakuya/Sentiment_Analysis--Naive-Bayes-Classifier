Prior to T-Mobile, I had AT T TDMA service. I thought it was the best service ever! (except when you're deep in side a building). Then I switched to AT T GSM. What a nightmare! I know their GSM service is new, but that was ridiculous. Dropped calls everywhere! I liked the GSM service though, so tried T-Mobile. I travel from Ventura County to Los Angeles to Orange County and even north San Diego county. This service is awesome! In my three months, I've never gotten busy signals, and my calls always came through. I have the sidekick, and don't know if it's on a different network as their cell phones, but it is the best mobile device I've ever owned.
