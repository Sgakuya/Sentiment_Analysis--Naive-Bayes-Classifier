If the Rams can stay consistent, and prove that last Sunday's spanking by the sorry 49ers was a fluke, they might be able to sneak the division title away from Seattle. Mark Bulger is a good quarterback, better than likeable but terribly inconsistent Kurt Warner, and he has righted this ship for the most part. Torry Holt is getting in done on offense, and Marshall Faulk is back this week. Although Faulk is not what he once was, he should make a difference on 1st and 2nd downs, and also as a receiving threat to take the pressure off of Holt. A 5-3 second half could mean 10-6 and maybe a wild card, but 7-1 with their easy remaining schedule would mean 12-4 and most likely the division title. I think the latter is more likely, and maybe even a first-round bye. Keep an eye on this team.
