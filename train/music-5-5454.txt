There is something intagably compelling about the persona and its accompanying world of fairy tale horror that Alice Cooper weaves, as if he were either a idiot-savant stumbeling around the dark underbelly of post 60's American ideals, or a wiley provocatur as manipulative and dangerouse as the characters he invents.What makes early Alice Cooper material so engaging and timeless is its sense of humour, its sense of irony a concept probably lost on the country of which he was born, who were all to busy delighting in the schlock horror theatrics he presented.Welcome to my Nigtmare is the sound of an artist effortlessly at the peak of his powers, excersising a new found freedom, away from the compromises and politics of a group setting, and indulging his razor sharp instints to the full.The albums over blown pompousity is brilliantly employed by producer Bob Ezrin, rendering songs such as 'Only Women Bleed' as a vitrolic and sarcastic attack on the feminist movement that had built up around the 60's.And lets not forget that Cooper proclaimed that he and his group drove a stake through the heart of the love generation!.This is one of those perfectley realised albums, and if the awesome opening track doesnt engage than nothing here will.
