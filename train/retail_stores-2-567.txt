Ok, i admit that some of the clothing is cute, but if i didnt get a 40% discount i would never have bought anything. so basically i worked my behind off all summer and for WHAT?!? 0 dollars baby. they havent payed me yet because they keep telling me its MY bank thats having the problem?!? no. i'm sorry. but i think this has happened to other people and i'm SO fed up with the incompetent managers who are continuously passing off responsibility. They over hired, gave me the worst hours ive ever had to work in my life, and at minimum wage IN ADDITION they didnt train me properly and freaked out when i made a mistake.
