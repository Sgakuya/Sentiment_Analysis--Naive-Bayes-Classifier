Star Trek was cheesy- and sometimes heavy-handed- but a good and quite original show. It does not translate well to film at all though. Although I think the 4th one, with all of that Save the Humpback Whale stuff, was even more pompous and awful, this first one would put you to sleep even if you had smoked 176 cigarettes and consumed 31 bottles of Mountain Dew prior to viewing this dreck. In addition to the usual cast, we also see a bald Sinead type chick with a cool name that sounds like an African dictator, Persis Khambatta, who is actually from, I would guess, India or Transoxania or Samarkand or somewhere like that, and perennial d - list hack and "Tales of the Golden Monkey" star ( a blatant Raiders of the Lost Ark ripoff early 80's show) Stephen Collins. Avoid this tripe!
