Update: If it bothers you so much then don't watch it for pete's sake. Problem solved. No one is poitning a gun to your head. They rated it R so it's not as though they're hiding the content of the movie behind a lower rating. I simply think it's ridiculous to trash a movie you've never ever seen simply because it involves homosexuals. I have to admit I'm intrigued. Sounds as though the movie has potential and a sound script. Now you just have to add them eating pudding so Trey Parker and Matt Stones premonition of a "Gay Cowboys Eating Pudding" movie can come to pass. ;o) Louie, I seriously doubt that their careers will be over. Ever see Philadelphia? Notice Tom Hanks career after he made that movie? (Saving Private Ryan, Green Mile, Apollo 13) How about Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry"? Now correct me if I'm wrong but these Oscar Winners went on to make more Oscar winning movies (Million Dollar Baby and Forrest Gump anyone?). Thankfully most of America won't be like you and let homophobia overshadow a good script and a good acting performance.
