I have been attending UoP via Western International University. I am currently enrolled for my AA in business and then will go on to get my undergraduate in Business Management. I have been attending now for about 7 months and I am surprised by what I am reading. My enrollment counselor was INCREDIBLE! She answered all my questions thoroughly and quickly. My Academic Counselor is ok, no real problems. My financial aide has been fine and even when I had to take a 3-week leave of absence it was smooth as butter to do the paperwork and even jump back in a little early. I had my concerns the first block of classes because it seemed I was the only one actually attempting to respond to DQs and responses to other classmates in any real depth. I asked my counselor and she assured me it would change, that you had folks who had been out of school for years and needed to get back in the groove. She was right. I am now in my third block of classes and everyone seems to really participate, but a couple. I have been out of school for 11 years and I feel like the AA program is fine. I have friends who are going to the State University and when I told them I had 2 and 3,000 word essays due in my second block, they were shocked, they had been in school 2 years and thought 1500 word essays were big. Ultimately I think it is what you put into it. I like doing things for myself and very rarely call for help, but I don't need it. I figure if you need to contact your counselor constantly, then maybe you are not ready for the online format.
