Middlesex is an extremely ambitious book. Eugenides does a Nabokovesque job of taking a subject that many people will find uncomfortable - the life of a hermaphrodite - and through good writing making it a human, relatable story for just about anyone. Middlesex tells the story of Cal - the child of Turkish immigrants who is raised as a girl, but is really a boy. I admire this book as it does its part in making the world a better place by destroying some of the myths surrounding hermaphrodites, by describing not a freak of nature, but a scared, confused adolescent - something just about everyone has been. And all in the context of a tremendously in depth description of 3 generations of the family, from Turkey/Greece all the way to Detroit, Michigan. I can't give it five stars because it just too darn long...
