Bethlehem is part of the Lehigh Valley area which includes Allentown to the West and Easton to the East. Bethlehem is a nice community that has regrouped nicely after the closing of Bethlehem Steel. There really are two parts of the city. The North side is more quaint and quiet. There's plenty of historic victorian houses. Downtown is the site of the yearly Musikfest event each August. Many natives say it's become too commercialized which may be true but it's still a quality event which packs them in every year. Main St. is a classic small town USA st with plenty of gift shops and other attraction slike the Bethlehem Brewworks and the Hotel Bethlehem (Radisson). The bridges that connect North to South Bethlehem offer a very scenic view of the Lehigh River and the old Bethlehem Steel. The Southside is a dynamic area with Lehigh University and a respectable musci scene. There are great bars like the Funhouse, The Your Welcome Inn, and The Tally Ho. There also are some fine restaurants like Nawab (Indian food) and Tulum (Mexican) among many others. Also there are two fine music liastening rooms like Godfrey Daniels which host many established and up and coming folk artist and the Wildflower Cafe which mostly caters to the hippy Phish heads but will also book alternative punk bands as well. Bethlehem is a cool city!
