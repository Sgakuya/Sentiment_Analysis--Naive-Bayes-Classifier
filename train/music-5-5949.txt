Prbably the best of the TOOL albums. This would be the start of the TOOL albums filed with few quickie sound effect tracks, and the long but beautifully and ferociously crafted songs that are anything but filler. The sheer talent that flows from the instrumental and songwritting ability from these four men is astonishing. This album will make you think as well as keep you in hysterics with the suprisingly witty lyrics. Favorite cuts from this album include 'Stinkfist,' 'Aemema (the filth that makes L.A. and flushing it all down a toilet),' 'Hooker With A Penis (what is truly selling out?),' 'Intermission,' and the ode to L. Ron Hubbard and anyone ese who claims to be a God when they're not 'Eulogy.' One incredible record. MONEY WELL SPENT!!!!
