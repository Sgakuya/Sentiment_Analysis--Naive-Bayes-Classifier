Patrick Surtain is one of the best, if not the best, cornerback in the league. It goes beyond his amazing cover skills (29 career interceptions) and impecible speed. He happens to be one of the hardest hitting corners out there. I would say there are safeties and maybe even some linebackers that hit softer than him. Last season he had 71 tackles. That's outstanding for a corner. That's more than Champ Bailey who recieves constant praise for his tackling skills. It's also more than double the number of tackles by Chris McAlister, who is considered by many the best corner in the league. He isn't afraid to blitz the quarterback either. He's had 6.5 career sacks. He's also a great leader at his position. Team leaders at skill positions, such as cornerback, are rare, which is what makes players like him and Ty Law so valuable. All in all, he has less visible weaknesses than other marquee players at corner. Champ Bailey has been burned several times when put in man coverage against tall recievers. Chris McAlister lacks solid tackling skills. Ty Law is coming off of an injury plagued season. Taking all that into consideration, I'd say that makes Pat Surtain this best corner in football.
