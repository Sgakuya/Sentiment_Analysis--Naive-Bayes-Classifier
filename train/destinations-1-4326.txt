Oh my...I can't believe some of you here who say LA is a wonderful city. It's more like a polluted hell-hole with trash, bums and freaks almost everywhere you go. People are really cold and mean. If you don't do things the way they want to do it, then they make a big deal out of it. Then there's traffic, and the retarded layout of the roadway. Boy, whoever designed the roads of LA must have been snorting PCP from Compton. One street ends at point 1, but starts again at point 2 which is several block down a parallel road. Ridiculous. Housing and rent cost is also ridiculous. A rundown shabby mud-hut in East LA cost $600,000! Don't believe what hollyweird projects on the screen. LA is horrible, it's like hell on earth, and life is very stressful living here. This is why I got the hell out of LA.
