An unbelievably productive player. Bonds has that rare ability to put his team on his shoulders for weeks on end, and is a true star both offensively and defensively. In terms of his personality - which has always been his biggest liability - if you get a chance, read the summer 2000 interview with Bonds and Dan Patrick that appeared in ESPN, The Magazine. In this interview, Bonds comes across of a private, insecure guy, who is terrified of being called stupid, and uses his bluster and attitude to disguise his insecurities...it was really interesting stuff. Regardless if this interview was a result of a PR spin for Bonds, the guy is a hell of a baseball player.
