Your KMART (West 26th and Sterritania) plaza store really needs help. The pizza is always good. But, Little Ceasers is known for the crazy bread too. Each and everytime I walk in there...kids are hanging all over the back of the store and there they've run out of crazy bread. I don't even know if all those kids work there. They are dressed like they live on the streets. But, it would be great if they could put some of them to work and make some crazy bread. They always have an excuse aa to why there isn't any. My gosh, you're known for crazy bread and these kids are driving your name and business into the ground. T. Wager Erie, PA
