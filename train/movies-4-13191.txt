I read the book, then watched the film. Jack Nicholson plays Patrick McMurphy, a man in the mental hospital because he was judged insane by the court system. In there, He meets evil Nurse Ratched who takes joy in tormenting the patients. The book was better because it got into more depth of McMurphy the character. The movie, however, does still follow the book faithfully for the most part. But it kinds of cleans it up. They left out scenes involving Old Rawler's gruesome suicide, The kid with hydrocephalus putting his head in the disinfectant, and how Nurse Ratched sent her aides to anally probe the patients. The movie does still show how abusive the mental asylums were back then, but the book depicts them even more.
