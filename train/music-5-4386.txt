Wow! All I could say when I got this cd was Wow! I could not believe all the energy the Boss and the Band still had, even in their (young!) 50s! It was so heartwarming and wonderful to hear! I was not only enchanted by the E Street Band, and their excellence, but by the fans' reactions, too. From singing along to Jungleland, to helping introduce Patti and Clarence during 10th Ave. Freeze Out you can really see that they're having the time of their lives! And listening to this cd is as close as it comes to being there! I find myself reacting exactly the same as the crowd while listening to this! I like every song, but I might have to cite My Love Will Not Let You Down , Jungleland , Born to Run (a surprise track not listed on the packaging!) Youngstown American Skin Land of Hope and Dreams Two Hearts , and Out in the Street as my favorites. Although the others are wonderful too! Listening to this makes me feel so alive! And I can safely say that any music fan should definitely enjoy this! I must say that it takes a time or two of listening to it before you reach the state I'm in, but once you do, you never get tired of it! I would say that it's not quite as amazing as Live 1975/85 but still glorious! It's lesser expensive and still superb, so if you can't afford Live 75/85 This is the one to get! I love it, and chances are you will too!
