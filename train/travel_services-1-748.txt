I rented a car to be picked up in Las Vegas. The shuttle service from the airport was flawless. When I got to their rental location I waited in line for 1 hour and was told they had no cars available. Not only that but it's not their problem they don't have any cars, it's the people returning them late that are fault. Even though I confirmed the reservation the day before! This place is the MOST unorganized business I have ever dealt with, very rude employees with no customer service skills. After talking with the supervisor she said I have a car for you. After I fill out all the paperwork and argue with them about the minimum insurance coverage they want me to take which was $14.95 per day on top of the rental fee. Then they tell me I am 100% responsible for ANY damage and lost time for them while the car is being fixed. Yeah sure ok. Finally they accept the fact I don't want their insurance coverage. 1 hour and 45 minutes later I walk out to a Dodge Neon, which is supposed to be a mid sized car? Not only that but the car is the biggest POS I have EVER rented. It has 31000 miles, stains throughout the interior, scratches, dents and a broken windshield. Half of which was not listed on their little form you sign before you take the car. After getting that taken care of I am on the road. The car was ok for the few days I had it. Returning was much smoother. Car was dropped off and I was at the airport within 20mins. DON'T rent a car from this outfit! Pay a few more dollars and save yourself a ton of headaches. Also beware they have changed their name. It's now US Rent A Car!
