DISTURBED is my all-time favorite band. My girlfriend introduced me to their music about 8 months ago. Now, I can't get enough of them! ... seeing as how this is about Current Concert Tours, I'll talk about Rolling Rock Town Fair 5.. We went there on July 31, 2004, and it was so awesome. Words can't describe my experience there. Even my pictures don't do it justice (the point-and-shoot camera makes everything look farther away than we actually were). We were in the mud pit, right up front, about 25 feet from the stage. DISTURBED was almost the last band to play, but we didn't care. We also didn't mind all the rain and mud either, because we were THERE to SEE DISTURBED perform!! It rocked! They have such a magnificent stage presence. And the lyrics are intelligent and make many points. Not to mention the drums and guitars... And we got to see the new member (John) play. Of course, the fight between Finch and DISTURBED kicked butt too! Score: DISTURBED 1, Finch 0 .. LOL.. too funny. All the songs David sang were wonderful and powerful. And you could feel the music in your chest. RRTF was an awesome experience and I left with many wonderful memories. Next time DISTURBED is coming to Latrobe, PA, I'M there for sure. If you've never seen them live, you gotta go... it's a whole new level of listening to the best band ever: DISTURBED!!
