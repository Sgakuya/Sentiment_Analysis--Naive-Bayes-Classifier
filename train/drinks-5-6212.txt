It s funny how the simplest things in life are often the most satisfying For plain cola-cola , I always have and will prefer Coke. I like Vanilla Coke ( V-Coke ) also, but at times, it s had an odd aftertaste (although that sometimes occurs with all sodas, depending on the bottling plant). For some reason, Pepsi Vanilla ( Pep-Van ) which actually lists VANILLA EXTRACT in the ingredients (vanilla extract is a noteworthy omission in V-Coke s ingredient list) is one of those simple concepts with a deliciously complex result! To me, it actually seems to have more of that great, acidic, cola bite of Coke that s missing from regular Pepsi (the bite is especially Coke-like in the canned version).Yet, at the same time, it s wonderfully smooth and creamy in both taste and body (gets a great foamy head when shaken), and leaves a palpable, yet subtly smooth vanilla aftertaste that s remarkably natural compared to V-Coke. More amazing in some respects, is the diet version. You d expect the artificial sweeteners to negate the cola-bite and overpower the delicate vanilla flavor, but that s simply not the case with Pep-Van. It has all of the bite and smoothness of the regular version Simply the most un-diet-diet-soda since Diet Dr. Pepper The year-plus gap between V-Coke and Pep-Van was worth it... it's an overall outstanding effort from Pepsi!
