WOW! I do recommend visiting this cathedral. Once, twice, three, four times...it will never be the same. Because the building of this masterpiece is still in progress after so many years...and what you can see today is just a lateral wing of Gaud 's original project (which is probably going to be cut/modified someway or other). And what I strongly recommend is getting to the top of La Sagrada Familia...without the lift (this for lazy people...unlike you;-)). What you will see is going to be a great reward for all of you, I guarantee...from the sea, to the Northern side of Barcelone, the Parc Guell, the Montju c to the South, las Ramblas, the modernity of the new Barcelona behind you...don't you feel like taking your plane right now?
