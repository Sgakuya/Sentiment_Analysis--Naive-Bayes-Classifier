Newports would be a woneerful product if those that consume it would figure out a way to consume ALL of it. To the rest of us. It stinks.I mean it REALLY stinks. It stinks in that way that when I smell the secondhand smoke, I marvel at the addicitve power of nicotine that would push a human body to drop its defenses and actually CRAVE inhaling it. It dosen't seem possible that something as foul and acrid could have actually have come through a human being. If you want the stuff, help yourself. It's a free country. But the minute your addiction makes my skin and clothes reek of your addiction, it becomes a different kind of problem.
