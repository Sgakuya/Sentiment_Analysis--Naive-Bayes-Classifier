I think this is probably the best president of my time. Maybe Reagan was a little better but Bush was the only one "tested" in my time and he came through just as I thought a president should. You have a bunch of cowards on both sides. None of them had the guts to have a war go to a vote for "fear" their "political" career could be damaged if all did not go well. So what did they do? They let Bush be their "proxy." IOW, a person they could blame for their own mistake. IOW, "Hey, I didn't vote to go to war, I just said that I would leave it up the president to use his own judgment." However with all these things... the attack on America and the numerous disasters Bush pulled through. Add up all the things combined the other presidents had happen while in office and it pales in comparison to what Bush was face with. At best, you had a Kennedy that not only brought on the Cuban Missile Crisis (via Bay of Pigs), he got us out by the skin of his teeth. At worst you had Carter give impotency a new name as the Iranians held Americans hostage for 444 days. Bush took action and for this he deserves more respect than all those congressmen and women that can only "speculate" that he did something wrong... and speculate for their own personal political gain. Just imagine anyone of them being in Bush's place. Not a single one had enough guts to place their own political career in jeopardy so they voted to keep a distance and "Let George Do It." It didn't matter if it was Kerry or any other person in congress... there is no way they would win against Bush as they have already proved to us what they were made of. They wouldn't take it upon themselves to declare war. Why? Because, let's face it, their political career meant more to them than us Americans. I am almost certain that you will never see another congressman/woman become president. It just won't happen as they have lost the American people's respect.
