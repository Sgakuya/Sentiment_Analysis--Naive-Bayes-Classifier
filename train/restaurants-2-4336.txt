My husband and I along with some friends ate at the Cracker Barrel in Clarksville, Tennessee Saturday Night. Our waitress brought us a plate of biscuits. We found a long hair in one of our biscuits. We told our waitress and she in turn told the manager. From where we were seated, we could see the manager when she told him. He never came out to inquire about what happened or just to say he was sorry. We are not asking for anything free, but a simple appology would have been acceptable. I work for the Sheriff's Dept. in our county and our Chief Deputy and his family were also eating there the same night. He like myself had eaten there numerous times. He could not even eat his steak and biscuit because the steak was ruined. He had eaten steak there before and he stated it had never tasted like that before. He also informed the manager but the manager told him that was the way it was suppose to taste. My family has always considered Cracker Barrel their favorite restuarant but after this last incident, I think we have changed our minds. I am writing this letter because I think you need to know before this particular manager loses a lot of your customers. Thanks,
