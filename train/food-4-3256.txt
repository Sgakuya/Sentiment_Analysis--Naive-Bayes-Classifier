Lean Cuisine is at the top of my list for light frozen meals. You really can't beat them for taste and variety, and the portions seem to be a bit larger than what you find in some of the other lines. My favorites are the chicken entrees, such as chicken in peanut sauce and chicken piccata, and the pizzas, which are quite substantial and very tasty. Sometimes frozen meals can be kind of watery, but that's never the case with Lean Cuisine. The vegetables always look and taste fresh, and the sauces are especially flavorful. Lean Cuisines often go on sale, too, which is nice. To get a quick, fairly healthy meal for $1.50 to $3.00 is a bargain in my book. If I'm looking for a fast, low-fat meal, I'll go with Lean Cuisine.
