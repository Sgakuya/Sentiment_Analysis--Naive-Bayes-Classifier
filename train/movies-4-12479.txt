It's the Chocolate Factory only as Tim Burton could make it. I haven't read the book, and I've seen the original movie a million times; it's really hard not to make comparisons. But, as a movie in and of itself, Burton's vision of this story is a reflection of his dark yet whimsical, semi-nightmarish world. Which, well, does work to bring out a whole new dimension to this movie. Most of us know the story: One factory. Five shiny tickets. Five kids. One eccentric candyman. But, if you're expecting to see a revamp of the charming story starring Gene Wilder, you'll be disappointed. This is something entirely different. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: Depp's version of Wonka is very . . . well, Michael-Jackson-esque. It's a very interesting interpretation of the character; where the original movie kept Willy Wonka fairly one-dimensional, Burton's version delves deep into the psyche of Wonka and his child-like tendencies. It's Charlie who is a flawless, one-dimensional character in this version. Interesting take on the familiar story. Overall, worth watching, but it should in no way be seen as a replacement for the original.
