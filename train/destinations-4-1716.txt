Find some time to visit Slovakia if you are on any kind of Central European jaunt. Comments based on two visits to Slovakia (total of about a week) in 1998 and 2000. Bratislava (see separate review in Cities section) has just but so much to offer attraction-wise, but the countryside itself is very beautiful in places. Slovakia is still a bargain for crafts (many of which are unique)and food. The Slovaks are pretty friendly - a lot less greedy and somewhat more hospitable to tourists than their Czech cousins. They also put on less airs than do the Czechs. Language can be a problem, even in Bratislava, but German came in really handy (as I suppose Russian might as well; couldn't say from personal experience). Hotels I stayed at in Bratislava were super-clean, with good breakfasts. Traffic and drivers were pretty sane. Overall, Slovakia is somewhat laid back, although in my experience service of most types was pretty well organized. I was surprised to find conveniently located ATMs in Bratislava, espcially since it seems that they are there more for use by tourists than by the Slovaks themselves. I wouldn't recommend devoting a lot of time to Slovakia, but by the same token, I would not recommend missing it altogether. It's still a good travel bargain.
