She constantly contradicts herself. She blames others for doing stuff that she disapproves of but then goes and does the exact same thing herself. She thinks she's the damn messiah out to liberate us poor weak women through the power of ROCK! Unfortunately, she isn't much of a musician/songwriter and her messages are lost to those who see what a hypocrite she is. She was a good screamer but her voice is too busted up now for her to carry on. And the acting? She was decent in TPVLF but thats it - the movie was well directed and the story was interesting but Courtney wasn't as good as some people say. She couldn't pull of being 17 at the beginning, she looked like an amateur during the middle, and the make-up artists really deserve the credit at the end. Other films I've seen her in; 'Straight To Hell' - unintentionally funny, terrible acting and tries too hard to be like Nancy Spungen. 'Sid and Nancy' - Tried out for the role of Nancy and lost (thank God) but equally as bad acting as her debut and funny to look at. 'Man On The Moon' - uninteresting therefore forgettable. 'Trapped' - below average acting in a bad movie, laughed when she tried to be sexy. The other films look like a waste of time according to reviews. On her looks - extensive plastic surgery and embracing the Hollywood lifestyle does not favour Ms Love. She carried off an interesting look from 91-95 as the not-so-pretty girl with a bucketload of attitude to keep you intrigued long enough not to turn away. Now she's become a generic (almost hideous) tragic barbie doll figure and the attitude has gotten old.
