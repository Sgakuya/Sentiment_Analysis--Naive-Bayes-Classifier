The most enjoyable thing about watching this movie at the theater was seeing the audience's reaction. We went to see it opening night, and the theater was packed. The two teenage girls sitting right next to me screamed contstantly during the jumpy scenes and ended up making me jumpy. Then, during a particularly quiet scene, a woman in the back of the theater pulled a solo and screamed - even though it wasn't a scary part in the movie. The whole theater cracked up laughing - I guess because everyone else felt the same way. However, during another quiet scene someone in the back of the theater (I think it may have been the same person) yelled out the Big Secret that was the key to the ending. Everyone would have figured it out very soon thereafter, but it was kind of annoying to hear it from Ms. Loudmouth in the back. However, I found the movie completely delicious. During several parts, the hair on the back of my neck and that on my arms stood straight up. With all the goofy teen horror movies and stupid ghosty-flicks out in recent years that failed to do the job, The Others pulled it off wonderfully.
