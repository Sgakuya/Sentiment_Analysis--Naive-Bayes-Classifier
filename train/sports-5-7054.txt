Presented the best and worst a superstar has to offer. Extremely talented and capable. Understood and practiced the fundamentals. A lost cause for most modern NBA superstars. Had that X factor that seperates champions from also rans. Remarkable to watch and impressive in the clutch. The drawback is he established, more than any player in history, the it's all about me mentality. Through an incredibly successful marketing campaign he remade what it means to be a sports icon. An effort that has rippled through all sports and has made them less interesting. The worst example comes from teh NBA where players care more about record deals, movie contracts, and their next ESPN top 10 play more than simply making a free throw or playing sound defense.
