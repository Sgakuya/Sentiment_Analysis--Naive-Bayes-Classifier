Titanic is simultaneously the best and worst things to have happened to this actor: it brought him TEMENDOUS fame, money, but it diminished public perception of his talent, and can typecast him if he does not consciously try hard. I cannot understand how anyone can see The basketball diaries, What's eating gilbert grape, gangs of new york, romeo and juliet... and not claim to be seeing a terrific avctor. What exactly does he do as an actor that is flawed? The whole rating system is moronic anyway. His is ridiculously polar: some hate or love him. It is not representative of his actual talent. This is an inverted bell-curve. Vote with your heads.
