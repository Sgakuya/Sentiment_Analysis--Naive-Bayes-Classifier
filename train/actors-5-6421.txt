well after reading all your opinions on him id have to agree with the majority of you in saying that J is the best thing since sliced bread-id love to be able to form a personal opinion of him-but none of us actually know the REAL josh jackson (although the majority of the female population would want to), however from what we have seen- he is a fab guy! He is well up there in my list of babes! Brilliant actor, a down to earth person, he is witty, intelligent, and appears to be a really friendly young man- so good luck to you josh and i wish your future all the best. p.s hold on to joey 4 as long as u can- u make my friday nites lol xxx suzanne xxx
