This book made me cry. It is so great. It is about an old man dying from a diease that slowly takes away the ability to do anything from the legs on up. He is a teacher and an old student of his comes back into his life. The old man (Morrie) teaches the student again but not in a school way. He teaches him, life lessons. He teaches that work is not what is important. He teaches that living your life and being happy is what is important. There are funny parts, sad parts, insightful parts and in the end a happy/sad moment that makes you look at your own life and ask yourself why you aren't doing what makes you happy? It is a great book to give as a gift because everyone needs to be reminded to do what makes them happy. It is a heartwarming book for everyone (man or woman).
