I agree with swanoak in all his wisdom. Smilers are too be distrusted. Besides, how could John Edwards compare to Dick Cheney, in all his Dr. Strangelove charm? UPDATE: Another blanket statement from Mr. Political. How do you know that John Edwards cares more about his career than helping America? Are you his shrink or his best buddy? I would say he cares more about America than Bush and Cheney, who only seem interested in helping their fatcat friends. ANOTHER UPDATE: Mr. Political, who seem determined that Edwards is out to further his career, not that that's the cardinal sin. Honestly, who isn't? But I would take his brand of inexperience over Cheney's experience any day. At least Edwards is positive and has not hurt people;on the contrary, he seems to want to help people, and is interested in folks who make less than six figures. Imagine that! Cheney is an overwhelming negative force who only wants to fill his own pockets and those of his wealthy friends. And because of his overwhelming greed, we are in a pointless war with Iraq. So you bet, I would rather start with a clean slate than slog on with the dismal and dangerous Cheney.
