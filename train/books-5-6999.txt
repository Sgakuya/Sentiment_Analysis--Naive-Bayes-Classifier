i loved this book. I admit that the Nadsat language is difficult to get used to but every word is explained in some form, and after the first few chapters, reading it and understanding what is being said becomes a non-issue. I think that there are even editions now with a Nadsat glossary in the back. Burgess successfully creates a world that is fascinating, scary and possible all at the same time. I like the way that alex is portrayed: we hate him at the beginning and pity him in the end. I liked his character a lot, despite the ultra violence. This book is all about choices and the role of free will in society. This book, i think, has been tainted by the film that has become a cult success. Although Kubrick did a good job, the book is by far superior!
