Yes, I like HOT SPACE. And yes, it is a strange album. Quite minimalistic for Queen. Well, the Jazz album had been so also, and so was The Game in a way. Anyways song by song ... Staying power is superb and energetic! Body Language so original and enigmatically simple and silly, but it sounds FANTASTIC, base, synth and Freddie´s vocals!! Cool cat is a great delicious song. Life is real (song for Lennon)is beautiful and surrealistically sad. Calling all girls rocks steady and comfortably with a great rock finale! Back chat is a bit hammering to the ear , but good rhythm and voice, don´t quite like that "electronic" drum solo in the middle. Queen music normally tends to sound quite eternal, not old-fashioned, though clearly reflecting the decade it was composed, but that solo is very tacky eighties... Put out the fire is ok, prefer the live version though... and don´t reaally like Las Palabras de Amor, Queen no suena bien en español this time. It does en "OH MUCHACHO!" en Who needs you? Good album in spite of this last song!!!! But Queen II or Sheer Heart Attack are close to my heart. I still love you Freddie! and you, John (Deacon)!!!!!!!!!!
