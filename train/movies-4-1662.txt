The movie had an interesting story, the acting was overall good, and the special effects and stunts were generally passable, although there was a bit too much of a cartoon/Matrix feel that dominated much of the fight scenes. While the fact that the characters seemed to possess the ability to fly was explained by Asian myth/legend, and I have heard that movies like this are all the rave in other countries, I think that the flying around the treetops fighting and the indoor flying fight scene may have been overdoing it a bit for us here in the states. I don't think that the movie could have ended well any other way-- it would have been fairly lame for Chow Yun Fat's character to have received the antidote and been cured just in the nick of time. I loved the fact that the movie used subtitles instead of dubbing, which I think has a tendency to distract from the movie (because of the fact that I feel the whole way through like the picture and sound are out of synch.) Overall, I give it a 4, because, while I enjoyed the flick, I don't think it lived up to all the hype. Not a waste of time or money to watch, but also not a masterpiece in my opinion.
