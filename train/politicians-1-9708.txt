Johnson was a horrible president. He was an immoral man who expanded an immoral Vietnam War. I agree with the objectives of the war; to stop the spread of communism, but massacring innocent Vietnamese and destroying their country with the use of napalm was bad. He put too many American men and women's lives on the line through his War of Attrition that Johnson authorized in Vietnam. When fighting a war, you hit your key objectives fast and then you get out fast. Johnson just continued sending soldiers incrementally to South Vietnam without sending a mass army to North Vietnam to fight the communists at their base. I hate it when the left blame Nixon for the war. He said he was going to bring the war to an honorable end, and that he did. Nixon brought the Americans home and we fought the communists in North Vietnam and Laos. Otherwise, Johnson's expansion of the welfare state was inexcusable. Johnson, like most liberals, are well-intentioned, but his Medicare scheme nationalize medicine in this country, which led to higher costs of prescriptions overall. Remember, higher taxes and higher regulations for companies mean that they will have to charge a higher price for products.
