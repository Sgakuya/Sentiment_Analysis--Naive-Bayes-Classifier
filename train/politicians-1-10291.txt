It's important to remember Bush is just a figurehead. Behind him is a cabal of greedy, self-serving , immoral/amoral, power-hungry and unscrupulous individuals. Not just inside the White House but within the oil, automotive, arms and timber logging lobbies. He is their stooge, the one who cops all the flak when people are angry and p*ssed off. As a UK citizen I'm mightily f***ed off the way every British government crawls up the backside of whoever's president of the US. I'll give Bush one credit. At least he's no longer pretending the Iraq war was about WMDs, unlike Blair. Back to Bush's mob. Speaking as an outsider what really angers me is their 'we dont give a f*** attitude' towards climate change and other environmental issues. They really just dont care,as long as the US has cheap petrol and garden furniture. Then again, Clinton was hardly any better.
