This president has surprised a lot of people, and that he has been able address many issues effectively. It is a complex world and Armand and the economic conditions faced with US is very troublesome. I think for students of current affairs President Bush's feud for more favorably than what we see coming out in the mass media. It would appear that the media is concluded he is a failure regardless of what he does. Even the jokes about his intelligence process regardless what he has done now collaborative is then in dealing with the many issues facing us in this country. Sir when is this administration has made numerous mistakes, which most of us should consider human. Nonetheless I'm afraid we're long way from being able to evaluate the contributions of President Bush or any other president who does not wear a D on their sweatshirt.
