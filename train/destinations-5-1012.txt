I enjoy visiting England when I am in Europe. It is a very warm country with inviting people. London is definitely one of my favorite European cities. St. Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace are among the many attractions first time visitors should see. When touring the countryside; visit Windsor Castle, Stratford-upon-Avon, where Shakespeare lived, Bath and Stonehenge. They are all beautiful places and only a couple of hours drive from London. It is very easy to get around the country; the roads are excellent. Be careful in London, it is easy to get lost, but if you get lost there, you'll always find something interesting like a pub with really good fish-n-chips. The English have a stigma of being cold people, I did not have that impression, they are actually very warm. Visit the Roman Baths in Bath, they are beautiful and date back to 200 A.D. Nearby Stonehenge dates back to prehistoric times, visit that as well, the history is fascinating. In fact, the history of the entire country is fascinating. If you are going to Europe, make England your first stop.
