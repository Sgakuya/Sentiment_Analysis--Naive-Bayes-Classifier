A beutifully crafted play that really defines what real love is about and what some people will do to be with those they love. I hardly believe this is based on human nature though. I think this a fantasied tale that no human could possibly match. I believe we take those we have around us for granted (whether they be our lovers or our family) which is why I think this play is so appealing. It shows us relationships we could have if we stopped procrstinating each other and accepted ourselves for who we really are. Some say that the updated movie version with leonardo di caprio gives the play a bad name......that's what i first thought until I saw it. If the only way english scholars are going to be able to teach future generations about romeo and juliet is by adding guns and drugs.....then I say they are doing a good job.
