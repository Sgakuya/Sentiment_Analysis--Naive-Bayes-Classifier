I was ready for this too be too maudlin to stand, but it wound up working - primarily because John Cusack is just the ultimate actor when it comes to characters you want to root for. It's sort of shame that the trailer basically gives you the first 20 minutes of the movie, but overall this pulls the right strings in a sweet and even elegant way while still being funny. Extra points to the music director who finally capitalized on Nick Drake's Northern Sky (the most romantic song I've ever come across); and then another Drake song Black Eyed Dog is mixed in a dramatic way (w/o the vocal) which was interesting to me as well. The lead actress reminded me a little bit too much of the girl that Bailey dated during the last season of Party of Five, but I doubt many other viewers will be troubled by that.
