I'm a big fan of the book, so I was ready to judge this movie quite harshly. Surprisingly, I thought they did a very good job converting this to film, especially considering how difficult the conversion would be with this book. What might be most impressive is the way they arranged it to either lead the way to the other books, or stand on it's own if this is the only one they make. Sam Rockwell was an excellant choice to play Arthur Dent, and the rest of the cast(particularly Zooey Deschanel) is good too. If you aren't already a Hitchhiker's fan, it might not be the movie for you, but it could be worth a look. Who know? You might take a liking to Douglas Adams sense of humor.
