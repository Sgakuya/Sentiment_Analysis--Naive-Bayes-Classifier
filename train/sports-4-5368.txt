If you pay attention you will notice that nick shot a good percentage from the 3 pt line this year and he isnt sitting in front of a PC reading this right now, he is working on his game. Nick is a great player and as a rokie has better footwork than most big men in the NBA, he is also a relentless rebounder and a hard nose ball player. Also he is extremely intelligent of the game and when he is a sucess in the league a lot of people will have thier foot in thier mouths especialy espn's chad ford. I am a D1 college ball player myself, not for a school as big as Kansas (savannah state) but i am from NYC and i play against professionals every summer and Nick is ready for that level and he knows it, soon everyone will also.
