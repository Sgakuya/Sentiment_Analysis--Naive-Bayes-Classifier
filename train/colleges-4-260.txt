I have just completed my online UOP MBA. I had two excellent chances to switch to other online schools, early and midway through the program. My decision to continue with UOP was based on two factors: their texts, assignments and library gave me information I was seeking, and the freedom to study information on my own schedule. I run my own business, need to talk strategy with clients and be familiar, if not fluent in Accounting, Finance and Operations Management to help plan the Human Resources part of strategy and tactics. The people who did not participate on my teams I largely ignored. I edited the papers of people who did not write. Occasionally others would improve my papers, correct my math errors and share sound advice on approach and real-life instances. Not certain the instructors ever caught my complaints about non-participants, nor how others theorizing on others' grades came up with them. I largely ignored the aggravations, read either my assignments or my substitutions, and performed every assignment, the same strategy which got me through my Ivy undergrad education - I'm in it for me. UOP provided me with training in statistics and the Accounting/Finance side of business to the point where I understand discussions on conference calls and can ask reasonable questions and give reasonable opinions that affect HR. Studying texts on my own? Could have done that, but it is important to be certain that what is being studies is current, and the value of discussion with the few strong people in each class and some of the faculty cannot be overstated for comprehension. I'm proud of my MBA, but because of what I put into it - UOP was superb in supplying me with what I needed to make the efforts efficient and worthwhile. UOP online MBA advantages: convenient, state of the art electronic library, helpful technies and for the most part faculty: all the tools you need to educate yourself.
