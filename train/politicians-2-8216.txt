I agree with the observation that most of the other people have made, JFK is overrated. He possessed enormous amounts of charisma, charm, and intelligence. However, his accomplishments as a President are near non-existent. If what you think makes a good President is name recognition, charisma, and impressive speech delivery, perhaps you should nominate, Muhammed Ali he's not doing much these days. Also in response to Marc Chatow's comment that JFK was a great democrat. Maybe next time you should think of a more positive way to describe a person you feel is worthy of five stars. And as far as notebert's statement about the reason JFK didn't act aggresively towards Russia was because he was in WWII and Bush wasn't. One I don't know what Bush who was obviously unable to serve in WWII due to his birthdate has to do with Kennedy's foreign policy. Two, the US never engaged Russia in WWII so I don't understand the correlation unless it was he thought he might start WWIII.
