Many days as I watch the cross-Canada weather, the weather forecaster out of Toronto skips Manitoba entirely. Although there is a segment of Toronto population that refuses to recognize life west of the Great Lakes, we're here! Manitoba is a beautiful province, underrated frequently by those who can only see the lack of large cities. Look a little further -- we have spectacular natural beauty ranging from wide and impressive rivers, many clear unspoiled lakes, miles and miles of dense forest, even a small area of desert. We also have the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, recognized for its excellence around the world; every year Folklorama, a celebration of our many ethnic populations, attracts thousands of visitors; the Winnipeg Folk Festival is one of the best in North America. Our economy has few peaks but also few valleys. It's a good place to live and a good place to visit. Come and check it out for yourself!
