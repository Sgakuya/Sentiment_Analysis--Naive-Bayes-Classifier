W M gets marked down every year for the same reasons: (1) poorly funded by the Commonwealth of Virginia, (2) located in a sleepy town/not a big party school, (3) unable to attract big-name faculty/performing acts, (4) generally easier to get into than an Ivy League school, and (5) generally harder to get an 'A' than at an Ivy League school. Those concerns, though they may be legitimate, should not overshadow all of the things that make W M an outstanding school, a place not just to earn a degree but to receive an education. If you embrace life, have a love for history and tradition, rejoice in academic challenges -- if you are looking for great classes, students, and faculty (some of the top teaching talent in the nation), an administration that cares deeply for the students it strives to serve, and an inspiringly beautiful campus, and if you want to one day end up a well-rounded, marketable, and successful graduate -- you'll not find a school better than the College of William and Mary.
