Every now and then, an actress comes along who, on the strength of a single performance, just blows the MooCow away. Sometimes, as in the case of Selma Blair(Cruel Intentions), it is the sheer force of beauty; udder times, such as Ms. Swank's performance in Boys Don't Cry, it is a revelation of true acting talent. Not only was Ms. Swank udderly cowvincing in a very challenging, and none-too glamorous, role of Teena Brandon, she emparts such a depth of sympathy, pathos, and understanding(not to mention irritation at the character's cowstant irresponsibility), that this Cow would have found it hard to believe if she had not received the Best Actress nod. But she did, and I suppose there is some justice in the world at that. Udder roles Ms. Swank has appeared in have been also good, although not as spellbinding(The Gift, Insomnia, Affair of the Necklace). Ms. Swank is also equally blessed with serious snugglosity - it is hard to imagine she played a gal trying to pass for a guy, and made it work. But she did, and she deserves full accolades. This is one actress for whom the MooCow forsees many good things to come1! :=8D
