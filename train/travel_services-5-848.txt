well i do agree with dan cunningham they do screen all movers they have but he can not controll after he screens the companies that he uses who the company hires sometimes when they screen companies and they show that they are good and then the company that they screen hires crappy people he can not help that he does do all at his power to send the best movers to help. I have delt with moving staffers on SEVERAL move jobs and i have delt with so many customers that used moving staffers and they have allways been pleased. and about the deposits they do state that it is a non refundable payment and about the non english speaking people i can state that they do require that all movers must speak english fluent. and if dan cunningham knew tha a company was sending non english speaking movers he would pull them off their list in a new york second. cause that is in his contracts when movers sign up with them... i know i would recommend them to anyone!
