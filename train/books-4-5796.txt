Once again, I find myself in almost total agreement with Irishgit, although I liked Red Storm Rising more than Hunt for Red October. Cardinal of the Kremlin was also excellent. Some years ago, before Clancy really got to be a mega-author, he came to the DOD organization I worked for and gave a talk. He was fascinating, and pretty unassuming - he said that probably anyone in the audience could write a novel as well as he could (I actually tend to doubt that), but interestingly said that about 20% of his novels he had written up to that time were fact-based, and the other 80% was what he termed fluff. Another couple of interesting points I recall from his talk: First, his inspiration for Red October came from an attempted mutiny by a Soviet destroyer crew some years earlier - think that the mutineers wanted to sail to Sweden and claim asylum. The mutiny failed and, as I recall, they were all executed. The other thing he told us was that when he submitted the manuscript of Red October to the US Naval Institute Press, the editor there read it over, and then said It's a great book. Rewrite it. Apparently, she was not kidding, as Clancy said he had to do an almost total rewrite before USNI Press would publish it.
