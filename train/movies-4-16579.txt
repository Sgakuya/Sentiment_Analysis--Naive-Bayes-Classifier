Very sweet romantic comedy. I laughed, i teared up, i left the theater in an all together cheery mood. A very cool and up beat tale of two people who have a chance meeting in a New York department store and spend a fun filled romantic evening together. It is obvious that these two belong together. our main female believes strongly in fate and tests it a few times to see if they belong together. If it is destiny they will cross paths again. A few years later they are both engaged to be wed and both disinchanted with their partners. The search begins and it is a laugh a minute. Very cute fluff that is much needed in these crazy time. When will destiny set me up?
