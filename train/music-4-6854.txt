I will be the first to admit that this not among one of Ozzy's best efforts. Though come to think of it, even Ozzy's worst is still good, and is still the best music out there. The Album doesn't hold up to a 'Blizzard' or 'Ozzmosis,' but the disc still packs a whallop. After all, the great ZAKK WYLDE is back on guitar (Thank GOD)!! The strongest tracks on this disc are 'Get's Me Through,' and 'Facing Hell.' It's your basic Ozzy stuff: hard crunching guitar songs, some ballads thrown in, and some experimentations. An average attempt for Ozzy. Yet I will state again, what's on the charts now (Britney, Creed, Ludacris) will make this disc look like 'ST. Pepper's' or 'Revolver!'
