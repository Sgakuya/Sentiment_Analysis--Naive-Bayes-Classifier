I agree that this movie falls short on a few things. Like I wish Jimmy's wife could've been developed a little more, and have had a few more clues to the true nature of several of the relationships. Plus the police investigators in this movie were dumber than in any movie I've ever seen. Besides it's flaws, I think this one holds up good as a modern comedy. I think Matthew Perry is superb at physical comedy and is one of the driving forces, but I most of all wish there had been more chemistry between him and Natasha Hendstridge. Amanda Peet is also pretty funny and likeable, and I enjoyed the surprising amount of chemistry between her and Bruce Willis. Of course you get conflicting feelings for Bruce Willis. In the end I was thinking about how Matthew Perry will never know if Bruce might still come after him for no apparent reason.
