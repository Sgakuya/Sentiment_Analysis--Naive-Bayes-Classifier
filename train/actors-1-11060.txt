I actually met Joan Cusack once. I was living in Chicago, and a buddy of mine was dating her sister. A bunch of us were at a bar, and my buddy introduced me to Joan, who had just been to a Bulls/Cavaliers basketball game. I asked her how the game was. She said, Well, it was just the Cavs. At the time, the Cavs were actually a decent team, so I said, Come on - the Cavs are OK. This prompted her to start yelling at me, The Cavs?! The Cavs!? The Cavs!? over and over again. She kept that up for at least a minute. Right when she stopped, my buddy turned to me and whispered, I can't believe Joan Cusak just made you her bitch. So, given that I'm one of Joan Cusak's bitches, my opinion is a little biased. That being said, I don't like her. She simultaneously gives me the willies, the heebie jeebies, and the creeps.
