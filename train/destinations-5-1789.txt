Spout Anti-Semitism, scream about bigotry, shriek your conspiracy theories and prattle on and on about warmongering ... it is all for naught. America is #1 and, quite frankly, it's not even particularly close. For those of you outside of US borders who have chosen to use this forum to berate this nation, be advised that my country is better than yours. And here is a list of reasons why, in no particular order of importance save for the first: 1. Due Process 2. Freedom of Expression (Try burning a national flag in Mexico City, Singapore or Beijing and see how much "tolerance" you are accorded) 3. Blacks (People of African ancestry are rich part of our history and national character, and in the U.S. they enjoy the highest standard of living of blacks to be found anywhere on the planet) 4. Jews (Without the United States' intervention in WWII, there wouldn't be any left. Thanks to the U.S., the group most statistically overrepresented as professionals, scientists, academics and Nobel Prize winners thrives and contributes.) 5. Multiculturalism (There is no greater example of people of different colors, religions, backgrounds, traditions and beliefs peacefully coexisting on a large-scale than in major American cities) 6. We have the NFL - real football. You don't. 7. Charity (America contributes more money to international charity than the next three closest nations combined) 8. Mercy and Decency (After WWII, America played a large role in rebuilding its defeated enemies, Japan and Germany. Today they are two of the strongest and most democratic nations in the world. What would have happened to the U.S. if the Axis had won rather than the Allies?) I could go on, but why? I'm already telling you something you know whether you wish to publicly admit it or not. The United States is the unquestioned and unparalleled superpower of the early 21st century. And thank God for that. The world is a better place for it.
