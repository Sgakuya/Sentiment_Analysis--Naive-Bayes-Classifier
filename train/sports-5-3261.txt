Bob Gibson had the best year (1968) that a pitcher has ever had in modern times. He went only 22-7, but he had an ERA of 1.12. Today, anything below 4 is considered worthy of millions. So, think about it. 1.12!! When he lost 2 straight games that season by scores of 1-0, one of them on an unearned run, he didn't complain. He just said I blew it - I let the other team score first . And, he wasn't just great on the mound - he was an excellent hitter with home run power and one of the best fielding pitchers of his time. After facing him in the 1964 World Series, Mickey Mantle said that one of the scariest things in sports was watching a Bob Gibson fastball go right under your chin, knowing that the next pitch would be right on the outside corner.
