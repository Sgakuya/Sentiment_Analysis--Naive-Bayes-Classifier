I'm usually not a big fan of Tarantino's work, but this was a damn good movie. A woman goes on a bloody spree of revenge after waking from a four-year coma (Edited: Alright, about the storyline: One, it was a Tarantino movie. Two, the title is Kill Bill . Are you really expecting something highly intellectual or philosophical from it? Some extreme mind-blowing revelation? What did you expect?). Excellent fight choreography and cinematography, it's artistically one of the best kung fu movies that I've ever seen. This is truly a live-action anime. The spraying blood had been a bit gratuitous, to the point of being humorous, and there's a key point in the movie where you'll wish you didn't get the super-huge-mega-value drink before the movie (you'll know it when you see it, trust me). I wasn't a big fan of the music, but it's something you either love or hate. Definately worth the $8.50, and already worth the extra $8.50 I'll spend watching vol.2.
