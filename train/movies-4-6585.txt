This was fantastic! A bit hard to follow in some scenes, but overall a brilliant film. The scenery alone would have been worth the entire film, and I don't think John Ford could have found two better suited actors for the leading roles. Only Maureen O'Hara could have been dragged five miles, kicked in the rear, and still walked off exuding that much dignity and grace. John Wayne is also the only man who could have looked manly refusing to fight for his woman. (not to mention drag her five miles, kick her tush and make it look funny instead of shocking!) And I'm with pineywoodsslim on cheering for lack of political correctness...a feautre horribly lacking in today's "don't breathe too heavy, you could offend someone" society.
