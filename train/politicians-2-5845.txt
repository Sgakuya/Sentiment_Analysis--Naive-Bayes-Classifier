What happen to the Americans who want to live their lives free, and not have the government enforcing every politically correct piece of nonsense that comes along on it's citizens. America's real problem is that it citizens have forgetten their duties, and demanded perceived rights that the founders never invisioned. At best all people, of all pursuasions are inconsistent. It doesn't help when we get so blinded by hate, that our thinking boils down to name calling and cursing. It's too bad that this generation of Americans have forgotten the price of freedom and liberty, and are unwilling to think of duty before selfish demanding of 'rights'.
