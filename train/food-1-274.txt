The REGULAR and WHOLE GRAIN CTC are AWESOME! I didn't even notice a difference between the original and the whole grain- probably because the amount of whole grains is negligible... but I digress. I decided to try the less sugar variety because I thought it might actually be as good as the kind with the whole grains, but I was sadly mistaken because the 75% less sugar kind is absolutely HORRID. First off, it tastes stale and has an aftertaste like it's been sitting over someone's stove for the last few months. Second, when you go to slurp that last bit of extra-cinnamony milk when you're done, be prepared for a shock. DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME, KIDS! At the bottom of the bowl, hidden by the milk, there are these crystalline things STUCK to the bowl. They have no taste to speak of, are harder than a rock, and have a slightly slimy texture. GROSS! I am NEVER buying that again- I am perfectly happy with my FULL sugar variety, because at least I know it's NATURAL sugar- God only knows what the crystals are really made of, and what havoc they may one day wreak on my internal organs. I implore of ALL OF YOU to NOT try the 75% less sugar CTC- YUCK!
