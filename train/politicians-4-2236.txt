He leaves the position of Secretary of State as one of the most respected American men in the world, bar none. Attempting to portray his tenure at State as anything less than exemplary is ridiculous. Bulletin: Afghan elections have been held. Bulletin: the Taliban was routed from their position of governmental power in Afghanistan. Bulletin: Saddam HAD weapons of mass destruction (which he deployed in the late 1990's) the disposal of which has never been accounted for, as the UN had stipulated as necessary to prevent further military action. Portraying his speech to the UN regarding the US case for military action against Iraq in early 2003 as anything less than truthful, appropriate and convincing is also ridiculous. Get a transcript of the speech and read it. Tell me one point that you could (even stretching the truth) call less than accurate, based on the facts known before the invasion. Bulletin: Iraqi elections are about to be held. Point out a Secretary of State with more positive global accomplishments in a four year tenure than Powell's. And, should we not consider the use of the term Uncle Tom in reference to a black man as the literary equivalent of using the N word to refer to him, which would be objected to roundly and removed from our posts?
