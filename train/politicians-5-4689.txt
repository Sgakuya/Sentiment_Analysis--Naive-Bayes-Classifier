Dick Cheney is just plain cool. I like this guy a lot. Finally, we are getting back to the issues at hand and forgetting about Monica Lewinsky. Bush and Cheney have brought integrity, dignity and respect back to Washington, something that has been lacking for the last 8 years. Who cares about his voting record back in the 80's? I am only concerned with the present, and what the current administration is doing in the PRESENT. Cheney is very well-spoken, his voice is calm and soothing and he invokes common sense and good judgement. Bush is all the better for having someone like Dick Cheney as his second in command.
