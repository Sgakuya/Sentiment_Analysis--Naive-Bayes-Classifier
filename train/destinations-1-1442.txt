First of all I take offense to calling all people who dislike France a hick or redneck. I have a Masters degree in engineering and I dislike them. It's called having an opinion. There is still free speech in America despite the efforts of you select few who want to see that abolished. My feelings have nothing to do with the Iraq situation, I actually respect the French for their stand to a degree. I just do not like their arrogance,and yes it is there, I find it silly. Pardon me for not using a more intelligent word for all you geniouses on here, I find them also to be creepy. Little things....American cyclist Lance Armstrong who survived and fought against cancer , being booed in a race in France. The French judge in the Winter Olympics who was bribed and changed her vote,which caused a far superior Canadian team to lose.. and lastly the desecration of American servicemans' graves in France, now that may be one of the sickest things done. Yes I know that was done by a select few and does not reflect the whole country. I have a French friend, a professor at our university here, who agrees with me. Even other Europeans dislike them. Please give me one contribution this country has given to the world in the last 100 years? And again I do not hate them, I just find them irrelevent. You have the British who are stubborn, funny, survivors. The Germans are strong, intelligent, hard-workers. The Italians... passionate, friendly, fun. Then you have the French....who are....how can I say..French.
