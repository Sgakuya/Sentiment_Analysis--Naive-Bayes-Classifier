Spokane is a small city that has really had some bad times in the past. After the mining industries collapsed in the 80's the unemployment rate was around 13%. Since then things have gotten better, but have a ways to go. The downtown is very good for such a small city, but it does not compare with anything big of course. As a young person I find many opportunities to bring change to the city. Currently (August 2004) we have below national average unemployment rates and are rated as the best city in Washington to do business by Forbes. There's no doubt that rural visitors from outlying areas aren't very sophisticated or cultured, but that's not who I see in my day-to-day life. Living downtown is a whole different experience I guess. The natural beauty is excellent as well.
