I chose to transfer to USC from a small liberal arts school in the midwest because I wanted a large-sized school with great business and liberal arts schools, a beautiful campus, lots of school spirit, and a convenient location (Columbia airport nearby, Charleston an hour drive.) Some may have something against the city of Columbia, but they must understand how historic it really is (most of the original buildings are more than two hundred years old.) Most negative comments about the school are probably Clemsonians, anyway. If you're looking for a large, southern, historic university, than USC is right for you. Go gamecocks!
