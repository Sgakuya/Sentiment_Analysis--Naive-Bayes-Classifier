Denver is one of the cleanest cities I have seen in the US! The nightlife is awesome whether you like to dance, drink, see a live band or see a stand up comedian. The winters are mild with plenty of sunshine, but enough snow to get some fresh powder at many of Colorado's great Ski Resorts. There are many quality resturaunts as well as great places to shop. Try the 16th street mall or Cherry Creek Mall! The sunsets over the mountain range are amazing from a high rise loft or hotel room. Cath a game as Denver has many great sports teams from the Avs to the Broncos, with three newer stadiums. There are 2 waterparks, a Six Flags, several Musuems, plenty of art galleries, historic landmarks, Red Rocks amplitheatre, a large aquarium, and plenty of job opportunities. The people are down to earth and very friendly! I love this city and I wouldnt choose to live anywhere else in the world.
