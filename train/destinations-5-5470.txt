Since moving to this state decades ago- I have found the people to be reserved but genuine. There is much in the way of amentities for those of all age groups- and a highly intelligent populace that is sophisticated and tolerant. As far as being 'left wing' the people of this small state seem to have had the right idea in 2000 and 2004 when they did not vote for the disastrous policies of Bush and the republican far right. And in the near future there will be more to pay in the economic follies of GW Bush- in any case.. If you want wide open spaces move to Wyoming or Montana- and live with the Zenophobes in those hell holes.
