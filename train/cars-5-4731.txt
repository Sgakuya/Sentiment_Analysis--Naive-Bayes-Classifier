2003 Ranger, 4.0l, 5spd, 4.10 limited slip diffs, 32" TSLs, Flowmaster. 16 miles per gallon. Off road weekly, and intensly (with jeeps on 33"+ and lockers) That being said, this truck is the best vehicle I've ever owned, it has plenty of power, comfortable, nice interior, and is very fun to drive, I now have approx 44,000 miles on it, and have had it for about 1 year. I use my truck for everything from going out partying in, to moving, to wheeling, to daily driving. The only things I don't like are the low gas mileage, but I drive hard. Also the fact that the front axle does not articulate, and that I've gone through 3 fan clutches so far, also replaced the slave cylinder at 35,000 miles. I have now power accessories, other than steering, and Air conditioning. This truck is the best of 5 rangers I've owned (I've owned 83,86,88,90,03) and I would never think of getting rid of it as it gets plenty of comments, can waste a honda in a street race, and still schools Jeeps and Hummers offroad, and its pretty enough to get the ladies' attention. I am stationed in Arkansas, but also have had this truck in Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Tennessee, and the truck has hauled and passed through all those states and various weather conditions (115 degrees to -35 degrees and a blizzard) and never had any problems, it does get squirrley on ice and wet asphalt though
