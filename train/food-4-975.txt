I'd give it 4 stars if GM hadn't changed the recipe somewhere along the line. I remember having these for the first time about 7 years ago or so and they were awesome, really tasted like cookies. Now, they're not bad but...they're just not as good anymore. It's mostly sweetness without real taste, the genuine cookie-like taste is gone unfortunately. They're still good once in a while, in moderation, one or two boxes a year is enough not to get sick of them. I had them again (almost a year later) and they now taste really good. I don't know what changed, maybe its the new no trans-fat regulations or something but they are way better than last year.
