Well after reading most of the comments here, I will say that I am even more afraid to start "UOP" as everyone here is calling it. I don't have any degree's just a high school diploma but have been fortunate enough throuout my work years to have really great jobs with high incomes and still have one of those jobs today. But for my own personal reason's I really want to go back to school and receive a degree. I've been speaking with this one counselor for several month's now from UOP and he calls me once or twice a week to know if I am still going to enroll in the classes for "Associate of Arts in Business"? I tell him yes but inside I am saying ?????? because I have been burned before by a so called "training school" that made several promises for the job market today in the Medical Field with hard work and your diploma/certificate. But I got nothing in the end, but smart mouth teacher's, a letter to pay for my own Graduation and a bill to receive my Diploma. Thank God I got I already had a great job at Kaiser Permanente Medical Facility, because without my own great attitute, common sense, self motivation and hard work, I dought if that school would have helped me and I just don't want to go through it again. Don't get me wrong, I know that some things and places are what you make it but If I am paying for it, I want it to pay off, and not just get the money and run. Quick story in regards to the school I went to for that Medical Diploma, while on my job at the Hospital, I decided to tell the school that I needed them to fax over my resume for a position at the Hospital without letting them know I already worked there. Because this was one of the schools requirements to help the students find medical positions, well can you believe that the school faxed over 35 resumes of other students and not one was mine. Can you believe that? and I still owe Citibank student loans today. Now who wants to get burned again??
