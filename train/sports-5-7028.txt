Naming the heirarchy of Basketball's greats is a fine art. And let's face it, most fan-addicts don't know the art. They are ruled by blind impulse, pure sentiment, or dumb computer logic. Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson unquestionably are numbered among the NBA Elite. But Michael Jordan is the Elite of the Elite. He stands above the rest not only for leading the Bulls to six championships, but for the way he led them. He is, by far, the greatest clutch player and competitor in NBA history, if not in all of professional sports. No other player has inspired and instilled a greater passion for the game of basketball, and certainly no player embodies the game better than Michael Jordan. A star of greater stature may yet emerge, but he is presently nowhere to be found.
