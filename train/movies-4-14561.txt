I do agree with most of the critics that say Cast Away- even though it is was high on my list for suspense, is most likely to appeal to those that believe Robinson Crusoe does exist. Sure it was exhilariting...an adventure...and sometimes funny...and Wilson deserves the Oscar! But it had a great opportunity to expand on the human condition- that there is survival and there is living. And this is where Cast Away could have delivered the punch- the message- that 'things' are just that, things, and that care of time ( 'don't turn your back on time') is for eternity. Too much analysis of the content can sometimes spoil the adventure of any movie but all in all I do believe that when one takes care of 'time'- friendship, family, personal beliefs, self, one lives and just doesn't survive. Tom Hanks came around to this at the end- we need to see how he now learns to live in his world with this new knowledge.
