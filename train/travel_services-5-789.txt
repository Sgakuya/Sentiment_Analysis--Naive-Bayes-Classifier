Probably the best Mass Transit System in the USA. it's rather new ( started in the late 60's) so the stops are newer, modern and the cars are newer than in many other cities. Still this system is excellent. The rides are smooth. They run frequently and usually show up on time. The cars are so clean, they can afford to use carpeting in them. Air Conditioning is set just right in the summer. Goes just where you need to and the maps/descriptions on where to go are simple and effective. Even tourists can use The Metro with little trouble. Little problems include getting mixed up at times on which side to go to when train approaches, using cards for Metro sucks because it's a paper card that can get damaged. Doesnt run 24 hrs a day.
