Shortly before The Flintstones premiered on the ABC Television Network, a new comic strip made its debut in the funnies of some papers. The only thing Johnny's Hart's B.C. needed for his vision of the age of stone was modern life, not The Honeymooners. There are those times when the strip goes a little too far when it comes to being the modern stone age. Religion (Christianity in particular) sometimes takes part in the story, which can be very unusual to some readers considering the comic's name (BC: Before Christ). Since B.C. is meant to be a parody of modern life & society, religion must apply as well. Besides, there is a character named B.C. that appears once in a while, along with a certain Johnny (an ant). Don't let the religious themes get to y'all, it's all part of Hart's depiction of our world today.
