Suck-o! I went there for the $50 bonus and have more than paid for it. What a screw job. This bank/cc is the most inept I have been at, especially the cc. One creditor kept pestering me that my card hadn't been paid when I knew it had and Bank One said they had the check to prove it. It was one of their promotions where if I rolled over my balance from the other card I would get a lower rate. Great, right? As it turned out and nearly a year of my jumping through hoops-neither bank would help out-I discovered the promotional check, written to the other cc, got processed by Bank One's processing group rather than by the other creditor. It was illegal as it wasn't written to Bank One in the first place, but my credit was in question because the other cc wanted me to pay them all along. They were right as it turned out and Bank One hadn't paid them as they said. My latest fiasco is when I asked a branch manager to wire transfer money from a mutual fund. It was over $5000, so a deposit would take longer for some reason. I wanted it done quickly and she suggested I withdraw money from my cc and move it to my checking account while the other was being deposited. It would only be a few dollars in interest if I paid it off soon, as I planned, so I did it. When my statement arrived, there was a $100 fee for a cash advance! This was never discussed and if it had the transaction wouldn't have occurred. So not only did I pay for the wire transfer and interest, but a $50 fee (they did credit me $50 for their mistake, but should have given it all back) on top of that. These people are truly screwups of the worst kind. Even when they know they are wrong they do nothing to compensate you fairly. If you are at all enticed to get an Amazon cc think twice. Bank One is responsible for it as well and it is linked to their cc so there is bound to be hell to pay.
