Good movie. Rather depressing though. Is there any goodness in humanity? Obviously not in this pessimistic look at L.A. narcotics cops. As far as this movie stands they are all evil and blood hungry. Except for those few rookie white guys. This is not a racial movie. However, it is driven by the exceptional and award worthy performance by Denzel Washington. This man gives a groundbreaking performance as the sick and twisted head of the L.A. narcotics unit. What an actor! If he is not nominated I will personally bitch slap each and every member of the academy. Ethan Hawk is so-so as usual. He does his best and you really feel for the guy. Ethan Hawk is the audience incarnate in this film. What a great copper! Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray and Dr.Dre (in order of apperance) give surprisingly comendable performances proving them to be not just names to add to the film but real talents worthy of screen time and our attention. Training Day is Recommended. Just don't let the negative look at life bring you down. Just watch the great film making and superb performance and keep reminding yourself, people aren't that bad all over. Makes you appriciate the good cops a hell of alot.
