Just in LA on business a few months ago. Here is my take. It is REALLY smoggy, and I lived in Houston, so I know what smog is. I was surprised at how physically large the city is, again like Houston. Lots and lots of cheap looking houses with discolored palm trees. Venice Beach was by far the most interesting place I saw while there. Pasadena is a good side trip for you, with the Playhouse and all that. The weather while I was there was typical apparently:hazy sunshine and temp's in 70's. Hollywood was really a big letdown, much less glamorous than portrayed on TV . The UCLA campus is gorgeous, as is Beverly Hills. LA actually has a fairly convenient subway/light rail system .LA also has a really vibrant restaurant scene, with amazing quantity and quality. To sum, LA has drawbacks clearly, and I would not want to live there, but to visit, it is pretty good. It is a unique place, which is what you want in a place you visit.
