One of the greatest politicians of our time. He is brilliant and ideologically sound, the only one willing to keep talks going during the UN security council roundtables. He was a great general, and a helluva better soldier than the hero of Vietnam, our John Kerry. The people who post on this forum should pick up a history or political science article or book before they begin the age old rhetoric of WMD. They were used in the 1990s and Clinton had bombed the hell out of Iraq for it. Also, please be advised that the new 9/11 commission (bipartisan i might add) has said that the administration was not pushing the intelligence community, and was informed by the british, russians, and our own that the weapons were there. Colin Powell did the right thing and did it with a much more respectable and intelligent discourse than a future would be president Kerry could.
