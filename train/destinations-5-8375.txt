I am 29 years old and was born 14 years after Sun Studio closed its doors. I was weary that this tour would be Elvis overload. However, I had goosebumps standing in that studio hearing the stories and original recordings! From the birth of Rock and Roll with the newspaper filled amp to Johnny Cash taping the dollar bill under the guitar strings for percussion effect...it was amazing! And to know that U2 recorded some songs there and Jerry Lee Lewis recorded there just a couple weeks ago was amazing! The old equipment and the original office furniture was recognizable from the movie Great Balls Of Fire . It was a very small place but not at all disappointing!
