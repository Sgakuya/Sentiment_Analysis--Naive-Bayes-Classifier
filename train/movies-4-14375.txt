FOLLOW UP -- Regarding one of the recent above posts that is somewhat misleading...while the sex scenes in REQ are far too short and few , there is quality nudity (you'll just have to frame by frame it at home via DVD come January) and while we all have differing views , I certainly felt this movie was about about two classic vices, SEX and ADDICTION not love whatsoever...if the male lead actor had any love for his mother he wouldn't have chosen the dead end road toward being a junkie !! The impression most presented in REQ is also how girls can use SEX as a weapon for a variety of needs and wants i.e MORE DRUGS. In retro and now having seen it a second time, I would've liked to have seen also more of the flaky game show host perhaps as a connection by which Jennifer C. could score with him to get more drugs. The stereotype of negroes always being the kingpins while it has a level of accuracy to it, has in fact become quiet stale. I still wish the vegematic choppy edits could have slowed down for at least one sex scene with Jennifer C. I am by no means one of those spoiled (buy em a new car for high school graduation) rich kids, I paid good money and expected to see a lot more sex and nudity from an independent film like this, and yes the dissapointment still lingers.
