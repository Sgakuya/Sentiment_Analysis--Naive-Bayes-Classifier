One of the best fantasy series written, the Lord of the Rings teaches good and evil to everyone. Most people, including me, only picked up the book after the first movie came out, but now they can't but it down. As an action adventure novel, the Lord of the Rings takes you on a dangerous quest to destroy a Ring of Power. Tolkien sends 9 companions on the journey. Each of the characters in the fellowship contributes something to the quest to destroy the ring. Tolkien does a fantastic job giving the characters their own personalities, and developing them for the future books in the series. My favorite characters include, Aragorn, and Legolas. Both of these characters help to make the Lord of the Rings possible to believe. Enjoy reading it! I know I did.
