this movie left me with some strong feelings after i'd finished watching it, which i think is always a hallmark of great art. i think if a few of its minor flaws had been corrected, it would have been a perfect film. first, some of the lines malkovitch delivers when it's clear he has finally gone around the bend sound a bit like mike meyers's dieter character from his sprockets saturday night live sketch. this movie is the opposite in that sense of art-house vampire films like the addiction because it delivers big time on the atmosphere that you want, with none of the silly pretention, except in that case. second, dafoe gets a bit overwhelmed by the nosferatu at a couple points, as you'd have to imagine any actor playing it would. his body language and his vocal inflections are thoroughly perfect, but at some of the creature's more sorrowful moments, his facial emotions seem to be flying a bit out of control. his eyes stay forced open until they become unintentionally comical, and his lips quiver a little too much. i have to say though that this is probably his best work, and that he really surprised me, though i had a high estimation of him beforehand. when he gives the speech about dracula to the two drunks at the campfire, he steals the movie. his final pose is also memorable. all in all, the timing of the revelations was a little strange. i never got as much exposition as i wanted when i wanted it, and that was only intentional on the filmmakers' part in the beginning. it's as though the story overwhelmed all its messengers, to some small degree. worth seeing. rent nosferatu too, and watch it afterwards.
