See's chocolates are my favorite. They are high in quality and reasonably priced. The standard box of assorted chocolates contains a wide variety of fresh-tasting, rich, decadent candy. My favorites include the Scotchmallow (dark chocolate encasing layers of caramel and marshmallow), the Key lime truffle, and the polar bear paw (caramel and peanuts covered with white chocolate). I like the no-nonsense approach at See's stores- no fancy packaging, no fancy displays. I assume the money goes into the candy instead of being wasted on image creation. The salespeople are extremely friendly, and they are generous with their free samples. If I lived closer to a See's store, I'd be in serious trouble.
