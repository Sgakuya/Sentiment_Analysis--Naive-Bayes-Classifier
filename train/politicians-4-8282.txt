Deserves great respect for being one of the founders of the US. As President he also stood up to some extent against the extreme Federalist tendencies of the times (despite being one himself), although not nearly enough. The Alien and Sedition acts were inexcusable, but he didn't personally iniate them, just failed to fight them enough. And he failed to enact the key reforms on tariffs, slavery, native American rights, and the right to property that would have led to a genuinely free country and prevented the future problems that blighted 19th century US history. I give him 3 stars as president (1 knocked off for the Alien/Sedition acts, another for no real reforms to ensure universal liberty), and an extra star for being a founding father.
