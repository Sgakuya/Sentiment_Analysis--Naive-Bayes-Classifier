The most passionate argument in all of sports has to be, Who is the greatest baseball player of all time? However, 9 out of 10 times, no matter how low brow or high brow the analysis, The Fat Man always comes out on top. I would pick the Babe as the greatest ever for 4 reasons: 1) Had he not went into the outfield, he was on track for being a Hall of Fame caliber picture. He still has one of the best winning percentages for a pitcher (.671) and one of the lowest ERAs (0.87) in World Series play. 2) The magnitude of his batting statistics, while still awesome today, were beyond comprehension in his day. I won't list them all; but I will mention that he still holds the all-time record for Runs scored in a season (post-1900 era), with 177 in 1921. 3) Wherever he went, teams won. He garnered 3 World Series Titles with Boston and 4 more with the Yankees (who never even went to a Fall Classic until Ruth's arrival). Ruth, of course, factored in many of these victories. 4) His combination of athleticism and off-field antics has made him something of a mythological hero. The Called Shot, his alledged ability to party all night and go out and hit 3 homers the next morning, his nicknames like Bambino and Sultan of Swat, and the fact that they even coined a word after him, Ruthian (for prodigious), are examples of how an ordinary ballplayer achieves legend status. The only knock I got on him is that he played in an era where there were no Black ballplayers, but that was not within his control. Barry Bonds presents a chllenge to Ruth's hold as the greatest ballplayer ever. But how many Series' rings does Bonds have. Ruth is the Greatest of All Time and All Sports
