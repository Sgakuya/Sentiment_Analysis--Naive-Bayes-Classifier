Coach Nutt is the second best SEC active coach right now. Second only to Fat Fulmer, who nonetheless, has a lot more to work with than Houston and is doing crappy this year. Firing a man that has his heart and soul into the state and team; his motivation; recruiting has been better than any other Arkansas coach during the SEC era; and his offensive play-calling may not be the greatest but if you look at are offensive stats under his 8 years as coach you will find out that the offense has produced great numbers. He has had 3 9 win seasons, been to a bowl game 6 outta 8 years, and beat Texas two outta 3 times we played them. Once in the cotton bowl, the hogs blew them out in 2001, then in Austin we spanked the #4 Longhorns agains, and the lone lost came in Fayetteville 22-20, while Matt Jones fumbled on the 8-yd line, and a field goal would of sealed the game. He has done so much for this state, it's just that Little Rock schould be the home of the Hogs, not Fayetteville--fans suck up there. And I am a relative of the Nutt family, and with my season tickets I have witnessed the worst fans in Arkansas history in Fayetteville, but not in LR. Every coach has rough years, but the Hogs were never even on the map till Nutt got there. So just wait and see when this blows over, and Houston wins again, after only 2 down years outta 8.
