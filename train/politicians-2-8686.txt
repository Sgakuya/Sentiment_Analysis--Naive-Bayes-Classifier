This might be common knowledge, but we believe that repetition brings true knowledge, so please bear with us. Polk was the forerunner of the communistic party. Prior to running for president he advocated a new social class he wanted to call dukes of polk , but was stopped by the early peta and retired homeowners association. He was so mad he became a radical republican and joined the crazy fascist/minimalist/socialist weekend retreat in Waco, Texas. This was his prime reason for acquiring texas. He brought with him his sudanese mistress and practiced mormonism with numerous inuit wives. The legacy he left is quite a debacle in itself. On another note, he holds several patents for the milking of sheared black sheep.
