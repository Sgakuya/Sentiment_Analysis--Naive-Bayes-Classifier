I think Best Buy has excellent customer service equal to Sears Robuck. They have reasonably priced extended warranties. My computer was priced the lowest compared to competitors, and i recieved all of my rebates. A couple of the salesman in the computer area were dopeheads, but most were pretty knowledgable. I only wanted to give the knowledgable salesmen the credit for my sale. I purchased a refrigerator from Best Buy three years ago, and the salesman made a mistake when we purchased our extended warranty. He gave us the top of the line warranty compared to the cheaper warranty for the same price! He could not change the mistake.
