I was smoking Marlboro Menthols before I tried blend 27s, and I dropped those fiberglass filled bastards at the first puff of these awesome cigs. The taste is very rich and different, yet it is also mellow and smooth. It's somewhat nutty and similar to the lights. They are also, in my opinion the best smelling cigarette, too. These are not for everyone, though. A friend of mine, who was also trying them for the first time, began to spit up. (Not because they were strong, but because they tasted nasty to him.) The guy I bummed them off of had luke-warm results and said he preferred lights. They are my favorite smoke anyway, and I highly reccomend them to people who like a unique flavor.
