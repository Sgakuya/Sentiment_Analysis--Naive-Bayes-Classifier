Should be a 5, but I'm off-setting all the people that have over-rated him. Barry Sanders had incredible moves and was one of the best ever, but not even the best of his time. He was a home-run runningback. He was not consistent on his carries and did not follow his blockers like a runningback should. He'd have occasional HUGE carries after several losses, and that would all even out to a good average and total. He didn't block, he wasn't an every-down back and his coaches didn't trust him inside. He was a one-trick pony, though with a GREAT trick. Most importantly, he lacked heart and was a quitter. Look at him as the most electric runningback of all time. Not the best.
