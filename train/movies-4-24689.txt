Hollow Man is a perfect movie to rent. The four stars is based upon renting it (I don't think I would have felt the same if I had paid $8 and motivated to the theater to see it). It stars Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue who are two actors I enjoy. The plot is based on a group of scientists who are trying to make someone invisible and (this is the challenging part) to then make them visible again and in one piece with no complications. They had tried on animals and then Bacon's ego gets involved and wants to be the first person to be invisible. Well, as I am sure you guessed, he gets a little too excited about being invisible. The other scientists have to try and capture Bacon but it is pretty difficult since he is, well, invisible. The special effects were impressive, I thought. The acting was okay. The plot has been done before but this one had some unexpecting turns. It is just a perfect movie to rent.
