Being a native of this cesspool, I have to say on the most there are reasonable, educated people in this state, but they are few and far between. The friendlyness outsiders encounter is a farce, once you attempt to interact with these for the most part, bible thumping, lowbrow, drunken hicks things change,rumors build, hostilities grow out of nothing, unless they think they may benefit from being associated with you. It makes me sick to my stomach when i read how lovely, nice (insert flowery description here) the people are knowing and expierencing the total opposite for over 20 years of living with these lovely degenrates that have no goals of growing with the rest of the world but living in the past, then wondering why they get the negative publicity they do.so sure the scenery is beautiful (at certian times of the year when they leaves are covering the beer cans, garbage and abandoned vehicles). The scenery hides an awful truth.
