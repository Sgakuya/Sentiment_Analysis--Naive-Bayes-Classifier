Since this has just become a forum for criticizing America, I'll follow suit. America is a country of intense history and massive potential that is often way too hard on itself. I'd like to address GoneAway's message by saying that America does NOT lead the world in any of the categories listed. The Czech Republic is the world's pornography capital. European nations, and especially Russia, far surpass America in alcohol use. Teen pregnancy is vastly more rampant in African countries. You come to these conclusions because of what you read in the news, but you fail to factor in that EVERY country has their own dirt. America is imperfect...in fact, the only reason I gave it five stars is because I think it deserves a much higher rank. But so is every other country. And America has the good fortune of being so large that it is among the most diverse nations on earth -- each one of the 50 states has a different terrain, different culture, even a different accent. If you're going to take a stab at America, you best do it state by state, or better yet city by city, or even better...PERSON BY PERSON. Like a celebrity in the spotlight, America's actions are always under a close watch and a wary eye. And, I believe, because of that, it is deemed a mess by others who ought to be checking out the plank in their own eye. Sorry if this was long-winded, but I have a very strong opinion on this matter for a seventeen-year-old.
