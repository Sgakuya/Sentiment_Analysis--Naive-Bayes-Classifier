Dennis Hastert plays go-along to get along. He seems to be a nice guy, but methinks a former high-school wrestling coach serving as Speaker of the House seems a bit apropo, nicht wahr? Hastert is a glad-handler who seems to enjoy relaxing on the patterned-daisy davenport after a hard day's work mowing the lawn on his John Deere E-Z Rider in his black knee-hi's and white converse stained chlorophyll-green, half-listening to the Cubbies or ChiSox game on his 1965 brown Zenith transistor whilst quaffing a few with his Midwestern cohorts from the Illinois cornfields, every so often tuning the dial to hear Springsteen belt out Glory Days or John Cougar (Mellencamp) rasp Jack and Diane or Small Town. Just my own observation. He certainly is brighter than Dubya and most Re-smug-licans currently in power. Hastert hasn't seemed to have really done much of anything significant in the House aside from being seen talking to Dubya and swigging a few glasses of ice water from his Speaker podium. At least he is no Newtie-baby, and for that I am thankful.
