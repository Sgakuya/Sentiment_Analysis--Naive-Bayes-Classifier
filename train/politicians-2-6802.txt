Oliver Cromwell must have been just like this guy. He ran for President back in 2000 on a religious platform. Bauer worked for Focus on the Family, a group who essentially wants to legislate a dogmatic type of morality. Bauer is the type who like to push a certain brand of Christianity up people's throats and that's simply the wrong way to minister to people. I don't believe that morality should be legislated. Law and government should have a fundamental core based on ethical values, but it should take into account other views as well. Both the left and the right are way too interested in legislating secular values and religion respectively. The result of all this is a farcical culture war that this completely unnecessary in my view. There are common sense solutions to issues like gay rights, school prayer and abortion. The problem is that people aren't willing to be reasonable on these issues. Bauer's views represented the Religious Right within the Republican party which has been growing stronger over the past few years, probably because of the inclusion of the South into the parties electoral coalition. Of course, there were issues with Bauer's campaign style. When challenged, he would take it personal, not a way to win votes exactly. It doesn't help that he has zero charisma and a complete inability to connect with his audiences.
