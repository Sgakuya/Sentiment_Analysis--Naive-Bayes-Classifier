The mass dismissal of commissioned sales counselors by Circuit City on 2/5/03 serves as a death knell for this stinking shell of a company. Yes, the sales counselors were oftimes pushy and arrogant, but this was the result of a constant bombardment of training . Furthermore, the constant harping to make budgets (esp. accessories--cables and Performance Guarrantees ) resulted in regular threats to their jobs. All of this combined in a deliterious fashion to lead the Company to where it is today. If you like the idea of spending your hard-earned money with a company that values belligerancy and belittling of its staff, then Circuit City is your kind of store. If you wish to spend your money with SALES HELP that cares only about selling volume, then Circuit City is for you. As for me, where's the nearest Best Buy?
