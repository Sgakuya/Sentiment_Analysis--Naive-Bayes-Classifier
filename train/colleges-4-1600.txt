You might not get want you want, here. But you sure as hell get what you need. 4.0gpa high school students will make great 2.5 gpa graduates (just tell any prospective employer you got above a 2.0 & they'll tell you 'Oh, that's like an 'A' anywhere else). The campus used to be like an island between 'crack-villages'. Today, I think it's got better living & more to do. But if you aren't on the conservative-side & want to enjoy your college years - don't go to this school. The academics are great - the lifestyle kinda sucked. Go to Univ of FLA, it's got a pretty good engineering/ architecture program + you'll get laid more. Your Bud: George P. Burdell.
