I recently purchased a 2001 RAV4 with 4WD and the Limited package. I was interested in a small, fun to drive SUV that would handle like a car, but could also be used off-road and in bad weather. I do a lot of camping and 4 wheel drive is a must. I originally was going to purchase a Honda CRV and test drove a 2000 model, but I'm glad I waited for the new 2001 RAV4. Styling was what originally caught my eye, and the new RAV is gorgeous. It reminds me of the Lexus RX300. The whole package looks very refined inside and out. I love the interior and the console controls are very well laid out. The radio sits above the climate controls which I find much more convenient than traditional configurations. Lots of compartments for extra storage including cup holders for all passengers. Power locks/windows and keyless entry are nice features. The L package also includes privacy glass on the rear windows, floor/cargo mats, a solid spare tire cover, and a tape/CD player. The heated side view mirrors are very handy on those cold morinings. I also opted for the power moon roof, rear spoiler, and roof rack and I'm glad I did. I'm very impressed with the solid feel of the new RAV. Handling and breaking are excellent. Shifting is effortless and the short throws of the gear lever are like a sports car. Acceleration (although not stellar) is adequate for my needs. The 4 cylinder motor gets great mileage. Toyota fit and finish are evident everywhere on this SUV and I look forward to many years of trouble free driving. If you're considering a small SUV I would highly recommend at least a test drive in the new 2001 RAV4.
