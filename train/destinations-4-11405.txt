One of the few National Parks in the East, Acadia is a wonderful stronghold of rugged wilderness located along the northeastern coast of Maine. Because it was originally a playground for the ludicrously rich of the early 20th century, Acadia was preserved by their desire to keep this haven to themselves and eventually passed on to the public. A breathtaking combination of rugged, mountainous terrain with the cold Atlantic ocean. Summer is the most popular season with warm days and cool nights, Acadian summers make for some ideal camping..not too hot during the day and cool enough to keep you from sweating in your tent at night. Fresh seafood is everywhere, and the town of Bar Harbor is a quaint little town with pubs and shops that make you want to live there..that is until winter.
