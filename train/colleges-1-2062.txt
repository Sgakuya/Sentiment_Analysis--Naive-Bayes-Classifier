I'm rewriting my review, I have many bitter memories of my horrible four years here. Where do I start, the snotty people, the lack of hellos and good mornings, the incredible overestimation everyone had of their intelligence, the North Face jackets, the wacky far-left liberalism...whatever the case, I hated the people there. They gave you reasons every time you took the bus or walked onto campus, almost everyone here is suffering from some mental disorder of some kind. It's definitely not as bad as NYC, but I can say it comes very close. The alleged intellectual advantage of this university is nil when you factor in the people. People here just aren't human. I don't know if it's the extreme wealth or the dissociation from reality, but it really turns people off!
