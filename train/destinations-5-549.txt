PUERTO RICO, PUERTO RICO ISLAND OF ENCHANTMENT: AS A SPANISH AMERICAN I CAN SAY PUERTO RICO IS BEATIFUL, REGARDLESS OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE EVERYWHERE WE GO PEOPLE ARE RUDE ESPECIALLY IN AMERICA. SECOND OF ALL IF YOU ARE GOIGN ON VACATION TO PUERTO RICO YOU MUST GO WITH MONEY IT IS A VACATION RIGHT? I RENTED A ROOM FOR $190 A NIGHT AND IT WAS BEATIFUL WITH THE OCEAN'S VIEW. I ALSO RENTED A CAR FOR $50 A DAY WITH UNLIMITED MILEAGE. I PREVIOUSLY LIVED IN PUERTO RICO WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I KNOW WHAT RESOURCES TO GO TO WHEN IT'S TIME FOR ME TO HAVE FUN A NIGHT OUT ON THE BEACH, SURFING,VIEWING THE ARTS,GOOD FOOD. PUERTO RICO IS A BEATIFUL COUNTRY TO ENJOY AND HAVE FUN AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT FOR YOURSELF. SO IF YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND OR ENJOY YOUR VACATION I DONT THINK PUERTO RICO IS THE PLACE FOR YOU, SO DONT CRITICIZE. LOVEPR
