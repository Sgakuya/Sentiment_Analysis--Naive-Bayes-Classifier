The reviewer who says its the cleanest place ever...have you been here? Anyone who has lived or visited Taipei will agree some places seem fairly clean but some places are just dirty. The air is never clean...unless you go to the mountains. Food is everywhere, good and cheap. My favorite places in Taipei are Shi Lin nightmarket, Hsi Men ding and Snake Alley area...the people there are kind of weird though. The people are generally nice but I have seen some violence from a gang before. It has all the problems of a modern city but they are much smaller than most cities. The mayor Ma Ying Jeou has really improved Taipei. You have to look to see the true beauty of Taipei, people who says its just a boring dirty place aren't looking hard enough.
