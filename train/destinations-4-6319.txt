I was actually impressed w/ this state and Ohioans. I'm live and work in Kansas City, and had to work a week in Cleveland, and in February. It was a bit cold even cold than KC, but I'm used to it. The people of Ohio are actually pretty cool. I didn't run into one rude person during my week long stay. My fiance drove up from Washington DC, and even commented that the toll booth operators were friendly. It's a bit cold in Ohio, esp during the winter months...but that should be expected since Lake Erie is right next door and they get the cold air sweeping off that, plus lake effect snow. People of Ohio should be proud.
