NO ONE BETTER!!! 2 national championships. Over 700 wins. Has dominated the BIG EAST. Note, the impressive thing about his recruiting ability is not just that he gets top players-but that he spots players who are not highly ranked--and develops them into elite players--e.g. Emeka Okafor #98 high school senior on Rivals and non-ranked on most lists--Scott Burrell-not-ranked--Ray Allen--only top 30-now NBA superstar, and it goes on. Will likely finish with 800+ wins and two more final fours. THE BEST NBA legacy for a college coach--put together the ten (yes TEN) UCONN players in the NBA and you have yourself a legitimate playoff team--just on pure talent--the team may have too strange of a make up to be practical e.g. only one pure point guard-- but you know what I mean.
