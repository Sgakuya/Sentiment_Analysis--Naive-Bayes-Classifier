I admit to having TV dinner night once in a while, a hit with the kids, easy preparation and clean up for me and my husband. For a while, I went on the breaded pork chop dinner kit..very tasy, they package the gravy separately and give you plenty to top the mashed potatoes and pork chop. Also, the mixed vegetables actually taste like vegetables..the carrots, believe it or not taste like carrots, even when mixed with the broccoli..which, get this, tastes like broccoli..a rarity in the land of frozen meals. Also, I am a big fan of the Chicken Pot Pie (not the one with Mushroom gravy)..the veggies, again, taste like veggies, the meat appears to be actual white chicken meat, the crust is flaky without being dry and the gravy is tasty. Overall, probably the best frozen meals I have come across.
