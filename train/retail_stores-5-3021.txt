I am very pleased with Friedmans Jewelers. I have horrible credit, however friedmans jewelers was willing to work with me, when know others would. The prices our lower than I have seen elsewhere. They have everything from the lower less expensive made jewelry to the higher quality items at exeptional values. Dont buy any jewelry without first visiting a Friedmans store near you. I shoped at the friedmans in midwest city oklahoma. There people were friendly, and seemed happy with where they worked. They also had young, old, and different races working there, and in a world where prejudice seems high, it felt good to know that Friedmans is there to help. Obviously they are exactly the kind of company we need more of. Thank you Friedmans
