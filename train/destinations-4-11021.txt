Asuming they are talking about teh acfcual company and not a Six Flags owned park called Frontier City. Six Flags as a whole i'd say is great, but when you compare it to Cedar Fair... Well it's no Cedar Fair. Six Flags parks in general are dirty, with rude park goers that cut in line alot, and Six Flags in general never have enough people to watch the queue.Six Flags has brought us great rides Like Nitro, X, Medusa, Titan, Raging Bull, chang, Riddler's Revenge, Batman Robin: the CHiller ect. But they clone way to much. The guy(can't remember his name) who decides what parks get, builds up clones. Just about every Six Flags Park will have either a Batman: The Ride or Vekoma SLC. And Vekoma SLCs aren't teh greatest. They are a waste of money in the big parks they have.
