I would never recommend these guys to anyone, even my most hated enemy. They were late by EIGHT hours, left their garbage on the lawn of the apartment buidling we were moving to, charged us AN HOUR to move less than 4 kms (of which they stopped to get a coffee on the way and charged us for the time), and were generally lazy. Our stuff was dumped into the garage when THEY decided they didn't want to work anymore. They rushed my fiancee to sign the form without letting her read it and fill in the comments section (which they knew would be read by head office). I could have hired two people for labour, rented my own moving truck from National, and had the move done for under $200, all with less aggrevation. The foreman insisted that they get all of the money coming to them and if he gave a discount for their mistakes, he would be fired the next day. CROOKS!!!!!!!!! We've been trying to get a response from the Oshawa owner for even a partial refund, only to play phone tag. I even boosted their truck and saved them a few hundred to call for a boost (of which almost blowing the computer in my car).
