Oh come on! You can hardly have a go a Charles about his marriage to Diana considering its a tradition with royalty that they only marry people who are 'suitable' for them, its hardly ever through love and they are very lucky if it does end happily ever after. Put aside the Diana situation, Charles actually does seem down-to-earth, helps out millions of people with The Princes Trust and doesn't seem to mind if he looks silly (he once came to London in the less privledged sectors and tried doing some proper DJing) He has done a very good job of raising his two sons and trying to shield them away from the media. Overall I would say that he is a pretty damn nice guy.
