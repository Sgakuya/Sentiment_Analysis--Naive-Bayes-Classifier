I just finished my on-line MBA from UOP. I was accepted to several MBA programs at regional institutions, both public and private, but my extensive work and travel schedule precluded my enrolling in the traditional type of program. Having talked to others who received their MBA's from local colleges it sounds as if my MBA course of study and experience was as good as, and in some cases, better than the one they received. Yes, there were some classmates that took advantage of the free rider policy and some just did not belong in the program. However, for the most part, my fellow classmates were a studious bunch. Of the 16 instructors I had, three had PHD's, the rest had a master degree(s) of one sort or another. I thought three of the instructors were below average, one of who had a PHD. Three were above average, one was exceptional, the rest average. I didn't have any problems with the administration or finance people, I paid for the program out of my own pocket. I wrote at least 60 individual papers and contributed to at least 35 team papers during the program. As with any educational program, either on-line or traditional, you tend to get out of it what you put into it. The lack of face-to-face contact is a drawback to the on-line program and some classes were better suited to a traditional classroom setting. Overall I rated the experience as good. I woul drecommend this type of program to people who are very busy and do a lot of traveling.
