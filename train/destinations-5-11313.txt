Casino de Montreal is beautiful. The bottom floor is blue glass and underneath it is water; really cool. True story (but I'm warning you now it drags on and is somewhat irrelevant): Back in 1999 at the Comfort Inn on Crescent St in Montreal I got drunk and fell on a sink, shattering the face on my brand-new watch. I was pissed. About a month later I visited the city again and I wore my broken watch. For some reason, and I really don't know why, I made the following statement to my best Italian friend Joe: I broke this watch in Montreal, and Montreal's gonna fix it for me. My buddy asked how exactly I thought that was going to happen, and I didn't know. Well at the Casino de Montreal I was playing roulette and the ball flew off the table and hit me, right in the watch. You could definetely hear it and right away I started yelling at the dealer for breaking my watch. I showed him the cracked crystal and he insisted that the ball couldn't possibly do that but I started going off incoherently about physics and the revolutions per second times the speed of the ball and I continued to yell obsenities at him until he called security. Security then brought me down to customer service who were amazed that a ball could do that to my watch but cut me a check for $200 nonetheless. In my life I have probably seen 1,000 spins and in that time I've only seen 2 balls fly off the table. The chances of the ball hitting me, on my broken watch mind you, in the exact city where I broke my watch and claimed to get it fixed, completely boggles my mind to this day. This is one of many, many reasons why I believe that some controller of the universe really gets a kick out of messing with me.
