Sears lacks the aura, mystique and emotional attachment of it's competitors like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and in Canada Eaton's and The Bay. Perhaps it has something to do with Sears' merchandise assortment and store decor. The Sears location at the local shopping mall near my home looks run down and hasn't been spruced up in ages. Basically, shopping at Sears is like shopping at the grocer. You go in to get what you need and then walk right out. There's no excitement or anticipation about visiting Sears at least to me. I think the execs at Sears need to come up with a retailing strategy that will draw customers into their stores not just for the prices but also for the merchandise and shopping experience.
