My RAV4 is a 96 4WD 5 spd that has 58000 miles of trouble free driving. I live in snow country and the all wheel drive takes me anywhere I want to go - in town, highway driving, hunting in the boondocks, wherever - without a gas guzzling monster V8 engine, and at about 25 mpg. It's noisier than I like on the road and the speakers were poor but have long since been replaced. I don't need to seat 8 people, tow a two ton boat or pull a tree out by the roots - this thing fits me just fine. And 150,000 miles from now when the Explorers, Durangos, Suburbans and other real SUVs are dead and gone, I'll still be motoring along.
