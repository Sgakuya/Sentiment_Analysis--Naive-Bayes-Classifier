Awful place. Dreadfully dull downtown area which is deserted after 5pm and at weekends when all the city workers have retreated to the suburbs. A city with a homicide rate that is the highest in New York State. A city which has wasted taxpayers money time after time on misguided projects, the latest being the laughable attempt at a fast ferry to Toronto. Total and utter incompetence from start to finish. A population of unfriendly people who seem to baulk at the possibility of any human interaction. City schools that are constantly ran into the ground as their budgets are cut year after year. But... you can always visit Wegmans, which is a supermarket that the residents seem to rave about, they don't seem to realise that supermarkets exist in other parts of the world.
