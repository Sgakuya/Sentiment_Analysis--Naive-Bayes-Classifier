Phil Jackson should be ranked MUCH higher than his current spot of #8. I know some argue he has been blessed with enormous talent through the years to earn all those championships but let's get real. Jordon was the only real star on his Chicago teams. How many people REALLY think Pippen was all that great by himself? A quick look at Pippens post-Jordon playing days will show how great he was. I agree Jackson benefited from Jordon and a high level of overall skill but the fact remains many coaches have enormous talent and cannot win a single NBA title, let alone 9. Phil Jacksons achievements as head coach are only matched by MAYBE a few coaches and players total. The results are hard to dispute even if he is luckier than most.
