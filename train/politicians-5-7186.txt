I find it very amusing that almost all respondents rate Jesse Jackson poorly. He's been called a racist, a divider, evil, hatemonger, etc... HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! You people are jokes!!! He is far from those descriptions! America is a great country. However, it has many problems...racism and inequality are just a few. This country was founded on racism....ask yourself how many Native Americans you've seen today and you'll get my point! Since racism is in its foundation, America will always need people like Jesse Jackson to battle it. Don't allow your insecurities to get in the way of progress and reason! Why is there racism? Racism is a tool used by those in power to stay in power! Since black people and other minority groups are not in power in this country...well you fill in the blanks! Jesse Jackson is a man of God! We must remember that God is not the author of confusion. This past election was confusing for everyone! Funny how many white people were screaming disenfranchisement during this election. They feel the burn that blacks have felt in this country for a very, very long time. I've heard the word so much that I thought we were having a white version of the Civil Rights Movement!(Maybe the way we vote will change since it affected whites, too.) And with the recent Supreme Court ruling, Jesse will be real busy! Bottomline....if you people who oppose Jesse want him to shut up, then stop being ignorant and wake up to the fact that this country has a long way to go as far as race relations are concerned. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Kwesi Mfume, etc... are not the perpetuators of hate and divisions in this country...why don't you look into your mirrors and see if you are! You see, if you are a bigot deep down inside, blame it on one person.....YOURSELF!!!! Jesse speaks the TRUTH...and sometimes the TRUTH hurts!! And quit worrying about how he makes a living!!! Get a life!!! I have spoken!!!!
