This time, when I give a five-star rating to a country, I can honestly say that it is not because my favorite rock bands came form it! Canada rules! The people are friendly and hospitable, the food is magnificent, the scenery is poet heaven, and the attractions make the Lincoln Memorial look like a street vendor. Niagara Falls is the most beautiful natural landform that was ever created. I got soaked to my skin on the hurricane deck. And anyone who goes to Toronto MUST-MUST-MUST check out Medieval times. It's this really cool restaurant that has staged knight-fights. Heaven for a pro-wrestling fanatic like myself...;-) I think it would be cool to go up and visit the Yukon territory, even though it's deserted and freezing. I might take magellan with me; it would be an educational experience for both of us (didn't mean to pick on you, magellan!). And by the way, Grim...what are you high on? Canada doesn't know that the USA is the best, 'cause no one is the best. It's people like you that make people like Eric the Federalist and Geordieboy give the US one-star ratings. Jesus, and I thought my neighbors were taking their patriotism to the extreme. Anyway, as I was saying...I LOVE CANADA! Take care, everyone!
