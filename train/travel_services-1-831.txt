The description for this item says they provide mass transit in Phoenix. Well, they deliver something, but I wouldn't call it mass transit!! They are unrealiable, the busses are crowed at peak hours, and alot of the drivers could use a course in human relations. And being on a crowed bus with a bunch of other people who have been standing out in 100+ degree tempachures is an experience you will never forget. It wasn't untill recently that they began service on Sundays, if you care to wait up 90 minutes between busses. The best way to improve this service would be to scrap the whole thing and start from scratch.
