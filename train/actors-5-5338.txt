I will never stand back when it comes to helping enhance his well being.He is one of the greatest actors I have ever seen.The majority of EDUCATED people will stand behind me in saying that , You can't judge a person until you've walked a mile in their moccassins. I have heard some horrible things said about this amazing actor on the comments list(all of which have innumerable grammatical errors,.. hint)and I do believe nobody knows what he is going through, and you can't until you've experienced it.The press is hounding him at every nimble twist and turn, he is self-medicating his bipolar disorder throughout his impossible schedule, he is battling to stay alive through the horrid rumors that he has been subjected to.I have chosen my side and I will struggle with every last ounce of strength that I have to protect his pure spirit and I give him a round of applause, maybe even two, for living in each moment optimistically and for making it known that he will never give up, not even in the toughest stages of his life. Hooray and long live one of the most enlightening and enthusiastic actors of our time, Robert Downey Jr.!
