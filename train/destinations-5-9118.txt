what a great place to be. the views are great. we had dinner up there and really loved the whole experience. the peak store has got a lot of great logo items to take back to friends. we ate at cafe deco, there are two floors make sure you sit up stairs. dinner for two w/ soft drinks was $80.US. and very good. the blackend sea bass was fantasic. dinner for two on New Years up stairs next to a window was $250.US w/ drinks (lots) and party favors and dancing. ONE THING DONT GET CAUGHT UP TOP AFTER 9 OR 10 PM AND WANT TO TAKE THE TRAM BACK DOWN THE LINE WAS VERY VERY LONG 1 1/2 HR+ WAIT. TAKE A CAB BACK TO THE BOTTOM. $10.US;]
