If you were able to build the perfect basketball player, you would end up with KG. At over 7', he is the only player that can play any position on the court. With his wide array of post-up moves, he is unstoppable on the low block. You better not give him too much room on the perimeter because he has three point range. And, if you try to play tight D out there, he'll go right by you. So you'll send another guy at him? He'll find the open man for a lay-up or open jumper. Maybe you can wear him down on the defensive end? He'll block your shot, lead the break, and jam over your center. With his engaging and respectful personality, Garnett is hard not to like.
