As expected snoop comes up with his unique smooth funky ass dope ryhmes. For the most the instrumental part of this CD is very simplified. Tr-808 sounding percussion, a deep pounding bassdrum, simple bass, simple melody. Maybe a bit of turntablism would have enhanced it a bit? Then of course there is the most important thang, The dope rhymes. The stereo effect applied to the rapping, makes it feel a lot harder. But the overall style of rapping pretty much the same, which is drawback. Maybe some different style rapping could have being used. Never the less, despite these minor drawbacks, Tha Eastsidaz delivers with a hard, yet funky to-the-point Gangster style hiphop. Worth adding to your Hip Hop collection.
