I promised myself I'd never do this, but I wind up doing it anyway now... a rebuttal to the most moronic Rate It All reviewer I have ever seen, patriotsvoice. Well gee, since Hitler was Catholic, and Hitler was evil, then ALL Catholics must be evil! Let me use that reasoning on other things now... Since Hitler was a German, all Germans must be evil! Gotcha'! Since Hitler was a man, then all MEN must be evil! Oooh! Oooh! Since Hitler's first name starts with an A , ALL people whose name starts with an A must be evil! Don't stop me, I'm on a roll here! One more thing, I'd LOVE to know how the rhythm method of birth control is actually a baby killing machine. Now... I got all that out. May I hope to never do this again.
