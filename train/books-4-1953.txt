Before ever looking into the Sunday comic strips, I discovered this well-known cat during the morning hours of CBS Saturday programming. Shortly after I began viewing the show almost regularly, I made yet another important discovery on the next day (Sunday). Just a couple or so pages from Peanuts was the one and only Garfield (excluding his other Friends, the U.S. Acres crew) on top of the page. As the years continued rather quick, long after the TV series ended, Garfield continued to amuse me, whether it was from looking at the pictures or reading his thoughts. As the humor section of my mind reached its highest point, the smiles would upgrade to good chuckles. This happened to be during a time when most Garfield readers noticed a supposed lack of new content in the strip. If you understand the daily lives of freelance cartoonist Jon Arbuckle, pets Garfield, and Odie very well after all these years, there shouldn't be any reason for even the most loyal reader to give up on it. Like every comic strip, there will be those days when the humor is unclear to the reader, but I assure you that you cannot escape Garfield's lure even on those days. Just keep reading, and there's no telling what the seemly ageless cat has in mind for the next 25 years.
