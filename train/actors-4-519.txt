Unlike actors like Tom Hanks or Dustin Hoffman, on screen, John Wayne would never even try to convince you he was really anybody else. Even though he starred in countless movies during his long career, he was actually successful at creating only one character - John Wayne, American Hero. His great success may have been due to many factors. But, whether it was the classic need for a hero/father figure, the turbulent times before and after the Second World War, or his position as one of the few conservative icons of the Viet Nam era, one thing you cannot deny - on a wide scale, he was better at playing this hero character than nearly anyone else.
