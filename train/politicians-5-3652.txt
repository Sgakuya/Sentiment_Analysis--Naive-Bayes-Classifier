George Bush may not be the genius that democrats expect him to be, but this is coming from a party that complained that their votes weren't counted after being totally confused and baffled by a ballot that a blind person would be expected to fill out. And then democrats complain about his DUI years back, something very common for a young person to do, and at the same time shout out praise for a president that cheated on his wife, lied to us Americans and not to mention that graceful departure from the White House, taking thousands of dollars of gifts that are traditionally left in the white house like it was a hotel room. He will step go to the White House instead of somebody that lied about his inventions, falsely claimed credit for an economy that boomed because of efforts of Republicans a few years back, and talked to people arrogantly like they were little children. He is also a very gracious man. Even though Clinton took all those gifts from the White House for his own, George Bush was gracious enough to not mention it when almost any politician, especially the obsessively critical democrat, would definitely say something. He has also said that he respects Clinton's ridiculous last minute pardons that freed some criminals that could go wreak havoc again on the U. S. (a lot like Clinton has in his 8 year term) And I don't get how democrats say that he is rich and has no idea what its like to be poor and therefore is a Republican. I've got news for you- he worked his arss off for this election and in life in general and despite what you might say, did not rely on his dad to do so. He is a very hard working man and deserves all of his accomplishments. Sure, George has his weaknesses, but he sure is a good leader and has a great heart and has much better morals than Al. A leader does not necessarily need to be intelligent, but needs to have a great heart.
