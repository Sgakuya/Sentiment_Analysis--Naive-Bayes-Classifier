Stephen King has unleashed a pathetic attempt at gaining a quick buck for a whiplash, jagged story that you MIGHT get to finish ready one day. What the hell? Has Mr. King become so bitter and lost in his millions that he's forgotten the one reason why many people (many of which are poor and of MINORITY decent, thank you)picked up their first copy of a Stephen King book in the first place? There is no character in The Plant - the story is filled with so many one-dimensional attempts at character that it's painfully obvious that Stephen King no longer hangs out with the average Joe. Or knows how to be human anymore. Yes, I've noticed that after his big accident Mr. King has become a bitter man. And I think that it will be obvious to most people to try to read The Plant. And the way that you get The Plant? You pay a buck. The way you get to read the end? If everybody else pays their buck as well. I think Mr. King should go back and read his own fiction and come to a realization in his life: It is the tale...not he who tells it.
