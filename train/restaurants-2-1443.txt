I recently made a trip to the local Sonic Drive-in to purchase one of their foot long cheese Coneys and a double meat jalapeno chili burger I enjoyed years ago. Man, was I surprised when I opened the 11.5 long hot dog package. Inside was a eight inch dog with approx 2 tsp of cheese on top with the nastiest looking chili I have ever seen in my life. I opened my hamburger and whoa the same thing, a large package disguising a 75% smaller burger with double 1/8 thick meat covered with guess what? Yeah, about 1 tbsp of that god awfull chili. Yes, realizing looks arent everything I tasted it ! My eyes did not deceive me, this chili was typical of those made for Yankees out of ground up pinto and soy beans with very little actual meat or real chili powder and spices. Hell, I can buy better chili than this at Sams Wholesale. Then I suddenly remembered why I havent been to Sonic in years. The same thing happened to me in San Antonio three years ago. I guess like so many other good companies, they must have been bought out by Yankees or foreigners who have no concept of what real chili and honest food merchandising is all about. I guess this why they don't have a e-mail address to their quality control or consumer affairs division. I guess all good things must finally come to an end.
