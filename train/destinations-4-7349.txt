Bologna has some of the best food in Italy (generally acknowledge by Italians to have THE best food in Italy). As far as sights go, there are plenty of better places in Italy. A warning: If you speak, or think you speak, Italian, don't be surprised if you can't understand a word of the local dialect when spoken between the Bolognese. I once got caught at the train station there during a strike and had to listen to the local dialect being spoken for about three hours. Although I have native fluency in Italian, I couldn't tell if the Bolognese weere speaking about the train strike, the weather, women, or politics. But, as elesewhere in Italy, everyone speaks the national language as well as the local dialect.
