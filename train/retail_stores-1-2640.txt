Oh dear, here comes the third negative experience from Nashville in a row! This time from the store at Hwy 70 S and Old Hickory Bl. Sunday at 9:30pm with a large number of customers does not seem like the ideal time for no lanes except U-Scan to be open, but it seems that otherwise the checkers would have had to actually do something other than gossip among each other near the customer service desk. So when the scanner inevitably beeped Please wait for cashier assistance after scanning an item, it seemed I had to frantically wave my arms for a couple minutes to distract one of them from their apparantly engrossing conversation. So I finally got the surly response put the ham in the bag! Apparantly this was enough to put me on that checker's $#!+ list, as when I tried to pay for $19.99 worth of groceries with two rolls of quarters, she looked at them, frowned, showed them to her friend, received a non-commital response and so she hunted down the store manager who apparantly told her it was ok to refuse them. She did try to politely ask if I had another form of payment I could use. Since I'd never had problems using rolled coin before in modest amounts I declined to pull out a credit card since my legal tender apparantly is no longer good enough for Kroger. After all, if she thought I was trying to short them, then in the time she ran around trying to get someone to give a negative response, she probably could have hand-counted the quarters. Failing that, she could have easily called the Secret Service on me. More so than the effort I would have undertaken to sue them in response, but I digress. In any case, I'm sure she was not pleased by the fact that I'd keep her even longer from chatting it up with her buddy as I simply walked out, leaving the bagged groceries behind at the U-Scan kiosk for her to have to restock. A short drive to Harris Teeter brought be to a checker who was not only more than happy to do his job and scan and bag my order for me, but accepted the rolls without a second glance. I don't plan on ever darkening Kroger's doors again.
