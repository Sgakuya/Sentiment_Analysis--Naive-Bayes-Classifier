The Niners are the team of the decade not to mention the millenium. This team made most of the right moves in the 80's and 90's. No team, and that's NO team, has been as competitive as the Niners have been for as long as they were. I'd say that's proof enough of their greatness. The team has fallen on hard times, but that won't last for long. With the help of Walsh, this team will come back stronger, younger and better than ever. Their offense is good and their defense is only going to get better after this year's draft (I hope they grab a gifted DE or CB). J. Peterson is going to be a stud @ LB and T.O. is one of, if not the best young WR out there. Unlike da'cowboys, we've already started our rebuilding and will be back on top sooner than anyone will expect. If the Ravens and Rams can come from no where and take the crown, why can't we? Go Niners!!
