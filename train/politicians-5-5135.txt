As always republicans end up looking bad. How they manage to do it to themselves every time, is a mystery, but they never fail. As always it seems their attitude is, if democracy is too slow a process, obstruct it, if we can't win justly in due time, hey...never mind, we'll just twist and turn anything that we can get our hands on to our advantage. Does anyone know? Do the republicans use the same lawyers as O.J. Simpson did? If so, the democrats are in big trouble. Then truth does not stand a chance. I guess no one should be surprised, obstruction of the democratic process isn't a big lead for Bush/ B(ush) B(utcher) among friends. I am not a great fan of either candidate, but I much prefer an honest (as politicians go), intelligent and democratic president, to a cheat, who without any modesty or second-thought sells democracy short. So I hope Gore pushes on and does not quit. The most important thing is that democracy wins and the winner is found - whether that winner be himself or Bush.
