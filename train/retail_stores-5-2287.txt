I really can t add much to danmuse s excellent review of this fine store except to say that I completely agree with all his comments. I found myself in one of these markets last summer in need of a small birthday cake. I couldn t find exactly what I had in mind (as he mentioned they carry great stuff, but are fairly specialized) so I decided to depart from the norm and bought a chocolate tort instead. Well, I will have you know that was one of the best substitute food decisions I ever made. This tort was so delicious excellent quality. And, though it had been frozen, once thawed, it tasted as though it were fresh from the bakery. If you enjoy trying unusual, high quality foods you ll have fun at Trader Joe s.
