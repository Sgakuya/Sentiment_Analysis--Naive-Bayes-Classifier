Gotta love Blackjack. There's something really exciting about pulling up a chair in a place like Vegas and throwing your money out on the table. I'm as small-time a player as you'll find (always looking for the $5 or even $3 minimum bet tables), but even when there's not a lot of money on the line I still get some kind of rush from playing. And, unlike pure games of chance (e.g., roulette), you actually have some control with Blackjack. If you know exactly when you're supposed to hit, stay, split, or double down for each card combination, and if you do some really rudimentary card counting (betting more when there are more high cards left in the deck because the dealer is more likely to bust), then you can get your winning percentage up into the high 40s, which is far better than most casino games. If some friends and I can take over a table and play for a few hours, get free drinks the entire time, and walk away more or less even - that's a fun night.
