I have little tolerance for people who don't know what they're talking about. I believe that I received a quality education at Coe. The physics department gives extensive research opportunities to undergraduates. By the time I graduated from Coe, I was published in a scientific journal, I had presented at an international scientific conference, and I was one of eight students from around the country selected for a physics internship in Washington D.C. I am currently working on my Ph.D. in physics. In addition, I think that Cedar Rapids is certaily not a pit. It is a large enough city to have everything that you need, but small enough not to have the problems of many larger cities.
