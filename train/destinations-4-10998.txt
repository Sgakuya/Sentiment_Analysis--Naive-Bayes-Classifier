High School Senior Night for me was at Darien Lake. I remember getting on a bus in the evening and arriving at the park around 8 or so and the park was closed to everybody except for high school seniors from the surrounding areas and schools. What a fun time to be rowdy, meet new people, chase girls you don't know aorund to meet , losing a bunch of money on the frustrating but addictive carbival games and so on. We stayed at the park the whole night. I have been there on other occasions and the rides are all up to snuff, the lines are not so bad, and one of the nicer things about Darien Lake is that they also have concerts there. And these are not like Snow White in concert - they get some really good bands to come out abd play at a section of the park.
