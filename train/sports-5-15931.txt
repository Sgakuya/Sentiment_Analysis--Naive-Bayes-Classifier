Yes, Brady plays on a very good team. He is in fact the most integral part of that team, and therefore must be at least a very good player himself. If being QB was just about throwing the ball, collecting numbers, you could rank others above him, but theres more to his position than that. The QB is the general of the team, the leader. This is where he shines. He reads defenses, picks up blitzes, finds the open man on pass plays, often the third/forth guy. (Thats why the PATS usually have 7 or 8 different receivers in a game). There are QBs that play really well against lesser defenses, but their performance drops off dramatically when facing stiffer competition. Brady plays consistently well against all of them. His play elevates with the game on the line. Take SB-39 as an example, The PATS offense did nothing until Philly scored. Then it became unstoppable until they took the lead. When Philly tied the game, they clicked back into high gear, scoring twice, including the winning points. The guy puts up Ws better than anybody!
