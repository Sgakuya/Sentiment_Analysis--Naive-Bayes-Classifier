Maybe Hannibal deserves three stars and I'm unfairly penalizing it because Silence of the Lambs was so much better. But I doubt it. This movie is just plain bad, all by itself. One of the things that made Hannibal Lecter so intriguing in Silence of the Lambs is that you knew he was a monster, but you generally didn't see his monstrous acts. Instead his evil lurked menacingly behind his refined facade and sophisticated banter. You were never really sure what he was up to, which made him more frightening. All that gets tossed out in this movie as we're repeatedly slapped in the face with Hannibal's violence and cannibalism. Monsters don't seem quite as threatening when we know what they're thinking and doing. Julianne Moore does a decent job as Starling, but she's not as right for the part as Jodie Foster was in Silence. I found myself alternately bored, disgusted, and irritated by this movie.
