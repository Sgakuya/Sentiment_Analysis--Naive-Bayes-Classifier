I think that George Bush has the ability to be a good president. His policys are sound and logical, even if he is a little more center oriented than I would like. Anyways though, he must be elected president to try and counter the direction our country is going. We have radical liberalism all over, taking everybodys rights away with the excuse that it is helping poor helpless people and all that other stuff. We need to try and repair the damage Clinton has done to our military, our economy (yes, I think it would be way better than it would be right now if he hadn't been elected), and our freedom. I think Bush can do it. I can only hope that the american people (at least those smart enouph to vote) will not let the same thing happen again.
