Annapolis probably is the best spot in Maryland, it's very nice in the southeastern area (Point Comfort or something like that, down past Waldorf). Other than that the worst of the North & South. Baltimore is like a Northern city with not much to do, I'd rather be in D.C. I was there for about a month a couple of years ago, and it seemed like it had all the problems of a Northeastern city and yet seemed to have some of the sour qualities of some Southern cities. The strip bars sucked, they were all packed together on this one street, and they wanted an arm and a leg to do their job (dance around naked). HIGH TAXES, urban blight, biggotry. For its location, and what you might expect Baltimore is not all that. The Harbor (whatever they call it) is like a tourist trap. Ever seen water and been to the mall at the same time? I mean, I'm from VA, but did not have any prejudicies about MD before the visit, I was looking forward to a great business trip but... On a positive note Camden Yards is one of the finest ball parks you can visit, a bright spot in a dark cloud. Maryland is not all that.
