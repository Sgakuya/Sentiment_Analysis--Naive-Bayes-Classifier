Starcraft has given me countless hours of fun, let me tell you. I still love the game, even though it's been out for awhile now. The game isn't as fun to play by yourself as it is to play with other people, and Blizzard's Battlenet allows you to do that, if you don't personally know other people who like to play. I can remember being up late many nights while I was living in the dorms at school and my friends and I were on the ethernet. At the time it came out, it was the best strategy game out there. The three races are all cool and it is fun getting to know their strengths and weaknesses. The AI of the computer is pretty decent and presents more of a challenge than it did for Warcraft II. Blizzard is such a great software company. They make sure their games are of excellent quality, and when people do find bugs or have complaints, they fix it almost immediately with patches. And if you play with the BroodWars expansion pack, it gets even better. Now I just have to wait for Warcraft III to come out...
