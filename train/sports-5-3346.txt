Roberto Clemente Walker's pride and humanitarianism won him universal admiriation. Despite an unorthodox batting style, the Pirates' great won four batting crowns and amassed 3,000 hits hits. He was equally brilliant in right field, where he displayed a precise and powerful arm. Clemnte earned National League MVP honors in 1966, but achieved his greatest fame in the 1971 World Series, when he batted .414. Tragically, Clemente's life ended at age 38 - the victim of a plane crash while flying relief supplies to Nicaraguan earthquake victims. Roberto Clemnte was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973.
