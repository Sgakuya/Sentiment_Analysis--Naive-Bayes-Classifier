I would give my favorite b-baller a 5 star more for his natural raw athleticism and potential that he has and is capable of achieving. Also for where his team would be or wouldn't be without their star player. Kobe and his cousin TMac have already surpassed him as the best young players in the game right now. He has been a no show the last couple of years and has to prove himself that he can lead his team. It's ashame to see 2 great players like Kobe and TMac play and live up to their fullest potential and not see a player like Vince live up to his fullest. He is arguably the most talented and athletic player in the game who has happened to get by with good performances from if he was an average player and pathetic from a superstar player perspective. Vince Carter has been sliding. When he starts to develop his killer instinct I believe he will be even more unstoppable then he was before and he will be a better defender and wiser player. If Vince Carter is the true star that I think he is he'll be able to bounce back and surprise everyone.
