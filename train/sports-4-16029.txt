As pointed out by TheFreak, Deion is an extremely pompous and immature individual. He made at least one attempt at suicide in his life. When he was playing for the 1995 champion Braves as well as the Falcons, self-absorbed baseball analyst Tim McCarver criticized him for not making a commitment to one sport. In the locker room after the Braves were victorious, Deion virulently poured water on McCarver. As a player though, he was everywhere and could do everything on the football field. It is rare and rather amazing that in this day in age there is still someone who can play two different sports at the professional level. His mere presence on a kickoff return team could intimidate the kicking team. He was also a dominating cornerback. He was an all-around great athlete.
