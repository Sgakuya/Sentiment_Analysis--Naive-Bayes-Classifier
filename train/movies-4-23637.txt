The Zion section, while I may not understand or agree with the orgy, also shows The One becoming One with the Trinity after returning to Zion. I probably would agree that some of the stuff didn't make sense in the movie, like unnesessary fighting (Neo and Seriph), however after the fight was a wise saying, You do not truly know someone until you fight them. This is true. The movie had a physical fight, but when we argue and become upset, we begin to curse others and call them morons, if that's in our nature. I know many believe that all of that action was uncalled for. However, I have to be on the side of the directors. When do you get the chance to make a movie about everything you believe and have the budget to pull off every special effect you ever dreamed? I had to make my judgement on this movie being a continuatiion of the 1st and the half through point before the ending. With that in mind, I give it a fair rating.
