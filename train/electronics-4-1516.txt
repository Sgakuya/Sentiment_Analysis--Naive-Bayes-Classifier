I have a Polk 8 inch sub that supplements a 12 inch Velodyne I have in my home theatre. It uses a third order bandpass set-up and it has great frequency response and output for such a small speaker. It has excellent damping and exhibits very little voice coil "chuffing" at extreme sound and frequency levels. It has a built in 100 watt class B amplifier with a -18db ( roll-off) crossover circutry that you can set as low as 50 Hz or all the way up to 220Hz - I keep mine set at about 100Hz - It also has an automatic protection circutry that shuts down the amp when it's limits are pushed. I've yet to push it that far. One of the best 8 inchers on the market.
