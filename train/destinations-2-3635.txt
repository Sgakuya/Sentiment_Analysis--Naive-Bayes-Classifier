Here is an honest opinion about Savannah from a 23 year old point of view. Savannah is a good city currently experiencing a growth spurt on the outskirts of the city. I have lived here for about a year and have fairly enjoyed my time here. It has great scenery downtown with its historic buildings and park squares (if that is your taste), and Tybee Island beach is a good area but after that, really nothing else to do. Many areas are unsafe and not good to wonder around. I think Savannah is a great place to visit, and a decent place to live maybe for retirees, but may not be so pleasant for kids or teens. They may become bored pretty quick.
