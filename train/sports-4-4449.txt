COACH K only has one problem keeping him from getting a 5 star rating from me. Its not that he always has his teams ready to play, can change game plans in the middle of games to keep his teams on top, or has more pretty boys on his team tham any other in the NCAA. The one thing that keeps him from the fith star is that he recruits guys that are so good that they don't stay four years. Kentucky, UCLA, and UNC have guys that come to play ball for those schools because of their history and tradition as well as for the coach in Kentuckys case.Most guys come to DUKE to play for Coach K. He has class and has made DUKE everything it is. As a Kentucky Fan I now look at DUKE is our biggest pain in the butt since Dean Smith left UNC.
