If George W had allowed the votes in Florida to be counted and stayed to the end and won the election that way, I would have had more respect for him. It seems to me that he won the election illegitimately . I am very concerned about his ability to deal with foreign policy and the economic issues. I remember what the economy was like when the Sr. Bush wasin office. President Clinton had to clean up after him and seemed to keep the economy strong. I pray that I am wrong and that for the sake of my children and all childrensfutures . I hope that he proves me wrong. Maybe someone will send him a sublimiimimable message . read my lips We have heard it all before. Lets see some action! thank you!
