Even as a Tarheel fan, I have to admit, I've always kinda liked UK..............when they aren't playing us of course. The two programs are similar in so many ways. When I see UK kids, they kinda look as if they could be Carolina kids and vice versa. Know what I mean? They just seem like good country or inner city kids. No trust fund babies. Just natural ballers. But man, they dodged a bullet with that Randolph Morris thing. What happened with Azubuike? Isnt he with the Blazers or somebody? But yeah, I feel like UK is Carolina's cousin in some weird way. Like together we represent the real traditions, the old school. I feel like Tubby Smith and Roy and Dean would be great friends. Ya'll know what I mean? I just feel like UK and Carolina are somehow different than Arizona, UCONN, Mich ST, Dook, etc. Anyway, since we will probably be out early in the '05-'06 tourney (although you never know with Carolina), TAKE IT ALL UK BOYS!

I'll tell ya who rules - Sean May. Now don't that just make an Indiana fan feel all warm and fuzzy inside?
