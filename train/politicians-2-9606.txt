Jimmy Carter was not the first U.S. President in my lifetime, but he is the first one that I remember being in office. Jimmy Carter was a good person, however was one of the worst U.S. Presidents in history. Maybe he was too nice a man to be elected President. He could never successfully stand up to international terrorism, which was less of a threat in the 1970's than it is today. Carter never had the peripheral vision nor the insight to understand the Soviet Union, and he bent over backwards to support freedom fighters in Afghanistan who were at war with Russia at the time which eventually led to the country being run by despots who gave refuge to terror networks, which have led to the present day crisis. Of course you can't blame this all on Jimmy Carter. No one could forsee twenty years into the future, but I wonder whether Jimmy Carter had the ability to forsee twenty MONTHS into the future. Perhaps Carter's darkest moment came in November 1979, when Iranian militants stormed into the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took nearly a hundred people hostage. Carter never had the ability to stand up to Khomeini, and the Ayotollah ran circles around him for months until Carter finally left office in January 1981. On anauguration day, 1981, Reagan becoming president was NOT the top news headline, the top story went to the remaining 52 hostages being released by Iran, which chose to release the hostages on this day a) in an attempt to make a fool out of Jimmy Carter and b) to avoid guaranteed military action by the Reagan administration. In summary, Jimmy Carter is a great humanitarian, but was not a good president.
