Reagan probably ranks among the top five Presidents we've had. History will record his activities much more accurately, and therefore much kinder, than many on this board. I've seen him blamed for a viral outbreak (AIDS -- and for those who blame Reagan, let's point out that the only real solution would have been quarantine -- was that what you and AIDS activists wanted?) and an increase in the federal deficit. The truth is that funds are spent by the legislative branch of government. Due to the decrease in marginal tax rates we doubled tax revenues, but Congress TRIPLED its spending, after promising Reagan it would work to decrease spending. On the positive side, undwer Reagan we saw the end of the spread of communism (of course one comment decries the very concept of private property, but if you want to know which works better -- here's a hint: compare the cleanliness of your personal restroom with a public restroom. Get the picture?), a decrease in inflation and unemployment from the Carter years (astonomical!) and the beginning of the longest economic boom in history. More importantly we had a leader with vision who put the country first. Finally, never forget the freeing of Eastern Europe from the slavery of communism: Mr. Gorbachec, tear down this wall!
