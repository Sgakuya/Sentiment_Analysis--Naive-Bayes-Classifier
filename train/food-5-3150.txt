Ling Ling Potstickers are the BEST out there. I could only find them at Sam's Club and Costco. Sam's Club quit carrying them and started carrying some other brand that I would rate with a 0 out of 5 stars compared to Ling Ling. Costco STILL does carry them, but I did not renew my Costco membership. So whenever I have a friend going, I buy 3 bags when I go with them. our Wal-Mart does not carry groceries.... I wish somebody would carry them! We are having withdrawls!!! Adding New Info the next day).... YESSSSSSS! I was at our local grocery store in Southern California "Albertsons" today and they carry the large bags of Ling-Ling Chicken AND Pork Potstickers. Just couldn't quit dancing! They said they were new.....let's hope they keep it up! If there are as many people loving them as we all do, maybe they'll stick around! Okay, the way we like to prepare them is.....Boil them first.....then drain the water and fry them in a pan in about 2 tablespoons of hot oil until they start getting browned.....the insides are usually VERY HOT after this process, so we'll cut them in half to help the cooling process. Then pur some soy sauce on your plate and dip them while you are savoring each bite...... I don't care for the sauce that comes with them.
