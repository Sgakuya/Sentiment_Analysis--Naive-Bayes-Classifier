This game works on the same level as the Rainbow Six series...it's a thoughtful, deliberately paced FPS. Instead of running willy-nilly down a hallway blasting anything that moves (no doubt resulting in endless, multiple deaths), in T:TDP you skulk in the shadows trying to remain undetected. You sneak about, silently approaching guards from behind and either thumping them over the head with your blackjack or putting a well-placed arrow in their neck. You then stash the body in a dark corner and continue. The graphics are dark and moody, the sound totally immersive, and the mission sufficently varied to keep you playing to see what comes next. Another excellent entry by Looking Glass studios. Thief II is more of the same, but with a refined graphics engine. Both highly recommended.
