My wife and I relocated to the UK las tyear and after talking to a number of shipping companies we chose Globe Movers of Sunrise, Florida as they were competitive and help full. We paid $3600 (the full cost of the move) to them and set off for England. To cut a long story short they didn't pay the sub-contactor who had packed our stuff and after spending hours on the phone and getting nowhere with them they eventually stopped answering the phone and it transpired that they had gone bust. We were forced to pay a 2nd company another $4000 to get our belongings shipped and they eventually arrived 5 months after origionally being packed. We followed proper procedure to try and recover our money, we contacted the relevant govt. departments etc but they have been no help whatsoever and the bottom line is that I am $3600+ out of pocket because the people behind Globe Movers are thieves who stole my money.
