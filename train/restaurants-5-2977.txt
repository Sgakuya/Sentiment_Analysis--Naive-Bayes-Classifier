I work for Friendly's as a manager(in Massachusetts) and I must say that I disagree with the above comments.We are a very busy restaurant and cleanliness and sanitation are very important to us.Gloves and handwashing are crucial.Sometimes labor can be tight, but we always have a dishwasher during peak times, as well as a minimum of two servers and a cook, depending on the time of day.At night we normally have between 5-7 servers and 2-3 cooks.We always try our best to give excellent guest service. As for the management training program, I did not find it difficult at all.I found it challenging but rewarding. I came from Papa Gino's, and I would definitely give Friendly's higher ratings for cleanliness, service, quality and training any day.
