The VW Golf GTI is an automotive LEGEND that has been around for a quarter of a century! It singlehandedly helped define and popularize the performance hatchback genre worldwide when it was then known as the 'Rabbit GTI'. I have a 2003 24V VR6 GTI that I have owned for 3 years, and I have not had one single problem with it. It has been incredibly reliable, and best of all, a blast to drive, since it will hit 60 MPH in a blazingly fast 6.5 seconds with the 6-speed manual! The 17 inch aluminum rims look hot, and help the car handle quite well. Interior fit and finish is on par with BMW or Audi in terms of quality of materials, plushness, and ergonomics. Interior room is surprisingly ample for a smaller car too. This is one refined and fast FWD car, and they just keep getting better and faster. It makes for a great 'daily driver' as well as a car that you can take out on weekends for a fun joyride, and it amazingly gets about 400 miles on a tankful (highway) for those long trips. I also owned a 1984 GTI years ago, which was equally fun and well made. This tight car is proof that German technology can be both affordable and fun. It will put a grin on your face!
