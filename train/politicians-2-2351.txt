He only gets two because he is an intelligent black man. However; how in the world can he sleep at night knowing he is supporting Dumbya? Appointing minorities is the only thing making Dumbya look okay. I guess we can consider him a TOKEN of the times. The fact that Colin knows how to kill people doesn't make him heroic. What is sane about war. Need I remind you a war that Dumbya Sr. started, and he didn't even hit the target! He is a CLASSIC example of an Uncle Tom! If he wanted to have the respect and merit of the american people, especially the African American people, he should've run for president on his own. He refused. Maybe it was because he would've beat our Bush Sr. Now he's underneath Bush Jr. Go Figure!!!
