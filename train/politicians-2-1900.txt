I am not a big Republican fan, and I do not like the Bushes. A lot of them are drug addicts and break the law. George Sr. and Jr. are morons. Out of the Bush men, Jeb is the most sane. I don't like the whole medicade issue and the fact that he doesn't really seem to care about the elderly. But what do you expect, he's a Bush. And out of all the Bushes, Jeb is as sane as they're gonna get. However, he did step up to the plate when Hurricane Charley hit. He did an ok job with that. If any of the Bushes had to be president (which I don't think any of them should be), Jeb would probably do the best job. As good as a Bush is going to do.
