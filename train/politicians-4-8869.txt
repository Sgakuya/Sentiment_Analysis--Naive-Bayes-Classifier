While there are character issues about Bill Clinton that have certainly raised some eyebrows, there is no question he was an effective president. Some people feel that Clinton was often full of s*** and he was. His relationship with Hilary was less than perfect. However, when the man gave a speech he always sounded very sharp and very aware of the issues. And this is coming from someone who typically votes Republican. I believe that a rating of a president should be based on effectiveness and getting things done. Is he more immoral than GW? In many ways he probably is, however I would take him hands down over Bush when confronting major issues. The type of issues that involve bringing both the Democratic and the Republican party together for a solution instead of dissent, the type of international issues that require an understanding of foreign policy, the sensitivity to those issues AND the ability to speak eloquently in front of large audiences. (Bill Clinton may have been even more persuasive than Ronald Reagan). During Bill Clinton's term, the unemployment stayed rather low, numerous jobs were created and many of those new jobs were non-service related. You can say that the President has nothing to do with the economy but if that is the case, then who should shoulder the credit? Bottom line is that Clinton did disgrace the presidency and I had disagreements on a few issues, but very few politicians were as persuasive, brilliant, or able to win the confidence of both political parties
