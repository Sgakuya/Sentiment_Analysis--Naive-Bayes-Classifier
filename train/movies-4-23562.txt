I squirmed a bit when I first saw this. Fantasy movies would always seem to lean towards a bit of grit (Dragonslayer etc.) but this was full fantasy, unicorns, elves, nymphs, a Peter Pan like Tom Cruise. In the end, especially after I saw it the second time I realized that they actually did a pretty good job it's just that there are virtually no other fantasy movies that tried to be as ethereal as this one. The curious, through the looking glass cinematography was a bit disconcerting at first but enhanced the movie. Also while he didn't carry the movie, Tim Curry was just brilliant as Darkness (is there anything that guy can't do?)
