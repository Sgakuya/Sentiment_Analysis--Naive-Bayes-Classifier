Consider this - Lexus ES 300, Lexus RX 350, Camry, Solara, Avalon, Sienna and Highlander are all based on the same chassis/platform, some more loosely than others. They are all similar in many ways. This platform is the heart and soul of the Toyota/Lexus company. They want volume - this is where they get it. They will listen to what people want and taylor the vehicle as best they can to achive maximum volume. It will never be the edgiest chassis, nor the greatest performer, but whatever vehicle is based on this chassis will always be a best seller. The Highlander was defined by this chassis, not the other way around. If you want a rock climber, by the new 4runner.
