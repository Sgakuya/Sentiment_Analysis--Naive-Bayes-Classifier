Any president who puts the security and wellbeing of this nation first above world opinion is high on my list. To all those people who HATE the president, your hatred have clouded your judgment. I don't really care about president Bush's rating on this poll. History will show him to be among our greatest presidents. I thank GOD that he is our president and not Al Gore. BTW, I wrongly voted for Gore in 2000 as I did for president Clinton twice. I had a mentality that the Republicans were racists and greedy back then before 9/11 happened. Since then I started reading more and more on conservative viewpoints and noticed the stark contrast between them and those of the liberals. I find that, in general, liberals tend to keep hatred, race, and equality their main issues to drive wedges between our people and divide our country. I am not a redneck hate monger, greedy rich republican like the media led you to believe. I am a little guy, a US Citizen from Vietnam currently living in California and I proudly voted for president G.W. Bush in 2004. I sometimes wish the US had not caved in to the liberals media pressures and backed out of Vietnam when they did. The enemies do not defeat us. We defeat ourselves.
