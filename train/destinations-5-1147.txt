I am in love with scotland...it's lovely...and people so friendly. I suggest to visit the Highlands, something like John O groats, Aviemore, Wick, Thurso, but also visit places like Jedborough in the south on the borders.... Places on the borders and in the further north are the nicest... stay away from the middle part...the lowlands....basically the industrialized area...but Edimburgh is lovely also. I find the sheep so nice...god they're everywhere :-) There's a lot of places to visit, dont stop to see the capital only.. There's nice castles scattered a bit everywhere...and i suggest you to see a town called huntly in the north east going towards Aberdeen.. it's so lovely and they make good shortbread there..I LOVE SHORTBREAD !! scotland forever :-) plus dont compare it to other countries...cos every country is unique. I am italian and i like my country but Scotland is so different...and i still love it
