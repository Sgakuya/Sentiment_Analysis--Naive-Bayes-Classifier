I used to shop at Abercrombie when about 5 years ago, when the quality was much better. Their customer service is horrible. Unless you're white and fit the look of their models, they don't care about you and won't help you at all (or even acknowledge that you're there). I think it's sad that this store is still popular, with their hiring polices of hiring people who fit the all American stereotype (a.k.a. white) and their racist tshirt slogans in the past. Why do people still support this store that obviously only cares about a certain sector of the population and sells overpriced low quality clothes to people who are brainwashed by their advertising to believe that these clothes are any good?
