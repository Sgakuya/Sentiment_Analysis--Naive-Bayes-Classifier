I was born and raised in Connecticut, but essentially left when I went to college. Conncecticut was a really great place to grow up in as a kid in those days - still plenty of rural areas almost in the midst of highly industrialized areas. When I visit or pass through Connecticut now, I feel that the state has gotten somewhat shabby malls are decaying, roads are as bad as they are in Pennsylvania, infrastructure in general needs work) and the close-kinit society it once reflected has begun to fall apart. There are still some nice places to visit (Litchfield retains its charm, as do several other communities inland); one incredible little jewel is Sasco Hill, right off Route 1 in Fairfield. Anyway, still a good state, but not what it used to be.
