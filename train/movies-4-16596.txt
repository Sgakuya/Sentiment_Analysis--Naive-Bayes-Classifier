Denzel Washington puts this movie on his shoulders and singlehandedly transforms a ho hum plot into a movie that was definitely four, and bordering on five stars. If there ever was any doubt that an actor's talent can carry a film, Training Day emphatically destroys it. Denzel is so convincing, so charismatic, and so tragic as a LA narcotics chief gone power crazy, that you catch yourself wondering if he could possibly play any other role than that of LA Narcotics Officer Alonzo (which of course, he can). Ethan Hawke, though not half the actor that Denzel is, was very well cast as the innocent, straight-laced rookie cop, and is believable as a foil to Denzel's swaggering, dominating presence. I would agree with Thorne that Snoop and Dr. Dre are both very believable in their roles, and bring a degree of legitimacy to some of the hardcore urban scenes. While I wasn't a huge fan of the last 15 minutes of the movie, Denzel Washington's overwhelming performance makes Training Day worth the price of admission.
