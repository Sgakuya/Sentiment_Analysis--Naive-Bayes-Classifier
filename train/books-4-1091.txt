I enjoy the Amelia Bedelias, but I have a few criticisms. The sentences are too short and choppy, and they make reading the book somewhat unpleasant, unless you create your own version by combining the sentences to make longer, smoother ones. Also, for children who haven't reached grade school yet, I think it's hard to grasp the idea of double meanings of words. For example, in one book, Amelia's supposed to pare the vegetables and separate the eggs, so she pairs the vegetables by putting two together, and places the eggs in separate places in the kitchen. That's cute to adults, but how many young children know that paring means peeling? And when you explain it to them, it's still confusing. However, they still enjoy the stories. And by the time they're old enough to understand the double meanings, they'll probably still enjoy them.
