Always loved Knoebel's. Been there twice a year for the past 10 years, always camping for approximately 3 nights each time. Only park I know of that you don't have to pay an admission, pay per ride or an all day pass(during the week) The only park where you see adults run to get an outside horse on the Carrosel (to get the rings) Roller coasters are excellent. The phoniex and Twister are two top rated coasters. Rides for all ages, but really more geared for the younger children. Alot of well kept older rides, but seems to be adding a new ride or two per year lately, geared toward teenage kids and youngsters Food, I would rate as average in the park, but don't expect fast service at the pizza shop. Prices are much better then any amusement park i've ever been to. Allowed too bring your own food in coolers and find a table in the pavallion area let your things sit until you need it, done this many times and no one has ever messed with our things. Stayed at the ajoining campground may times, park is clean, bathroom and showers are some of the cleanest of all campgrounds we stay at. The only somewhat negative thing I see is that years ago when we came here, most of the rides were operated by older adults, whom seemed to pay closer attention to safety, operation, cleanliness. Just had a better caring attitude then the high school, college kids that seem to be working today. A majority probably don't notice, but if you go there watch how they all fool around with each other, more then they pay attention to the people riding the rides.
