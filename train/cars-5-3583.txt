Very high quality car. I've driven an Explorer since I started driving in 1997 and there have never been any problems whatsoever with the car. The engine is powerful and the ride and suspension are excellent. It is a very stable truck; you can drive at high speeds and feel nothing. Most trucks start riding rough after you pass 80 m.p.h., not the Explorer. Also, Ford makes way better trucks than any of the Japanese car companies. Those cars as a whole seem to drive like tin cans compared to American made cars, which are the best in world, and I'm not just saying that because I'm American. Nationalistic pride certainly does plays a role!
