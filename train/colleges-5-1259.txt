The University of California, Berkeley is truly among the finest institutions in the world, not just in the country. It's practically the only public school able to compete with the elite private schools in every field. Cal is rated in top 5 of almost every discipline there is. Very few schools can actually do this. Take two prestigious private schools, Harvard and MIT. MIT is the "god" of engineering disciplines, but is not notorious when it comes to most liberal disciplines. Harvard, on the other hand, is kind of at the other side of the spectrum, being rated much lower than most universities in engineering. Berkeley has simply the best of both worlds. Every major there has also been polished to being an almost perfect curriculum. Not only transferring knowledge to students from ground up, but transforming them into smarter human beings to lead the world. There is simply no competition.
