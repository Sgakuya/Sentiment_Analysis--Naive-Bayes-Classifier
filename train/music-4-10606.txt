Pretty good. Jewel's voice is stronger with alot less hiccupping and cooing than on her first album, which is definitely a good thing. And she has a BAND behind her which sounds so different from her first album! The music is more bluesy and robust. My favorite song is standing still , but all of the songs are good. As usual, there are a couple of songs similar to Who will save your soul in which Jewel laments about the basic evil of humanity. And she also has the prerequisite love songs, which are nice enough to listen to. But my favorite songs on the album are those which are up-tempo, bluesy type songs that really allow Jewel's voice to shine. Definitely worth a listen.
