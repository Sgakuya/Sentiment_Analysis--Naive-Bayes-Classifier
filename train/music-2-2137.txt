My least favorite of this once great bands trilogy. After their last two very good albums were released fans were put on a 5 year hiatus. I saw them in concert in support of the green album and I was looking forward to this new album. To my surprise they don't have one song on there I truely love! Sure they are all good songs and all but they lake any real deep meaning. My favorite album of Weezer's is their vastly under rated Pinkerton which features songs that are so catchy and so relatable it is irresistable. The green album does not have this. It is very bland in comparason to the last two albums. I hope they gain their knack for writting catchy songs with a slight meaning. That is what I loved about the band. They could write a song about the worst break up that ever happened to you and still it could make me smile and sing along. I love Weezer to death. I just hope they get back what they lost on this album when they put out their fourth.
