the car have good point and bad points..... bad----- it is Ugly. i were willing to buy an ugly car if it can deliver what i need, but it didnt. it is extremely weak. it is great for driving around town, terrible for out doors. and if you are driving around town why not get a passenger car and get great gas millage instead? rude salemens, just because this is a newly design vehicle the saleman got the balls to add a mark-up value on the msrp. that is such an insult. good----stereo, design (folding seat and all). easy to clean floor....if only it had more power this car would be the bomb. an ugly bomb but still the bomb .
