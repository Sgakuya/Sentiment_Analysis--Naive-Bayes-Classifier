I was in Washington DC last year for a few months and worked in a bar. Two French people came in and ignorantly aoutomatically began to ask for food 'in French!' Now this seemed quite shocking to me and everyone was automatically rude to them, for not speaking the local language, english. Now flip that around, if you go to Paris and automatically begin to speak English to Shopkeepers, train fare people etc, you WILL NOT get a good reception, its natural, its obvious!! Ive seen it in france myself, usually its from Americans, running straight up to the counter and saying 'hey i want a ticket for Paris please' straight away in English, with no attempt at speaking French, its plain rude!! Learn a few phrases in French and youll find you are treated reasonably and able to enjoy Paris as it is, one of the most amazing places in the world.
