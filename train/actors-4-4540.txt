Kevin Bacon is a very talented actor. It boggles me so much as to why this guy has not undertaken more roles in which he is the leading man. He gave a pretty good performance in Stir of Echos -his sometimes creepy character in that film was very believable. I enjoyed his earlier performance in Footloose . His support roles in A Few Good Men , JFK and Flatliners were all impressive. My favorite role of Kevin Bacon is probably a tie between Wild Things and The River Wild , in which he plays a villian in both. I really would like to see him take on more roles where he plays the villian- he is a VERY believable villian. In the final analysis, Kevin Bacon is a man whose talent can take him leaps and bounds, but unfortunately, he has yet to reach his full potential.
