I have been dipping for 20 years now. I cut my teeth on Kodiak Wintergreen when I was 6 years old my two older brothers made me do it and I've been dipping ever since then. Skoal is what I call Cowboy Candy it is weak and you have to use 1/2 the can to get a taste of it. I dont like all the different flavors they have come out with like peach and apple becuse they are just like candy and if I wanted candy I would buy some Jolley Ranchers. I have tried just about all the different types of dip over the years and like Kodiak Wintergreen the best but I use 2-3 cans a day so I had to find a cheaper dip so I dip Grizzly Wintergreen and it taste alot like Kodiak but is not as strong.Grizzly cost my about $18.oo a week comparied to $40.00 a week for Kodiak. I wish I could still buy Kodiak but its to much money so I must take my 2and choice.
