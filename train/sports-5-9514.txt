Detroit played a hell of a series. They fought it out to the end boys! That was the best NBA Finals I have watched in a long time. It was the first 7 game series in the finals since 1994 (or was it '96? can't 'member) so it was definetly a series to remember. Detroit got beat by the better team this year and there's nothing wrong with that. They're still an awesome ball club with defensive prowess that no one else in the league has. Who else can defend a whole half that well and only get one foul? and the score didn't even hit 80! That's what you call defense. I give'm a 5 now Pat....they've proved something to me.
