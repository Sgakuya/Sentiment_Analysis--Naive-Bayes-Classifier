First, he steals the election, then allows 911 to happen; lies to the American people to start an illegal war; won't discuss why, he allowed his administration's Arab friends to fly out of our country after 9/11 when all flights were grounded; systematically continues to dismantle our Constitutional rights, while bringing democracy and freedom to the Iraqi people, and seems unconcerned about finding the treasonous person who outed Wilson's CIA wife, thus endangering her and her contacts' lives as well as our very national security. Instead of pursuing OSAMA BIN LADEN in Afghanistan, Bush DIVERTED ATTENTION AWAY FROM THIS MOST DANGEROUS TERRORIST LEADER by getting side-tracked in his corporate-profiteering WAR on TERROR against Saddam Hussein - later changed to OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM when all the bad intelligence he utilized to fool the American people to get us into this heinous war was admittedly bogus. Either knowingly, or because he didn't do his homework (aka Dereliction of Duty) by checking and verifying his sources of information before starting war on a sovereign country - something one would expect from the leader of a great country or corporation - he is responsible for 800+ young American soldiers dead, 5,000+ wounded AND 8,000-10,000 dead Iraqis and thousands more wounded, compounded by the destruction or damage to their hospitals. Very conveniently, his administration prepared for this war even before 911 by throwing out restrictions against War Profiteering for himself, Cheney, and friends). Evidently the plan was to rebuild Iraq, then privatize everything the Iraqi people were already getting for free, then take their oil as payment, perhaps using Halliburton's tactics of grossly over-charging for services whether rendered or not. Because of his stupid war, Bush has given Osama Bin Laden more fuel to grow hatred against America and her allies, allowing him to run around the past two and a half years recruiting more sympathetic followers, organizing them all around the world with determination to retaliate in the name of their Muslim brothers, and against U.S. corruption, materialism, and empire-building. THE WORLD IS NOW A MORE DANGEROUS PLACE, ESPECIALLY FOR AMERICA, OUR ALLIES, AND OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD!!! Regarding weapons of mass destruction, why wasn't Bush's daddy concerned when he sent Rumsfeld to meet with Saddam, smiling and providing him with bio/chemical weapons and nuclear capability so he could use them on Iran, our enemy at the time? Osama Bin Laden disliked Saddam's lack of religious fundamentalist fanaticism and acceptance of western ways, among which he allowed women freedom to dress as they wanted, equal access to education, and professional careers. If Bush and his greedy war-mongers really had no profit motives (oil, rebuilding destruction caused by collateral damage of war, privatizing everything they could get their hands on) immediately after 9/11, they could have saved so many lives and broken bodies - not to mention $trillions, by bringing together all of our allies and sympathizers to deploy the BEST INTELLIGENCE personnel from all friendly nations and putting a $10-billion bounty on Bin Laden - dead or alive. The world would have been a much safer place, and all the soldiers and innocent civilians - sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, casualties of Bush's War would still be alive.
