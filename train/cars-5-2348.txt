Hmmmmm. I don t know what to say. Obviously there are some who has never driven a Boxter and some who just love it. I ll try to be a bit more objective. I own a Boxter S model 2002. It is true that the Porsche is expensive byt few other cars keep their second hand value as good as a Porsche. The boxter comes in 3 engine versions: 2,5 litre 2,7 litre and finaly the S . The 2,5 litre is said to be a bit underpowered. The 2,7 litre is the middle model witch is probably the best value for your money. Then there is the 3,2 litre witch also has a 6 speed gearbox and bigger brakes. It all depends on what you look for in a car. The BMW Z3 is also a nice car when you get the 2,8 litre engine and up. Porsche like ferrari has always sat the standard for sportscars and will therefor always be a bit pricy . But to go as far as saying that the Boxter is bad car or not a real porchse is just plain ignorance. RedCelicaGT, you surely mean the elder 911 engines that had this kind of problem and would also overheat when standing still on the freeway, byt since 1990 they are past that problem. But Porsche has always been known to make reliable engines. How many 30 year old Toyotas still run?OKOL117OM What is a real Porsche? As said before on this site you don t know your automotive history very well do you?
