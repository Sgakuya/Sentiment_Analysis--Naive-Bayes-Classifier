If you're looking for a "fresh" destination, I'd take a look at Mazatlan. Maz is where spring break was founded on an organized basis (1967 Cervinik-Anderson Travel). The seafood is world class, all the spring breakers are midwest US students = super friendly, and the beach bars are fun & ON THE BEACH. Surfing? Oh yeah, Playa Bruja is 3-4 foot faces...sometimes as big as 5-6. El Rancho is 6+ faces...most are 8. It's a destination you'll also spend the very least amount of money at once you're there. There are also organized "party buses" out of Texas & Arizona during spring break. Mazatlan is located just north of Puerto Vallarta on the Pacific sides of Mexico, and has some of the very best surfing in Mexico. Expect temps in the high 80's in March.
