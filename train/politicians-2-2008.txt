It's a shame to see such a great state governed by such a loser man, HE LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THINKS THAT NYC IS ALL THERE IS TO NEW YORK STATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Upstate New York is a very nice place to live, but it does need some more jobs, for god sakes people don't elect him any more!!!!!!!!!!! I want to get back to upstate new york, and maybe if there is a new governer, i will be able to find a really good job. what ever you do, don't be a loser dumbass like chalky and leave, that just makes it worse, he/she is just a whimp that will probably make the mistake of moving to the south like i did, HEY CHALKY IT SUCKS ASS!! TRUST ME WHEN I SAY, STAY IN NEW YORK!
