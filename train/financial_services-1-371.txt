Customer loyalty means nothing to this bank. I've given them my business since they took over our local bank many years ago. I am not in the habit of giving companies my hard earned money for nothing (late fees, overdraft fees, etc...) But one small mistake balancing my checkbook racked up $360.00 in overdraft fees. Did they work with me to reduce these fees? NO! All I got was quoted policy stating that unless it's the bank's error no fees will be reduced. That goes to show how well long term customers are treated. It will be the very last fee they ever get from me. Customer service is nothing more than quotes from their policy manual.
