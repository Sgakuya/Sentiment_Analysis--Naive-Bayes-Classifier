I think that the French really do get a bad rap from people in America. The only thing that stinks about France is it's government. It is a composed of a bunch of socialist crooks intent on squandering the taxpayers money. Even the French are disillusioned with their system. The French are actually very nice people who really love America. Their is a competitive edge to our relationship, since our history mirrors theirs a lot, but its all in good faith. They have a very nice country with great food and wine. The countryside is beautiful, when you go to France, you have to see Provence. Paris is beautiful, especially at night. Overall, France has great attraction and very warm people. Go see it if you can!
