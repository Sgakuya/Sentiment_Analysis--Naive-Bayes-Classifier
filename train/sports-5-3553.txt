Very dependable hitter. Led NL in Batting Average 8 times. Though modern baseball analyses downgrades the value of BA; that Gwynn led the league so many times is a mark of a great player. Before the strike killed the 1994 season, Gwynn had an excellent chance to break .400 that year. In another season, even after an injury prevented him from the necessary 502 plate appearances needed to qualify for the batting title, they awarded it to him anyway when it was determined that if you added enough outs to give him 502 PAs, he was still way ahead of the next best hitter. Though he was rather portly, he was a tremendous athlete, who also won several Gold Gloves.
