Cingular was, once upon a time, a decent mobile phone company. Once they merged with AT&T, things went downhill fast. I moved last year and it took them EIGHT MONTHS, and many many phone calls from me, to have them update my address so I would get my monthly bills. For those on Cingular, who are getting ready to move, DO NOT use the "change address" feature on their website. That only changes the address in their database, NOT the address the bill gets sent to. After continuing to get bills forwarded by the post office to my new address, I went to the nearest Cingular store, where the person working there thought I was nuts because the address in HIS system was my current address. I kept showing him the bill I just received with my old address printed on it, and it didn't phase him. Asking for the manager was futile--"he's on break." Bottom line: Once your a customer, and signed a contract with them, they don't care about you. It took countless more calls to their billing department to get someone working there who actually cared enough to ensure the address was updated correctly in their "hidden database." A perfect example of 2 databases (one possibly in another country) not "talking" to each other. Regarding the quality of their cell service--it stinks now. I'm always getting a "no service" symbol, in the middle of populated areas. Calls are dropping. I can't retrieve voicemails. My Cingular plan is up for renewal in February. I will NOT be renewing with them. Verizon, here I come.
