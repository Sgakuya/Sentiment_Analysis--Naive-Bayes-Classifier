My favorite meal here is the Ayers Rock Strip cooked medium rare with the Aussie Chips (very good fries), along with the house salad with honey mustard on the side. If we aren't totally full (rarely) their dessert Cinnamon Oblivion is my favorite restaurant dessert... also their kid meal chicken tenders are surprisingly excellent! Also, I HIGHLY recommend their call-in curbside takeout service. They package everything up very fresh and you can basically eat the same very good meal right at home. One tip for this is order your beef just a shade under where you really like it, as it will continue to cook a little in the box on the way home. (No tips & no waiting this way!)
