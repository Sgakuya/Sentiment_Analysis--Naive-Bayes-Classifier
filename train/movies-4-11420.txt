I would have to give My First Mister a Good rating because it seemed like a labor of love to me. Obviously this film wasn't going to attract a mainstream film going audience and I don't think that was the intent. The story was good and I was both delighted and suprised at the route it took. Albert Brooks alone would make a film worth going to for me (ok, well maybe not The Muse)and he was great in this film. The Goth Chick thing was a little overblown, like Goth imagined by someone who isn't, that bugged me a little. It seemed kind of like when punks were first portrayed in the mainstream media dressed in garbage bags held together with safety pins and the like. The story is what makes this film good, the acting was quality but not sensational. The awakenings of the characters kept me engaged, I laughed and cried along the way. To compair it to Ghost World wouldn't be fair to this film. Ghost World was really an incredibly engaging, well acted and wonderful film and I bought the characters hook, line and sinker. My First Mister is much sappier and follows a much more traditional line of storytelling.
