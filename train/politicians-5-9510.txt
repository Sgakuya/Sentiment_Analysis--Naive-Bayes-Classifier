Many disliked him for the Iran Hostage Crisis and for a slow economy, but I still liked him both as a man and as a president. I truly believed he should've gotten a second term. He was truly compassionate and cared about Americans more than any president we had in a long time. He focused on human rigths as a tenet for American and foreign policy. He developed Habitat For Humanity to make more poor people get into homes. And for those who attacked him about a bad economy, it was bad mostly because Carter kept giving money to welfare and the poor. And he was one of the most honest presidents we ever had, if not the most honest. He never told a lie and never kept secrets from the press or the people. And he was truly a man of morals and truly believed in the values of America. He was very faithful and believed in the Lord's word without being hostile towards gays and abortion and other stuff that many people say are the meaning of moral values. You see, Jimmy Carter brought back the integrity, compassion, values and pride to the White House. The integrity, compassion, values and pride that had been lost for years and that we lack today. We need more presidents like Jimmy Carter.
