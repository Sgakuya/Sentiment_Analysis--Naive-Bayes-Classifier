I'm embarrassed to say that I've only seen one of the 74 films Cecil B. DeMille directed between 1914 and 1956. That was The Ten Commandments , which was truly great. I think it's very stirring at the beginning, when the director himself comes out and explains the importance of the story of Moses in clear-headed terms that you'd never hear from anyone in Hollywood today. Interesting footnote: Cecil B. DeMille happened across Ayn Rand shortly after she emigrated from Russia (this is before she had written any of her novels). It was on the set of one of his films that she met her future husband Frank O'Conner.
