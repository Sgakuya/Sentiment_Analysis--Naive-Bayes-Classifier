That was very interesting, john430et. But next time try reading the book. Atlas Shrugged is the best book I have ever read. I could relate so well to Dagny Taggart that it was scary. Ayn Rand is a brilliant woman who had the guts to stand up to idiots who thought making money was some kind of crime. Lyric of the Day: Mr. Charles Darwin (or Miss Ayn Rand) had the gall to ask, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And John Galt was the coolest character in any book I have ever read. One time, I had to write an English paper about the symbolism in a work of literature I had read. I got an A+ writing about John Galt. I wish he were real, I'd talk him into running for President or something. And I have problems with idiots like James Taggart every day, and I have a friend who, if he doesn't watch it, will turn into Francisco D'Anconia. Or maybe Ragnar Dannesjold. We should make it a law that everyone read this book before they turn 50. Unlike some people, I have read this book in it's entirity. And I will never forget this book. Thank you, Ayn Rand, and take care, everyone!
