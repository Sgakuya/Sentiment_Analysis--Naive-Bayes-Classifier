Easily the best QB to ever play the game. And I'd dare say easily one of the 10 best players ever in the league. And I'm taking this way back to 1921, baby. QB argument? I'll cite the laudations of such greats as Marino, Theisman, Tarkinton, Starr, Young, Fouts, etc. whom have all stated the ole' #4 is one of the greastest to ever play the game regarless of position. Those opinions seem to not only outweigh whatever we say here, but cement the fact that Brett is in a legue of his own. Look, there are freaking linebackers such as Ray Nitschke and Dick Butkus that didn't play as many consecutive games as Favre. All 3 of those had major injuries at some point in their careers. But guess who suited up the next week. That's right. Number 4. I'm dreading the day when Favre isn't in the starting lineup for a game, as it will mean he's retired. I just hope it'll be another year before facing that. Good Christ that's going to be a hard, whisky-drinking day.
