Beale Street is pretty fun at night. Dozens of good clubs and bars, folks playing music out on the street, etc. I suppose it's not the decadent Beale Street of old, since its somewhat commercialized now, but you can get a sense of the history of the place by ducking into A. Schwab -- an eccentric dry goods store more than 100 yrs old with the motto: If you can't find it at Schwab, you don't need it! The one thing that disappointed me was the homogeneity of the music on the street. For a city that produced so many diverse great bands of different styles, it seems that B.B. King is the only guy anyone cares to emulate! Also, from my studies, it seems that the best restaurant (Rendevous) and record store (Shangri-La) are a little off the beaten path, so don't go to Beale Street and think that you've done the best of Memphis.
