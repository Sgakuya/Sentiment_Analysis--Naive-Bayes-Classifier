Here we go again with Bush shouldn't have been president anyway because Gore got more votes. Take a political science course people! The U.S. is not a democracy, it's a constitutional republic. The presidential election is NOT determined by the popular vote it's determined by the ELECTORAL vote, and for a reason. That reason was to prevent states with large populations from having a disproportionate share of power. Thank God for the wisdom of the founding fathers. And true to liberal form, if you cant win by the rules take it to the courts and have a judge change them for you. W won TWICE. Get over it! And BC718, you appear to be a product of inadequate education yourself. Was Bush president when you went to school?
