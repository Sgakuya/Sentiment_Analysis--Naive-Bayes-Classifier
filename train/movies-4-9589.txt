I'm a sucker for chick flicks, so I knew it was only a matter of time before I saw Bridget Jones's Diary. It turned out to be a pretty good movie, much to my surprise, because I couldn't make it through the book. Renee Zellweger is terrific as Bridget Jones, a 30-something, single woman living in London, who is dealing with her unpredictable love life, problems at work, and mixed-up parents. Zellweger's accent is very good (at least to my untrained ear), and she lets her vanity go by the wayside and plays her role with abandon. In fact, Zellweger makes the movie. The plot is predictable and somewhat boring, and you have to endure Hugh Grant, who plays her cad boyfriend and boss. Zellweger is such a delight, however, you don't even mind. I don't think my husband would've enjoyed this movie much, but I'm glad I saw it. This is the ideal girls' night out movie.
