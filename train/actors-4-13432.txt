Juliette is a pretty decent actress, but as many comments have pointed out she has been typecasted and it's a sad pity indeed. It was nice to see her in the Jennifer Lopez film Enough in a diferent role for her. It just seems so hard for anyone in acting to break oout of being typecast. I don't think Juliette has yet to have had a role that will define her. Sure, she does tend to play the white trash skanky or in trouble but she can do so much more. When it comes to her looks she may not be jawdropping stunning as some actresses but she has a beauty which grows on you. She is very y in her own way. I've enjoyed every role and appearance she has and find myself growing more and more fond of her. She could be the down the street, your sister or best friend. Okay, so I've had a crush on her since puberty but damn it I think she's got what it takes to be a big star.
