I have so many mixed feelings about Boston. I grew up in Mass and live in Seattle now so I have a native and outsider perspective. I'll start by saying it marches to it's own drumbeat and is like no other city anywhere. I don't think I've seen any other city with so much brick infrastructure (god forbid an earthquake hits the place), nonetheless the architecture is gorgeous. The Back Bay recalls a Parisian atmosphere with chic shops and gracious brownstone living. Beacon Hill has a character that can only be found in Boston with it's colonial village look with redbrick townhouses, black shutters, cobbled streets, and gas lantern streetlights. This may sound biassed but the food here is the best. Italian in the North End, dessert at Mike's pastry, chowda and lobster to boot, not to mention all the international cuisine that comes with the territory in a cosmopolitan city like this. To those of you who knock driving in Boston I'm with you but that gives it another advantage. No other city in America invites walking as much as Boston. Hey America you could use the excersise anyway. The city reeks with history at every corner. Walking the Freedom trail is a rich experience with so many important stops in the history of the Indepenece of this country. Stand at the site of the Boston massecre and your surrounded by the old state house built in the 1700's, turn of the 1900's office buildings, and postmodern skyscapers. It's that one of a kind flavor that I love about Boston but I can only rate it 4 stars as noted by others it cost way too much to live here. Also Massachusetts gives corrupt polictics a whole new meaning, the amount of tax and spend and wasted taxdollars here is monumental and the repercussions of that make living here very HARD. Otherwise Boston is fabulous but only consider living here if you can make it.
