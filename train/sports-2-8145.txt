Vince Carter is an awesome Ball Player; however, I don't think he has the great of person or a team player. Just recently he adamantly refused to offer his position on the All-Star team up for Michael Jordan. This man had been injured roughly all season and was given a starting position on the all star team, clearly unfair. Michael Jordan in his last season had the potential to go for his last all-star game but will be unable to now. Two or three seasons ago Vince decided to go to his graduation ceremonies rather than warm up before game seven against the 76ers who eventually won the series due to a last second shot that Vince missed. Academics is important, but the graduation was a ceremony; Carter is a leader for his team and he left them when his guidance could have been the differences. His selfishness is apparent and his sportsmanship is poor, sorry Vince.
