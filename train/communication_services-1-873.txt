Have you ever heard customer relationship guy saying I am trying to educate you? I heard that... Thanks Peter(real name of the guy)! I was with Clearnet before it was taken over by Telus. As the comment below, I was extemely satisfied with Clearnet's service and stayed with Telus long than I should. Three years ago, I bought that first flip Samsung phone and since last year the reception of the phone was getting worse. Finally I was fed up with it decided to switch to Fido since customer service rep was going to charge 25 bucks to me for swtiching my number to another phone. I told service rep that I wanted to close my account and was passed on to Peter. Well... he asked me why I wanted to close my account and I told him why. He went on about my phone is outdated and should swtich to a new phone. I told him that it's not fair forcing customers to buy another phone that cost couple of hundred dollars just because they changed their system. that's why Peter went on about I want to educate you shit. Yeah, EDUCATE! this is coming out of supposedly cusomter relationship guy! well... I'd rather not be a TELUS customer if this is their idea of FRIENDLY. Just wait until you need to fix something or cancel your account. you will be surprised how bad their customer serivce can get.
