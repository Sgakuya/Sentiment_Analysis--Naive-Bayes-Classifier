You dodged a bullet didn't ya, kid? OOOOOOOOOOOh, that was a closey, huh? Ahh, you'll be allright. I like ya. Just listen to your coach next time. Trust me, he knows what he's talking about. Other than Roy, I respect no coach on earth like I do Tubby. Not even Larry Brown or Karl. So, kid, the longer you stay with him, the better off you'll be - trust me. The key is to forget everything and just get MEAN. Your talent is there. If you get mean, you won't be stopped. Put players on their ass in the lane, ya know. F 'em! DUNK ON THEIR UGLY FACES! Get after it! Think Brendan Haywood or Luke Schensher. You know how bad ass they could be if they would just get nasty? It's not too late for you. I've seen you at your best, KILL 'EM! What are you, Dirk Nowitzki, Vlade Divac?!? Don't be a Euro punk! Get mean. Think Sean May. He used to be average and they called him soft. Now he's great and they call him a bully. Who cares, be a bully! You'll be allright. Tubby will see to it. Check my weblist.
