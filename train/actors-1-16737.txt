I love the show, and his character. Although I don't agree with the show having him let go of his rights to his son, I mean come on Micheal looks just like him, and plus one night with A.J. and you have a baby, no way. She was with Jason more times than I can remember. I was hoping that the show would marry Carly and Jason,because he's the only one that forgives her mistakes,and accepts her for herself, her lies, and schemes. I mean the guy even took care responsibility for their baby, and her tries to put the pieces back together in her life. Plus, it didn't look right with Carly and Sonny he doesn't forgive easily which is not a good sign for Carly. Plus,the show would have been more intersting if they were to marry. I think that Steve Burton is a good actor, and his character is great. I also, loved every episode with him and Carly in it, it made me sit on the edge of my seat every time. If you have the same opinions as I do, e-mail me we can chit-chat about it. Thanks!!
