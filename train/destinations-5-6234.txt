I would love to spend time in Georgia, quite possibly the greenest state in the country. Unfortunately most of my time in Georgia has been spent on I-75, racing to get to Florida, dreading I would miss the traffic going through Atlanta. Although Atlanta is a vibrant,cosmopolitan city, there is so much more to Georgia than just Atlanta. The beautiful mountains in the north, and the pine trees and red clay in the south. Some of the best food in the country also, real cooking, not the franchise places lining I-75, I think I had possibly the best breakfast I ever had in my life in Georgia and it didn't cost me more than five dollars, served by a woman with the sweetest Southern drawl, who didn't care if I was from NYC, Oregon or North Dakota.
