Two stars because he is a reliable coach. HOWEVER, Larry can be also the worst kind of coach. He kills himself too many times by benching good players he just doesn't like or feel comfortable with for some reason. I give you Exhibit A: his continued BS benching of Darko Milicic, the #2 pick, for 2 years. Not only has Darko elicited excellent praise from his teammates, he has proven he has talent in the minutes he is given. Brown for some reason, refuses to play him, and I suspect this has created a rift with management that might be a factor in his recent struggles with management. Exhibit B, the disastrous Olympics, in which Brown horrendously led a star-laden team to a subpar bronze. Any team with 12 NBA superstars that can't beat international teams with maybe one or two NBA stars, at least, is pathetic. Even worse is when certain players are bizarrely benched and others played huge minutes. I can't wait to see Brown leave this team; Carlisle engineered the Piston's championship, not Brown. He is quite honestly, the most deceitful and idiotic coaches in the NBA.
