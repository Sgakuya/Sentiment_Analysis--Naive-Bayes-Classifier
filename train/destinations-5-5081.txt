Everything it represents is great. It has the urban area of New York City (the greatest sports city in the world as well as the greatest all-around city because of its immense diversity and culture). Madison Square Garden is the world's most famous arena (as well as the capital of the world) and Yankee Stadium is the most historic place in sports. It is so rich in history, from the Museum of Natural History to Ellis Island, to the Statue of Liberty, to the Baseball Hall of Fame to the battlefield at Saratoga, the turning point in the Revolutionary War. New York is a liberal state as well, with Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer as our senators. They don't vote for hateful people. Also, there is hiking on the Appalachian trail and the Adirondacks. Plus, there is a ton of great golf courses (Mansion Ridge in Monroe, NY). It is truly the best state, with the greatest sports teams. New York is the place to be. In case you couldn't tell from this comment, New York is my home state.
