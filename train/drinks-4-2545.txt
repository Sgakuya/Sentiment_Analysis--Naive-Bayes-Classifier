This is a good sparkling wine (champagne) for the cost $6 to $8 in most stores. It is slightly sweeter which I prefer and I often buy the extra dry. I find that it has a ample supply of bubbles, good for cocktails and is a great value compared to Korbel, or any of the under $15 California spakeling wines readily availble. I keep a few bottles on hand for everyday use in cooking or for cocktails. The magnums are also well priced at around $15 which make them great for lower budget parties. Would serve over Totts, Ballatore, Cooks & Andre (this stuff should only be used in punches). A good subsitution to Korbel if price is an issue.
