Listen, I have worked for blockbuster for 4 years and I am not here to defend them....Blockbuster sometimes charges people extended viewing fee's incorrectly.....but thats not on purpose. You have to take into account they deal with about 2,000 movie returns a week, and new employee's always make mistakes....in this case you have to inform us, and in my case I would be glad to take care of it. and as for NET FLIX goes....Blockbuster has The Blockbuster Movie Pass --$24.99/Month - no contract, no late fee's, no return date, UNLIMITED RENTALS, and you have the ability to switch the movies you rent 3 times a day or more if you want....alot more than net flix and waiting for the wonderful snail mail....
