MY husband and I bought our wedding bands form Kays in Fairoaks Virginia. Our sales rep has been nothing but helpfull. However I jave ran in to problems. There is a store that is 20 minutes from where we live, but when I took my ring in for it's 6 month inspection I wanted to get them saudered the rep at teh Springfield VA store told me that I would have to pay for it because it was not coverd on the plan. So I called my rep who happens to be the manager at the Fairoaks store and she read to me on the pamplet where it states that it is covered that and any sizeing that needs to be done. So I took it back to her. We have since been stationed in Germany and when I took my rings in for inspection we found a crack in my saphire. Since we were leaving in a week I could not leave it there for repairs which would take two, so she made a note that on our warrenty voucher that we were PCSing and when we get back to the States I am to have my stone replaced. I have also left my rings in their care to be re surffaced they are white gold so the scrathes show a lot more and every time they have had it I always gotten it back on the day they said it would be back or sooner. I also drive 45 minutes to an hour to see Tanya at Fairoaks. I won't go to any other in the Northern Virginia area. The bad experiences are not just the company's fault some people just don't care about there customer's. It's unfortunate that a few bad seeds can make the apple taste horrible. As for now I would still go to Kays if its in the next town we move to. As for Fairoaks as long as they keep true to their promise like they have in the past, they will continue to keep my business.
