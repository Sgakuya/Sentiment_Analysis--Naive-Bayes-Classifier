i don't understand where a lot of the negativity surrounding this move comes from. there are a few things about it that can be argued in its defense which seem obvious, but which everyone seems to overlook. first, it's supposed to be what it is: visually stunning, casually interesting, laid back, detached... all the things people imagine the jedi being. this is lucas's perfect republic in its prime; there's no awful threat, like the empire of the other films, to bring out the best in the heros... that comes later. that's the point. the evil here is supposed to be a shadow, supposed to be vague and on the horizon. star wars is a space opera, and you can't judge any opera by its overture. as lucas says, you'll see later, after having seen this film, why luke complains that his planet is a dump. second, a militaristic culture such as the empire, founded on uniformity, finds a creature like jar jar offensive, because strategically he is worthless. lucas demonstrates in this film that his idea of a healthy society is one that celebrates diversity, in which a goof like jar jar can be helpful and not condemned with cold derision. i mean, think about it, which is more imperial, and which is more democratic: hating someone who makes your group look bad, or utilizing their strength for the group's sake though it may be different than yours? third, star wars was never popular, despite the fact that it was always popular. huh? it takes a certain type to like these films, and maybe the hype generated by its return clouded that fact. that and the fact that the entire story is really far from having been told, probably contribute a lot to the dissatifaction surrounding phantom menace. obviously, anything that creates so much buzz, pos nor neg, is worth seeing. as i said, also, it's quite a treat for the eyes.
