Yeah I know people say its ugly. That was my first opinion also. We bought this for my wife to commute to work in. I must say over time I've grown to like its style. Overall this vehile has worked out very well for our family of four. It is comforable on trips and has room in the back for all our stuff. People have complained that it is underpowered, I have not found this to be true and it gets good gas milage even with it's all wheel drive. Recently we were caught in a snow storm with with around six inches of snow with two inches of ice underneath. The Rendevous didn't slip a wheel even when going up an incline. Fit and finish is definetly Buick! What can I say, Its not for everyone but for us it works great.
