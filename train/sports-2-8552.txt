Sure he's a talented ball player, but he is not and never will be another Michael Jordan; although in his mind I'm sure he thinks he's already surpassed that. Anyway all I can say is I hope Sacramento and Dallas keep dominating, and I hope the Lakers eventually become reduced to a mere step above the Clippers. I mean with a huge fouledeverytimeheshootsnomatterwhat shaq, a cocky, selfish showboat like Kobe, and that reflection of a donkey's ass also known as Rick Fox, how anyone could love this team is beyond me. Sacramento was robbed last year; THEY are the rightful champions, and hopefully this year will be a little more just. *Updated comment about recent accusations* - I don't know if he's guilty of rape or not, and frankly it really doesn't matter what he did. Because as OJ has already proven to the world, enough money and fame can let you get away with murder. So Kobe really has nothing to worry about....except for when he stands before God one day.
