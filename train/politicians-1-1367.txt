Mindless idiot who has inetersets in Iraq. Quess who built that nuclear reactor that Israel blew up years ago? It was France. Iraq owes French companies over 5 billion dollars. Why the hell did we fight for these idiots in WW2? The boycott of France has now begun. What ever happened to the quote you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours? The French obviously arent the most loyal people out there. I hope that we stay away and out of French business for a long time. UPDATE- Some folks think here that by simply electing Kerry as President, we would be best friends with France. Too bad its not like that. France hates us and they have hated us for years and I wouldn't have it any other way since I hate France.
