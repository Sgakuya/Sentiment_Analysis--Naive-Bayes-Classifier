Roger Staubach didn't set any statistical records for yardage or touchdowns relative to more current QB's but he did win more games for his team in the 1970's than any other QB in the decade. Dallas won more games than any other team during his tenure. Not one losing season. He didn't start for very many years (8) due to injury (1972) but did light it up for the short time his star did shine. No fiercer competitor ever played the game than Staubach. He simply never quit! When the NFL liberalized the passing rules during Staubach's last two seasons ('78 and '79), he lead the league in passing yardage and touchdowns. Just imagine what would've happened had he played in today's league. If Staubach continued to play in the 1980's, the Eagles don't go on to lose the Superbowl, the Niners don't win the NFL title in Jan '82, and the Redskins would lose to Dallas in the following years NFC title match. I've seen many great QB's play over the years and say, without hesitation, that Roger Staubach was the best of all. Just ask Elway and Young. Remember, Roger had the highest passer rating in NFL history when he retired; that includes Johnny Unitas. He most definitely doesn't get enough credit for his field accomplishments but if you ask Roger about it you'd find he's more than happy to give credit to everyone else. One of the finest men to play and the best role model a kid could have.
