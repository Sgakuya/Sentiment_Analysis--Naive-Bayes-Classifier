A bigoted nation by definition, Israel discriminates against all non Jews. Formed by terrorism and political manipulation, Israel is Satan's counterfeit. I have never been there but I heard on the news terrible things are going on in that country and around it. I also understand that America gives more foreign aid to that country than any other. I wonder why? NOT! But, anyway God Bless them. I am tried of telling people about them, but God said to stand up for what is right and to Bless your enemies. So God Bless. One last thing, that land is soooooo important now because it will be the landing site of a giant cubed shaped spaceship (REV 21:2-27). The Angels, Jesus, and even God will be in that ship and they will let some of us take from the 'tree of life' (REV 22:14). And a loud voice will proclaim Behold, God's dwelling is with the human race... (REV 21:3). So, of course, those in the know want to secure the future landing site of the Holy City . Those who now control Israel know this, and so should you. God Bless the Jews. And may God's dwelling soon arrive. A warning to those who would fight, Revelation points out that Satan is currently misleading the armies of the world to lead them into battle against the 'beloved city' (REV 20:8). They will be destroyed by the fire from heaven. So, don't go there to fight in an army. File your conscientious objector status now!!!
