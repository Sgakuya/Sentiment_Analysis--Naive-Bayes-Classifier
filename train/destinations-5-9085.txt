Most tourists (especially Westerners) see the Great Wall of China near Beijing (at Badaling). While it is my understanding that it is merely a popular myth that the Great Wall is the only manmade structure visible (to the naked eye) from space, this does not make it any less impressive. Most of the Wall is in ruins (largely due to disrepair and intentional destruction by Chinese governments until a relatively recent renaissance in interest in their own pre-communist history), but the section near Beijing has been reconstructed for both safety and to foster tourism. Despite the excessive commercialism (they sell t-shirts and other crap right beside and on the Wall itself), the view and sense of history is still present. Be forewarned that the climb up to and back down from the higher elevations on the Wall can be physically taxing for many visitors, as some sections are rather steep. For a bit of history, the genesis of the Great Wall dates to more than 2000 years ago as a manmade defense against the Hun and Mongol tribes of the Asian steppes; however, the structure didn't take its recognizable form until the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). To put this in a global cultural perspective, while Western Europe was entering the Age of Discovery and reaching out to a greater world (for good or ill), Chinese society was older and considered itself more mature; therefore, the Chinese looked inward exerting great resources trying to keep the rest of the world out. In some ways, these differing philosophies persist even today.
