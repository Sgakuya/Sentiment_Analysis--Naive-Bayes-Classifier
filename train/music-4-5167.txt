I love this cd. I am glad she converted to a pop-contry it sounds really cool with that little swedish swing that olle romo programmed into the cd. I love the dance-flav track holdin on to love.. and black eyes I also love the emoion put into the song when and form this moment on the song if yout wanna touch her,ask! is really cool becuase it sounds kinda dance-flavy ,but sounds better on the regluar version not he international version( the remixed version for int'l pop radio) I have to say that the regluar version is mostly better than the int'l version. I also love the track don't be stupid, you know I love ya and it sounds all jumpy and cool It's kinda hyper in a way. I love this cd and It's a cool one!
