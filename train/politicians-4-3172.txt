It seems to me that this site is dominated by Republicans and conservative democrats. Everyone has been unfair to Clinton. He's a human being, and I sort of liked seeing a human president. The affair business didn't interfere with his presidency, and he is NOT responsible for the flagging economy, which is not flagging as much as people seem to think it is. Clinton took us out of the rut that we were in after Bush's presidency, and I admire the way he handled himself during the investigation. He should never have been asked about his sex life. Being a good Christian was not his job, leading this country was, and under the circumstances, he did a good job. And I think you should stop with the name calling. Bush Jr. doesn't have such a swell record, and he's left more corpses behind him than Clinton.
