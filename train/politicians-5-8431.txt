I love how all the anti-Reagan idiots in here leave one sentence answers, and all the people who really know the great things he did for this country give lengthy opinions to back up their rating. If you know anything whatsoever, you know Reagan took the convictions he had for a lifetime to office and created policies which achieved most of his goals. No one told him what to do, he knew from Day 1 what he wanted to accomplish. Read a book if you don't believe me. And what were the results? The end of the Soviet Union, the longest expansion of the economy in peacetime history, low unemployment, low inflation, and stronger national pride. He wasn't perfect no, but the best President we've had since FDR. 5 stars easy.
