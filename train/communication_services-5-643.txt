Great service in the NYCity area-even get service underground in some subway locations. I have spoken with Cingular customer service about 5 times to ask questions and to add services and each time I have spoken with helpful and genuinely friendly representatives. I even had one representative spend over an hour with me to figure out my correct wireless internet settings. Made me feel like they actually valued me as a customer. All charges have been exactly as stated. Seems that most who have problems/complaints have not done their homework as to the specifics of their plans/options. I really enjoy my Motorola Razor V3 and the great service I receive. I have been pleasantly surprised with my new service. I must admit that I was happy with my previous Sprint service, but was wowed by Cingular's phone choices. Sprint was slightly less expensive and also had sufficient customer service (almost as friendly as Cingular).
