My hopes for George W. Bush's second term, in no particular order. 1) I hope that he makes an effort to bring the country back together - to be a President to all Americans, not just those that voted for him. 2) I hope that President Bush and his Republican Congress and Senate pass legislation because it is in the best interest of the country, not because they can. As demonstrated in the first term, a united government can pass just about whatever it wants - no matter how pork laden, no matter how special interest focused. I implore this government to begin taking their legislative powers / responsibilities seriously. 3) I hope that President Bush devotes some of his substantial political savvy for generating international support for our foreign policy initiatives - not only because of the massive costs involved, but because of the attractiveness of policy supported by legitimacy, as opposed to supported solely by brute force. 4) I would like to see President Bush move towards a more Reaganist, Big Tent philosophy of Republicanism, versus one that favors an idealogically extreme minority. 5) I hope that the President makes any Supreme Court nominations that might arise carefully. That's it. If the President can do these things, or even some of these things, I will wish him well.
