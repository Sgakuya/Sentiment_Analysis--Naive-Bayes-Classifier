In my opinion, one of the best albums of the 90's, and hands down the best end to end lyrics that I have ever heard. While it took a while for the piano driven music to grow on me, it's been in my steady rotation of CDs for the last couple of years - and I expect that it will stay there. I was introduced to this record by a girl I met in a bar who was wearing a shirt that said I was never cool in school, you probably don't remember me, with a silhoutte of a piano on it. Well I thought the girl was cool, I thought the shirt was cool, and god knows i wasn't cool in school either, so I thought I would give ben folds a try. In my opinion the best tracks on the album are The Last Polka and Where's Summer B? ... If you've never heard these guys and are up for trying something different, give this record a shot.
