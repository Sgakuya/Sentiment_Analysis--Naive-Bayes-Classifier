I am an American who has traveled enough to know that USA does not have too much to brag about. In our pursuit for money, it's like we forgot to remember the value of nice neighborhoods, a working infrastructure and a culture with real substance. Living in New York, I pay insane mortgage just to live in a city with some substance. We tried to make an ideal society and we have may have started out pretty good but now, we have steered way off track. Instead of great country, we have growing obesity, embarrassing racism, dirty cities that often do not even hold a candle to many European or even Canadian cities. I am so tired of reflexive patriotism. We need to fix this place up. We have a lot of problems to attend to.
