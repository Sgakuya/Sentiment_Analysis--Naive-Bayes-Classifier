One of my favorite things to do is watch rerun episodes of Party of Five on rainy afternoons. I have every episode taped from the very beginning. The perfect day starts off with me going down to the local sub shop, Parnello's, and I get the family meal deal. That is one sandwich, one soda and one chip. $6.95 value for only $4.50. Parmello's... So I get my food and I run back to my room and pop in a tape. I love the theme song. But why is there a line in the Party of Five theme song that says 'Closer to three'? That confuses me some of the times. Oh well. I saw Neve in a dirty movie where she showed her back naked while another girl showed her big boobies. Ren from Footloose was right in the middle of thiose two girls. I was eating a Parmello's family meal deal with a roast beef sub that day. I bet she smokes. Winston Lights. Non filter. Her eyes are bleary a lot. I like her still. I wish we could meet some day. You know what they say - 'Neve say Neve'.
