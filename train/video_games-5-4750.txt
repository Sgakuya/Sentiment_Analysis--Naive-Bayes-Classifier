I hesitate to fall victim to the machine's new graphical capabilities, and also to say that this is possibly the best looking game ever made. I've only played this at the store on their HD widescreen TV and I'm sure it would look alot different on a less expensive rig, but I almost crapped my pants when I played this. It is absolutely stunning, and the gameplay is excellent from what little I played of it. I didn't particularly like the fact that ther is no health bar, but I guess they're not really realistic, are they? Even if you're not a FPS fan, still go down to your local game store and take a look at the demo. It's amazing.
