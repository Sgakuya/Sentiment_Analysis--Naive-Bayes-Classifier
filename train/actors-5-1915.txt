Johnny Depp is charming, intelligent and down-to-earth. Based on what I know of him, he was a struggling rock star raised by a poor family who lived in hotel rooms in Florida. He did not go to acting school, as far as I know. Still, he is incredibly talented and unique, bringing more than directors intend to the characters he molds himself into. I like Johnny Depp, because he does what he wants to do and is not out to impress anyone. He is also not a chauvenist jerk, known for beating his girlfriends like so many of the so-called Hollywood hunks who gloat on themselves. Just thinking of Johnny Depp causes me to feel lightened and I get a smile on my face hearing his hair-brained Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas drama and wild portrayal of Ed Wood. What a brilliant actor!
