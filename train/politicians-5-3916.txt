I hope someone listen's to rush for ideas and help in the campaign. Stay hot after Gore and don't back down. In the debates please ask him what Clinto and Gore have done over the last 7 1/2 years about a energy policy, and what they have done to fix the medicare problem. How many bills have they offered to congress to help either of these problems. If his Healthcare is so good why is Canada in so much trouble with their health care. Why do so many Canadians that live near the boarders come across the borders for healthcare, if their program is so great. Thanks for being their and stay strong. we will be praying for you Thanks Ken Fisher
