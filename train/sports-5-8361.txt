Dwayne Wade and Shaq together reminds me of kobe and shaq!Dwayne is really developing and there is no doubt in my mind that in a couple of years, Dwayne will be a seasoned all-star veteren!!He already might be!!!He has a quick crossover and has already develped a great jumpshot! The only thing i'd say that Wade should work on is free-throws!So far he done a good job of GETTING to the line in the playoffs, but isn't hitting efficiently. He was like 9/17 at the line against the wizards in one playoff game this year where they almost blew the game. But like i said hes devloping and will be great off with shaq.
