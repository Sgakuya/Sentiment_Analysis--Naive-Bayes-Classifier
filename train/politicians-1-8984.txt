I'm constantly amazed at the Clintonites' ability to look the other way and/or completely ignore all the illegal and immoral behavior committed by Mr. and Mr.(sic) Clinton. It seems that the love that the Clintons receive must be due to the fact that they are practicing Democrats rather than anything positive they may have contributed to the Presidency. American politics is a mess, and I think that the Clintons are a prime example. Even the National Organization for Women stood up and applauded when Bill cheated on his wife and then lied to everyone about it. If the same thing happened to Dubya, I'm sure all the lefties would jump all over him and let us know what a horrible excuse for a human being he is. I'm not being hard on Bill just because his political leanings are opposed to my own. In fact, I was proud to see him win the first time. But then as more and more news of his various illegal activities came to light, I really felt disappointed. And when he sent troops to war without even consulting the U.N. I heard no cries of Evil! Unilateralism! Baby Killer! and so on. But today, so many democrats and socialists stand out in the street venting their hatred for Bush. Kinda makes me sick. Its unfortunate that the state of U.S. politics has sunk so low that nobody takes into account a President's morals or actions, but instead supports or debases him based soley upon party lines. I think in a few years when people realize that the Clinton time in office resulted in the greatest influx of criminals and terrorists into the US due to lax border controls, and that the President's personal exploits made America the laughing stock of the world, maybe some will realize their folly. But of course then it will be too late, and they'll be voting for some other Democrat who pretends to care about women and minorities and diversity. What a crock.
