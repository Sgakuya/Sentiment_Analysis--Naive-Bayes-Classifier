I don't understand why people don't read their contracts before signing them... In the years that I have worked in the cell phone industry, people would rather listen to someone give them the world for free rather than read the contract they are being binded to. Cingular, like Verizon, TMobile, Nextel, Sprint and the late AT&T Wireless, are all companies that do not make a habit of giving the world out to anyone because if they do then they have to do it for everyone. If they give me a $600 phone for free and I tell two friends and they tell two friends and so on, eventually within a contract time the company does not make money. Then they go out of business... Another thing ALWAYS GET INSURANCE! Even if you think it will never happen to you, it will and then you will hate the fact that you have to pay full price. Cingular as a company is a very good one. Just because you get an angry person on the phone that seems uncaring it does not mean that they are stupid or don't know what they are doing, it just means that they probably had someone yelling at them for something that they can't control on the call before. Another suggestions, when you go in a store make sure that it is COMPANY OWNED RETAIL and not an authorized agent. You are much less likely to be misled about anything and more likely to be serviced properly if something does go wrong. Just think if everyone did their and became educated about what they are signing this would be fine and most people would not have as many complaints.. Just think if you were signing a mortgage you would read it an understand before signing, right? Why not treat a cell phone contract the same way.
