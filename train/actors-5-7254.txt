I just saw the new movie Billy Zane stars in called Invincible, not only do I praise Mel Bibson and Jet Li for an absolute amazing production but I found that Billy playes his character perfect. The one thing missing from his performance is more emotion, but all in all the whole thing was incredibly awesome. I have aslo seen some of his other movies and I love what he can do with the charaters he plays. One minute he can be the caring humourous individual and the next a sadistic self-centered monster. It definitly shows us what actors lack in the industry today and that is the actaul talent which few like Billy Zane pocesses
