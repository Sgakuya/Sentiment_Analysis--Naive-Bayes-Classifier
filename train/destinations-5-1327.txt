To Bugaha, Germany started two world wars and quite rightly were made by the allies to understand what they had done and to learn by it. Through their guilt, hard work and economics this is what they have done, vowing never to take up arms in an invasion again. And now you're calling them wimps for not supporting the invasion of Iraq? What sort of double standard is that? Germany wanted an intelligent method of disposing of Saddam since it is well aware of the pain and strife caused by war -that's all. But America didn't listen. That doesn't make Germany wrong. It's a great country and America could learn a lot from it, not least of all it's transport infrastructure.
