Qwest of Denver, Colorado has by far had the absolute worst customer service that I have ever encountered in my life. Over the years of being a customer (due to their monopolistic structure resulting in few alternatives), my wife and I tried to pass off a couple bad service experience as being isolated. Unfortunately, these negative experiences turned out to be more common than expected. As a result, we simply and completely dropped their services about six months ago and replaced them with Vonage, Dish TV, and a local microwave Internet service provider. The telecom aspect of our life is so much easier and less expensive now. In short, I would tell anyone to find an alternative option to Qwest in their area. It could potentially save you some headaches and money.
