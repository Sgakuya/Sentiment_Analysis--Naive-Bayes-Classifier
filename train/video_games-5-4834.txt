Ok im Sam (The greatis Halo 2 player of all time) if you have never heard of this game lisen to me now. U lisening? OK, this first person shooter game is a GOD for me i worship it. And you know why? The guns, dual weild, tanks, warwogs, the maham, the chaos, the destruction, the XBOX LIVE, the glory and the pride of beating your friends online... did i say guns yet anyway multiplayer get 140% although the story it self, the starting all good and fun but about half way though a litle boring, around the end confused and very boring because it the same thing all over again and confusing because this giant plant guy comes out of nowhere and its just confusing so i give 60%. In conclusion this game is not exacly fun when it comes to the story but the multiplayer is so freaken awsome its worth it.
