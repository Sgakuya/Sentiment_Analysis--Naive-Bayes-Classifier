If you did a poll of overrated actors in Hollywood, Tom Cruise would be somewhere high in the poll. Cruise is certainly capable of a good performance - Risky Business, Top Gun, Born on the Forth of July, A Few Good Men, Collateral ....but overall he's cranked out some so-so to weak movies - a lot for such a big box office star. He also doesnt do comedies. *****UPDATE******* Cruise is a good actor. Better than you'd think really. He's done a number of movies that were hyped up because he's in them. But based on his talents- he's good. Cruise doesnt do comedies and hasnt done any TV work but he's become a major actor so he doesnt have to. Has Katie Holmes as a girlfriend now. Nice catch, even if she is quite a bit younger than him. His trademark smile is a bit annoying.
