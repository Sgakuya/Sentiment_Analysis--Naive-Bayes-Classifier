What a great old city; full of historical tales, charm, fascinating well-kept and loved architecture and lots of things to do and see. To get your bearings and some background information, you might want to start out by taking a tour of the city on a horse-drawn carriage ride. Then check out one of the many interesting and excellent open-air restaurants tucked away in mysterious little vine-covered alcoves. Top it off with some shopping in the marketplace where, among many other things, you can find some unique handcrafted items. Very relaxing and well worth the two-day stop we made on a return trip from Florida one spring.
