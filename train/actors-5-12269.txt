I THINK THAT HALLE BERRY IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN THE WORLD. SHE IS AN OUTSTANDING ACTRESS WHO I BELIEVE REPRESENTS NOT ONLY BLACK AMERICAN WOMEN, BUT HER OWN MOTHER AS WELL. PEOPLE CRITISIZE HER FOR EMBRACING HER BLACK SIDE. SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW IN AMERICA. IN THIS COUNTRY, SOCIETY DETERMINES YOUR RACE BASED ON YOUR APPEARANCE. IF SHE EMBRACES THAT PART OF HER,THEN SO WHAT. IF ISSUES AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT COLOR, THEN WHY IS IT AN ISSUE WHEN IT'S DONE BY BLACK AMERICANS. SHE IS JUST AS TALENTED AS JULIA ROBERTS, MIRA SORVINO, OR ANY OTHER ACTRESS IN HOLYWOOD. MONSTER'S BALL MAY NOT BE HER BEST WORK, BUT THE MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY DON'T ALWAYS REWARD SOMEONE FOR THIER BEST WORK. ONE PERSON CRITISIZED HER FOR LETTING HERSELF BE ABUSED. NO ONE LETS THEMSELF BE ABUSED. AS FAR AS THE AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT, PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES, AND SHE DID HAVE TO FACE UP TO WHAT HAPPENED IN A COURT OF LAW. SHE IS WORTHY OF ALL THE ACCOLADES SHE IS RECIEVING. IF HER RECIEVING AN OSCAR, OPENS DOORS FOR OTHER BLACK ACTRESSES, THEN SO BE IT. I'M A FAN, I'M A FAN, I'M A FAN.
