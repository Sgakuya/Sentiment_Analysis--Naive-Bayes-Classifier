I guess it depends on what your reason is for eating cereal in the first place - to load yourself up with sugar or to have something relatively healthy for breakfast. Although I agree with those who say that shredded wheat tastes a bit like cardboard or sawdust, it's really not all that bad, even without sugar sprinkled over it. All of us have certain tastes we are avers to - my dislikes are liver and cilantro, in particular. As a good for you breakfast, shredded wheat with milk (low fat, of course!) is pretty high on the list. The coffee I have after it probably screws up all of the good I have done by eating the cereal.
