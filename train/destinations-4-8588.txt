Yeah, i've tried Grizzly Wintergreen and Natural and thats where i am going to stop. they are allright, but way too salty and they dry my mouth out like nutz. but yeah, they do pack well and provide long lasting flavor. If you wanna dip grizzly, make sure you do it only 3 times a day or else you'll be drinking gallons of water....... i dont do mint flavor at all because it reminds me of a time i dipped kodiak ICE after drinking half a 5th of 80 proof liquor, then swallowing the dip and puking it up. yep, i tasted that smokeless mint all the next day over and over again...right next to the toilet.......i can stand skoal mint pouches, but thats about all. i'll post a review of the new Red Seal Black Cherry if i can find it update: i've decided to keep my tin of grizzly wintergreen just because of the buzz it gives you......i'll only use it once a while due to the after effects on the gums!!!!!!!!!!!!!
