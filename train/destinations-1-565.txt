While Old San Juan has many interesting attractions, their own people treat the island like it is their trash can. They keep their houses impeccable but they trash the beaches on the weekend. Not just trash but with loud, obnoxious music that they seem to think everyone is going to enjoy. Crime is a big problem. While I was there, the manager and cook of the Outback Restaurant in the Wyndham Casino were murdered during a robbery and there was a man killed and a woman wounded on the streets of Old San Juan. There is a drug war raging and to date (4/27/2004) there have been 281 murders. If you want to see PR, stay someplace away from San Juan. There are plenty of beautiful beaches around the island, just stay away from them on the weekends when the locals trash them. I was amused to read Cottonmouth's review below. He is obviously one of the 'independentistas who think that their opinions count. Fortunately, the 'independentistas' compromise an insignificant 5% of the population. They just make a lot of noise and whine about how much better things would be if they were an independent nation. 5% does not make a plurality and PR will never voluntarily elect to become independent. Cottonmouth...isn't that what you get from smoking weed?
