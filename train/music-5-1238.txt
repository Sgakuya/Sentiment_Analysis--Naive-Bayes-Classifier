Liz Phair may not have the popularity of, say, Gwen Stefani or the poetic tendencies of Tori Amos but Exile In Guyville has got to be one of the most brilliant albums (and Liz Phair one of the most brilliant musicians) to emerge out of the whole 'Altera-Hip' scene. Her talent doesn't reside in her mall-rat voice, but in her ability to write and play songs from adequate to awesome! In Exile In Guyville , every song from 6 1 to Strange Loop exhibits Phair's talent as a guitar player and lyric writer, and every song is worthy enough to be listened to and not skipped over on your CD player. But the most impressive thing about Exile... is that Liz is so raw and straightforward and is never apologetic for what she says.
