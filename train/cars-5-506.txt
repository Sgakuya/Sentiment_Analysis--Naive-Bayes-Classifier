GSX-Red my god are you delusional!!! There is only one thing you said that I agree with Its about the ride. Remember the ride entails mechanical as well as environmental elements that together make up the experience. There is no finer way to experience both of these elements than on a Harley. The Harley lets you know that you are a part of the experience. Listen if I want to go 110 mph on a machine I'll ride a roller coaster, its safer. Which brings me to the question how can you possible be enjoying the experience when you going to fast to take it all in. I do not disparage anyone from buying foreign it is a personal choice. I have had Japanese motorcycles and they are well engineered and are of the best quality, but somehow I always felt as though the bike and I were seperate. Its not the destination that we remember it's the journey.
