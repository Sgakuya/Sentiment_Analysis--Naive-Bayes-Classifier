I think that Dianne Feinstein is a fine legislator; albeit I do not agree with her on some issues. She is posed, intelligent and is relatively independent when making decisions. Let us remember that she did vote for the Bush tax cut which is project to spur the overall GNP by 1/2, that is significant. Senator Feinstein did the right thing despite taking heat from her own party. She isn't the most liberal Democrat and that is good, just like I think it isn't good to be the most conservative Republican. I'm not for the mushy moderates, but you do have to have principle. Dianne Feinstein has it, she does what she thinks is right for her country.
