***8/18/04 Update: The Phillies have dropped 5 in a row now, are 2-8 over their last 10 games, and are in 5th place (6 games back) in the wild card race. Bowa isn't totally to blame (Burrell, Wagner, Millwood, and Madsen are all injured and badly missed), but he still has to go. This is a team that, 5 months ago, popular opinion had taking the division without breaking a sweat. 4 -albeit key- injuries shouldn't ruin our chances like this. That said, I still haven't lost hope. **5/20/04 Update: If Burrell continues to hit well, and if Wagner can stay healthy once he's off the DL, I think the Phillies have as good a shot at going all the way as any team in the league. *OC: I've been a loyal fan for my entire life. Some of my fondest all-time best sports-related memories are of sitting in the nose-bleed seats at the Vet during the '93 play-offs. There are times when I find myself wondering about some trade incentives but all in all, I have never lost respect for the fightin's. I may be a minority on this one...
