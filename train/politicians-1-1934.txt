Ah, yes, the presidential wanna-be who does a TREMENDOUS job of polishing his brother's size 10-W (no pun intended) Dingos with the finest chads votes can buy. I believe Jebbie visited the Hispanic and black sections of numerous Florida towns and cities to encourage his denizens to get their votes out while figuratively directing these punchcards towards the landfills. (Located in minority neighborhoods, of course.) Here's a fine specimen of a Re-smug-lican who would sell his citrus-drenched soul to perplex the recount and encourage Floridians to wearily state, Oh, Jesus, let's just stop this! I wanna go home! Look, let's say Dubya won, we'll get Jebbie off our backs, and no more of these friggin' chads! What a pain in the ass! Let Tallahassee and the Supreme Kangaroo Court decide this! So, Jebbie was witness to two statewide travesties: the recount, and himself. Now he says he might either want to run again for governor or maybe even for president. After all, he's a Bush. Entitlement is one word he understands. Disenfranchisement is the other, to the tune of countless minority votes. Way to go, Florida Re-smug-licans.
