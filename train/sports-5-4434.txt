Thank you Ninobene for articulating the difference between Mike Krzyzewski, and say Bob Huggins. Coach K takes young men, actual student athletes, and molds them into a team that is USUALLY greater than the sum of its parts. You have also illustrated what makes NCAA football superior to NCAA basketball, it is not a just a farm system for the pros. The number of NCAA All-World players that dominate the NBA is miniscule. I don't know of any contract the Nothing But Attitude league had with the NCAA to develope studs for them.Perfect examples of what Coach K is are: Bobby Hurley, Christian Laetnner, Cherokee Parks, and Trajan Langdon. None of these players had the individual skill to be a dominant player at the NBA level, and were ONLY significant in college because they adhered to K's tutlege. I am a die-hard NCAA fan, and will readily defend coaches such as K, Tubby Smith, Eddie Sutton, Lute Olson, all men who are a credit to their craft.
