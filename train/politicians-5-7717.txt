I do not understand why this man is not number one on the list. He led a brand new country recouperating from war and full of opinionated, idiotic hot heads for eight years without killing himself. In addition, he got that country throught the first eight years using a completely new governmental system that had never been used in the modern world. You don't get much more amazing than that!!! He didn't want the power, and that kind of person is the only good leader. He did not abuse his power and he left at the right time. In response to the fact that Washington owned slaves, slavery was a morally and socially accepted part of life, espically in Virginia where Washington grew up. Slavery was not viewed as evil and immoral institution as it is today. It is not fair to blame a man for the views and morals of his day. I'm not defending slavery, just the fact that we can't blame Washington for it. The world has not seen since such a morally guided and righteous leader. Washington was an amazing man, probably of the likes the world will not see again. We owe a lot to the man, especially our respect and gratitude.
