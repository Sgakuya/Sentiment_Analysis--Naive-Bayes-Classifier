the Micosukee indian Village and the Micosukee Gaming Casino..are not one of the same..The Casino has great prices eg. $6.99 for Steak and Lobster tail..for starters..great service..and free entertainment..from some of our most loved stars of the 50-60's...and it's free... Also some great Stars..at the Dome ..for a very small ticket price...And it's located right across from Dade Corners previously known as the FROG POND on the Trail and 177 Ave. The Village is about 25 miles west on the trail..and there is no gambling or slot machines...It's a wonderful spiritual experience where you can walk on sacred grounds..and listen to the beating of the drums at a mystical and almost celestial rythym. There is a shop at the entrance and the jewelry and art are all unique and original...i go every time i get a chance.
