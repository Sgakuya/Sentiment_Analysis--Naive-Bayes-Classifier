"They call me Mr. Tibbs." This guy is a fantastic actor and needs to be near the top. A liberal or Anti-American... maybe, but he isn't really from here. He grew up in poverty in the Bahamas. In fact he has been the Bahamian ambassador to Japan for about a decade. Not an honorary thing... the real deal. And he's the Ambassador for the Bahamas to the UN for UNESCO. More or less a UN peace group formed by France that achieves peace via education and science. He was also appointed a "Knight of the British Empire." Nope this wasn't an honorary thing either, he's a real Knight. The Bahamian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists him as "His Excellency Sir Sidney Poitier." So we really don't have someone here like a perpetual adolescent "I hate America" Alec Baldwin trying to gain respect from his peers that are also dropouts. IOW, I give Poitier a break for his political views.
