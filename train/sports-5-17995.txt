Let me be the FIRST to say that this team has the most loyal fans in the NFL. There may not be many of them, but true Cardinals fans are one-of-a-kind. They never give up hope, they don't dwell on the fact that our only football championship came in 1947 b/f the formation of the NFL. What we dwell on is the FUTURE. We're 4-6, got a great coach, and an awesome running back whom NO ONE thought he would be on his way to getting 1,000 yards as a Cardinal, including me. We have quite a future ahead of us, that much is clear. The real question here is who WOULDN't want to be a big red fan??? -Cardinals fan for LIFE. GO CARDINALS.
