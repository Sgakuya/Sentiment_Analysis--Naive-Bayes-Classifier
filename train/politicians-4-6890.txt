Dear Mr. Lott: Hello, I lived in Mississpi for seven years and when I hit a big problem you were there. I also met you in Greenville, at Jim's Cafe. Mr. Lott, I have written my representatives now that I am back home in Virginia and I am contacting you as the majority leader. Mr. Lott, surely I am not the only one that is thoroughly disgusted with the elections and the behaviour of Mr. Gore and his entourage. If, and unfortunately I believe it will, it comes down to the legislature deciding the outcome of the election, I sincerely hope they will include the actions of the candidates. One certainly must wonder how such tactics would be viewed by foreign dignitaries and working for peace in different parts of the world. After such fiasco, could Mr. Gore be taken seriously in anything that he did? Thank you for letting me bring my feelings to you. Sincerely Theresa Quiggins.
