Seattle is a great city with a good lifestyle...healthy lifestyle..lots of outdoor activities,...a great education experience with a lot of colleges and research facilities in this city. Coffee...I could care less about it since I don't drink coffee. The people here are very open-minded, and friendly than other big cities I've visited in the US. The downside...it's cloudy...somewhat depressing making it difficult for me to get up in the mornings. Seriously..there were several occassions where I went to work late because I got up an hour late!! Traffic is getting worse here....as there is no decent mass transit system. Nevertheless, the beautiful air..fresh air!!..the sceneries...the people...all take the cake for an excellent city!!
