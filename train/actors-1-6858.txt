Yes what is the deal with the man? He's borish at best. He's overweight,bald,gray,acne scars,short,and has poor facial features. He's arrogant,racist and single dimensional as an actor.He stands out for his matcho insecure ego persona which oddly we as a society like.He is the matcho entry in our strange American taste medly for the uninspired as follows:Woopi Goldberg,Oprah Winfrey,and Roasanne Bahr.I guess its cool for insecure men to look up to him, and unhappy romantic looser women like him because he is an anti character in comparison to the pretty boys of their jilted past. Your guess is as good as mine.
