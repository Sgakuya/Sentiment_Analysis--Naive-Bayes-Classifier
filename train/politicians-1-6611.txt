If I ever meet the chicken patty Buchanan, will one of you please remind me to pretend that I am George Bush Sr. and he is a Japanese statesman. This way, I will have a good excuse for throwing up on him. Is there a rating for disgusting, religious fanatical, womanizing, racist, sexist, homophobic, escaped asylum patient, thinks-he's-God's-gift-to-mankind-but-is-really-Satan's-gift to-destruction-of-all-the-good-in-this-world, flat out STUPID jerk who thinks he can run for president ? If not, think of this one star as just that rating. I'd be willing to bet that he watches Teletubbies just like Jerry Falwell and watches for gay role models. Time for him to go away and leave me alone.
