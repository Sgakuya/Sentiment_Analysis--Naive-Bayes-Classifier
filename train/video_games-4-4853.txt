One of the most highly-anticipated games ever, its release date pushed back so many times, it had BETTER be worthwhile. And, judging from preliminary play, it's at least as good as the original. I'm not a big fan of FPS's (first-person shooters), but hell, I'll give it a shot. Graphics are excellent, though it's not that much greater than the original Halo game. The customization is a nice touch, but it's just bells 'n' whistles. Because I'm NOT big on FPS's in general, it's kind of hard to get the controls down, but it's not that much different than other games of its genre as far as that goes. And for storyline? Well, I'll tell you when I get there. As it stands now, it's a 4: At least as good as the original, but hasn't shown me anything too new . . . yet. We'll see if it gets a 5 as gameplay goes on.
