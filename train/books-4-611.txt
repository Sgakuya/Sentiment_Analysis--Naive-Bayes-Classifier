Good but depressing. About the Baulbedere children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny who were orphaned at the very beginning of the book. This is actually a series of books. Our son and I have read the first two. The kids parents are rich and they are make wards of this bad man who is an actor and only wants the fortune he is mean to the kids and they must convince MR Poe the man who oversees the fortune and the kids well being that they are in danger. These kids are going to spend the rest of their childhood fighting for survival against the bad guys trying to get the fortune.Everytime they find happiness it is only temporary because someone comes along to make their lives dangerous and miserable. this is not a happy ending book. Lemony Snicket the writer even reminds the readers that there are no happy endings in his book.A pretty original book to read if you do not mind not having happy endings. One good thing is the kids get to be the heros, and problem solvers.
