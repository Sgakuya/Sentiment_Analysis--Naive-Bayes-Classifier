It makes me laugh when I hear people say things like All he did was hit homeruns. No, all people talk about is Ruth hutting homeruns and all the highlights you ever see is Ruth hitting homeruns, but he did much more than that. A younger Ruth led the league in triples once or twice (going from memory on that, could be wrong) and was a decent fielder. People also seem to forget that Ruth started out as a pitcher and was a pretty darm good one. Yes, he ate to much, he drank to much, and he partied to much, but the fact that he could do all those things and still dominate the sport says just how good he was. As far as homeruns, even if that was all there was to the man, he was hitting 50 and 60 when 10 or 15 was considered a lot.
