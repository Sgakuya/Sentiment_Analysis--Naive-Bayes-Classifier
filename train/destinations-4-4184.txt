Ever see the movie Defending Your Life? Remember Judgement City? A very ordinary city that had everything a city would have yet had no character or anything to distinguish itself from anywhere else. It was always 75 degrees and sunny as well. We'll that's kinda like what Charlotte is. There's just about every business/franchise in the USA there. It's clean, neat and has all the requisite elements of a city yet there's no sense of place. There also are a lot of transplants from around the country there. So many that it doesnt really feel like The South as I've come to know it. Still, it's a great place to live - very affordable , esp. if you have a family. It's landlocked though.
