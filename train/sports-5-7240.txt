Oscar lead his highschool team to the first ever Indiana state championship team from the city of Indianapolis. He lead them to the first ever undefeated season in the state of Indiana. Like Rick Mount he got the points before the 3 point shot was invented. His Pro career was stifled by his management at Cincinnati and he finally got the championship at Milwaky(Spl). In his days there was no 3 point line but he got the points and triple doubles anyway. Those were different times so you can't compare Oscar with Jorden and Jorden would be the first to say so. He didn't miss many shots cause How do you block a fade-away shot?
