This man is destroying the whole world and bringing other countries that dont deserve it with him! This guy has shown that he can make a few speeches, lockdown the Whitehouse, and send troops over to Iraq. That pretty much it. He is destroying relations with everyone, and making more countries dislike him AND America also. I am sick of hearing this guy show off the power of the U.S by nuking something. That's all he wants to do! Is show that America is the best and most powerful nation in the world by throwing nukes left and right. Did you know if that at least 8 nukes hit the world simutaneously in different areas, that the whole Earth will split in half, and then what? BANG! there goes the Earth. Face it, this guy has 0 in diplomacy and doesnt do much to improve it. The Canadians are sick of the Americans and your/their arrogance to the rest of the world. Also Arabs and Muslims in third world countries have 0 tolerance for Bush or the U.S take into some consideration Mr. Presidant that diplomacy is #1, War is #2. Diplomacy is more important than anything else because it can STOP WARS, and it can also stop deaths in the world. If this whole Iraq thing continues, then the world WILL split in half and World War III will most likely break out, and the top contenders: America and Iraq with the Arabic and Muslims most likely supporting Iraq and not America. Only Britan will side with America, Canada might side with America but I have my doubts, most people would not like a war, and Mr.President is asking for one to show the world how strong his nuclear bombs are.
