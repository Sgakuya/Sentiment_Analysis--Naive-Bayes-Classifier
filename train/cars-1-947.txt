What can I say about the Accord that hasn't already been said? Dull, boring, ugly, and cheaply built seem to sum it up, but let me explain further. I had test driven a 1988 Honda Accord when I was searching out a first car back in 1997. I had heard good thing about Hondas and thought to try them out. Boy was I ever sorry! The test drive proved the car to be a rattletrap because lots of loose trim pieces were on the verge of falling off. The materials on the seats felt very cheap and were uncomfortable. The whole car felt like it was going to fall apart! Thinking Honda improved, I test drove a 2004 Accord top of the line EX-V6. Sadly, the leather felt like vinyl, the dashboard had a buzz in it, and the material felt cheap, especially the plasticy door handles. All in all, while I'm sure the Accord is a nice car and I just got bad examples, you'd probably be better off with something better built.
