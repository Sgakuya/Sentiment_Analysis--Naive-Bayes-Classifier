I absolutly loath CVS the one in my area is terrrible. The staff in the pharmacy department are grossly incompetent and have no people skills what-so-ever! They will tell you that they are out of a certain drug only to have you call and get your doctor to call in a change the script so they can tell him "oops we just couldnt find it earier". This is only one of many horror stories i can tell about CVS, once the phamacist on staff asjed me what my perscription number was for a certain drug i was requesting and i told her i didnt know it off hand but it was in their system because i had, had it filled with them previously. She snorted back "well my telephone number is in the phone book!" at this point i asked to speak to the manager, but it was futile the same woman still treats me this way whenever i encounter her in the store. Also i find that in my location the shelves are constantly barren and on at least 2 occasions i have purchased make-up that was past its expiration date.
