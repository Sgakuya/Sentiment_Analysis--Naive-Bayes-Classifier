Malone being ranked behind guys like Barkley and Robinson is a crime, as is his rating at number 19. The most consistent player to ever play the game, nobody ever played at such a high level for as long as this guy. A monster offensively and deceptively great on defense, in particular as far as his strength and quick hands. One of the very best low post players to ever play, a master at drawing fouls and amazing as far as running ability. Even today he outruns most other players and he's 40 years old! The only reason Malone doesn't rank higher on this site is because so many hate him beacuse of his dirty play over the years, but in his prime in the 90's he was the second bset player ine the league, only behind Jordan, which would be the one thing to haunt his legacy).
