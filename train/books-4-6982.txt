The Silmarillion is a wonderful companion to fill in all the prehistory and gaps for the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and The Hobbit. As other comments have noted, the genesis of the book were the unfinished notes and works of J.R.R. Tolkien which were compiled and finished by his son Christopher. While the Lord Of The Rings was a true, self contained story, The Silmarillion is more a collection of interrelated short stories which means less character development and several inconsistencies. Nevertheless, the stories concentrate on the origins of Middle Earth, the history of the elves, and how this fictional world was affected by the famed jewels called the Silmarils. The elves are revealed as much more flawed and human than they are portrayed in the trilogy.
