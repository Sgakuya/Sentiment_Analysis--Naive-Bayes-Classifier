Horrid country with no moral backbone with people who act so polite on the outside but would as soon stab you in the back. Overcrowded, polluted. Perverts everywhere, I've heard of young girls getting fondled and touched on the bus and subway by men many times. The country's economy is collpasing, they wouldn't even have one if the U.S. didn't help them out after WWII. Highest suicide rate in the world due to pressure in society and overwork. Parents don't even raise their children, families hardly spend any time together. I'm surprised the country hasn'tcollapsed yet,the signs are showing though.The Japan economy is but a shadow of it's former self.
