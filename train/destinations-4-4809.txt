Quito is an incredible city that mixes the southern portion (the old) with the northern (the new) city. The quality of food at even an average restaurant is great. If you would like to avoid getting sick, I would not eat from street vendors, have anything served with ice, no salads and drink only bottled beverages. I recommend traveling in pairs and using common sense. Ladies from the U.S., when your out late at night partying, don't get into cars with strangers, as Ecuadorian men, in general, believe you are easy and will expect more than a good night kiss. You may get yourself into more than you can handle. Maybe that sounds great to you-but, remember this. AIDS (SIDA) positive men and women is at an alarming high. Much of this is based on culture and the fact that protected sex is not common and prostitutes are plentiful and inexpensive. Wearing jewelry-even if its worth nothing if it looks like something-It can be pulled from your ears. Going out at night can be fun but also has many hazards. Travel during the day is best. Any Northern Americans going-please keep in mind that there is no such thing as pedestrian crossings. Cars do not stop when you decide you want to cross the road. Despite the poverty, Quito has a lot to offer. The people are warm and kind and will take their time to help you. Pack for all seasons as the weather and temp change drastically from morning, noon, and night. Remember, when traveling you always represent more than yourself.
