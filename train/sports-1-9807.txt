I absolutely loathe this team, and I honestly don't understand how anyone could like them. I was absolutely thrilled when the Spurs knocked 'em out of the playoffs the other night; there really should be nation-wide parties to celebrate such an occasion. As I've mentioned on here before, Kobe Bryant is an over-rated, cocky showboat, Rick Fox reminds me of a curly-haired ass, Robert Horry is a talentless waste of space that mistakenly thinks he's God's gift to basketball, and Shaq is just a huge, nasty, ugly beast whom you can't gaurd without getting called for a foul; his free throw shooting reminds me of myself in about the 3rd grade, and if it weren't for his inhuman size, he would be cleaning fish for a living because he is absolutely talentless. And I DARE anyone to tell me otherwise.
