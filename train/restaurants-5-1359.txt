I agree with the person who works for Sonic in Florida I believe. I used to work for Sonic in College Station, Texas. Home of the Texas A&M Aggies. Our Sonic was so slammed constantly (thanks to the college kids), I am surprised half the people even got their order. But we always managed. Lots of times, we did get yelled at for not having an order out in time, and I got my pay docked for that. It is not easy, like it was said, skate when you never really knew how to skate... especially down slopes carrying a tray of food and drinks. Some people can't even walk without tripping and we are on skates. Not only that, half the time, we had 3 to 4 people working up front, and 1 or 2 cooks. The 3 to 4 was 1 of them did drive thru, the rest of us were bagging food, making drinks, filling ice, carhopping, taking orders, making icecreams, and trying to cut limes and keep up the supply of stuff, we had to do credit card and "aggie bucks" and lastly, getting yelled at by our boss for not being faster. So please, next time you are at Sonic, have a little patients. This is not McDonald's where there are 15 people up front just taking orders and that is it. We are the job, we are what makes Sonic strong. Remember that and quit complaining.
