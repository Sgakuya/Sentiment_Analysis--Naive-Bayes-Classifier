oh please, Alexander has to face the cupcake NFC West teams while LT had play the harder teams . Lets compare. When Alexander played the Redskins he had 98 yards on 20 carries on an OT loss. When Tomlinson played the Redskins he practically doubled that and had that run to win for the team in OT. Alexander played the Giants and had 110 yards on 31 carries(3.1 YPC) and one TD. Tomlinson had more yards (192) in less carries (21, making it a 7.2 YPC) and 4 TDs (one of them a passing). They both did a lousy job against Dallas, but Tomlinson still had more yards on less carries an SA. The only time LT had a worse day than Alexander facing the same team was Philly, which had a bizarre 7 yards (mostly because of his bad O-line) which the Eagles had two weeks to focus on stopping LT. If you're thinking why Alexander has more TD's than LT, it's pretty obvious, he has obviously a better line. Having Walter Jones and Hutchinson helps his game so much. So his whole left side is better, it makes them wanting to run left all the time so the defense knows he's mostly going to run it to the left right? Wrong, Holmegren just calls trap, counter-trap to bring in Hutchinson to the play. Go to Alexander's player page on ESPN and scroll down to the bottom. On one of the headline articles it says he's running against a dominating O-Line, one of the reasons why he's on set to break the TD mark. Don't get me wrong Shaun's a great back, but no LT. LT has no weaknesses, he is the most complete back there is in the NFL. I think people in here already made my comments for LT.
