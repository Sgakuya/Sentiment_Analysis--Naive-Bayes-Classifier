A very solid Vodka for the money. There is some truly nasty cheap vodka out there, so you do have to be careful. Nothing extremely fancy about this brand, just a good vodka. Like in my rating of Smirnoff, this tastes pretty much like nothing, which is really what I prefer from a Vodka. Most importantly, it does well in either mixed drinks or in shots, with it going down nice and smooth and much less likely to get a bad hangover like you'd get with some of the other cheap vodkas out there. (of course in moderation you could avoid this problem with any vodka ;-) Now a note about the flavoured vodkas. I have tried Vanilla and Orange, both are fine as far as mixes go, but as far as shots go I'd suggest you stay away from the orange. Burns like hell after a few seconds. Vanilla makes good shots however. And as always, make sure it is well chilled before serving.
