It's amazing of all the people who bash Florida and give it a bad rating, to each is their own but with the number of people who move to Florida each day at 1,000, it seems that that alone speaks in volumes. To say the overall quality of life is less then average is totally ignorant. Humidity comes with the terrority and you can't even escape it during the summer months in the northern states. Dry heat is wonderful isn't it? With dried out sinus passages, dry chapped skin, dehydration and static electricity shocks being a daily nuisance. If you think that is easier to live with then a little sweat, then knock yourself out. Air Conditioning is as common in Florida as Heat is during the winter months up North, if you live near the coast you will get a nice daily breeze, further inland yes it can be brutal. It all depends where you live, but it's the people who don't live in Florida who aren't use to it that complain. Some parts of Florida are getting overcrowded, especially South Florida, housing is a problem, that is expensive to either rent or buy. Traffic and Crime varies where you live but with more people comes more issues. It's a tough place to make a living and jobs (good ones) are sparse and salaries are below average. With the rising cost of living and lack of high paying jobs, some parts of Florida are becoming very hard to live in for the average Joe. Everybody want's a piece of the pie, but all that's left is the crumbs. 5 stars for great weather, beautiful beaches, Palm trees and etc. especially from October thru May when the rest of America with a few exceptions is staring at gray skies and frozen blocks of ice.
