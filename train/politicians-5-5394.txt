After watching the debates I know for sure that Al Gore is the best candidate for the presidency of the US. He obviously has the experience necessary and will fight for important issues like the environment and education. GW is in favor of drilling in pristine wilderness area in alaska. So I wonder who his ties are to? Big Oil? Daddy's friends in big oil? Gore has shown through his leadership and character that he can do the best job to run the country. And Bush's tax-cut plan for 5% of 1.2 trillion over the next 10 years for the american people. Well...the math isn't fuzzy. That comes out to a measly $23 per year. Is that really worth it when we can invest that money in programs like education and saving the environment? I think not.
