Greg Schiano is THE opportunity for Rutgers to gain credibility and breakthrough into big time college football. He has done a superb job in connecting with the state of NJ, NJ HS coaches and the media. He definitely has shown (and continues to show) that he is learning to be a head coach. His in game decision making and adjustments are lacking. His choice of staff has been brilliant and terrible at the same time. We should be proud that he has remained as upbeat, resolute and consistent in his vission and expectations of the program. When he starts to win game with coaching decisions, we will be hoping to hold on to him.
