Probably the most over-rated athlete in the history of sports. Owes nearly all of his success to a brutish style of "tackle basketball" and the fact a dunk still counts as two points in the N.B.A. His signature move (two two-footed hops and lowering his shoulder while exploding into his oppenents like Larry Csonka) is the product of a league that no longer regards the established rule book in favor of marketing their product to a fan base desensitized by rap music and "reality television." This overweight, underconditioned 'superstar' would die of a heart attack if he had to chase Russell, Chamberlain, or Robert Parrish up and down the court for forty minutes a game. His work-ethic is revealed by his lack of success at the free throw line and the amount of time that he spends on the disabled list for every hang nail that he suffers. Gladiators show up in the arena when it's their day to fight. Shaq stays home and makes bad records.
