I can't believe more people aren't jumping on this guy's bandwagon. In my opinion there's a top tier of running backs: Shaun Alexander, LaDainian Tomlinson, Larry Johnson, Tiki Barber, and Warrick Dunn (Edgerrin James is just getting alot of yards because his team is leading in all of those games). To say he belongs with company like that illustrates precisely how highly I think of him. At the time I'm writing this he's averaging 5.1 yards a carry, better than any other top 10 back (Larry Johnson being barely behind with 5.0). Yardage wise he already has 1174 yards, a career best with 4 games left to play, even while he's splitting carries (the Falcons have two other players with 300+ yards, Vick [470] and Duckett [341]). There's only one major downside to Dunn. He hasn't pounded out alot of touchdowns. In fact, he only has 4 touchdowns (3 rushing, 1 recieving). That's because of Atlanta's system. Dunn unselfishly lets the team pound out short yardage situations with the bigger, stronger back T.J. Duckett (who has 6 rushing TDs). To be honest, if I were a coach I'd love to have such a generous, unselfish player helping to lead my team like Warrick Dunn. Dunn is a great example of a great person. He fully deserved the NFL Man of the Year award. UPDATE: I'm glad to see he got a ProBowl trip this year, because he deserved it.
