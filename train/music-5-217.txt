Fan-f**king-tastic album, not a bad song on it. A dreamy opening with 'Planet Telex', kick ass rock 'Bends', indie anthem 'High Dry', heartfelt 'Plastic Flowers' - before picking up a gear again into 'Bones' then back down to the ethereal '[Nice Dream]'. And that's just the 1st half!! 'Course then you've got 'Just' 'Iron Lung' which are the two songs that first converted me to Radiohead. Brilliant - they plead, they wail, they spit venom, they scream, and they f**king rock! 'Bullet Proof' is thoughtful introspective then back to great heartfelt rock with 'Black Star' 'Sulk'. Then there's the end - what can I say - 'Street Spirit' - it haunts me still. One of the best albums of the 90's.
