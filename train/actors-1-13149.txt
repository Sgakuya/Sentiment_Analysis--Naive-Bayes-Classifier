Too bad i can't leave her a worse rating. Bon Voyage, Susan! Enjoy France. Oh, by the way, you're comment about electing a president who's killed more people before he got to The White House is untrue. Washington was in something called The Revolutionary War. You know in America. How about U.S. Grant in The Civil War? or Andrew Jackson? Teddy Roosevelt? Please learn to read and then buy a history book before you make such ridiculous comments. Also, how come i don't remember you criticizing Clinton for sending troops to Kosovo? Yet, you criticize Pres. Bush. Clinton did such a great job in Mogadishu, too! PS: please stop going to N.Y. Rangers games. That's why they haven't made the playoffs in 6 years! Keep Timmy at home, too.
