You are way off base. Ed Diddle would play anyone anytime. He had many All-Americans. Won tons of games and by the way at one time the NIT waas superior to the NCAA. The NIT would only take the top 8 teams in the country. So some people need to do some research before commenting. Ed Diddle was a GREAT coach and a GREAT teacher of life. He loved his players so much that the called hin Uncle Ed. Adolph Rupp would not dare play WKU. Rupp has been quoted in his own book you would think that our players could play defence with as much money that we pay them.He also said something about a recruit of his, we really did not want him, I just did not want Ohio State to get him. He was also a racist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So you do do not know diddle about Ed Diddle. Kentuckian by birth, Western Kentucky University Alumni, fan and supporter by the grace of God. I'm Outta here.
