I'm more of an RPG fan, but this game captivated me. I personally liked it better than its prequel. True, you don't get to play as Snake for very long, you play as a new recruit named Raiden for the bulk of the story. As the game progresses, the reader is awed by its unique missions and incredible graphics. It's also got some extra features and challenges to it such as a way of holding up your enemies and stealing dog tags, special items such as stealth camo, and cobat with a katana, which I really loved. The details of the story get a bit confusing near the end but they somewhat terrify the player due to the fact that such things are possible. One warning, the manual states that if the player collects all dog tags in the game (which requires the player to beat the game on every level), he/she is granted access to a special website. However, the site was shut down in the middle of 2002, so all of your work will be for nothing. Don't waste your time doing that unless you love a challenge (and it's REALLY a challenge to beat that game on extreme).
