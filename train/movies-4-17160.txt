I liked Lords of Dogtown. I had seen the 2001 documentary about the explosion of skateboarding out of Venice Beach in the seventies - Dogtown and Z-Boys - and Lords of Dogtown is the Hollywood version of that story. The movie follows three of Venice's young skateboarders - Stacy Peralta, Jay Adams, and Tony Alva as they revolutionize a sport, get distracted and divided by big money, and try and pull it all together again. Heath Ledger gives the only exceptional acting performance as the burn out board shop owner who has enough vision to see the potential of what he has in these young skaters, but not quite enough to actually cash in on the craze. The movie goes fast, and while I'm sure much of the story was Hollywood simplified, it's worth seeing.
