'99 SS900 - 10K miles, tons of fun! These bikes have GRUNT and handling all over the competition. Lots of performance mods available, from Ducati and aftermarket, let you make this bike all yours. The riding position is a bit forward, but this IS a sportbike. I do a 50 mile, each way, trip to work and back, no problems, and I'm no spring chicken(44). Long days strafing the backroads of NH with my buddies can get me a little sore, but nothing that would stop me from doing it the next day. Super front brakes, good balance and a general tight feel overall. The bike is reliable, responsive and capable of most anythng you can throw at it.
