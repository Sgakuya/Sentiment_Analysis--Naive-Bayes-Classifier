Rated Bad because I couldn't find people around to wait on me or help me if I needed it when I used to shop there. The store was not at all attractive and it was hard to find things. Once I went in the men's room and there was no door on the one stall they had; I think they could have done better than that! There is no longer a Sears store close enough to me but I would consider going there again to check out basic work duds, underwear, etc. if there was, because it might be cheaper than Macy's and there might be more to choose from. One of my main problems with physical department stores is that they don't have enough choices. When one orders via mail-order or online there is more to choose from and you don't have to wait in line -- this goes for all stores.
