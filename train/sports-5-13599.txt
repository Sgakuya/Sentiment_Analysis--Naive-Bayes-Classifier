Along with Belichick, Andy Reid is absolutely the best in the business. He's always prepared, keeps his team on an even keel, and refuses to overcelebrate wins or overdramatize losses. And before you Pats fans get to overconfident, Reid has never lost when given 2 weeks to prepare for a football game. That's 9-0. A seven point line looks awfully big to me when you consider that stat, the Eagles dominating defense, and at least two legitimate playmakers on offense (McNabb and Westbrook). Oh yeah, the best receiver in the game might play as well. I'd love to see Reid win the big one this year - he's earned it.
