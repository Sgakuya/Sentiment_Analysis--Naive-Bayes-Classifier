I read in the paper the other day that President Clinton is discussing ways to prohibit employers from using genetic testing to influence hiring decisions. Just a little earlier I had been reading about the controversy surrounding the possibility of putting advertising billboards in space. And just today I saw a commercial for a drug that helps you overcome social anxiety. Every time I see those kinds of things, I think about Brave New World and a little chill runs down my spine. Huxley was a visionary who explored some of the most frightening aspects of society s inexorable trend towards technology and capitalism. This book, published in the 30s, does a remarkable job of portraying a future where individualism and uniqueness have fallen victim to an assembly line mentality (Henry Ford is revered as a religious figure), with consumption representing the engine of society as well as the goal of the individual. Drugs are used regularly to control moods and make everyone happy. It s really kind of frightening to read this book over 60 years after it was written and realize how much progress we ve made towards Huxley s nightmarish vision.
