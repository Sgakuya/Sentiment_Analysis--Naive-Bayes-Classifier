I gave the Cd an almost perfect rating and these are the reasons. Reason 1, who told Mathew that it was cool for his daughter to sing all the leads and his other adopted daughter to sing the leftover ones? Don't give me that bs about the LaTavia and Letoya not being able to sing, VIBE magazine might have fell for it, but I didn't-you don't keep someone in a group for ten years and they are tone deaf as Beyonce said. Reason 2, how you gonna replace somebody behind they're back and have other chicks singing their songs they co-wrote and rocking their gear they bought?And then how you gonna kick Farrah out and say it's imaging -I guess the group's imaging doesn't allow anyone to be prettier than Beyonce-no wonder only the two plain looking chicks with plain names are still in the group! Reason 3, Somebody tell Beyonce it's not even cool to yodel on every track, hog the stage and interviews, all the while not being able to speak or articulate-She is just too damn country-and that's comin from a country girl!P.S.I HOPE AND PRAY THAT SONG SURVIVOR IS NOT MEANT FOR LATAVIA, LETOYA, AND FARRAH BEACUSE KELLY WAS LYING ON HER VERSE-YOU TALKED ABOUT THEM ON THE RADIO, TV, MAGAZINES, TALKED ABOTU THEIR FAMILIES, AND YOU CONSTANTLY JEOPARDIZE YOUR CHRISTIANTY WHEN YOU AND BEYONCE ARE HALF-NAKED AT EVERY APPEARANCE Y'ALL MAKE!
