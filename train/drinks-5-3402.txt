i'm 30yrs.old & still hate beer.but i love twisted tea!i started drinking it when it came to MA.in 2001.i started w/the original flavor.then to rasp.then to half/half.then my favorite came along "peach"!my 2nd fave is half/half,i still like rasp.but don't like the original any longer=too plain.most of the bars here in MA.only carry the original,if that.a lot of people out here still haven't heard of it!its been out for 4 yrs.people!i guess lack of advertising.i love the fact theres no carbination!they over carbinate every drink these days.when i went to FLA.last june,they never heard of it there!so i couldn't buy it!damn,i'm glad i'm back in MA.TWISTED TEA=I WANT TO BE YOUR SPOKESMODEL!!!
