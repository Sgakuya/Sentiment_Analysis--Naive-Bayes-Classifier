I can't give Cast Away less than 4 stars, simply because I am a huge Tom Hanks fan. I could watch him eat a bowl of cereal and be entertained. However, it did not live up to my expectations. Maybe if I had seen it at the theater right when it came out, before all the hype. ( I just watched it the other day June 2001) so my expectations were very high..also I had heard a lot about it. If you haven't heard too much about Cast Away, go rent it and enjoy now, DON'T continue reading if you haven't seen this movie yet. I had heard about Wilson..the open ended ending etc...so I found myself waiting for certain events..which made them a little less moving perhaps if I didn't know what was going to happen..Of course, being a sap, I did get a tear in my eye as Wilson floated away..a bit reminiscent of LT. Dan in Forrest Gump. I did enjoy Hanks and did not lose interest one time during the entire film. I think Hanks is one of the few actors of our time that can act on his own, no words, no one to play off of (besides a volley ball) on a desert island for an apparent 4 years. He is remarkable. I also enjoyed his reunion with Kelly ..it was real..as for the ending, I loved it. How else could it end? It would be too much for me if he actually returned to the girl whose package kept him going..however, in my mind that is what he did. But if they had to spell it out for me, I would have been disappointed. I belive that was the only possible ending..They leave us wondering, contemplating..During the entire movie, we are living through Hanks'..we don't know what is going on back in civilization..we don't know until he does that there was a funeral, Kelly is married with a child etc...So, we HAVE to be left from that same perspective..he doesn't know which choice he is going to make..therfore neither do we.
