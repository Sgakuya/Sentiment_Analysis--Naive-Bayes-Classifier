Oklahoma has had a top 10 strength of schedule almost every year under Bob Stoops. Bob Stoops record against ranked opponents is over 80%. OU has played in 3 National Championship games in the last 5 years and won 1. Name another active coach that can say that. Pete Carrol comes close if you count AP and BCS, but that's it. To say that USC has less talent than OU is absolutely rediculous. USC has had higher ranked recruiting classes the last 3 or 4 years, including #1 classes the last 2 years. To say that Stoops won the 2000 NC with John Blake's players is ludicrous. 12 of the 22 starters on that team were redshirt freshmen, true freshmen or JUCO players recruited in 1999 or later. 7 other players were playing different positions than under Blake. Bob Stoops is one of the best coaches in college football today.
