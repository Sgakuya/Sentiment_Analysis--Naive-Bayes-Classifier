Best all rounded King no doubt. But to be honest witchyall he still one of my least favorate Kings. I like him, but I like just about every other player on the Kings roster better. I rank Webber at the same ranking I do Peja. Webber is no doubt better than Peja, but webber earns about $9,000,000 of his $14,000,000 from the bleachers every year. Ha, come on C-Webb, I know when it comes down to the nitty gritty the officials will make it to where the L.A. Loosers win every time. But who knows, with you in there maybe you could make the Kings so damn dominant you guys could still beat the L.A. Fakers, kind of like the T-Wolves did last year, when they were playing a 5 man on the floor game against an 8 man rotation against the Fakers. Hey for any of you little L.A. Ladies fans out there, just remember, you didn't win in 2001-02. Okay, the Kings got skrood with out getting kissed. ofcourse if it was Shaq offering the Kisses that could've ben a blessing in discise. Shoot I wouldn't even tell him to kiss my ass. Nope, wouldn't want his dirty lips on my ass. LOL, GO KINGS, die FAKERS!
