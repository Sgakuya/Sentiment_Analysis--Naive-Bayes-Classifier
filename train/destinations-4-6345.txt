As someone who was born in and has lived in Ohio through college, I feel I'm adequately experienced to rate it as a vacation place. There are definitely some perks in the state, but unfortunately I've found places that are more interesting to visit elsewhere (I love the mountains and the ocean..neither of which can be found in Ohio). But, if you want to visit Ohio, I can give you some pointers. Cedar Point is the best thing Ohio has going for it. That place is awesome. You can see my comment on it under the amusement park category for more details. Also cool are the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and COSI, a science museum, in Columbus. If you're a sports fan (which I'm not), there are plenty of games you can watch due to the three large cities of Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus. Ohio is also rich in history, being the birthplace of 8 U.S. presidents, Neil Armstrong, John Glenn, Thomas Edison, Jack Nicklaus, Paul Newman, Steven Spielberg, and the Wright Brothers. Unfortunately, I have to agree with the person who said that a lot of Ohio is uninteresting flatlands. I'm from central Ohio and went to school in northwestern Ohio, and it's all flat farm land. If you want to see hills, you have to go to the southeastern part of the state, near Kentucky and West Virginia. The bodies of water are not the best for water activity due to pollution, but I believe you can still find some fun on the water at Lake Erie. While Ohio is not the most exciting place to visit, it is a pretty decent place to live. The people are friendly, the roads make sense, there are large cities close at hand almost all over the state. You just need to make sure you get out of the state every now and then for a vacation :)
