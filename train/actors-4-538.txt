Kind of iconic, which can be a bad thing. He hasn't really done anything in years that would require actual acting ability, but his legacy is too extensive to write him off based on the last twenty years. He is good in some roles, but doesn't really bring much to bad roles. Good-Apocalypse Now, A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront. Bad-Island of Dr. Moreau, that DeNiro-Norton heist flick. Made me sick-Last Tango in Paris. He's just far more entertaining offscreen than onscreen. He's probably a nightmare to work with, with his refusal to learn his lines or wear pants on the set. Just a weirdo who's been coasting for far too long.
