I am a automobile technician and have an ase master certification. After extensive research I decided to buy a 00'Tacoma 4cyl short cab 4x4.I am very pleased with the truck.Research on specs. the Toyota has nearly as much HP or more than v6 domestic trucks in the same group.We see hardly any problems with these trucks in the shop that I work at. I must agree with some negative the interior is small (rec extended cab) and the body metal is thin and easy to ding. However powertrain and performance are unmatched.These trucks are off road monsters and are set up very nice stock with big tires and nice gears. I have yet to get stuck with mine and have had no trouble pulling out others.To sum it up I feel that the Tacoma is a great buy,nice looking,powerful,reliable,and a bang for the buck. Oh and die hard domestic drivers hate them and they will tell you they stink. I wonder why.
