It absolutely baffles me that a player that has been playing for such a long time can still be so, so effective, especially a pitcher. Last year, he past person after person on the all-time strikeout list and was the Yankees' most consistent pitcher. Clemens has obviously always been a great strike out pitcher and has won 5 Cy Young Awards. His being named to the All- Century team shows that he definitely is one of the greatest pitchers to ever live. I would start him in any game 1 of a playoff series. The Rocket has conditioned himself very well and I still see a few more years on his career. He is practically the definition of dominance on the mound. His consecutive pitching win streak last year was the longest in history. I look forward to see his mastery again for the Yanks in the 2002 season.
