My favorite cheese overall--sharp chedder! I like Tillimook (Oregon) brand, but their sharp chedder's quality has been going downhill these past couple years, have to now purchase extra sharp to get the flavor that regular sharp used to have, as regular sharp is getting much more mellow. Fortunately, it is much cheaper at Costco, so it is not like I have to pay big bucks to do the substitute. My entire family is Tillimook eaters, and all 5 of us have had to switch to the extra sharp--hey Tillimook-what the heck is happening? Cutting corners, getting greedy? Might have to order out of state chedder if you don't fix the problem, or get the inspectors to check out why sharp is no longer sharp!
