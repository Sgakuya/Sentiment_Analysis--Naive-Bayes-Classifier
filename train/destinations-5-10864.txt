I came all the way from Arizona to go to this amusement park legend. I paid a ton of money so I expected to have a good time and a great time is what I had! Happy was I when I got on the MaXair ride. It felt good when I faced my fear of heights by getting on the Power Tower. The only ride that made me freak was the big wood roller coaster. I always worry that they are going to fall down like an old parking garage. When I was challenged to get on the Mean Streak (I think thats the name of it)I just had to. But while I was on the ride I was thinking is this ride safe and if it is not am I going to see my sister again whom I went to ceder point with and I am in my mid 30's I still have a bunch of things to look foward to. After I got away from that ride I threated to smack my sister or anyone of our freinds who made a challenge for me. The sevice is so great at Ceder Point that I felt like a qween. If your lost there is most of the time a big burly female security officer there to help you find your way or if you are having breakfast,lunch or dinner the people working at the resturants seem happy like they are feeling their best. I could have gone to Disney World in Orlando. It was like Disney World vs Ceder Point and Orlando vs Sandusky. Disney World lost my money for two reasons. Number one: Disney has changed so much over the years it is not the same the image is weak and mixed up. Number two: Disney World is magical when Ceder Point packs more action (I like action that is why Ceder Point is more my kind of place). Before ending this comment I must say may we all find the comments from jersey coaster chick(and the others that she plays to be)non helpful.
