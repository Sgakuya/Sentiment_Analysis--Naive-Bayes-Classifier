Absolutely their finest album yet. The Chicks have talked the talk, and on this album they are walking the walk. They have proven themselves musically and artistically, and on this album, it's apparent that they are finished proving themselves - they just relax and let it flow. The album is more acoustic than their previous work, and features alot more mandolin which gives it more of a bluegrassy sound. Taking away the drumbeats and synthesizer-country sound only serves to emphasize the individual mastery that each one of the Chicks has over her instrument of choice. Natalie's voice has never sounded finer, stronger, or more heartbreaking. Martie is stellar as usual on the fiddle, and even plays the mandolin on Landslide . Emily is incredible on banjo and dobro. Their vocal harmonies are perfect. Whatever controversy they may have with their record company, they've still managed to create an incredible record that will no doubt win them even more accolades. A couple of the songs on the album are written by Patty Griffin, one of my favorite singer-songwriters, and although Patty tends to be more on the blues/rock/folksy side, her material is effortlessly and beautifully rendered by the Chicks. Chris Thile from Nickel Creek plays the mandolin on several of the songs which is an added treat for his fans. (He's a master.) As on their previous albums, the Chicks do their share of writing too - see the hysterical but lyrically and musically tight White Trash Wedding . I don't think I could pick a favorite song from this album if I tried - each one of them is amazing in its own way. I will stop gushing now - buy this album, even if you don't typically like country or the Chicks, because it is a fine piece of work no matter how you label it.
