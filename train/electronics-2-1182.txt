My husband and I have Ericssons KF788 cell phones. Not to happy. The battery pack pops off if dropped. The flip down door on mine catches on sweaters, coats, purses etc. I feel the charger unit connector and the recieveing end on the phone are fragile. We had the units since 2-2000. We are now on our second chargers. Ironic - they died 1 week of each other. We have a two year contract. That means more chargers before this headache ends. My husband had to get a new phone due to the carging/hands free connector shattering. Just getting the new phone was a TRIP. My phone slid off the corner of my bed and fractured the door (from a 24 height). After all this I can say I still like the telephone. I think the company needs to take a good hard look at the weak areas and listen to the people who use them on a day to day basis. We are as careful with our phone as humans can be. I have some time left on my contract but I am already looking at other phones. I may even drop a few at the store to see what happens. ( With the phone not the sales person!) Ibi Regn
