I was recently in the UK for a week and I had to enter and exit through Heathrow. Even though this is the largest airport in world, it is very well managed. There are excellent stores and restaurants there. Crowd control is very good, considering the fact that many people go through that airport every day. The ticket counters got people on their flights quickly, airport transportation is good and it's not too far away from Central London as well. Security is par none and efficient. You have to pass through a scan both when entering the terminal in the airport and when you enter the gate when getting on a plane. The guards seems to know what they are doing and are watchful of any suspicious activity. The British have had tough security for many years now, they are experienced in providing good security while making sure that crowds flow well at the airport. The U.S. Transportation Department should look at how the Europeans do airport security. Their model may help our situation here, considering that most of the airport security in this country is of poor quality and it remains at the level that it was before 9/11, which is pretty bad.
