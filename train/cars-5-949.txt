I had a 1993 Accord LX, bought it @ 196,000 and it ran great. No problems except for worn out rotors and catalytic converter. Wrecked it @207,000 beyond repair and came out without a scratch. A very safe car if you have your seatbelt on, solid structure!! I bought a '92 Accord EX Coupe. Just like the 93 LX, fun to drive and dependable. The '92 EX coupe has excellent handling, take corners easily at upto 20 above the posted yellow/black limit on winding roads. It also has decent power @140 ponnies, which makes overtaking a walk in the park. Only problem is that the AC seems not to be strong enought to cool down the car comfortably in a hot summer day, unless you switch from vent to circulation. Also, the wind/road noise is audible but tolerable. Very reliable/dependable cars, good gas mileage, nice looks, good handling, and maintains quality for decades without draining on the pocket (except for regular oil change and maintanance). Go get yourself one of these and get a peace of mind!
