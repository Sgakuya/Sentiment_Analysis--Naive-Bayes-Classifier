Though i personally prefer the(highly original,visually stunning) films of his British compatriot Michael Powell,David Lean is rightly regarded as one of the finest directors from the English-speaking world,a huge influence on Spielberg,Lucas and many contemporary American filmmakers-who would be as surprised as i am by his current lowly rating here.This,after all,was the man responsible for(the majestic) Lawrence of Arabia,Great Expectations(which just pips Cukor's David Copperfield as the best screen Dickens),the much loved romance Brief Encounter,Bridge on the River Kwai and the enormously successful Doctor Zhivago.Given some of the relatively mediocre or unproven names above him,surely he should be higher than 35th?
