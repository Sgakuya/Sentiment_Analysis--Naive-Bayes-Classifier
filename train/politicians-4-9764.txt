One of the finest men to become President, but he was too politically inept to win a second term. The legacy of his administration was liberating Kuwait from Saddam Hussein, remarkably in a month's time, destroying some liberals claims that the Gulf War would be a repeat of Vietnam. He should've gotten a mandate from the UN to overthrow Hussein as the Iraqi population was rising, as Bush had so much geopolitical capital at the time. The economy during his term wasn't nearly as bad as everyone suggests. It was a minor burp, yet Bush failed to communicate the positives of the economy and instead let the Democrats script the debate. Don't forget Read My Lip: No New Taxes. Quite simply, the Democrats played Bush like a banjo. First, he makes that statement during the Convention. Next, the Democratic-led Senate forces him to break that promise in the name of deficit reduction and economic recovery. Finally, these same Democrats air campaign commercials emphasizing Bush's failure to keep that promise. Amazing that Bush was played like that, but between getting outmaneuvered by the Democrats and failing to communicate about the economy, Bush's heart wasn't in the reelection and perhaps he deserved to lose. That said, there's no question that Perot siphoned votes away from Bush, and '92 would've been a very close election, maybe just as close as '00.
