Where I work, I use Windows 2000 and Mac OS X Panther. There really is no comparison. Of the two operating systems, OS X has given me a much more stable work environment. This is the very reason I convinced my company to purchase a G5 for video editing. My Windows computer is now limited to just e-mail and Internet. I don't even know why people call Windows an operating system. After all these years, Windows still runs on top of DOS, the real PC Disk Operating System. With Windows being just a nice-looking application on top of DOS, it's no wonder why it experiences more problems. My company has been thinking about upgrading to Windows XP. However, our IT department cautions that XP has greater instability than 2000. I have a feeling we'll be on 2000 for a long time.
