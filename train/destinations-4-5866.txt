Surprisingly nice. With the exception of places like Newark, Paterson, Jersey City and Elizabetn, New Jersey is a sophisticated, fun, clean, and interesting state. I also liked Hoboken, it is essentaily part of manhattan, it is only a few hundred yards away cut off only by the hudsonn river. The Jersey shore has a real simple pleasures' feel to it. It is mostly developed, but still very fun, and it doesn't get battered with hurricanes every year like the beaches in the south do. A lot of people move to NJ when they are transfered to either the NYC or Philadelphia area from abroad. New Jersey is stereotyped to be mostly like Newark, but in reality, most of the state is like Nutley, Parsippany-Troy Hills or Point Pleasant.
