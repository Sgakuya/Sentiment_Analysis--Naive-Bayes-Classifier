I love all Cope but Cope Black (Bourbon Flavored) is the best. I started on skoal when I was 8 yrs old then I went to Redman and Levi Garrett but I decided one day that I would have My 18 yr. old friend buy me some cope longcut...THE BEST STUFF EVER but now I chew Black Cope and I ran out one day and tried some skoal and I was as green as the grinch if ya know what I mean and the worst thing is is that I was at school. So to all of you people that chew that fruity crap go to Cope. I understand the risks but the pleasure and buzz outweighs them As Chris Ledoux Says Makes conception a wonder and childirth a pleasure.... THAT COPENHAGEN MAKES ME FEEL SOOO GOOD
