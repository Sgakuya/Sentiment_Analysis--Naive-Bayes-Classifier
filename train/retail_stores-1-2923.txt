Bailey banks and Biddle is owned by Zales. They have had my wedding ring for over 8 weeks now repairing it with no apology or explanation for the delay. This is an expensive piece of jewelry, even though good service should not be based on cost of an item. This is their high end chain and the service is terrible. I escalated my issue to the regional manager and he said it would be another 2 weeks before they had an update on my ring. All I need is a side stone reset because they did not set it right after it went if for repair last time. Do not shop here. Go to Tiffany's for great service and follow up. BBB/Zales does not care about their customers and this is evident their lack of concern and follow up.
