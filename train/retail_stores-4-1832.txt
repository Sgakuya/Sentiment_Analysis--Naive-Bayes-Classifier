I am an employee of wal-mart, and I have to say that a lot of the people there are hard working, down to earth people. I agree that wal-mart doesn't pay enough, which brings down the moral of the workers, but the benefits they offer are better than some of the benefits offered by some of the factories arounds my area. The thing to remember is that wal-mart employees are human too, we have bad days just like everyone else and we make mistakes like everyone else. I know at the store that I work at, with Christmas around the corner, it is crazy. We are shorthanded, so all the freight does not get worked like it would if we had a full staff. That is not the employees fault. We don't do the hiring. I can't speak for other stores, but at our store in Mt. Vernon, Illinois, we do the best we can with the people we have. Even the managers jump in and throw freight. We can't please everyone, but we try. If you have a specific complaint, about a specific store, try talking to the store manager to get it resolved. If that doesn't work, talk to the district manager. The store manager will tell you how to contact him. If that doesn't work, call 1-800-walmart. That is the number for our home office in Bentonville, Arkansas. Wal-mart, like any other business, has it's faults, but if you don't let the store manager know what they are, they will not be fixed.
