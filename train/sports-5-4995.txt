The Pistol is THE Greatest College player ever. How can anyone even dare to dispute this fact? The greatest showman, scorer, passer and ballhandler. The guy who gave him 3 stars doesn't realize that Maravich, long before Bird and Jordan, singlehandedly brought a revolution to the game of basketball, changing the game forever. What did he win? He is the benchmark that every player and player-wanna-be, EVERYWHERE, emulated ever since he stepped on the court. Winning is so much more than a trophy. He won so many records, many never to be challenged and all so very far ahead of the 3-point games of recent history. EVERYONE began to dribble between their legs and pass behind their back. He led the revolution--with no supporting cast! NO--He invented the revolution! He is the wizard and magician that no one else can come close to. He has WON that place in history from which the rest follows!
