Is Steve Martin on the Dream Date list because if he's not he should be. I have had a crush on Steve Martin since I was a little girl. I remember Two Wild and Crazy Guys and I guess I was pretty young to really get most of the humor but I thought that Steve and Dan were sooo cute. I think that might have led to a sense of humor being a definite must in anyone I have ever dated. I still get all teared up when I hear I'm picking out a thermos for you . Steve Martin seems so funny and cute. I loved loved him in Parenthood . I also like that he is a big patron of the arts and I understand that he has a pretty decent personal art collection. What stories he would have to tell! So what if he's more than 20 years older than me. Now that's a fun dream date!(But never at dusk!)
