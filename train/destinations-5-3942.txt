Awesome place, when visiting the right areas. The airport is full of arrogant, snobby Latin American visitors, but once you get into the area of Miami outside the airport, the place gets nicer. Unlike LA or NYC, the people here are pretty nice. Upon a visit to South Beach, I knew the area was rich, but I didn't feel unwelcome. I was invited by several restaurant hosts to patronize their establishments, even though I didn't dress trendy or anything. I had dinner at a pretty atmospheric, trendy place for a good price. All around the city people were very nice and human. I definitely recommend Miami for a visit.
