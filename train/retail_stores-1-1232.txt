How is it that Starbucks is better than smaller coffee shops? I love the coffee my local coffee shops offer and the atmosphere is much better, too. The town I live in was just fine until about a year ago when Starbucks decided our downtown wasnt complete without their neon eyesore. AND they decided to put thier store not even 1/2 a block away from a locally-owned coffee shop that has served us well for as long as I can remember. WHY? Just to prove that because this is a college town and people in the Midwest are dying to be in the ranks of the cool set they will drink any liquid crap they sell? Every time I drive by Starbucks it is always filled with people. Of course windows surround the building so everyone can see how cool the patrons inside are because thier cup has the same logo as Ashley Olson's. It's all about image and brand name in this society. I'd rather drink delicious coffee out of a plastic mug than drink crap out of a Starbucks cup. Before we had a Starbucks I never once heard anyone say Oh, I wish we had a Starbucks because the coffee shops we have now are terrible!! I have never been to a Starbucks and never will. I dont care if they do give their employees good benefits, etc. If teenage prostitutes were given health, dental, and 401k stock options would that make thier pimps fine upstanding citizens?
