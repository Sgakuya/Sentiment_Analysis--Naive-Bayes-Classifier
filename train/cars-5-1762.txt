I recently purchased a 1998 Volkswagen Golf Cabrio GLS. This is one SWEET, affordable little drop-top! The new Beetle-style Cabrios are nice, and essentially the same car with a new body style, but I prefer the Golf-style Cabbie. This car runs well, handles great, and has a very solid feel for being a small convertible. The top does not leak, even in pouring rain. Wind whistle is virtually nonexistant. It is spacious inside and even has a decent-sized trunk. My only complaint is that rear visibility is somewhat limited (the rear window could stand to be larger). I absolutely LOVE this car. I have always had good experiences with my Volkswagens, and the Golf Cabrio is no exception. It is every bit as reliable and well-built as my 1997 Jetta, with the added fun of a convertible top!
