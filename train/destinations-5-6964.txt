What's truly amazing about Rome is its churches, and I'm not just referring to the Catholic ones. Besides of course the expected visits to the Vatican and St. John Lateran, Rome is a great opportunity to see services of other old Christian churches w/ congregations in the Eternal City. When I was last there, I was lucky to come upon an Ethiopian Coptic Church, and I checked out its Mass. The Coptic Church was founded in the very early years of Christianity and is mostly found in Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia. Its liturgy is quite different from other denominations (Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, and Protestant). Also, Rome has one of the oldest Synagogues in Europe. For those interested in history and religion, Rome is a jackpot for you.
