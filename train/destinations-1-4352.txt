I have lived in Los Angeles most of my life. I was born in Tarzana and moved to Mariposa when I was eleven. When I was fifteen I moved back. I'll tell you, living in a small town like Mariposa made me realize what a stink pot Los Angeles is. The people are totally image conscious here. The media has brainwashed everyone to believe that they must live their lives according to how they dress, what music they listen to, what gym they go to, etc. Everyone looks the same, there is no uniqueness. All the guys have the same short spikey bleach blonde or brown hair. They all ware the same baggy pants and sports orientated t-shirts. All the girls where the same fakely faded jeans and tight little shirts. God knows how they can walk in the shoes they ware. I know most of you will say I am generalizing but we all know majority rules. So if you are unique and you want to stand out then Los Angeles is the place to come, but where you think you will be revered for your individuality, you are sorely mistaken; you will be ostrasized for it. Los Angeles is full of incompetent, unphilosophic, sex starved, psychotic idiots. Unless you are working on a thesis on the socially inept, stay away.
