Ya'll should be okay next year. I've never really hated ya'll that bad when you weren't playing us. That scam I read about that ya'll pulled on the Crazies, was hilarious. I can't believe how much it worked to perfection! What idiots! I guess having a script to outline how to cheer for a basketball team comes back to haunt you, huh? They should go cheer for their polo team or some grey puopon sport, because they obviously don't know basketball. Ever notice how when the ref makes a call, they get all confused for a split second before they understand what happened. They don't know the game. I've actualy seen them start booing, realize the call was in their favor and start cheering. Did you hear about the two Carolina fans that sat right smack in the middle of the crazies during the first Carolina game in '05? They had a sign that read POSERS with arrows pointing in all directions around them. I heard nobody said a single word to them about it... ................pussycats. GOLLY GEE THEY'RE CRAZY! Anyway, ya'll only lost Gilchrist, right? Yeah, you'll be good in '05-'06. Check out my new weblist about 'greatst clutch shooters of the past 20 years, COLLEGE AND PROS'.
