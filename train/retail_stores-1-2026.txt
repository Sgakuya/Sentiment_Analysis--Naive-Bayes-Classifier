I bought a brand new Sealed ATI Radeon Video card from Best buy in Murrietta CA, got home, opened it and found a 8 year old EGA card with a Nintendo cable! I was very upset but was confident Best Buy would take care of it, WRONG! I returned the next day and the General Manager (I'm not afraid to name names) Kevin O'Neal said it could not of happened at their store and that I should contact the Manufacturer, now why the hell should I contact them when I bought it from Best Buy??? I was furious and he wouldnt budge on exchanging it. What kind of store is this???, they sell me a worhtless peice of junk as they refer to as Rocks in the Box and refuse to do anything about it! I'm writing consumer affairs on this one and I'm seriously considering legal action against these crooks! Nick
