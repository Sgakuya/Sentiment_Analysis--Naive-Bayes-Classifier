A randy young gent who apparently didn't take the business of kingship as seriously as he should have. Early in his reign, during a meeting for all the important figures of state, the teenage monarch was conspicuous by his absence. Bishop Dunstan (A very important figure at the time and a future Arch-Bishop of Canterbury and saint!) found the monarch having a tawdry romp with a noblewoman called Aelgifu (what a lovely name!) and dragged the wanton royal from his bedchambers demanding he repudiate this strumpet. Unsurprisingly Dunstan was not popular with Edwy and he was exiled soon after, in a statement of defiance Edwy proceeded to marry that strumpet! Edwy was extremely fond of giving extravagant personal gifts to his favorites and coupled with his belligerence this made him rather unpopular. By his death only Wessex recognized him as King. A poor showing.
