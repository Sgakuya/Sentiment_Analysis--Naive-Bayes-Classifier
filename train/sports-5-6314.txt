ACC CHAMPS just like ems4duke said!!!!! I love this Duke team because their is always someone who can step up for the team. Like if J.J. is having a bad game their is someone else who is there hitting all the shots or making steals or something to help them win. In this years regular season there has been so many people who have step up, and to name a few names the guys are: Shavlik Randolph, Lee Melchionni, David Mcclure, Reggie Love, and Demarcus Nelson and many other guys. When Dockery went out no one thought that Duke would be able to win games, but they provided them all wrong, because other people stepped up. Thats whats so great about Duke. Another guy who has stepped up at a right time every game is Daniel Ewing, which we will miss next year since he is a senior. And of corse the Landlord... Sheilden Williams. I'm also sick of people who think all Duke is, is a bunch of snobby rich boys, well they didn't pay the people to give them a scholarship, they earned it because they are good, so it makes no since to me. Well that all I got to say, and good luck to Duke in the NCAA. GO DUKE! P.S. Hey North Caroline if you can't beat Georiga Tech, how do you think you are going to win when you start playing harder teams in the NCAA tournament?? Well I bet we will be seeing you in the Final Four?? See you there! GO DUKE!
