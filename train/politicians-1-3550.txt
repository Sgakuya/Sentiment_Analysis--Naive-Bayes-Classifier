Why I hate George W. Bush 1. He blows up things in the name of truth, justice and ExxonMobil! 2. He can dismiss al our woes with a single stratergery . 3. His SAT scores were almost 200 points lower than mine and he was able to get into Yale. 4. Everything he has gotten in life has been because of his last name. 5. He has the ability to run the most powerful country on Earth (sorta) while reading at a fourth grade level. 6. He thinks Africa is a country. 7. He can take the most horrific disaster in American history and use it to push through his own radical political agenda. 8. He can get out of scandals with the greatest of ease. He received large donations from Enron and was a part owner, but don t think about that! The country has to be united behind him! 9. He probably did cocaine. 10. Adopted a No Tolerance policy in Texas for illegal drugs. 11. He was arrested for DUI. He says it was a mistake of his youth. I guess with advances in the medical field, you re still young in your thirties. 12. He won Florida. Thanks Jeb. 13. He is trying to push through a trillion dollar tax cut. Where will the money come from Mr. Bush? His response: Strategery . 14. That tax cut will give around three hundred dollars to an average middle income wage earner while providing Dubya with a nice $44,500 tax return. 15. Good buddy, Cheney gets $327,000 from the tax cut. That s more money than a brain surgeon makes in three years before taxes. (cut or not) 16. He has managed to take the most booming economy in the world and turn it into a stagnant quagmire of corporate scandal. 17. Our national debt is now at $6,392,794,328,304.78 (I m not kidding). Each year we spend billions of dollars to pay off interest on this debt. But it is of little importance to Emperor Bush. 18. If we paid off all our debt, we would free up immense amount of capital that could be used to improve the economy. That would make everyone richer, but Bush has the strength to resist such temptation. 19. Whenever strategery doesn t work, Bush can still whip out a very nice Bomb Iraq or a We must or the terrorists win to solve any other problems. 20. Eventually we will be stripped of all our constitutional rights (not the 2nd amendment though, we need more guns! Lots more!). 21. Freedom of speech will have to go. Dangerous ideas spawn terrorists. 22. Freedom of religion. That s gone too. It s Evangelical fundamentalist Christianity or nothing. Don t even ask about Islam! 23. Right to privacy. Go ahead and pee. Don t mind the camera. It s for your own safety. 24. Right to a trial by jury. Military tribunals are cheaper and less fair! Step right up and watch Haebeus Corpus go in the toilet. 25. Mr. Bush also has the ability to color within the lines (sometimes).
