My Wife and I just got back from a 2-week trip to Spain Portugal Morocco and we had a great time.Spain was so relaxing. In Nerja we staid at the Hostal Marrisal which was in the best location I think. It was right on the Balcony of Europe and the rooms were only about $40 euros/night. They even have a great restaurant that we ejoyed as well. In Nerja the caves were amazing, and the beaches were quite nice as well. Portugal/Lisbon was a incredibly fun and exciting city to visit and was a great way to end our trip. I cant wait to go back. Tangier/Morocco is definitely worth the Tijuana-type experience. But Do not miss to book a Tour With (viptour@gmail.com), a Guide Charif was excellent, well definetly worth For full-Day the 30 Euros per person fee or so including an airconditioning Van. the hydrofoil/catamaran from Tarifa, Spain to Tangier is great (35 minutes), Another place we want to share is the MARHABA restaurant ASK FOR IT in Tangier. It is located on Rue de la Kazbah, We get a little tired of eating the same food every day, even at home and wanted to try something different. This turned out to be our best meal. Our day trip from Spain was to Tangier /Morocco. The Kazbah & the Sultan-Palace are awesome! If you have a chance, make sure you go there. If you go by Fast/Boat Catamaran, it's a really Nice trip and you'll have plenty of time for a Visit and lunch.
