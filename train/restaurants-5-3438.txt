Super good food, great prices and sweet in-store service only knocked down by poor delivery. First, their pizza is the best. The sauce rocks, the cheese is awesome and they offer different kinds of crusts, including the all-important Deep Dish. They also offer Personal Pan Pizzas, nifty if you are only eating for one. Their prices are good, from their $2.99 Lunch Buffet (I've heard its $3.99 in other areas) to the prices on their lovers pizzas. Service is also typically fast when in the store. Here's an update! I just moved to Delaware and have heard many things about the legendary Northeastern Pizza Chains. All I have to say is, blah. Pizza Hut still beats them all! Long live the pizza place with the red roof!
