I think it's fair to say I have enough experience with Canada to share my opinion on it. I went to college at the University of Michigan, and we visited Windsor (right across the river from Detroit) at least once each year. I've also been to Vancouver a couple times (a truly beautiful city), and I've taken a train from Vancouver to Banff, right across the spine of the Canadian Rockies. I also spent some time in Glacier National Park, set on the border of Canada and Montana. So I've had a chance to see some of the country, and I've certainly met plenty of Canadians. In terms of raw wilderness beauty, Canada deserves five stars. And the people are very friendly (if you'll allow me to generalize), but I've also met quite a few who seem to have a chip on their shoulder. Those of us in the U.S., apparently, tend to be shockingly ignorant about Canada. We don't follow their politics, we have lots of misconceptions about the country, etc. But I guess if I lived in sub-zero weather 9 months out of the year, I might be a little cranky, too.
