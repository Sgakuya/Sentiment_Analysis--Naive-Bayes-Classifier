I would pay Jordn the supreme compliment of saying that he was as good as Elgin Baylor - Jordan better at defense, Baylor a better passer and rebounder, equal at scoring. I think Bill Rusell also rated them as the two firsts in the history of the NBA. If RJ had played for the Bulls during the Russell-Celtics era, he wouldn't had led them to any championships. And if he had played in that era he would have had to do what Baylor did: INVENT that going-up-into-the-air and creating from there style of play. Funny stat: Baylor one season averaged 38 points a game and lost the scoring title to Chamberlain. But then things were more competitive then than now, in the Jordan-era, with the water-downed 29 team NBA.
