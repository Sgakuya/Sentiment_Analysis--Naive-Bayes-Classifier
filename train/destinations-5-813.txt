Canada is beautiful, scenic, great value, great restaurants, blah, blah, blah... But here's the real deal: Canadian women are gorgeous, buxom, and willing. I've visited St Catherines, Windsor, Brockton, Port Colborne, Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver, and Quebec City. In many of these towns, HE SHOOTS...HE SCORES with the women there. My wife is Canadian (even though I met her in Duluth) and I visited London, Ontario a lot when I dated her. The Canadians can be a little opinionated and have an inferiority complex about their neighbor to the south; but its harmless. Canada is a great travel stop as much for a family of five as it is for a virile trey of college dudes looking for a little adventure.
