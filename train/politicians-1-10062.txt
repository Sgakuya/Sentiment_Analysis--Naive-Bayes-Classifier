I liked the tax cuts, but he didn't offset it with spending cuts- in fact he increased spending. All that is is a deferred tax- those bills will have to be paid at some point. If I was 60 or older I guess I wouldn't care, but I will have to foot the bill for this reckless spending. Also the war was a waste of money. He also goes to far in pushing the social agenda. A good republican knows that the religious garbage is good way to get stupid poor people to vote for you, but that you shouldn't actually implement any of the nonsense they want, just give it lip service. I just wish he were more fiscally conservative and hadn't got us involved in Iraq.
