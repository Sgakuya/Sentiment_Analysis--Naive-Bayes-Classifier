I'm pretty excited to see what Tommy Amaker can do at Michigan. What a great hire for the Wolverines. With Seton Hall, Amaker proved himself to be a solid coach and a top recruiter. Anyone who can bring the nations #1 recruiting class to Seton Hall should be able to work wonders at Michigan. Early reports (as I write this, he hasn't even officially been announced as Michigan's coach yet) indicate that the current Wolverine players and recruits are reacting really positively to Amaker's hiring, which is great news, and that some of the Seton Hall recruits (7' center Chris Charles in particular) may follow Amaker to Ann Arbor. Let's hope Amaker can live up to all the expectations... Battling Tom Izzo for control of in-state recruiting will be no easy task.
