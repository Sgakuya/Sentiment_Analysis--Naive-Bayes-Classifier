Robert Higgs, Research Director for the Independent Institute, said this of Clevelsnd, He kept the country at peace. He respected the Constitution, acknowledging that the national government has only a limited mission to perform and shaped his policies accordingly. He fought to lower tariffs; preserved the gold standard in its time of crisis; and restored order forcibly when hoodlums disturbed the peace on a wide front during the great railroad strike of 1894. Though I disagree with Mr. Higgs on many fronts, he nails my opinion of Cleveland perfectly. Grover Cleveland greatness can not be overstated. He is easily one of the five greatest presidents in U.S. history.
