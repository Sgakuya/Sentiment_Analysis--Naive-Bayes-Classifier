Those already familiar with Nokia mobile phones will be able to start playing immediately with the latest from Nokia, their 8800 series. The phone is incredibly small and controls almost identically like their wonderful 6100 series of phones. Overall, the only possible drawback might be the fact that the buttons may be too small for those with large fingers and hands, and the phone itself, being so small, can easily be misplaced. The 8800 series of phones do offer a few more features that some of Nokia's earlier models, and it's here that the consumer needs to look into the service providers that are available in their area. There are some subtle differences between the 8860 and the 8890 and one carrier that may support one of the models won't support the other and vice-versa. It's CRUCIAL to make sure you select the wireless phone service that's right for you before you decide to purchase any mobile phone. A really cool phone is about worthless if it doesn't work where you might need it to. All in all, the 8800 series is smart in design and function, works well, and Nokia's redesign of the earpiece adapter (which makes the handsfree ear-mic that's included work perfectly!) makes it a good purchase decision, provided the service meets your needs and the phone fits your hands.
