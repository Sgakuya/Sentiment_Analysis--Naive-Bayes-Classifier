OMIGOD!!!! all these jerkwads are too blind too see that GAMECUBE JUST PLAIN IS AWSOME!!!!! i think people should see that these games for kids rule!!!!! animal crossing? AN ABSOLUTE FRICKIN' MASTERPEICE!!!!! wind waker? a work of art!!!! I dont see how anyone can sit down at animal crossing and say thay hate it. any frickin' one can say, its okay, i like so and so but still, it awsome!!! it has so many aspects everybody must love some bit!!!!! i've seen a man nearing fifty sit down and love it so much hes considering buying a system of his own. People say theres so little amount of games, and they, my peoples, are nearsighted jerks.
