I've only seen him in LOTR, but I have to say he's done the part of Legolas very well, and makes for a very convincing elf character. And, yes, he's attractive, but I'm tired of seeing him posted all over my sister's desktop at home. Ah, anyway, shows promise as an actor, I'd like to see more of his movies. UPDATE: Now, I'll have to piss off the teeny-boppers: Sorry, folks, after seeing a few more movies with him, I had to knock him down to a 2 from a 4. His performances in Troy, Pirates of the Carribean, and Kingdom of Heaven were mostly wooden and unimpressive. Yeah, he has that wide-eyed innocence look down pat, but that only gets you so far. A pretty boy he may be, but out of the movies I've seen of his, none have proven a real acting ability. Most, however, cite Black Hawk Down as a fairly decent performance, which I haven't seen yet, so I'll give him that as a possible bonus.
