The only PM ever to start a war because she needed the popularity that fervent nationalism would give her. Her government was deeply unpopular in the early 80's and was looking to be thrown out until the Falklands. And denying the right to picketing for strikes was the only reason she kept in power, she weakened the unions, and Labour too much to fight back. Her government was met by dislike by all younger people, and was full of riots, protests, and other things. The poll tax threatened to take us back to the 14th century, the last time something like that came up. And as for strong... Hitler was strong in his country. So was he a great leader?
