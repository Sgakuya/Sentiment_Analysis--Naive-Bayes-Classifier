I live here now so I must give it a good rating. Northern CT is pretty with the small mountains. Eastern CT is ok. Southwestern CT is basically a suburb of NYC. Lots of huge, gorgeous homes and beautiful country curvy roads. People drive like a-holes here though. And traffic is almost always horrible-especially on I95, the Merritt, and downtown Stamford. The cost of living is outrageous too (not good like someone else said)...but the pay rate compensates somewhat. Overall, not a bad place...very close proximity to places like NYC, Boston, the shores of Rhode Island...lots of possibilities for day trips or weekend trips.
