Not a team player, not a nice person, but he is one of the best shooters in the history of the league. It's going to be hard for him to win again in this league if he doesn't learn to work and play well with others. 1/22/2006 ***Special news flash: While I was indeed sincere in what I wrote yesterday on Kobe Bryant. I just witnessed him in an interview following tonight's performance in which he was 28 for 46 shooting, including 7 for 13 from three point distance, 18 for 20 from the free throw line (Breaking a streak of some 60+ without a miss) and an increadible 81 points!!! After turning in a total that is the second highest game behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100 pointer over forty years ago, Kobe gave one of the finest, most humble, and reverent post game interviews I've had the pleasure to witness in my many years as a sports fan. In it he gave praise to his teammates, (to whom he refered to as his "blockers") Coach Phil Jackson, and remained humble when asked to compare himself with past greats including Michael Jordan , Magic Johnson, and others. I was very proud of Kobe and believe that this may be the turning point that allows him to put all of his enormous potential and ability into the package that truly does guarentee that he be considered among the greats of all time. In Short, I am convinced; any rating less than 5 out of 5 would be truly dishonest of me. There can be no further denying the fact; Kobe is truly a great, great player!
