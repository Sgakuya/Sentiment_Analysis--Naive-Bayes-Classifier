I'm doing my best to get into this CD, but it's tough work. My experience with Radiohead's previous CD, OK Computer, was that I didn't like it at all the first few times I heard it, then after a while I started to kind of like it, and all of a sudden I couldn't stop listening to it. So I assumed it would take me a while to appreciate Kid A, and it has. I've probably listened to it about 10 times now, and I'm at the point where I think it's good, interesting music, but I don't feel nearly as mesmerized as I did by OK Computer. The sonic, ambient quality of the Kid A music - often without guitars - is intriguing and cohesive, but it lacks the balance of traditional sounds that helped made OK Computer so compelling and addictive. If you're already a Radiohead fan, you need to buy this CD, but if you're looking for an introduction to this talented band, start with The Bends or OK Computer.
