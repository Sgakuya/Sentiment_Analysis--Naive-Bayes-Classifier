Best point guard in the NBA. Not only does he pass better than any other NBAer, but he gets a truckload of rebounds and has a good enough pull-up jumper to keep the D honest on the pick-and-roll. His passes are almost always crisp and on-target. He hasn't bought into the ESPN highlight mentality, either. He can make fancy passes like J-Dub, but often eschews them to avoid turnovers and to ensure that they get where he wants them. Kidd is the best and certainly the most reliable PG in the association. That said... the widely-held belief throughout the 2001-02 season that Kidd was MVP was ludicrous. This view stemmed from the comical belief that he single-handedly lifted New Jersey to playoff status. Never mind that Kittles revived his career, MacCulloch emerged as a bona fide center, and Jefferson/Martin arrived as threats in transition. Kidd's shaky jumper will prevent him from ever being a legit MVP candidate.
