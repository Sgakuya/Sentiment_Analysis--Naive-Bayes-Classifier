Colorado is my home-state and the best state in the country, I did not realize until I left Colorado, what a beautiful place it is. The people in Colorado are amazing and the political, economic and racial diversity for a state of four million is unbelivale and some-how we all live together in Colorado in peace. Colorado Springs, gets a labled as conservative, when in-fact the city has a more liberal city government than Denver. Colorado Springs is a simple city, that rejcts arrogance and pretention. Before I was an adult, I hated Colorado Springs, but now I realize the honor to have grown up in a city that had views of Pikes Peak, an affordale cost of living, the best cheap eats and the most compassionate people in America. If you cant make in beautiful Colorado Springs, you cant make it anywhere. Denver, may not be the cleanest city in America, but Denverites are the friendliest bunch of people you will ever meet. Denver is also a city where you can have one job and are able to pay the bills.
