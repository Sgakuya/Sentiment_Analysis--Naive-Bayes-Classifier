Bernie Williams is the silent and deadly leader of the New York Yankees. He takes after his mentor, the great (and should be in the Hall of Fame) Don Mattingly--he's not flashy, he just shuts you up by his great bat and awesome defense. All these so-called experts who say that Bernie does not have great defense should take their reports and shove them way up their arse! The man has only won 4 Gold Gloves--he's made one spectacular catch after another plus he is, without a doubt, the Yankees best hitter and most clutch. He deserves more respect--besides how many outfielders today can match Bernie' numbers and include 4 WS rings, a ALCS MVP, and a batting title. . .NONE!!
