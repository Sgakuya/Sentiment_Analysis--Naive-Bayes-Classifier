Plot line is ridiculous and over-the-top (underwater zombie having a fist-fight with a shark?), acting pretty awful (with the possible exception of Richard Johnson), but in terms of atmosphere, this is one gruesome and creepily effective movie. Be warned...the violence and gore are extreme, but these are probably the most terrifying, realistic-looking zombies ever. I first saw this with an inebriated group of friends in NY's Times Square in 1979. Back then, I thought it was a fun and ghoulish gorefest. I watch it now, and it's silly and repellent. But, if graphic Italian horror and flesh-eating zombies are what floats your boat, this is your movie. It still packs a punch...
