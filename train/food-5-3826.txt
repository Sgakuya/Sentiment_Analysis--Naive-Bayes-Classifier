It's the best! It's like jewelry; the thin, no character sauces are like the cheap crap you get for Christmas from your great Aunt Mustachia, you have it because it was on sale, then don't use it because it's just not right. Then you have the stuff that your new significant other gives you (for (pick an occasion) your anniversary, new baby, first holiday...) that's so expensive, like some of those sauces, that you only use it for special, not wanting to waste it on just any day; then there's the stuff you bought yourself because you like it, you use it all the time and get lots of compliments. That's what Prego is like, you love it, and so does everyone else. It makes you feel good!
