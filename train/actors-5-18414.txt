In a poll i conducted of World Cinema fans' favourite films,Kurosawa's Seven Samurai(unarguably one of the all-time greatest dozen) came top,as did the director himself,ahead of Hitchcock and Renoir.One of the 3 Japanese grandmasters(along with Mizoguchi and Ozu,both less well-known in the West)Kurosawa created many of the finest international classics.Rashomon was the film which put Japanese cinema firmly on the World map;Ran is a majestic (though for me a touch overlong)adaptation of King Lear;Throne of Blood a hugely atmospheric transposition of Macbeth(for many the supreme screen Shakespeare);Ikiru a touching tale of a terminally ill man's attempt to create a children's playground;Hidden Fortress an enthralling,underrated adventure;Dersu Uzala a sincere Oscar-winning description of a Siberian forest-dweller's life;High and Low an engrossing contemporary kidnap drama;Yojimbo and Sanjuro both grand entertainments.Influenced by the westerns of John Ford,Seven Samurai and Yojimbo were in turn remade as The Magnificent Seven and A Fistful of Dollars.Though there are several (generally more subtle)directors whose work i love and respect more,Kurosawa was undoubtedly a 5 star film-maker.
