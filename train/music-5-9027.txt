I think the song and the video are both excellent. A lot of times, a band will come out with a good song, but the music video totally sucks, or vice-versa. But the song and the video are both so carefree and fun. I think this song is really relaxing personally...it's like you can just put it on and lay in a hammock and fall asleep, or float around in the pool on an air matress to it. My favorite part of the music video is the part where the little chimpanzee is being tossed around in the air...it looks like the band and the animals are having so much fun! Anyways, it's just a feel-good song and a feel-good video that just make you, well, feel good.
