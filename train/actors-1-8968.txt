Sandra Bull-ock's acting ability didnt bridge across from all Americn Girl Next Door to naked on all fours sex object for the tribal male in her amazon forest flick. I don't care for films with people having sexual relations in full view, didn't like Sandra's acting in either of the two films she has done sex scenes in (the sex scenes and the acting were putrid at best) and have pretty much lost interest in seeing any more films by Sandra Bullock. She still looks like the All American Girl but after seeing her in those last two films (there was no warning on the video box about the contents of the scenes) it's hard to see her any other way but as a poor B rated.
