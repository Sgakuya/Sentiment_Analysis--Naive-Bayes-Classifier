A Hidden Gem. This school is on the rise and is amazing. Theres never something NOT to do. Good for partys (beginning Thursday nights of course) and going to many bars in the city and clubs also. Of ALL the schools i visited, this school had the most friendly student body. And that is something that you hear many times over when you ask a student why they picked scranton, because everyone was no nice. Ive been to Fordham and Ive been to Georgetown. Georgetown is a fine school, but u get lost in the numbers. Thats the great thing about scranton and lyola and the smaller jesuit schools, they focus on you and focus on creating a community. The scranton community is definatly one you will not regret joining.
