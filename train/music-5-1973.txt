This is one of the BEST cds around (best choice ever for me to buy). Sorry about how you feel, Dummer4Jesus, but I totally disagree with you! OLP's music is so far the most meaningful I've heard on the radio. The lyrics are about raw human emotions, and life's hardships on a day-to-day basis. Not to mention the music is raw and fresh. I find Raine Maida's voice to be very unique and his vocals are so amazing -- he can sing a whole octif higher!! The way he sings is as if he is talking to you on a personal level, espressing his feelings, witch is very rare these days, with all the Britney Spears and BSB's of the world. This album is definetly worth buying, and the kind of music that the kids will find rocking and parents won't complain about.
