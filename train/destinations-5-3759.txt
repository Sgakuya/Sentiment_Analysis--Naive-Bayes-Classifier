Buffalo is the most underrated city in terms of inexpensive, yet good, quality of life. Those that have never experienced life anywhere else than Buffalo, do not realize what a treasure we have here. We have convenient, liveable size, immeasurable natural resources, almost no risk of natural disaster (forget blizzards, you don't die from them unless you're stupid!), and one of the best laid out infrastructures in the country. It has far too much going for it to not survive it's current state of mismanagement. I firmly believe that the city's rebirth will happen throughout the next 10 years, when the bio-medical corridor (which is already underway) starts retaining and attracting higher end jobs and residents to live and work in Buffalo. We are already experiencing a silent migration of people moving from the suburbs into affordable luxury apartments and lofts that have been renovated from many of our beautiful old buildings. You just don't hear as much of these positives in the media. And to the rest of the nation... GIVE US A BREAK ALREADY each time it snows!! I'd rather deal with snow than earthquakes, hurricanes, forest fires and tornados (none of which he have!)..
