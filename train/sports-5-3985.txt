99.9% OF THE NEGATIVE WORDS ABOUT ADOLPH RUPP ARE FROM #1: PEOPLE THAT NEVER MET THE MAN! #2: PEOPLE READING WORDS, WRITTEN BY A REPORTER THAT NEVER MET THE MAN! RUPP GETS THE RACIST TAG--YET HIS TEAMS WERE THE FIRST MAJOR, OUT OF THE SOUTH TO CONTEST MIXED RACE TEAMS!, THE FIRST TEAM TO SCHEDULE TEAMS WITH BLACKS INTO SOUTHERN ARENAS FOR INTER-RACIAL GAMES! RUPP CHOSE AND COACHED BLACKS ON HIS HIGHSCHOOL TEAMS! AND ACCORDING TO THE BLACK HIGHSCHOOL COACHES IN KENTUCKY HELPED MANY OF THIER KIDS GET COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS! THE PICTURE WAS THUS: RUPP/KENTUCKY SIGN BLACK PLAYERS--NO S.E.C. TEAM WOULD PLAY AGAINST INTIGRATED TEAMS--SO U.K. GOES 0fer THE SEC. RUPP AND U.K. DO NOT SIGN BLACKS, AND ARE DRAWN,AND QUARTERED BY THE REST OF THE NATION! AAAAAH! THE GOOD OLD AMERICAN WAY! JACK
