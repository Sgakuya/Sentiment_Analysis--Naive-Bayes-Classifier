I feel Joseph Lieberman is a good man who has been overshadowed by the fringe left of the Democratic Party. A man of great moral principle and judgment, he epitomizes some decency in an increasingly poisonous political atmosphere. A self-effacing man with the good of his country first and foremost in his heart, many from both of the major parties ought to learn from this man about professionalism and substance. By the way, why is it that when a Democrat like Lieberman decides to put aside party politics in place of his/her conscience, that others within his/her party start to demean and disparage him? Isn't liberalism originally about being open-minded to any and all ideas? Isn't it also about being 'inclusive'- unlike Republicans who liberals continually blast as being 'exclusive'? Yet, when a man like Lieberman speaks his mind about what he feels, it is taboo. Isn't this hypocritical?
