Here's the facts: #1 Engineering/Science in the country. #1 Economics AND Management for Undergrads. 54 Nobel Laureates. Every undergrad class taught by professors who try to kick your ass. 30 fraternities with multi-million mansions, and all are self-governed. MIT is hard as hell and only special types of people can survive it. You WILL learn a lot, and if you do well, you can truly change the world. MIT alums start large companies, invent things, run the United Nations (Kofi Annan). Up the river at Harvard for undergrad, there is grade inflation and lots of cheating, which I imagine will help you get a good first job but that's it. The two schools are completely different - know what type of person you are.
