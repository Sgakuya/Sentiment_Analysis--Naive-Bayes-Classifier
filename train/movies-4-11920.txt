I would give this an almost 4. this has some pretty good scenes. Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon play middle aged woman who in their early 20s were groupies and hung around rock groups and lets just say they were real friendly with them thus giving them their nicknames. now aobut 25 years later one is still a free spirit taking like as it comes. and the other has married a lawyer had two girls and has completely changed. and has never told her family about her former life. Goldies character arrives in her old friends town to ask for money{she lost her job} at first they do not hit it off at all, the friend has changed too much and does not want anyone to know about her former life. Of course slowly they she changes her mind allows herself to let herself go and even lets her family know about her former life as a groupie.{at first she is laughed out of the dining room} but yet everything ends with a happy ending. Okay movie but not great.well acted by the leads though.
