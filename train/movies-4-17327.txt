The second subtitled movie I've enjoyed (the first being the uproarious Shaolin Soccer--also released stateside by Miramax, who also released the 4th and 5th Pokemon theatrical features), Amelie is a surprising delight. The sense of humor in this, complete with a hilarious narrator, is quite unique and goes off on amusing tangents. The main character is very appealing--and decides to do good deeds for others. The movie is very well-paced and is quite creative overall. I personally don't think the movie is completely deserving of an R-rating--a PG-13 probably would have sufficed--as there is no profanity, no violence, and no dirty humor in the entire picture. And, yes, this is the hilarious origin of the Travelocity Roaming Gnome! ^_^
