To begin I would like to say that I have read a far greater number of books in the fantasy genre than I care to admit to. I have read ALL of: R.A.Salvatore, Ann McCaffery, Steven King, Piers Anthony, Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, the Shannara series. And countless others that I cannot recall. Lord of the Rings was only a trilogy and Tolkien was no doubt a fabulous writer(I thank him for Middle Earth). The WoT is now awaiting book 11 and is very quite possibly better. Jordan has simply expanded the wolrd(s) that Tolkien opened our eyes to. He is like Tolkien reincarnated. There is an extreme depth to characters, and multiple storylines that are all relevant to the main plot, as well as numerous subplots. Jordan writes in such a way that sometimes you may know what is going to happen, just not when or how. Other times you have a vague idea of what is happening, but are clear as to who, how, and/or when. Most of the time though, you know(or are told) that something is going to happen/happening, but are left to ponder the possibilities of how(which can be extremely numerous and complex). The end of each book leaves you craving for more, and are very enjoyable a second or even third time; the same as LotR or other Tolkien classics. All in all, the WoT is superfluous to any other books and/or series in the genre. Individuals that bash or put down this series are not looking at the wide scope of things. No, he does not write like anyone else which is exactly what a reader should look for. Jordan has taken the time to develop characters and plotlines that have great depth and require time to be followed through. Yes, Tolkien is literature, BUT HE'S DEAD!!! Very few writers can write to Tolkien's level(which Jordan does), hardly any have writings considered 'literature' while still living(Jordan definitly does), and most of all THEY ARE JUST BOOKS!
