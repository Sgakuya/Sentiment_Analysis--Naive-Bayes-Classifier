Wow, I cannot believe everyone complaining that Outback is too expensive, that is funny. The house special steak is around 12.99, if anyone knows of a place where you can get a steak dinner for less than this please post it. At more supposedly upscale steak restaurants in my city, steak prices range in the 18.00 to 25.00 range. Everytime I have went the steak has been delicious and so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. If you ever have a rare occasion where it's not cooked correctly, they'll gladly give you another one. If 12.99 is too expensive for you, you need to stick to McDonalds or Village Inn. You could not buy all the items from a supermarket and cook it at home for this price. I go to Outback on the average of once a month, I agree the wait sucks sometimes and the service can be erratic at times, but thats only because it's a hugely popular restaurant.
