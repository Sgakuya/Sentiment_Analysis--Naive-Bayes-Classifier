I bought the Sony SPP-Q105 about four or five years ago and it has served me well. During that time, I've lived in a few different apartment complexes and the reception has been just fine at each place (with 25 channels, it's been fairly easy to get a clear one). I've also used the same battery since I bought the phone and the charge still stays strong (but, not as strong as it used to). My one complaint with the phone is that, sometimes (less than 1% of the time), it can't find a clear channel to speak on. When that happens, instead of going to a channel with static, it won't give you a dial tone or won't let you pick up which makes it tough when you are answering an incoming call. All in all, I have been satisfied with the phone, but unless Sony has fixed this problem, I will probably check elsewhere when buying another one.
