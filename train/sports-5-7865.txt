Plays every game like it's his last. Some think because he gives every ounce of his strength in every game, by the time the playoffs come around, he has nothing left. Interesting story from summer ball in Minnesota - a former Gopher was on fire, as good shooters will sometimes be. Anyway he's dropping three after three over Garnett. Garnett, of course, is playing like its game 7 of the NBA championship. Diving for lose balls, scrambling on D, going after every rebound. Well the guy continues to shoot the lights out, so Garnett takes a swing at him. While I don't advocate swinging at somebody you can't stop, it tells you something about the will to win of Garnett. One of the richest men in America, and he plays every second of every game like feeding his family depends on it. I'd pay to watch KG play any day.
