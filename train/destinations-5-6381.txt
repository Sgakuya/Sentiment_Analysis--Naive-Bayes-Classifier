Ignorance abounds in this forum from those who brand an entire state with labels such as, obese, prejudice, uneducated, bible-thumping rednecks riding on trash infested highways. That mindset is as prejudical and judgemental as it gets. Get past the little that you've seen and much you've heard about Tennessee and it's people. You will find beautiful mountains, breathtaking countryside, clean lake, arts, culture, sports, excellent schools, and communities filled with civic minded, family oriented, health conscience people whose incomes and lifestyle reflect educations and aspirations beyond the trailer park trash rednecks you depict us to be.
