You can't take away what they've accomplished. They just keep breaking records. No heroes. No flashy dances. No psycho egos with fur trimmed H2s. Just football. jmoney52, I feel for you. Colts are a great team with a great qb. Just not good enough this time around. eeeeeee, I also feel for you; it sucks to be that jealous of our little corner of paradise. And Zeck, hate to break it to you, but if there are fair weather fans, we just don't know about them because we've all been fans since the days of Lenkitis and Grogan (I think I was 10 year old back then), and those fair weather fans must not live here in NE. I can also explain why there are Packer bars all over the place; because Green Bay is such a frozen hell hole that they all moved out! :o)
