Not so bad. KC is up and coming. I grew up in the KC metro area and currently live downtown. It can be a lot of fun, if you know where to go. The city is spread out, so there are lots of nooks and crannys. KC has lots of work to do before it becomes attractive to visitors though. Hopefully that will change soon...the construction of the Sprint Arena in downtown is slated to begin and open by 2007. A new Performing Arts Center is under way, and will supposedly rival the Sydney Opera House...and be in downtown by 2008. Also after the arena is built, an entertainment district is supposed to open nearby called Kansas City Live. Hopefully this all comes about, as KC has been known to have a great plan to attract outsiders, but for whatever reason it never happens (ie The Power & Light District from the early '90s). KC currently offers fun for outsiders, but you gotta look for it. Worlds of Fun & Oceans of Fun, Swope Park & Zoo, Starlight Theatre, and Union Station & Science City are great for families to name a few. Westport and the Country Club Plaza are great nightspots for restaurants, bars, and shopping...not to forget Crown Center too. The newly renovated Liberty Memorial (the only WWI monument in the US) and Harry Truman's house & Presidential Library are also some tourist attractions. Three major riverboat casinos also offer great entertainment. And of course, Arrowhead and Kauffman Stadiums are two of the most grandest sports stadiums in the country. KC is home to one of the greatest football teams, the Chiefs (maybe I'm a bit biased), and the Royals are okay (they still have lots of work to do). All in all, KC isn't all that bad.
