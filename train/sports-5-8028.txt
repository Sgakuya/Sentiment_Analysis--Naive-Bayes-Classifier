At the beginning of the season, I wasn't sure what to think about Allen Iverson. I thought he was a good player, and definitely the best player on his team, but I wasn't sure whether he really wanted to be an NBA superstar or just another thug in the hood. But during the NBA Playoffs, I discovered exactly what the man who is called The Answer is all about. I watched in awe as he drove fearlessly into the lane against players who were much bigger than he was, and how he continued to play after getting knocked around so badly that many of us would have had to take a week off from work. I watched as he almost rallied his team back from a 30-point 4th quarter deficit against Milwaukee in Game 6 of the Eastern Finals. I saw how his team harnessed his raw emotion and rode it all the way to the Finals. As for his appearance and lifestyle, that is simply a case of a man being himself. Iverson has made me into a Sixers fan, but more importantly, he has made me into one of his fans.
