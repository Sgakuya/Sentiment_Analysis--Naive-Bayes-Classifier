He once was a terrorist/freedom-fighter but now is no more then an incompetent, power hungry leader afraid to let go and open the PA to make it a real democracy. After this Iraq war, the USA is looking to gain some credibility in the Arab world by trying to sort out the Palestine/Israeli mess. This is a perfect time for him to show he can lead, but yet again he will fail his people miserably and leave them to another decade under ocupation. While personally, I support a free palestine, and can undersatand their resistance against Israely ocupation, I despise the murdering of innocent civilians - by both sides.
