The PS2 may not be as powerful as its competitors, but I assure you that it's difficult to tell the difference in graphics or speed. What makes the PS2 so great is its selection of games. The PS2 has the most games available for it, and is the only system on which you can play some really great games (Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, and Grand Theft Auto 3 just to name a few). Its backwards compatibility allows you to double your game selection because you can play all the old games for the PS1 as well, which are very inexpensive these days. Also, the system plays DVDs nicely and has a lot of additional accessories for it. I've had my system for about a year now, and I don't regret buying it over another system one bit.
