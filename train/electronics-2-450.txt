I have had my Tivo for about a year. I received it as a Christmas gift and had never given much thought to them prior to that. First the good: The user interface is pretty easy to use and the Season Pass is nice. The bad: I have to agree with easterwh, setup was a pain because Tivo does NOT support HD. So in order to watch programs in actual HD I had to hook it up in a somewhat unorthodox fashion which results in a rather tedious process to switch between Tivo and HD. I was really disappointed and rather surprised that Tivo didn't support HD so beware. I'm not overly impressed with the video quality, it's OK but it's definitely not great. Another annoying thing is the infrared "eyes" which sometimes don't change the channel correctly so it records the wrong program. They are also slow to change the channel which just sucks. This is also the Series 2 box which means if you don't subscribe to the Tivo service the box is basically a paper wait that can only pause a rewind thirty minutes of TV; nothing more. Overall, I wouldn't recommend Tivo if your cable company offers a DVR which in my case is a better value. Oh and one more thing, do NOT buy the lifetime subscription. If the machine breaks the subscription is not transferable so you would be out the $300. I've heard these machines are prone to failure and the lifetime subscription is only a good deal if it lasts longer than 2 years and the warranty doesn't last that long.
