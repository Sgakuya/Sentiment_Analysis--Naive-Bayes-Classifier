Let me start by saying that I do not condone or seek to justify any wrong doing that Jesse has done. I do say that noone has any right to judge and many of us are not without sin. Our God is a forgiving God. No person is above mistakes! I don't see too many people rushing to try and make a difference in this world. African Americans have few leaders that are willing take take the fore front and fight. Don't be so quick to blow up the mistakes and forget the triumphs. Jesse was wrong and he has God to answer to, but as for his ability to lead and what he has done for African Americans and this country, I say he has been exemplary. I say continue on, Jesse, with the duty of civil rights leadership and leave it to the weak minded people to pass feeble judgements!
