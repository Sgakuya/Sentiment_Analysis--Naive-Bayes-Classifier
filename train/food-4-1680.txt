There's 2 kinds of smarties so here's what I think of both The sugar candies: They're ok, I wouldn't buy them but as a kid I always finished them off as part of my halloween candy though (most of the time among the last of it however). They all taste the same and the colour, and taste, is kinda faded but they are alright once in a while, not too often. Chocolate Smarties: Good quality chocolate inside but not enough of it, the shell - although better tasting than m&m's shell - is too thick. I find m&ms somewhat better but the two candies are extremely similar, right down to their promotions around various holidays.
