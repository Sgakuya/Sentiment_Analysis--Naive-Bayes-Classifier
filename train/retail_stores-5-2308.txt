The Food Basics in my area are great. Basically, it's a no frills version of the already popular Farmer Jack or A&P stores but promises lower prices because of a few missing frills such as baggers or the deli counters. But I dont care because their prices are so low. Who cares if you have to bag your own groceries and pay ten cents for each large heavy duty bag.Your're still saving lots of money. Plus they caring name brand foods along with the store brand America's Choice. It's not no name crap which is sold at other no frill stores such as Aldi or Sav-a-Lot. Not to mention the fresh food.Three cheers for Food Basics! Finally who cares about paying a 25 cent deposit for a cart when you save so much and get it back when you get done shopping!!!
