Jackie Robinson is my hero- plain and simple. Boy-wonder sports writers who were dumb CO majors in college will tell you how Robinson was mistreated by racism of the time. They don't tell you about the brutal daily occurences he faced - He recieved a serial-killer like death threats in the form of letters from Cincy fans that threatened to kill his wife and infant son if he dare show his face as Crosley feild. He was routinely spiked on the basepaths, thrown at in the batter's box, and the brunt of abuse from batting practice to the last out. Ever try hitting a curveball under those circumstances? Ever think about what the pressure must have been like? Jackie went to UCLA and excelled at track and football (baseball was low on his list) He became an officer in the US Army. I've heard the naysayers: Robinson's numbers aren't Hall of Fame material. True, Jackie's numbers represent a VERY GOOD ballplayer and a borderline Hall of Famer candidate. . .but consider this list- Rookie of the Year, a batting title, 5 time All Star, one MVP, lifetime .311 hitter, an above-average fielder, and one World Championship over the hated Yankees. But Jackie obtained this list under the worst possible conditions a human being could endure. He was NOT ALLOWED to fight back for the first 3 years. Jackie Robinson had more guts than a slaughterhouse. Robinson's life story is as compelling as anything I've ever read in literature. Whenever I feel anxiety or doubt, I think about Jackie Robinson. Only sad postcript to Robinson is that he was the death knell of the Negro Leagues. When is there going to be a national holiday after this guy?
