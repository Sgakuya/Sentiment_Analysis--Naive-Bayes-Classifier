I would give this movie a five if it had followed more closely to the book. I enjoyed the movie a great deal. Nearly all the young men of Hollywood at the time was in the movie. Swayze, Howell, Machio, Estevez, Sheen, Dillon, Cruise, you name'em and there in it. Coppola brought out the best in the lot of them. The story is about social conflict between the working class and the rich played out '50's gang style. A pleasure to watch. ( PERSONAL NOTE...... I am starting to see a bunch of reviews on this sight by childish, self absorbed people trying to promote or defame movies, people, or whatever is being reviewed for selfish or promotional reasons. There are even some who are posting with multiple names just to make their own opinion mean more. That is dishonest and rude.)
