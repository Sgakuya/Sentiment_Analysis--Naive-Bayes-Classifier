President Bush has done so much for America. He's beefed up our Military, after the Clinton Administration severly gutted it; He's taken on the challenge of fighting the United State's greatest and most difficult threat, terrorism, of which the Clinton Administration didn't dare to touch; He recognized Terrorism against the US as OUR problem, rather than trying to obtain a premission slip to defend ourselves from the UN; He's upheld and re-established dignity, class, and respect to the highest held office in the land; He's given ALL Americans well deserved tax cuts; He's risked his life by traveling to Iraq to uplift the morale of our brave men and women. Those who try to blame a withering economy on President Bush obviously need to take Economics 101, which would teach them that the ups and downs of the Economy are CYCLES. Whether the Economy is up or down has NOTHING TO DO with who is president. President Bush does not try to use fancy, evasive rhetoric. He's speaks in plain, clear, and concise language, which is very refreshing in our time of slimy, evasive, back-peddling policiticans. PS. I've noticed that the majority of those who have rated Bush with one star have provided no substantial evidence nor reasoning to back up their negative allegations. Of course, this is just one of many traits of the classic liberal!
