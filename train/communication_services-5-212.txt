Verizon Wireless is a very good company to purchase your cellular service from. I have been a Verizon Customer for quite some time and am very pleased with their pricing plans and customer service. A helpful hint when purchasing any cellular service is READ YOUR CONTRACT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR CONTRACT. Many people do not pay attention to this and regret it later. Most people who expierence problems with any cellular company usually bypass the terms of the contract along with the instruction manual of the phone. Many problems cellular customers have could be avoided if they would take responsiblity for their purchase.
