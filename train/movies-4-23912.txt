Better than 'Gladiator' I thought and good fun if you dont go to movies for intellectual enlightenment. You get a lot of these pretentious f***witted critics who love all these dreary kitchen sink dramas but diss actioners because they're not deep, and so you'll find many have slated 'Troy' for this. The fight scenes are impressive and well choreographed and on a whole it's a handsome and spectacular epic. On the downside, the woman who plays Helen has all the presence of a cabbage and some of the old British thesps are more camp than a row of tents at a scouts jamboree, Peter O Toole in particular. Brad Pitt doesnt quite convince as Achilles. He's better at unheroic weirdos as in 'Fight Club' and '12 Monkeys'.
