Well, well, well. At the risk of sounding opinionated, I must say that Moby Dick is the single greatest work of American Literature in history. I don't know why people thought it was boring, except that Melville liked to take about fourteen pages to describe the most mundane things. I was not bored once. Melville had the most highly developed aptitude for description, but managed to never seem redundant. The reason that this is the greatest work of American Literature is that it could be read and appreciated on many, many different levels, and it is easily one of the most ambitious novels ever penned. It can be appreciated as an adventure story, as an introduction to cetology, as an allegory for racial relations in early America, as a psychological analysis of a monomaniac (Ahab), as a critique of western religious and moral pretensions, as a thorough exposition of the whaling profession and industry, to give a few examples. Also, and this is subjective, I found Melville's high-flown linguistic style to be so quaint and unusual that I found myself laughing out loud in a few places (not many, but a few). If Melville had been slightly more prolific he would have been the American Dickens, but more fun to read. Check out his short stories and novellas as well.
