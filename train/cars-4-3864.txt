Nobody should be rating this vehicle unless you own one. Just saying it's ugly is not an indepth rating. I bought one in 2003 and it has treated me well. I did alot of research before buying one. I wanted a new SUV, but I didnt want to spend 30K+. I wanted (needed)4 wheel drive. I wanted something good on gas and something that is reliable and will keep it's value. The Honda Element fit all my needs. Has anyone noticed that since the Element was introduced, more and more vehicles are resembling the "box" look. The windshield issue is no joke, though. I've been through 4 windshields and Honda didnt cover them. It's not the angle of the windshield, but the quality of the glass. My father has a 1974 Scout that has more of an upright windshield. He has never had a crack, and he's had rocks hit before. I hope Honda fixes this problem. The versitility of the Element is outstanding. Being able to flip, lye flat or remove the rear seats in seconds expands the rear area immensely. I've had people say, "This has more room than my full size Explorer." It's tiny on the outside, with "limousine" room on the inside. 160 hp is perfect. Not a powerhouse, but it'll get up and go. The AWD works great. I live on a hill and it's gone up in a foot of snow. It just plows right through, not even a little slip. At highway speeds, I hear the wind, but NOTHING compared to a Jeep. Now I'm ready to get a motorcycle w/ a trailer and head for the Cape.
