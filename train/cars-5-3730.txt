I own a 1995 Hummer H1 and live in northern Manitoba ,Canada. For the long winters here you can't beat a Hummer. They dont slide through intersections when its icy and I have never felt safer driving down an icy highway. My Hummer is a diesel and costs less to drive then alot of my other friends suvs. I am not rich and paid about the same price for my used Hummer as someone would for a new truck. The nice thing is that I never paid the initial depreciation like you would with a new truck. If I decide to sell my Hummer I could probably get back all my money. Try that with an ordinary suv! I think that if someone has never driven or owned something then maybe they shouldnt review it. Say what you will about a Hummer, but when my friends go off-roading they alway's ask me to come along, so that I can pull them out. Besides that, who wants to drive the same vehicle as everyone else on the block?
