Released in 1991 and directed by Jonathan Demme, Silence Of The Lambs is a combination horror, mystery and thriller movie that takes the viewer through the criminal mind. For the uninitiated, the story revolves around young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is assigned to help capture a mysterious serial killer named Buffalo Bill who is murdering young women for their skins. Eventually, she must interview the brilliant, yet utterly evil psychologist and cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). While Starling is trying to get into the head of Buffalo Bill, she must attempt to keep Lecter out of her own. This movie was perfectly cast, written and directed as evidenced by the film's sweep of the five major Oscar categories; nevertheless, what makes this film effective is that the horror is so tangible and believable and that the cinematography makes the scenes feel cold and wet like early November.
