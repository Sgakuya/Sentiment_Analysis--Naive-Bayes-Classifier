I'm really surprised by some of the negative comments I've seen about Jared. I used to work as an independent appraiser, and I did a few Jared stores periodically. I found their merchandise to almost always appraise for more than it was sold for. They don't use the "50% off" gimmick to sell jewelry, and for the most part what they have is legitimately priced. Their on-premises repair and fabrication center does excellent work (at least in the 8 or 9 Jared's I've worked in) and their employees have more knowledge of jewelry characteristics and qualities than you see in most "borax" mall chain stores where the salespeople are nothing but clerks who write up the sales tickets on items you buy. There are exceptions to everything, but on the whole you will get a better item of jewelry, at a more reasonable price, without all they hype and misleading discounts at Jared than you will any other chain operation out there. I know. I've done them all. I've worked as an appraiser at Kay's, Marks and Morgan, Reed's, Littmans, Christian Bernard, Baily Banks and Biddle, Gordon's, Zales, Ross Simons, as well as a ton of independent mom-and-pop stores, and I've managed the bottom-dweller of garbage stores, Whitehall. Jared carries a complete selection, tons of Certified stones (don't EVER believe the color grade on and E.G.L. cert, and NO legitimate self-respecting appraiser or diamond grader will ever use the term SI3), and a knowledgeable staff.
