What is Illinois anyway? It's really seven small states packed into one. You have Chicagoland. Then there is the northern tier of the state which includes Galena that is a lot like southern Wisconsin. The Quad Cities area is unique and distinctive, and of course the Iowa side of the river counts here too. The greatest part geographically is one big corn field, but thankfully some of the original prairies are being restored. Springfield and vicinity because the state government resides there kind of stands apart and a large part of SW Illinois is suburban St. Louis which is part of Missouri. Southern Illinois has more in common with parts of Kentucky than it does with the rest of Illinois. So Illinois is a fractured decentralized place that in many ways lacks an identity that is so much a part of other American states. It's not on the ocean and outside of Chicago is quite ordinary, lacking any spectacular geographical features. Still, in many ways it is the most American state of all. It's got more than its share of history and intrigue even if you take Chicago out of the mix. There are no mountains or oceans or famous national parks. Still, to me the simplicity and beauty of a pristine Illinois prairie is a rare site to behold.
