I moved from Tennessee to Connecticut 29 years ago but return quite often for extended visits with family and friends. Never once in those visits have I encountered the undeducated, bible thumping, hillbillies as described by those claiming to have an insiders authority on the residents of Tennessee. What I HAVE found, is that people are warm, friendly, polite. What's more, they seem to have a better comprehension of the fact that liberalism does not define intelligence nor does conservatism define ignorance; and therefore roll their eyes and move beyond the snide remarks against this beautiful and scenic state. There is also plenty to do in most place you visit. Yes, I would miss the close proximity to the beach if we were to ever move back, but am otherwise glad to call Tennesee my second home.
