I would describe this movie as a hip, fast-paced, MTV-esque, German rendition of the movie Groundhog's Day ... In place of a rather ho-hum Bill Murray, the heroine of this movie is an actress with bright red hair and incredible energy. It is her energy and motivation, in fact, that kept me intrigued throughout the entire movie. And though parts of the film are repetitive (as they should be), Run Lola Run is a brilliant and outstanding piece of cinematic art. Along with the movie Sliding Doors, I would recommend Run Lola Run ...especially to those who are interested in the concept of what could have happened? ...
