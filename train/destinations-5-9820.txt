Wow, these are seriously strong cigarettes. They're big and fat so it's like smoking 2 normal cigarettes at once. It's so satisfying that you won't need another for a looooooong time. It's smooth like all Camels are, and rich too. But don't smoke them if you're new to it or a first-timer because I've been smoking for about 3 years and when I first tried one of these I nearly fell over because the nicotine high was so intense. Definetely an excellent cigarette though. Don't buy a carton because they go stale quickly. Personally though a pack carries me easily through a week, and with other cigs I usually go through 3 or 4 packs a week.
