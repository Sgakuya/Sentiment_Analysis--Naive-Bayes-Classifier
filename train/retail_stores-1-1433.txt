I was passed an email from a Vietnam War Verteran that disturbed me about this store. As you know most place will make contributions to projects like statues, memorials, or sponser things like special events. Well When the Veterans of Foriegn wars asked target for a donation to the Disabled Vietnam Veterans so They can put up a memorial for them, They were told by the Target Reps that Target Ent doesn't donate money to Things like Veterans memorials and other war related projects. This I find out is quite sad as I emailed the target Execs about this and found out this is true. I will no longer shop there as will all other Vets that have served whether protecting this country on foriegn lands or on our own soil. Remember 911, so many have forgotten already. Semper Fi
