Hey Canada, on behalf of the blue states of America (West Coast, Northeast, Great Lakes... the better, more civilized, more intellegent parts of the US that share more in common with Canada) I apologize for the ignorrance to Canada exhibited by the yokels of RIA. I love Canada in a big way. I'm still proud to be an American but I love the neighbors to the north. Canada is an immensely beautiful country and I've travelled all over it from the rainforests of the Pacific on Vancouver Island to the lighthouses and rocky shores of the Maritimes. BC rocks! Lofty mountains draped with green forests on their slopes meet the ocean. Some of the most amazingly beautiful coastal scenery is found on Vancouver Island. Whistler has world class skiing and Vancouver is a gorgeous,clean, modern, and prosperous city that embraces the cultures and it's position on the Pacific Rim. Montreal is one of the most fun cities in North America to visit. Lots of good looking people up there and awesome nightlife. People with an open mind can appreciate the french culture and international atmosphere that Montreal offers... definately a world class city with facinating history and archetecture. Canada has cosmopolitan cities that inspire Hollywood to film movies up there. For the most part it's a pretty safe place (unless the Vancouver Cannucks lose the NHL playoffs). I think the US and Canada can learn a lot from eachother and if you look around the borders of the world I think Canada is the best neighbor to have. All this animosity between the 2 countries noted below is just garbage from negative people looking to pick a fight. Whereever one may travel.. generally if you exude manners and respect you get the same in return.
