A charming little fishing village that neighbors the mega resort complex that is Ixtapa. While Ixtapa is a long, straight beach packed with gleaming, luxury hotels, Zihua is a quiet town nestled around a gorgeous cove. The two best beaches in Zihua are Playa La Ropa, and Playa Las Gatas. Playa La Ropa has white, fine sand and is great for swimming, and Playa Las Gatas is right on a reef and is perfect for snorkeling. The central hub of Zihua is a basketball court in the middle of town. While I was less than impressed with the quality of basketball in Zihua, it was interesting that the kids do seem to play more hoops than soccer. Food was shockingly expensive - $12 for a fish plate at the touristy type places, but if you venture back into the town you can find some decent meals. Zihua is still a fantastic place, but the feeling that I got is that it's about to jump the shark. There was talke of building a pier for Cruise ships, and the amount of construction going on hinted that the town doesn't plan on being a sleepy lilttle fishing village for long... check it own now before it morphs into Ixtapa.
