THE BOOK STALINGRAD BY ANTONY BEEVOR IS A POWERFUL DESCRIPTION OF THE BATTLE WHICH TOOK PLACE. IT HAS BEEN ALSO IMPARTIAL WHILE DESCRIBING THE ATROCITIES OF BOTH THE SIDES. HE HAS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL ABOUT THE HORRORS AND SUFFERINGS OF THAT BATTLE EXPERIENCED BY SOILDIERS AND CIVILIANS ALIKE. BUT ONE IMPORTANT EVENT HE HAS OMITTED, HE HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT OPERATION MARS, IN WHICH ZHUKOVS TROUPS SUFFERED A DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF WEHRMACHT. RUSSIANS SUFFERED ABOUT 335000 CASUALTIES AT THE HANDS OF GERMANS. AS ZHUKOV WAS IN THE GOOD BOOKS OF STALIN, NOT A WORD WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THIS SETBACK BY SOVIET WAR HISTORIANS. WHY BEEVOR LIKE THE SOVIET WAR HISTORIANS WAS SILENT ON THIS EVENT IS A MYSTERY. THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH HE HAS DONE TO WRITE THIS BOOK,THIS OMISSION IS SURPRISING. OTHERWISE THIS IS A BOOK WHICH HAS NARRATED THE EVENTS IN DETAIL,THAT ONE CANNOT PUT DOWN THE BOOK TILL COMPLETION OF READING IS OVER. THIS GIVES AN INSIGHT OF THE SUFFERINGS WHAT THE INHABITANTS HAD TO FACE. SUCH WERE THE CONDITIONS THAT FORCES FROM BOTH SIDES WERE ABLE TO EXPLOIT THE LOCAL POPULACE, ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN.MANY PERSONS INCLUDING SMALL CHILDEN WERE SHOT BY THE RUSSIANS AND GERMANS ALIKE, WHICH IS AGAINST THE GENEVA CONVENTION. AS RUSSIANS WERE THE ULTIMATE VICTORS, NOBODY RAISED A FINGER AGAINST THEM (PATTON BEING AN EXCEPTION,AND MANY MAY RECALL THAT HE OPENLY CRITICISED THE RUSSIANS AND FOR THIS HE WAS REMOVED FROM THE POST OF MILITARY GOVERNER IN POST-WAR GERMANY.)FOR THE ATROCITIES THEY COMMITTED.
