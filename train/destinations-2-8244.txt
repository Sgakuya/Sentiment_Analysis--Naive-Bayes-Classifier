On a rare disagreement with Magellan, I actually found Fremont St/downtown Vegas to be depressing as hell. I mean, I LIKE authencitity, soul, and whatnot, but this type of experience was not what I was looking for on vacation. The "light show" was tacky, the atmosphere veered from decadent to downright dangerous, esp for female travelers and/or children. There was a sign on the window of one bar for 99 cent margaritas that particular night; my wife went inside and ordered one and it was brought to her in a tiny styrofoam cup - pretty classy, eh? From what I can see, the saving grace for downtown Vegas is the Golden Nugget Hotel/Casino. But just a suggestion; don't stray too far from that hotel at night on foot, as all signs of illicit, illegal activity are lurking around not too far in the distance - esp btwn this area and the Stratosphere Hotel at the edge of the strip.
