While a long film with some incredibly cheesy and just plain dumb moments, it wasn't too bad. It was more of a movie for the patriot (no pun intended) because of the way the British are portrayed. I'm sure that some British commanders were a little crazy, but The Patriot makes it seem like they are crazy and stupid. In addition to the fact that once again, our hero (Mel Gibson) is invincible and able to kill fifty people and still make it home to dinner. However, all movies are like that, so I can't really punish The Patriot in that respect. There is a romantic subplot that contributed most of the cheesy parts of The Patriot, but I guess it adds something for the girls out there, if they aren't already enticed to see it because of Mel Gibson's charming good looks. :) All in all, it was a pretty good movie that did get some of that patriotic pride coming out of my heart. I recommend it for people who aren't overly concerned with a correct portrayal of history, like gory scenes, and can stand to sit still for three hours straight.
