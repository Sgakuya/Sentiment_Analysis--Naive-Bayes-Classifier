As I recall, the year Lewis got 2000 yards, he also led the league in fumbles while playing on a team with a stellar defense and no offense outside of him. He put the ball on the ground more often than he put in the end zone (15 fumbles to 14 TDs). The defense got him back the ball quick. Kyle Boller was pathetic. The o-line was only built for run blocking. The only thing they could do was hand him the rock, and even then he wasn't reliable. Now, judging by how horribly he's done lately, being on pace for less than 1000 this year with just 3 TDs averaging just over 3 yards a carry, I'd say it's officially time for everyone to jump off of his bandwagon. He sucks...
