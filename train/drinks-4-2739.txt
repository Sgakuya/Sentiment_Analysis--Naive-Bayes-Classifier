I am a Starbucks addict. There are about eight Starbuck's stores within two miles of my house (almost all of them have a drive through). I think the coffee is great (I get mine with no cream), it sure wakes you up! But my true obsession is the Gingerbread Latte, Eggnog Latte and White Chocolate Mocha. I dare to think how much money I have spent at starbucks in the last 7 years. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because of the price. Four dollars for a latte? Whoaaa. I have cut down a lot (I get a latte about once per week), but still. In my Starbucks addict days, I went through the drive through all the time. The workers knew my child by name.Pretty sad.
