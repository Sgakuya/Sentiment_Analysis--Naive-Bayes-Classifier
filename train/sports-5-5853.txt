I don't know how well he will do as a Pro, but as a college player, playing on a first class team with a first class coach, he rates an Excellent. Putting his individual performances aside. he is a team player. And he needs his team to score as well as he has been doing. He is not a gunner, just check how many shots he takes a game. To score you must shoot. He has made himself an all around player through his hard work. I will concede that he is at times a little cocky. When you are good and you know it, it can perhaps be irritating to others, especially his detractors and Duke haters. But have you never seen how so many athletes just strut after a made dunk or touchdown? It's part of the culture today. So let's cut him a little slack and admire what he is accomplishing. No referee or fan or team mate or whoever is putting the ball through the hoop.
