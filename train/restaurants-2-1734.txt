For the past few years, I've gone to Blimpies several times a week. It was almost a joke, the way I was their most regular customer. But the last 3 or 4 times I have gone there, I couldn't even get waited on. It wasn't crowded: they have new workers at the one in our town, and they're lazy! They'll ignore you wander around slowly behind the counter looking like they're trying to find something to do - anything but wait on the customer. Each of the last few times I was there, I very quietly gave up and walked out, and now I'm through with them. They had great food, but I don't need that kind of rudeness (Subway's been treating me well lately!).
