This guy was riding the 5 Fulton yesterday. He was with his buddy who still lives in SF, who I could best describe as Apollo Creed. There were only a handful of people on the bus so I got to listen in. They were talking about how they were neighbors near the USF area, and they were talking about their childhood. They're old-fashioned type guys, who grew up listening to jazz and dancing and playing ball, and going to Church on Sunday's and being very family oriented. They talked about how they're upset with today's black culture, with rap, degrading women, dirty language, and gang violence being associated with young black men. They mentioned how in the 60's, 70's, 80's, black men were getting away from being repressed and started to form their own culture and finally had the opportunity to make a positive impact on society, and then something happened. Parents started raising their children to take things to the extreme, and really stand out but in a negative way, which explains certain behavior - outright violence and drug use and crime. It was interesting, to hear the conversation these guys had. I felt like I was in a time warp.
