Coach Smith is simply one of the best coaches in the country and an asset to the University of Kentucky as well as the Commonwealth. I believe he will continue to survive the opinions of such fools as we see posting here and in time quite possibly prove himself to be the best coach UK has ever had. It is hard to imagine how little one would have to know about either basketball or the man to provide Mr. Smith a 1-Terrible or 2-Bad rating born of honesty. Far more than ignorance coupled with fan fanaticism, it seems clear that these sorts of critiques more often than not, have the strongest portion of their base built upon racist origins. How sad.
