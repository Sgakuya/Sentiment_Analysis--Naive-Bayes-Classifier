I expect every decent movie of the past is going to one day get a remake. We'll be seeing remakes of Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, and Rocky anytime soon. No surprise that Willie Wonka was due for a remake. I saw the Gene Wilder version of Willie Wonka with my kids. It was good and this souped up version with Johnny Depp is also good. Depp does a great job. In Pirates of the Carribean, he supposedly modeled his characer after Keith Richards. It seems pretty obvious what pop icon (who was in the news of late) Depp is modeling this time (he even wore gloves). Comparisons to the old movie are mandatory, I would say that Jack Albertson did a better job than the old dude playing the grandad in this version. I also liked the old-version Oompa-Loompas -- the ones in this movie were kind of creepy. I also liked the songs in the old version as each rotten kid gets dispatched. In the final analysis, Roald Dahl's outstanding story is hard to screw up.
