Hmmmmm Cage rules. Let's analyze your critique of the Toyota Supra. Can't beat 0-60 in 2.43 seconds or max out at 235 mph . So what? The Supra is a competent, durable, well-rounded sports car many people could live with. It's fast and high tech without being overly ostentatious. The Viper on the other hand is U-G-L-Y. Can you afford the gas for your precious Viper? The insurance? How do you park the damn thing without hitting another car? Are you prepared to live with a lemon? Where do you store your sunglasses? How does the Viper handle twisting, winding roads? Duh. Like I said before, the Viper is a one trick pony.
