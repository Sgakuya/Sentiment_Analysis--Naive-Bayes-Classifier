I'm from there and having lived in other provinces, U.S., Australia it's hard to beat, particularly in June and early July. Lack of large industry, aside from several french fry processing plants, gives it a clean image too. Still very dependent on the small family farm and independent fishermen. Winter is hibernating period for some, for others a time for ice-fishing, snowmobiling and enjoying the countryside without tourists underfoot. Mid July-mid August is the big tourist period, lots of festivals, good weather, beaches are filled, some hotels are as expensive as Florida or the Carolinas... 140,000 year-round residents, 1.5 million tourists in July/August/September
