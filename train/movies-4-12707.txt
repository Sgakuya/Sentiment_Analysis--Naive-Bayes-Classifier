The weakest of Moore's films, but still quite good, as the life-long member of the NRA takes aim at perhaps the most irresponsible U.S. industry of them all, namely, the death-dealers who supply firearms to the carnage-worshipping and threatened pathetic men in this country who feel they have to arm themselves to the teeth. This film, because it deals with such a disconcerting issue that most people tend to sublimate, is less memorable than his other efforts, but nonetheless makes its points. One of the major problems with this nation is that so many so-called men are so frightened by the changing world, so beset with feelings of inadequately and inferiority, that they feel a quick-fix means to even the playing field is to go out and get a gun to serve as their Freudian extension. Usually, they cite the need to protect themselves, their families and their homes, but don't indicate precisely what unforeseen enemy they're defending themselves against. And of course, the totally irresponsible arms industry is more than happy to meet this preceived need: some people would sell cancer or AIDS if they could develop a market for it. What was hiliarious about this film was the part dealing with fourth-rate Hollywood poseur and has-been, fifth-rate rightwing apologist, and sixth-rate NRA hack Charlton (I have atrophied testicles) Heston. Here, the so-called actor who bored us to tears in the Ben-Hur days, can barely stay awake while on camera, and refuses to answer any questions regarding his own responsibility, or lack thereof, in promoting gun violence through his shilling for those sick and dangerous NRA types. The gun will be taken from Heston's cold, dead hands soon enough, folks, given the fact that this doddering pathetic excuse for a man is already older than some dirt. When he's worm food, the nation will be a safer place, indeed.
