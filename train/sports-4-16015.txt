It's rare to get a player like him. He's both an excellent player and leader at the corner position. He's also been extremely durable throughout his career, with the exception of his foot injury last season. I like some other corners better in terms of talent, like Pat Surtain and Champ Bailey, but he's as good as anyone in terms of leadership at his position. The fact that he's over 30, is coming off of a major injury, and doesn't even know what team he's going to play on prevents me from rating him a 5. Update: Law had an amazing game the other day with 3 interceptions against division rival Buffalo. It may have been a game that didn't matter, but it looked like it mattered to him. With 5 INTs in the last 4 games alone, Law really came on strong at the end of the year. Although there is bound to be less media interest in him this offseason as he will more than likely become a free agent again, I'd say he looks better now than he did a year ago. Especially since he's not coming off of an injury. He may be a year older, but I think he can have at least 2 more solid seasons.
