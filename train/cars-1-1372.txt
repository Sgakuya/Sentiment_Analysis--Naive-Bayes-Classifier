The Jetta is the worst car in the world. I have a 1995 Jetta I bought used with only 20,000 miles on it. The first 2 years I thought it was great, then it started breaking down. One thing after another, after another. Everytime It breaks down, I hear This is common for a Volkswagon or What do you expect, it's a Jetta And, most parts are dealership only, which is very expensive. Apparently, everybody knows this car only lasts a few years. I will never buy another volkswagon. I should've stuck with American cars. So, to all of you that have new volkswagons I suggest you get rid of them before they start breaking down.
