I've always been a fan of Wendy's since I was a kid. Their frosty is the best and I've always looked forward to it. However, my opinion has changed. I don't know what happened to Wendy's but their staff needs more training and/or better managers and their burgers have become sickening. I don't think Big and Juicy means greese oozing out in every bite. At the first Wendy's I ate at in this area, the burger was so greesy, and the place dirty, that I refuse to return. From the second Wendy's I've eaten at in the area I ordered a Frosty, and only a frosty, from the drive through lane. That was an amazingly fast drive through lane. However, the last Wendy's I went to ruined it for me. It was at a key location so they charged me like $3.50 for a double cheeseburger. What happened to the dollar menu? It wasn't even Disney for crying out loud! It would be understandable if it wasn't the worst burger I ever ate. It was ultra greesy. I took napkins and wiped a ton off. Then I proceeded to eat it until I looked down and saw the pool of greese that would ooze out wherever I took a bite. The bread wasn't even absorbing it all. It made me so sick I couldn't finish eating it. Actually, I was still noticably sick to my stomach hours later. I don't even remember the last time I had any circulation problems, but after eating that nasty thing it came back and my hands kept getting cold for no reason for hours afterwards. I can't imagine when I'll be daring enough to try to eat at a Wendy's again. At least not a hamburger. But I'll still stop by for a frosty if I'm up to it. It's no wonder why there are so few compared to other fast food places.
