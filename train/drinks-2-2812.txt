I am a consistent buyer of your International Coffees. Sugar-free (I am diabetic)decaffeinated Suisse Mocha being my favorite. I linke to mix the Frech Vanilla with the Suisse Mocha and am writing concerning the French Vanilla Sugar Free Decaf. The can number 13302s 10:42 does not dissolve like the Mocha does. After using boiling hot water on the coffee does not dissolve. Why does this happen? Some other Vanillas that I have bought do dissolve quickly and smoothly. Not this can! Was something done differently that this occurs every now and then? Please let me know as I purchase at least two cans a month. The generic Vons Vanilla does dissolve most of the time.
