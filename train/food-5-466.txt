Have a craving for something less sweet in the morning, with or without milk? Something soft yet filling? Something corny, but in a good way? Fill a bowl with Kellogg's Corn (Sugar) Pops and you'll discover what makes this different from most sugar filled cereals. No need to put these things in the microwave (if you want to) because they already have an appearance similar to popcorn. For those expecting some popping sounds due to the milk, don't let yourself be disappointed. By the time you're done eating an entire box's worth of the corn flavored pops that are Corn Pops, you may start searching for a much larger box.
