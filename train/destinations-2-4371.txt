I was born and raised in Birmingham and have lived there pretty much all of my life. An honest opinion of the city is that it is defintely a city with great potential but due to its lack of good leadership, the city is headed in a backward's direction compared to other cities of it's size in the south. Birmingham was terribly hurt by the huge migration of residents to the suburbs. It has a huge suburban sprawl similar to a smaller version of Atlanta. There are lots of shopping options in the suburbs, especially (Hoover and the Hwy. 280 area) and lots of friendly people (except when in traffic.) Large parts of the city is infested with crime and has a pretty large number of homicides year after year. Until city leadership is ready to move this city into another direction and make better decisions for the benefit of the city and its citizens, the city will never become the great city that it is destined to be and may only get worse as time goes along.
