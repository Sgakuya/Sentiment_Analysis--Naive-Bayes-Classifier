UPDATE 3-http://thinkprogress.org/?tag=State%20of%20the%20Union Go to this wesite and see how old BUSHY lied to America last night. Can you believe that they actually applauded the failure of Dopey's failed Social Security plan? How stupid are Republicans? See for yourself how this administration has ruined America and how far downhill we have gone. UPDATE 2-See UPDATE 1 below-Well it seems Bush's buddy and business partner Osama bin Laden has threatened the US again (really?) and the threat level has not been raised. What's up with that? I guess Bush must not be scared. Just like on 9/11/01 when the second "plane" hit Tower 2 while he read about the goat to the children, putting those innocent children at risk, or where they??? Well let's start with the fact that President Bush lied to us about going to war with Iraq. They knew that there were no WMD well before they invaded and that is why Karl Rove outted Valerie Plame because she knew. Rove will be sent to jail, one of Bush's cronies. He never let the inspectors finish their job. Poverty has gone up since Bush has taken office. Clinton inherited a poverty rate of 15% from Reagan and it decreased to about 11% under Clinton. It has increased again to 12.7% in 2004 under Bush. The number of Americans without health insurance has increased from 41% to almost 46%. The top 1% of wage earners are making 51% more than the poorest households who only get a meager 3.8% increase in salary under President Bush. He appointed another crony, Michael Brown to FEMA, who had absolutely no experience in handling true disasters and totally mishandled the Hurricane Katrina disaster, which led to many deaths in the Superdome, the Convention center and in the city of New Orleans. There are many in Mississippi that still have not even heard from FEMA. I have personally spoken to people in Mississippi and confirmed this myself. As a sidebar, the Republicans could have saved New Orleans when Clinton was President when the Army Corps of Engineers had a plan all set to fix the levees and there was a plan to save the wetlands but the Republicans voted it down. Now WE the People of the US have to foot a MUCH LARGER bill now, thanks to the Republicans. President Bush's crony David Safavian, the chief procurement officer for the government was indicted for lying about an investigation of the corrupt Republican-sided lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the dirty dealings he has done with House members, the newly indicted ex-Speaker of the House Tom DeLay and Robert Ney along with Ralph Reed, Neal Volz and Grover Norquist. All of this is verifiable but it seems you conservatives talk but can't back it up with facts. All I have said can be backed up with truthful facts. I could go on. The Bush administration is nothing more than a greedy, corrupt and yes, treasonous bunch of cronies. The dominoes are beginning to fall. Can Chertoff and maybe Bush be far off? When the bi-partisan commissions get organized and we find out that we got lied into a war and over 2000 of our soldiers were MURDERED and how FEMA continues to screw up along the Gulf Coast. Then maybe these rehearsed photo ops and speeches and goodwill tours of Bush trying to tell the US that he is doing a good job for us will stop while HR 3893 was passed keeping gas prices high and no new refineries built and the environment ruined with new drilling in Alaska. But our gas prices will still be high. Hey, didn't we go to war in Iraq for the oil; no I thought we went to stop terrorism or was that to stop WMDs? Corruption, big business over the little guy, greed, treason. How much more can I point out to you? It's all on the table? I wish I could rate Bush a zero star. We all know he lost to Gore but another Republican crony put Bush over the top. Prove me wrong on anything I have said, with facts. Not with a put down or a knock or a big mouth remark, FACTS to tell me, I'm wrong. UPDATE 1-Now our chicken leader wants to find out what you're Googling. He wants to find out if you're looking for pornography on Google so they can take more of your First Amendment rights away from you. They want to start an Anti-Pornography bill. Why don't we just take the First Amendment away from the Constitution as well as our PRIVACY. You right wing conservatives think that it is OK to bug us to find out if we're all terrorists, why not take away the right to look at anything we want to on the Internet. The right to look at what we wabt is OUR rihgt, the governments. If a parent does not want their children to look at pornography, there are many filters to choose from. Anyone over the age of 18 is entitled to do what they and to look at what they wany per the FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STAES CONSTITUTION! Or do you right wing conservatives don't believe in that amendment or only the one that you think you can have a gun when only the militia can have guns.
