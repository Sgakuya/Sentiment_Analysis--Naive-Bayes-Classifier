What Houston lacks in subway transportation, it makes up for with its Downtown Tunnel System. Whether its windy and 30 degrees in January, or muggy and 105 degrees in July, you're sure to enjoy a comfortable stroll just beneath the surface of the crowded inner-city streets. There are plenty of shoppes to wander through, several restaurants, and even a few coffee bars. Big back-lit maps of the entire system can be found around just about every corner, so you can't get lost. Each section of the system has its own name and its own unique character: one section will have an ultra-modern look; the next, a retro-50's look! Best of all is the access the tunnels provide to several skyscrapers... Nations Bank Center, Chase Tower, Wells Fargo Plaza to name a few. The views are breathtaking!
