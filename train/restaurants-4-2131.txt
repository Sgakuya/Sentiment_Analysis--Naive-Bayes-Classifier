I'm not even going to bother complaining. There's certainly enough of that to go around here already. I just thought I'd let the tea drinkers here know that you still have some options. After complaining to head office, I found out that all stores are still required to have the old tea bags on hand if people request them, so if that's what you want, just ask for a tea with the tea bag, and you'll get the tea you're used to. Unfortunately the new price hike is still a problem though. However, if you want to save some money and don't mind doing some work yourself, you can also now buy those tea bags. Just ask for the black box tea, and I think it's about $2 for 20 bags. Oh, I do have one question though for all the Tim Hortons' employees who may read this... Why do you seem to think cream the default for tea? Nobody drinks tea with cream. If someone asks for a double-double tea, they mean 2 MILK, 2 sugar. Are you trained to use cream unless people ask for milk, even in tea? Someone needs to tell management that's just not how it works. :)
