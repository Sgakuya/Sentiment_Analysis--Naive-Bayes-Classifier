This book comes pretty close to being perfect. I tend to tear through books, but The Joke is so well written, it encourages you to measure and savor every word. The story revolves around Ludvik - a former communist expelled from the Party for three lines he wrote as a 20 year old student designed to push the buttons of his over zealous girlfriend, Marketa. A Joke if you will. When Ludvik is expelled from the Party, his life goes into a tailspin. He spends some time in a hard labor for black marked Politicals and eventually ends up in jail. Once out of jail, every waking moment and action is driven by his bitterness about the unfairness of his lot. He seduces and has violent sexual relations with the wife of the man who led his ouster of the Party, only to find once again, the Joke was on him. He loses track of his old friends because they remind him of the naive man he was. He gives up his love of Moravian folk music because it reminds him of the Party. Brilliant writing combined with Kundera's uncanny ability to put himself in the minds of his riveting characters makes this a top 5 book for me.
