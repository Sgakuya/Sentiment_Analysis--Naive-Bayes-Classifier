A most wonderful learning enivrionment if one has the required monetary funds. Marks can be easily bought, as well as sex; from both the student body and the faculty. Residences are up to standards if one does not mind living among vermin and their fesces. The tolerance level of my peers at this distinguished institution is very good except for the occasional cross burning on the lawn of the Harvard African American Society. This however is incredibly understandable considering the fact that members of the Brothers in Arms for Afghanistan Social Club are forced to shave their hair, and I mean ALL hair. Just part of the friendly welcome one can expect upon enrolling at this fine place of learning. I hope my comments have been helpful and enlightening
