I think it's pretty obvious these previous posters have never been to Huntsville or know very little about it. I was born and raised there, so I'll offer a native's perspective. As a kid growing up there, I couldn't wait to get the heck out of town. As a married man in my mid-30s, I'd move back in a heartbeat if my wife were up to it. In a nutshell, if you're young and looking for excitement and culture, look elsewhere. If you're family minded, looking for good paying jobs in technical fields, looking for a low cost of living, looking for safe neighborhoods, and beutiful scenery, you can't go wrong in Huntsville. As far as excitement, Huntsville is turning the corner a bit downtown. This is the fastest growing city in Alabama and many Notherners are surprised by the un-Southerness of the place. Lots of potential.
