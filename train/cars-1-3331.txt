Last Saturday, Feb 1, 2003, My '96 Gr Cherokee just sputtered to a stop in the high speed lane of a local highway. I had to get it towed to the dealer for diagnosis and repair. What I found out astonishes me. It seems that putting gasoline in my fuel tank has caused my fuel pump to fail. I know, it seems ridiculous to me too, but its true. What's more, the dealer indicated it may be several days before he can get parts as several others are having similar problems. The details: It seems in late 90's Chrysler put a liner in their fuel tanks that deteriorates or dissolves after prolonged contact with gasoline. The sludge that results fouls the fuel pump and the fuel pump eventually fails. A call to Chrysler yielded only the form letter response This vehicle is beyond it's warranty period, any maintenance is the responsiblity of the owner that I have seen verbatim in other's postings on this site. . When I inquired further, The Chrysler Customer Assistance Hot Line indicated that there were no others with similar issues. This is in direct conflict with the claims of my local Dealership's Service Mgr who has 2 others on his lot with this same problem and indicates he can't get parts because they are back-ordered. SO, You can see, the replacement of the fuel tank and the fuel pump is obviously the owner's problem since I actually put Gasoline into my Gasoline Tank for the past 6 years! Pretty Lame. So let's do something about it! If you have had a similar occurence, please register it here. Daimler Chrysler arrogantly denies that there is any sort of trend - Let's show them a trend!
