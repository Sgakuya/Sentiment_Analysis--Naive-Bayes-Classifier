I won't go into the long and excruciating details of my nightmare experience with these assholes, but I will warn you to STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS! I chose them because their quote was by far the cheapest, but this saving became a joke when the circumstances in which their incompetence placed me cost me an additional $1500 and a month of completely wasted time. MARK DEHAL (Ontario long distance sales) will tell you lies and then screen yor calls and refuse to respond to messages. Particularly if you are a young woman, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MAN, as he will suddenly offer to do an in-person quote if he likes your voice, but really he is just coming to check you out. He is extremely sleazy; please beware. No matter what your budget is, if you value your belongings, your time, your money, and your sanity, you will stay as far away from this corrupt company as possible .
