I can't see how Bush or Gore have much in common with the vast majority of Americans. I don't believe in either one of these guys. As a middle class professional I see my commrades as the ones who support it all. I have an 88 year old millionaire Grandmother and my family is going to be raped by the Government in inheritance taxes some day. I don't believe that my Grandparents worked their Indiana farm and lived the conservative, modest life of saving and building for the future of the family to give half of it away. You can think what you want about NAFTA but you need to be aware of how it's effecting the American farmer. After all they produce the food that is necessary for your very existence. Yet in these prosperous economic times they are still being forced into bankruptcy. That makes me sick yet it doesn't seem to be an issue that anyone is even aware of. Huge corporations such as ADM and ConAgra have been raping the American farmer for decades. Are any of you aware that farmers are receiving less in the market place per unit, be it grains or meat, than they were in the early 1970's????? Could you exist on less than you earned in 1972. Meanwhile everything involved in crop or livestock production keeps up with the inflation of rest of the consumer market thusly reducing the profit margin more and more all of the time for these hard working people. I'm engaged to be married and will be stabbed once again by the government with higher taxes. I'm sick and tired of the dishonesty , corruption, and sycophancy in the system between the huge corporations, lobyists, and politicians. I don't know who to vote for.
