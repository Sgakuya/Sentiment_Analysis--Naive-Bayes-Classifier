jack Nicholson is good as a man whose life changes when he is forced to retire and wife dies a couple weeks later. His daughter who lives far away is getting married to someone he is not fond of. He has just bought recreational trailer and goes across country to his daughters wedding. he meets others along the way and the son in laws relatives including Kathy Bates who is great as the guys mom. He also writes to a boy he is sponsoring in Africa. A nice movie No huge things happen just a man whose life has changed a lot in the last couple months and his adjustment to it, It was good to see Kathy Bates and Jack Nicholson together in a movie. they were very good together.
