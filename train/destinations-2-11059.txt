If that dancing man in their commercials stopped here, I don't think he'd be that damned excited about it. I sure as hell wasn't. I remembered the park from its beginnings as Wild World, then later as Adventure World. I had hoped it would have improved from Wild World, but today I found out that it hadn't too much. PROS: Admission Prices were reasonable in comparison to neighboring parks (Paramount's Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Hershey Park). The Water Park's water was noticably cleaner than many other water parks I've visited. The roller coasters would rate a 4 for quality (fun) and quantity. CONS: Parking costs $9.00 alone. Out of all the rides my husband and I went on, only 3 rides DIDN'T have seats blocked off from the public for maintenance (I kid you not), two rides were completely shut down (including one roller coaster), and someone made the great decision to make riders get off the train after loading it in order to switch trains (which made me wonder what's broken THIS time?). This gives me reason to question the park's safety measures, if so many of the rides are not fully operational. This might be closer to home for me, but I'd rather take an extra few hours to get to a better park.
