Great place to work for, anybody who says different is a person who either just has a bad attitude or is lazy and is looking to put the blame on someone else. Go join the union, they will protect your laziness. There are rude people at any store, one bad apple doesnt mean the whole bunch is bad, these bad apples are dealt with. No express lane, why should they use that extra checker to check out the people with just a couple things when the people with full baskets out number them 4-1. Dont like that? Go to Albertsons, they could use the business, need a cart full of stuff? Go to Winco, save money. Most people with bad comments must live very close to a Winco, It's the most convenient store to get to, so they must make everything else convenient for them. Much like most americans. Not a perfect store to go to, but it is the best.
