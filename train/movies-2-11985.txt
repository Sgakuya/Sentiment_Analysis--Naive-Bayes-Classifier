The intentions of this movie were good enough, there was some humor, but the delivery was predictable cliched and unrealistic. The dialog is generally pitiful. Jason Biggs seems too good looking to play the role of a dorky college student. In fact his hip roomates actually seem more socially inept than he from the start (I don't know if this was intentional or not). Jason plays an overstudious college student who doesn't get along with these guys because they like to party (they merely act stupid, and I don't think any hip or pseudo-hip real life collegs student will buy these guys as winners). Anyway, this leads to a predictable winner vs. loser plot that you've seen before in a 100 other movies. Greg Kinnear is embarassingly bad as the professor, and Dan Akyroyd makes a most unwelcome cameo. I must say I definitely enjoy looking at cute Jason, and he does take off his shirt (again) in one scene which deserved a rewind.
