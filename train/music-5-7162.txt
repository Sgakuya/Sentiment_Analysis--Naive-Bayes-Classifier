I can't rate anything having to do with Nirvana less than a 5 or risk being kicked off of the Sub Pop mailing list forever. This video was obnoxious but you can argue that though brilliant and culture altering, Nirvana's sound was pretty obnoxious (in the best sense of the word). I think that very obnoxiousness is what made Nirvana so great, I mean the whole grunge movement was pretty much in-your-face nonconformity. I think that is what the cheerleaders are supposed to symbolize here, when I think of cheerleaders I think of blonde girls in powder blue sweaters but these girls were dark and tatooed, enticing the crowd to riot through the banging of their heads. I love the red light that they set up on Kurt Cobain and his scrunched up expression as he screams the lyrics. This video symbolizes the mad energy of the time and if you're going to make a music video for mass consumption then full out spectacle is the only way to go.
