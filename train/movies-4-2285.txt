Released in 1982 and directed by Walter Hill, 48 Hrs. is a successful buddy cop film which launched Eddie Murphy as a film star. For the uninitiated, the story involves the escape of a murderous convict who is trying to get his hands on some loot before his ex-partners do. In order to catch the killer, streetwise detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) releases con-man Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy), who was a member of the old gang, for 48 hours so that he can help the investigation. Through several trials and tribulations, the duo come to respect each other. Though a tired theme, this film works primarily due to the chemistry between Nolte and Murphy, especially since the latter's comedy was still fresh at the time. The bottom line is that 48 Hrs. is one of the better fighting partners, cop films to be released and is responsible for many similar movies to be released afterwards.
