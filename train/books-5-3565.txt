Way underrated, and needs to be read by more people. It can be read on so many levels. The Trial is something we all endure: the Court, the Law Offices, the mysterious higher power is in all of us, all the time. And what exactly was K's crime? Maybe he thinks of no one but himself? Try to find one time in the book where he feels or acts on any compassion for any other human being. It is fun to imagine a debate between Kafka and Ayn Rand, the High Priestess of Ego. --Throughout The Trial are little evidences that it can be read as an allegory for the judgements we render on ourselves. A great book! Five stars.
