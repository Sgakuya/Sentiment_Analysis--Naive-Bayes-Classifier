The management of these stores has been absolutely terrible. I can see why so many of the stores are closing down after they declared bankruptcy. It's some of the people that worked at the stores that I will miss. I feel for them being tossed out of their jobs like yesterdays garbage without any notice. A company of that size had to know what was going on and should have notified those individuals what was transpiring. After talking to some of them (Crescent employees) I can see why they are so disgusted with the company. I will never by another item from that company and I will pass the word out to many other people I know not to ever use this company again. They sure don't know how to take care of their customers or thier employees.
