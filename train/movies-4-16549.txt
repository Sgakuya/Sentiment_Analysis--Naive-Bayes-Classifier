A feel-good movie if ever there was one. Proving once again that in spite of the storyline if Nicolas Cage stars I m guaranteed to enjoy at least part of the film simply due to his off the wall presence. I really did enjoy more than part of this one though I enjoyed it all. Tea Leone also did a very convincing and lighthearted job as Kate (Jack s girlfriend/wife). One of the best and most endearing actors though would have to be little Makenzie Vega who played the couple s 5-year-old daughter to adorable perfection. If you find yourself one evening more in the mood to enjoy a cute romantic comedy/fantasy rather than solve the world s problems The Family Man might be exactly what you re looking for.
