Easily comparable with the Lethal Weapon films, and probably even more over the top in some cases. Stallone and Kurt Russell play two rival cops who must work together when they are framed for the murder of a federal agent by a criminal mastermind out to take the two top cops off the streets. Stallone and Russell have great chemistry together, and are quite humorous throughout. One of the film's most memorable points of course was the typically riveting performance by Jack Palance, who has a very commanding screen presence and plays his part well. Overall, Tango and Cash is highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed Lethal Weapon or Die Hard, as it is filled with just as much action and some good, and at points cheesy comedy along the way.
