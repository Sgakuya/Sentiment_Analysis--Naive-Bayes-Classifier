Stories of obsession can make for riveting reading - especially when they are told by a gifted writer such as Barry Unsworth. In Losing Nelson, Unsworth describes a man, Charles Cleaseby, who idolizes British Naval hero Horation Nelson to the point where he spends his days re-enacting major and minor victories in Nelson's career. The story revolves around the protagonist's inability to make sense of a particular event in Nelson's life - an event which indicates that Nelson may not have been perfect. Unsworth does a masterful job in slowly bringing to light the evidence which challenges everything that Cleaseby has come to believe in, in the process creating a novel which is compelling both historically and pscyhologically. A very good book.
