my f250 is a 2000 model it has been a very good truck. We bought it to help build our house,you know, carrying material and tow a dump trailer. Speecking of the trailer before I knew what the trailer capasity was I pull five yards of graval for the driveway. I thought not to bad until I cleared the scales and found out the trailer was carrying ten thousand pounds (didn,t do that to many times). The point is it pulled the load not only pull but pulled it up the hills that are on the way to my house. The only problem I have had with the truck was, the crank shaft timing sensor when bad. My truck now has over 80,000 miles and I am still very glade I bought the truck.
