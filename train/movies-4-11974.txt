 Scary Movie 2 was much, much better than the first film. For one, it was just funnier. And secondly, the sex was toned down. If they use this film as the model and do not resort to their tactics in the first film, the Wayans Bros. will have a huge hit with Scary Movie 3 . I really thought that James Woods was hilarious in the beginning as the father in the spoof of the Exercist . My favorite character was Hanson the Caretaker ... Take My Strong Hand... LOL. This movie also makes fun of Poltegeist and The Haunting . It really is funny, and if you did not like the first one, don't let that keep you from seeing this one because it really is awesome.
