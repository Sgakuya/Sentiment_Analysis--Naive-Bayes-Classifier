You just simply can't compete w/ Mike Krzyzewski...This whole rating thing isn't about how he looks (although I don't see the deformity all you other fans see) not even about how many wins he has...He cares about his players and loves each and every one of them and would go out of his way to do anything for them! Did any of you Happen to watch the Duke/Wake game @ Cameron?...I have never seen such a desire to win in his eyes before. He's the type of coach that allows his players to have a good time and get the job done. That is what an AWESOME, HALL OF FAME, GREAT coach is ALL about, Beyond the Glory says it all!
