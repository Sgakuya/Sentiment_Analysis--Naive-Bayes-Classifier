I'm not here to assess Saudi mores and politics (I do not do politics on Rateitall). This is a forum for rating countries in terms of how good a travel destination it is. I did visit this country twice (Jeddah and Al Jubayil) while in the Navy in 1985. In both visits, there was an absolutely void of dining, entertainment, recreation, and culture. We just moseyed around the crowded, dirty streets, looking at bearded males moseying around the crowded, dirty streets. Neither us nor the bearded males had nothing to do. We found nothing to do other than buying some gold jewelry at a souk (market). Even though we were at sea for weeks, after a couple of hours, we went back to the ship just to get a meal. We did go to a compound owned by the U.S. Embassy. We enjoyed a couple of beers. But since that is technically U.S. territory, that does not count for Saudi Arabia where there is no beer to be found. Can't think of a worse travel destination (Maybe Hell, Pluto, or Mordor might be worse).
