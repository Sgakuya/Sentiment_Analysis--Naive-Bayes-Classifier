There is an obvious liberal slant to the books that Borders showcases at the main entrance as well as their 'so called best sellers list.' You have an abundance of 'Bush Bashing Books' but don't offer anything that is an alternative without an in-depth search. If you are lucky enough to find an alternative, it will be in limited quantities and hard to locate. I witnessed a Regional Team coaching the Store Manager of 'what and where books would be displayed' at a Sacramento area Borders. There was no mistaking that there was an 'agenda' that had been passed down from Corporate as to content, subject and location of 'their' prefered books. You had better believe that people notice your left wing slant, because many have mentioned it! Just supply books, and let the general public figure it out right or wrong!
