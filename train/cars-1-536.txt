I bought a brand new FXR in 1991 from an authorised UK Harley dealer. Basically it was a complete pile of rubbish. The worst bike I've ever had the misfortune to own in fact. After years of incurable oil leaks, rough running in cold weather, being difficult to start and self-destructing wheel bearings, the engine eventually fell to bits at about 45,000 miles. The right-hand main bearing came off the end of the crankshaft and wiped out the drive to the oil pump. The engine also needed new crankcases and a new camshaft during the re-build. This bike had the easiest life and best maintenance of any machine I'd ever owned too. Harley Davidson UK eventually stumped up 340.00 towards the repair bill - which wasn't any great help as the total bill came to over 2000.00! I kept the bike for over 12 years and can hardly believe I put up with it for that long - I suppose I got suckered into the Harley Owner / lifestyle type crap. The only consolation was that it was easy to sell the bike on for a relatively high price after all the engine work was finished. A beautiful Triumph Thunderbird now sits in the Harley's place in my garage.....
