From 1962 to 1966, in the relative context of different baseball eras, he was the most dominating pitcher ever. Interesting fact: Koufax was a Nuke LaRoosh type early in his career (i.e., poor command and control). Koufax, who was Jewish, was taught he finer points of command (e.g., take a little off the fastball to get it into the strike zone) from fellow Jewish player -- catcher Larry Sherry. Koufax sitting out Game 1 of the 1966 World Series because of Yom Kippur is well known. Don Drysdale pitched in his placed and got shelled by the Baltimore Orioles. After the game, manager Walter Alston quipped, "I wish Drysdale was Jewish too." I once came up with the first stanza of a great Country-Western song. It goes like this: "I haven't met any good Jewboys since Jesus But Sandy Koufax sure could pitch." One day I've got to finish the song.
