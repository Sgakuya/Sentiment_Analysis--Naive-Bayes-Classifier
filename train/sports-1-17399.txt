The 40W-Hiners are league's most overrated team and here's why: for the last 10 years, the 49ers have averaged 9-to-10 losing teams on their schedule every single year. The majority of their wins have come against losers with horrible defenses. Over the same 10 years (with the exception of the Super Bowl 'win' over the 21st-ranked defense of the Chargers), the San Francisco has struggled against teams with winning records and the stats of the players that you all kiss ass upon are all inflated because of the lack of quality opponents. That's why the Niners always get their asses kicked in the playoffs. Did you know that Steve Young's CAREER rating against teams with winning records is a lowly 62.6? Oh, and the vastly overrated Jeff Garcia's rating against winners is worse at 54.3 So, as you can see....there is so much MORE to the 49ers success than meets the eye.
