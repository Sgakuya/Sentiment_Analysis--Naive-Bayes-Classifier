I lived in Juneau briefly in jr. high. It was beautiful. Every morning before the we were allowed to walk to school (in the dark) we had to make sure the street had no bears on it. If I remember right, they had a bear watch on my street. Like a burgalar watch. Thunder Mountain is incredible! Beautiful waterfalls all over the mountain terrain and the wildlife was so pure. Mendenhall Glacier was a huge attraction as well. I love to go there and just sit on the outlook at watch the birds fly (saw an eagle or two there also). Gorgeous state, but the highway is very limited in Juneau. When I lived there, there was only 40 miles of road way so you were very limited to were you could go. Back then, drugs were a BIG problem too. That is one of the reasons that we moved.
