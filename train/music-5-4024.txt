SO far to me this is the Best Bruce Springsteen Album ever made! Wow did he make you feel all good inside when you listened to his album. I truly beleive that THE BOSS is a healer through his music and helps you lives the good days of your younger years and how to live the most of your days today. Although his voice is not great sounding like beuaitful tone or anything but his roughness of his voice is what makes him unique and what makes him stand out and man can he write music. I think one of the best songs he wrote ever was THE LIGHT OF DAY song that Joan Jett and The Blackhearts sang on the movie of the same name starring Michael J. Fox.
