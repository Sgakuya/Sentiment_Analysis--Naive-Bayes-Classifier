Some of the ratings are hilarious. What makes Boston is unique is how close they come to advancing to the World Series only to lose. Or, in other cases getting to the world Series and losing by one and two run margins. 1986 vs the NY Mets is an excellent example. Closer Calvin Schiraldi had a three run lead in the ninth with two out and couldn't close the door. Last season vs the Yankees in the AL Championship was almost as brutal. Aside from the close losses in postseason play, this is not a one or two star team as some seem to indicate. That's just being ridiculous to even make that claim. The Sox are a team that historically relies on their hitting and gets burned often with a weak bullpen and defense. For the 2004 season The Red Sox should remain competitive because they have maintained much of the players from the 2003 season. They did add Curt Schilling to the starting rotation as well as Foulke in the bullpen. However, they did not resign Todd Walker at second base and I'm really not sure why they did not. He had very good power for an infielder and played better defense in the postseason. On the flip side they kept Byong-Choke-Kim, who really sucks. UPDATE: By the way, who do these dumbass Yankees fans think they are? It's true that they're a stronger team than Boston. But not by much. Yankees fans are too intent on getting even with Sox fans and show their true colors by being idiots and voting with their heart instead of their mind just to bring the Yankees past the Red Sox in the ratings. And by the way, Martinez is a head-hunter but he did NOT shove Zimmer to the ground as an earlier post suggests. Had you watched the game you would have noticed he side-stepped out of the way. Most other athletes would have thrown a fist at Zimmer. Let's also not forget the cowardly acts of the Yankees, specifically that dickhead reliever named Nelson and Karim Garcia ganging up on one of the landscaping crew who was heckling the Yankees players
