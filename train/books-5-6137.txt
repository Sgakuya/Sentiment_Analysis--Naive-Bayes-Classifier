Completely funny. It's kinda sad that we find it amusing when people accidently kill themselves from doing stupid things, though. The Darwin Awards are awarded to people who have removed themselves from the gene pool in a unique and rather stupid way. It is amazing what some of these people did. What makes the book and the awards even more interesting is that the authors attempt to verify the nominees submitted to them. This cuts down on the urban myths that get embelleshed with repeated tellings. They are clear to point out weather the story is true and confirmed, and what has not yet been confirmed and the down right false. IJR says check it out.
