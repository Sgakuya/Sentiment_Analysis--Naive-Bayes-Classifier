Eh. Maybe more of a 2.5 rather than a 3. SYNOPSIS: After two years of mourning his wife's death, Deuce travels to Amsterdam to visit his old man-pimp, TJ. TJ is mistaken as a criminal, and Deuce has to figure out who the real killer is and exonerate his old friend. That's pretty much it. PROS: . . . well, it had its moments. It'll get a couple chuckles out of you. CONS: Not nearly as funny as the first one. Predictable. Deuce's clients weren't as funny; in the first movie, the girls were overly tall, overweight, had Tourette's Syndrome, etc. This movie had . . . a girl with a penis on the end of her nose? It seemed like it was trying a little too hard to be funny. But, then again, that's the point of the movie. OVERALL: Well, you know what you're getting into when you walk into the theater. If you don't like stupid humor, you probably wouldn't be interested in seeing the movie, anyway. I was hoping it'd be a little funnier, but oh well. VERDICT: Not really worth going out of your way to see. If it's on TV, it's like one of those movies that, you might catch a silly moment when flipping channels, but after the scene is done you'll probably lose interest and click over to the next channel.
