Among his athletic achievement, I admire the fact that he is working on an issue that is becoming more of a problem in this country, and that is the lack of fatherhood. Society, as a whole, is trying to diminish the significance of fathers in the lives of children, and many men are surcumbing to this horrible lie. I have supported and I will continue to support Jim Brown and his committment to this important issue. I me, how many sissies will we have to have in this country before people start to realize that fatherhood is every bit as important as motherhood. This achievement will be much greater than his accomplishments in football.
