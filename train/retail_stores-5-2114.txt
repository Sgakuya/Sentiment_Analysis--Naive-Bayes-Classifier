Boy, if some of you complainers would actually say this particular RadioShack in so and so town is bad that would be fine, but to say all RadioShacks are bad because of one bad experiance at a particular RadioShack is just plain ignorant. The RadioShack (in Northeastern Wisconsin) by me is just plain the best place to go. These people will bend over backwards for you, won't give you a sales pitch, suggest other locations to compare at, are VERY knowledgable, if they don't know somthing they will do everything in there power to find out for you, and NEVER try to upsale you. If you say I want this, they'll say,"Well what are you trying to do?" and if your over buying something they'll let you know "hey you don't need that, it's too much this product will do perfectly and save yourself 20 bucks." If you use one RadioShack to rate all the others, you definetly need to go back to science class in middle school to re-learn how to research things.
