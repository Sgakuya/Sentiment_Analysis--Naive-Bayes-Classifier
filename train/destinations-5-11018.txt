I have some amazing childhood memories from Worlds of Fun. At least once or twice a year while I was growing up my family would brave the crowds for a full day riding the Zambezi Zinger (which I think is no longer there), the Orient Express, the Zulu, and the other great rides. I used to think the lines were long, but since then I've been to a few other big amusement parks (like Cedar Point), and they make Worlds of Fun seem empty. It looks like they've added quite a few new rides (like the Mamba, a 205-foot tall steel roller coaster) since I was there last. I'm not a big fan of amusement parks any more (I still love the roller coasters but hate the crowds), so I doubt I'll ever make it back to Worlds of Fun, but as a kid it was one of my favorite places.
