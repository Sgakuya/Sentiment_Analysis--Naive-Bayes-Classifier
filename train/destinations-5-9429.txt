What St. Paul's is to London, St. Isaac's is to St. Petersburg: a grandiose neoclassical cathedral that took forty years to build. The Cathedral, designed by Auguste Montferrand and decorated by best sculptors and painters from all over Russia, is a monument to the Russian Empire, its people and the Monarchy. Accommodating 14,000 worshippers during a mass, this is one of the largest Cathedrals in Europe and one of the biggest Christian church buildings in the entire world. Its dome, covered with a layer of pure gold, is the third largest free standing dome in the world. The massive dome is visible from the Baltic Sea and the gulf near St. Petersburg. It is one of the prominent landmarks of the city and one of symbols of St. Petersburg. The Cathedral, constructed of polished marble and granite is a giant treasure-chest of decorative art and sculpture. St. Isaac's is 101.5 meters high (or as high as a 40 story modern highrise), 111 meters long and 98 meters wide. A circular observation platform is located underneath the dome on top of the Cathedral which offers breathtaking views of the city. St. Isaac's is a remarkable awe-inspiring structure that is quite unlike any other building in the world.
