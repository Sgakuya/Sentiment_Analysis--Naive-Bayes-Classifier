I would not insult horses by calling that baggage horse-faced. Not that looks should matter but that bag could so do with some major plastic surgery. She's got the money now so why wait? Not entirely sure it is female anyway. To amuse themselves this manly (and some say not too fond of washing) creature and P Charles go out to kill foxes, grouse and anything else that comes to hand. These low-lifes are living on the inherited wealth that their ancestors (Charles's mainly) took from the working people of Britain. Time those people were given the boot and given a course on how to be civilised. If they were at least civilised it might make their pompous lording it over us common mortals a little easier to bear but there they are, just a couple of barbarians so Charles can keep his pontificating mouth shut because he is a disgrace.
