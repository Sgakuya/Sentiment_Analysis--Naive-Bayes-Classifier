For the most part a pretty good movie. A teacher at a private boys school. Kevin Kline is good as the caring teacher. One of the boys he is trying to encourage has a strict dad and Klines character tries to get him to do his best.Unfortunatly the boy has his problems and disappoints the teacher.the teacher feels guilty because in his effort to encourage this one boy he lets down another. anyway it takes place in 1976 and then goes forward to the present to show these boys 25 years older and how they turned out. an almost 4 to me. not a bad movie. a bit boring in parts but well acted by Kline and the kid actors.
