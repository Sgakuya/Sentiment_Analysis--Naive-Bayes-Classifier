Currently, the Yankees are in first for the Eastern Div of the AL, 1 game ahead of Boston. They place 3rd in the entire AL, behind Anaheim and Minnesota. What you all were seeing in April with the Red Sox and the Yankees (with the yankees losing miserably) was that 1) Boston has a team chemistry, a team spirit that enables them to work as a unit rather than separate players. that gives them a distinct advantage over the yankees, because 2) the Yanks don't have that yet. they haven't had that chemistry, that sort of team unity since the late 90's-2000. So many players have come and gone, the only ones who are still around from the time period mentioned are posada, jeter and bernie. I think I'm starting to see it come together for them, and I think it is why they're doing better in the standings. Both teams are good- both have a multitude of excellent, talented players and good management (although I'd argue that Joe Torre is better) so it really all comes down to who wants it more: the team that hasn't tasted victory since 1918, or the one set on defending it's dynasty, it's legacy? My money is on the Yankees.
