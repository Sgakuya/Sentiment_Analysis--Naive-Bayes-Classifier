I was basically forced to upgrade from Windows 98 to Windows 2000 in order to install my new virus, etc. protection software, and I have to say I'm not impressed. Several of my favorite yet older programs (and I haven't tested nearly all of them) don't seem to work as intended (suggesting a lack of backwards compatibility), and my version didn't come with some of the extras (e.g. desktop themes) to which I've grown accustomed. The bottom-line is that while Windows 2000 may have some technical advantages that are better known to more advanced users, I can't see why this version is an improvement over its predecessors.
