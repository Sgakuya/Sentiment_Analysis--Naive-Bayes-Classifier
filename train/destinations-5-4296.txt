Los Angeles is Huge and Diverse,just like the State it's in...don't rely on people's Negative or Positive Comments as the overall outlook of the entire City or Metro area..Los Angeles has Good and Bad Areas,Safe and Dangerous Areas,Beautiful and Ugly Areas... I'm sure their are parts of L.A that you will enjoy to live in or visit,because L.A has a Great Variety of things to See and Do,in fact probably more than any other city in America... I just got back from a recent trip to Los Angeles,and I was there for a couple of weeks and I can honestly say that I had a Terrific Time...L.A is not one large hell-hole like what some people on here labeled it to be,and yes their are areas that are Runned Down and Unsafe to be in,but this type of area is found in every Major U.S City,and represents a very small part of The Greater L.A Area..Most areas I saw were Really Nice and Safe,and believe it or not,I didn't see any Gangsters or a Drive By(SHOCKED)LOL The Mountains and Beaches surrounding Los Angeles were Gorgeous..It's amazing that a city with alot of Negative Comments by others,was Very Beautiful in my eyes,but I guess it's because that's what I look for in a city..I don't go around looking for The Ghetto's or Gangsters :-) I Love L.A so much,that i'm planning to move there in a few months from now and i'm so excited to get to live in one of the Greatest Cities in America :-) To:(Samjung23) It seems you judge an Entire City from the people you encounter in Planes and in Airports..I suggest you try getting away from the Airport and try living in Los Angeles before you start calling it a cesspool...I'm not a tourist to Los Angeles..I've lived there before and plan in moving there again.... I'm not rich,their are parts of The L.A Area that is affordable and quite nice,and just because Los Angeles has low ratings on here,it doesn't mean it's a horrible city and I found that out on my own... Like i've said earlier...Los Angeles has Good and Bad Points,but it is far from being a cesspool...If Los Angeles was so horrible,then it's population and economy wouldn't be growing...L.A continues to attract immigrants from around the world and other people from around the country,and L.A is not even in the top 10 list of dangerous cities in America,so things are improving compared to it's past...The Entire Metro Area is going through a Revitalization Period... Los Angeles is not for everybody,but it is not a cesspool...If it was a cesspool,i wouldn't consider moving there.
