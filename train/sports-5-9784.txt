come on... whoever does not live in LA hates this team. Why? Because they have been to the Finals 4 of last 5 years. Come on people, Lakers have and always will be the greatest franchise in basketball. They are the Yankees of baseball. If you are a true basketball fan and not a banwagon jumper, you know that the Lakers as a team have always been contenders and they will continue to be a threat as long as Kobe is in LA. They will not win the championship for the next four years or so but they will always be in the playoffs. They are a team that's always had class and accomplised more than most teams ever will.
