no matter what allen iverson does he is always criticized. From the rap album to the hair n tattos, he can't seem to find a break in the nba. Commissioner Stern probably hates to see such a thug becoming a star in the nba. Sorry, he already is a star. No matter what anyone says about allen, the fact remains that he is one of the best players in the league. In the post Jordan era, the NBA is looking for someone who can carry the banner of great basketball far into the future. The heart, skill and likeability of Iverson make him a perfect candidate. But people are reluctant to give this honor to him. Sure Vince Carter can dunk better, Kobe Bryant can showboat more, but Allen Iverson, standing under 6 ft tall, has the heart. How many times have you seen Carter or Bryant do dashing to the rim, get mauled by a group of 7 ft tall, 300 lb monsters, make the layup and go to the line with a smile on their face??? Allen Iverson has the heart of a champion, and definitely is pound for pound the best player in the NBA
