Hey Wavebacker..do your homework!! Two final four appearances and with Kenyon a national title probability. Does Boeheim suck because it took almost 30 years? As for graduation rates, that is a bad rap. Don't believe that stuff. Seventh winningest coach (active) but he sucks? He has nothing to apologize for by the way. His kids play hard, they love him and he has not the greatest university to recruit to. How many players are in the NBA? And exactly what would they do with a degree? College is to get you ready for a career and a productive life. Kenyon didn't graduate, signed a 95 million dollar contract, and he needs a degree in elementary education? For what exactly? I am guessing you are a Kentucky fan. They seem to hate Bob the most. For what reason I don't know. Does Bob have issues? Yes, and so do you and so do I...
