OK, if you love special effects and aren't a stickler for plots that make sense, this movie might be worth your while. The effects were cool; however, in my humble opinion they weren't enough to save this movie. First off, to be an Academy-Award nominated actress, Elisabeth Shue can't act her way out of a paper bag. Her facial expressions and body language are believable, but it's the delivery of her lines that blows it...she sounds like she's reading straight from the script. OK, second complaint: way too much violence against animals. I know animal testing is a gruesome reality that we should all be aware of, but this movie really shoves it down your throat in a very disturbing way...basically, the scientists test the invisibility serum on animals (including primates) before testing on people. They turn about 8 primates to goo before they finally get it right, and we get to see not-very-pleasant pictures of gorillas with their intestines all hanging out...horrible. THEN, when Sebastian (Mr. Invisible Jerkface) loses his temper with the poor invisible doggie...I almost walked out of the theater. As for the plot, it was soooo weak, and the characters were annoying...they kept clocking the bad guy on the head, then walking away like they thought he was dead...NOT! Then they would act all surprised when he jumped out at them. And, does invisibility also give superhuman strength? The invisible guy picks up a guy who is like 100 pounds bigger than him and throws him across a hallway, smashing his head into a pipe with enough force to kill him. I know angry people can be strong, and invisibility would give you a definite advantage, but sheesh...he kicked everyone's ass without even having to try. The movie just turned into a gory bloodbath and didn't really explore the possibilities of being invisible. I must say, tho, that Kevin Bacon is a good actor because he can portray a real dirtbag just as well as he can portray a good guy.
