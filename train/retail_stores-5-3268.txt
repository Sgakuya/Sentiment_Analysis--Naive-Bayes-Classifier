Did you ever think how hard it is to work at blockbuster. I work there part time and its the most stressful job I have had dealing with customer service, just because you are sincere doesnt mean that everybody is. People will come up with every lie in the book to get out of paying 3 bucks for a late fee. Then they will drive away in their bmw. I ahve dealt with more ignorant people in the last 2 years than I have dealt with in my whole life. I have had movies thrown at me I have been sworn at and called names. Blockbuster employees are well trained, and if they charge you for something or call you when it snows deal with it, its just a movie and it is just 3 bucks. I'm sure the employees didn't ask to work during the snowstorm and I am sure they weren't eager to call you about your late movie. I do what corporate tells me because that is my job. And the customer is not always right. In the really world what makes more money is right. Because, trust me if I could I would take off everybodys late fees and give everyone free rentals. And if you don't like it, rent your videos somewhere else. Employees may get free rentals, but we still have to pay late fees like everyone else. Blockbuster, does have widescreen dvds, I don't know where you have been going but its not blockbuster. With a lot of titles widescreen is the only dvd for rent or it is a double sided disc with both formats. I personally prefer widescreen but you would be surpised how many people specifically request pan scan(fullscreen) and get angry if we don't have it, because they say that they hate the black lines.
