I'd be tempted to give Rene Russo 5 stars if it weren't for The Thomas Crown Affair. If you saw that movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. It was amazingly bad. The plot was OK, but the love scenes were overdone and goofy, Pierce Brosnan's character was overdone and goofy, Russo's character was overdone and goofy, and the fact that Russo was topless about half the time, while it sounds great, actually got to be a little ridiculous. Still I liked Russo a lot in Get Shorty (a great movie if you haven't seen it yet), and she was good in the Lethal Weapon movies and In the Line of Fire. Sure she's older than most female romantic leads, but so what? She still looks great. She's sexy, intelligent, and talented.
