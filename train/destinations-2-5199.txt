in my opinion, this is not the best state in the union. actually, i would have to say it would be among the worst i have visited, and i've visited about half of the states. california is viewed as the meeting place of the rich and famous. yes, that may be true, but i've been here twice and in my experience, the people are either rich or poor. i have yet to know someone inbetween. san francisco is ugly. that's just my opinion, but the hills are just way too much. accompanied by disgustingly odd tourists and homeless people on streets. laguna beach may be like the television show, for some people. i had a relative who just moved out, and she lived in a trailor. la - the side away from the stars - (but like most metropolitan cities) is very violent and crowded and dirty and crime ridden. i'm glad to have been raised in alaska, where huge houses aren't hard to find for l00,000. in cali, you probably could'nt get nearly anything for that. the beauty has been destroyed by pollution and materialistic people on the beaches. and i dislike their valley accents. alot of spoiled kids running around too. the clothes are also a size smaller because all californians are expected to be skinny tanned barbies. but ON THE PLUS SIDE - sausalito is abosoulutely breathtaking. and cali DOES have fun shopping. i guess it's more of a place to visit, rather than live and the climate is way too hot. this is just what i think.
