 Kitchen Confidential is a bizarre, often hilarious, and disturbing account of Anthony Bourdain's personal experiences as he worked his way up to the position of executive chef, and it provides a behind-the-scenes look at the restaurant business today. Prepare yourself. This book is not for the faint of heart. Bourdain seems to enjoy shocking the reader from beginning to end. You hear what really goes on in restaurant kitchens, and he spares nothing when he describes kitchen employees and their shenanigans. I liked the way Bourdain provided tips for getting the most out of restaurant meals. For example, he said to never eat out on Monday because it's merchandising night when the chef is trying to get rid of food left over from the weekend. I learned a lot from the chapter titled How to Cook Like the Pros, where Bourdain provides sensible tips for the home cook. I think this book has broad appeal, and I would highly recommend it to anyone considering a career in the restaurant industry.
