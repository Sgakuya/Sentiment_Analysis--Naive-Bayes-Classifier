Red Man Golden Blend tastes great when I'm drinking a can of Diet Decaffeinated Coke. It tastes great when I'm not drinking a can of Diet Decaffeinated Coke. I teach high school, and a lot of my kids know I chew. I can't think of anything more delicious than a wad of Golden Blend after a meal. I guess I'm stuck in the oral stage of psycho-social development and for me this chew is the best. I've tried others, such as Levi Garrett, Chattanooga Chew, Beechnut and Apple Jack. I always come back to the Red Man Golden Blend. My Grandpa chewed Beechnut for nigh on 80 years and, when I was 12 and 13, I used to hand him the spit jar from the back seat on our trips across the country. I came to associate the smell of his chewing tobacco with family warmth and good times. Red Man does have too many sticks and not enough broad leaves, and sometimes you get a pouch with "dead" leaves. However, all in all, it's a "bitchin'" chew.
