My buddy Nick has provided me with some insight on Chuck E. Cheese, and maskots in general. He's the friend that you see once a year at a graduation party, and when I see him I insist that he tell the story. He never will right away, but after a few beers and a whole lot of begging on my part, he'll eventually open up. Nick was the Chuck E. Cheese Mouse for 2 years. He hated it, and if you ask why he did it for 2 years all he can say is I don't know. I needed money. It was 100+ degrees in that uniform and he put up with Abuse. He will explain that there have actually been studies done that prove people treat mascots like there's really not a person inside. Subconciously we believe that a mascot is something subhuman; we wouldn't even treat an animal so poorly. Anyway one particular time some kid screamed at him for pizza, and he had just been yelled at by his boss for leaving the playroom, so he couldn't go get pizza. Nor was the Mouse allowed to speak, so all he could do was shrug his shoulders. The kid proceeded to kick Nick very hard in the shins and then once again, only harder and this time right in the nuts. Nick was in excruciating pain but the Mouse can't scream or take off his head. What he did - and I crack up every time I get this mental image - was drop to the floor and roll around like Curly from the Stooges, with his hands between his legs. If Nick's really in good storytelling form he'll drop to the ground and give us a visual. Anyway during this time the kid got his little buddies and poured pitchers of soda and various food all over the Mouse. Nick got up, ripped his Mouse head off, and screamed What the F is your problem you little sacks of S! That was Nick's last day.
