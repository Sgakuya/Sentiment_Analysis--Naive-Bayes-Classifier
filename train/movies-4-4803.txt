On its own, it's a good animated movie. When compared to the book it's based off, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, it pales a little though. (But then again, few movies can live up to the standards the book sets) I still have yet to understand why the Frisby family was changed to the "Brisby" family, unless the animators feared being sued by whoever it was who came up with the Frisbee. It's mostly a tale of survival - the survival of the rats and how they use their vast intelligence to save the Frisby family, who is stuck with the ill Timothy and bound to face certain death. Although suitable for kids, unless you have a problem with the word "damn," as other comments have stated, I would think that it would be better suited for an older audience - the themes and setting of the story can be quite dark, despite the fact that the characters are small, fuzzy animals.
