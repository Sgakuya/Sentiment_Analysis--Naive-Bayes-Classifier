During the week of Christmas, I had family coming from out of town and needed a larger car. I rented from Fox, and will never again. I received a confirming email that morning of my reservation. I got there and even with my printout and confirmation number, they could not locate the reservation, but in a stroke of genius, decided with my documentation, they could go ahead and give me a car for the quoted price. Next problem: I am a local resident, so I needed to show them a utility bill, which, surprisingly, I didn't keep in my back pocket. They gave some story that it prevents cars from going to Mexico. Whatever. Credit cards can confirm a current billing address, so they are trying to not have locals rent from them, possibly because they find it easier to fight overcharges. Two other local residents had made the trip down there to find that out (yes, it's printed on the reservation info, way at the end of the boilerplate language) and they stormed off. My father rented the car, being from out of state. The overnight rental was uneventful, but they have another hokey policy that you can't just return the car with a full tank, but you have to have a a full tank PLUS a receipt from a local gas station dated that day that is within 7 miles of the lot. So they want utility bills and gas receipts, what a pain. Before ever renting from this decrepit, dirty facility, make sure you ask if you'll need a note from your mother as well.
