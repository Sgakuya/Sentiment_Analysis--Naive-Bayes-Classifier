The Acura NSX remains at the top of its field. It is truly a masterpiece in both style and performance. The fact that its been around for 11 years since it was first introduced and remains largely unchanged says that Acura got it right that first time. Who needs the Corvette with the NSX still kicking butt? The technological wizardry of the NSX - namely its high revving DOHC VTEC engine and aluminum frame -is a testament of how advanced the NSX was when it first appeared on the scene in 1990 and still is today. The Corvette has yet to step into the 21st century with a proper DOHC engine, the last being the short lived ZR1 model discontinued in 1995. HA! Eat dirt Chevrolet!
