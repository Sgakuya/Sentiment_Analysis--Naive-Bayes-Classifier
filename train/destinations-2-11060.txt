Save your bucks, folks. This was such a disappointing amusement park. It was a mess from trying to get into the parking lot on. Parking is too much $, the signage is unclear, the bathrooms and food concessions are unclean and smelly, the games are an over-priced rip-off, many rides weren't working (many more than the entrance sign said), it was so dark at night, ride lines were way too long for the number of people in the park, AND they want $8 for Dippin Dots!!! The only reason it gets 2 stars is because when they are running, and when you actually get on one, the coasters are GREAT. Other than that, eat first, take a cab, and hold it till you leave.
