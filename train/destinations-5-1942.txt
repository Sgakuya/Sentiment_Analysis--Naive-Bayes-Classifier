It is hard to fully judge a country if you do not live there or have only visited for a short time. For those living in countries of government-controlled media it is even more difficult since they only tell you what they want you to believe. I ask you this; if America is not the great country, we Americans believe it to be then why is it the standard of measurement for so many worldwide? Why do so many around the world leave their own countries to come to live in America? Yes, we have our problems because we are a society of imperfect people, just like every other country in the world. After traveling to several other countries around the world though, I will gladly take our amount of good and live with our problems versus what other countries offer. Here the police do not patrol the streets with military assault rifles, although some of our gangs do. I can travel anywhere I want within my country with out being stopped to show my papers and reason for traveling. I can drink clean water anywhere I go. I have basic human rights that protect me from others and my own government. I have the freedom to elect my own government officials then tell them what I want them to do, although they do not always listen. No matter what my religion or beliefs are, I can participate in any form of worship I choose. Here extremist can be a fanatic without being shot and I have the freedom to ignore them. As for arrogance, I have found arrogant people in every country I have ever visited. Arrogance is a human personality trait not a nationality trait. Trust me America does not own the copyright or patent to that, it is dealt out in large doses worldwide.
