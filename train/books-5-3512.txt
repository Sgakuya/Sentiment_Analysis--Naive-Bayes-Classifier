In a Sunburned Country is hilarious as well as informative. I had just read I'm a Stranger Here Myself and expected to enjoy more of Bryson's humor, but it was a surprise to find that I could also learn a great deal about Australia and its history. He must do tremendous research. One of the things that struck me the most was that in almost any situation he can find something interesting (and funny). As he described the heat of the outback, and the hours of driving, I could imagine myself in the same situation and I probably wouldn't have thought it was so amusing. His descriptions of people and places are so detailed that they practically jump off the page. While reading the chapter about the hot and humid northeast, I had to turn up the air conditioner! Don't miss this book. You'll laugh, and you'll learn too.
