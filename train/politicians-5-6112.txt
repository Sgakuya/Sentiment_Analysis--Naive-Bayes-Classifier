I didn't want to see Ashcroft as President (he was briefly a candidate), but I expect he will be an outstanding attorney general, where fairness and incorruptibility are the essential qualities. Seeing Ted Kennedy and the Left's more rabid interest groups paint Ashcroft as a wacko is truly shameful, and a big insult to the judgment of the very moderate state of Missouri where he was attorney general, governor and senator. Scary that to avoid the tag of racist these days, you can't be critical of any individuals of certain races. After all, Ashcroft voted to confirm 28 of 30 black judicial appointees, but his rejection of one is used as evidence of his so-called intolerance. More evidence that the Left is morally bankrupt...
