I visited Jasper back in college when two friends and I drove across country, up to Alaska and then back down through Canada. It was a great trip and Jasper was a great stop, beautiful area with tons of stuff to do. Of course when I was there I was just turning 19 and therefore legal to drink in Canada so we went out and bought a case of beer for the three of us and got sloshed at our campsite. I don't think we made a very good American impression that night. First off we couldn't even get our camp fire started and a little boy of about 5 had to come over from the next campsite over with a flaming log to help us out. We proceeded to repay his kindness by staying up until about 3 in the morning guzzling beer, being loud, vomitting (me, on one of my buddys pillow), and then stacking all the beer cans into a pyramid on our picnic table for his family to witness the next morning when they woke up to enjoy the crisp, clean outdoors. What can I say we were 19.
