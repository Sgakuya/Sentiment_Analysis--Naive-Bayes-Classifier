Carroll's done a great job with USC, no doubt. I'm an Oklahoma fan, so you can imagine how hard it is for me to say that. However, I'm also from Boston, so I know a little about Carroll's coaching ability. He did a poor job with the Patriots. It's just that simple. He'll never go pro again. He cares more about being well-liked than he does about coaching a good game, which is a huge liability in the pros but a huge asset in college (it helps recruiting). He'd be a moron to go back to the pros. You don't have to be an asshole (Bill Parcells) to be a good pro coach, but you do have to want to win more than anything else (Bill Belicheck).
