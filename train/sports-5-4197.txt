Anyone who is a true college basketball fan must admit that Coach Majerus is in the top 5 of current college coaches. He has been a revelation to to the Utah Program and to the Ball State program before that. The guy is an absolute genious. Granted, he has his moments, he has been known to be hard and sometimes too hard on his players, but the bottom line is, he teaches his players the skills they need to be successful both on and off the court. He produces NBA players. Look at Andre Miller, are you telling me Andre would have made it to the NBA if it weren't for Majerus? He wins! He has amazing game plans and can get a team to maximize its potential. I have never seen anyone quite like him.
