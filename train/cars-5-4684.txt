Bought my '96 Tacoma 4x4, shortbed, 4-cyl, 5-spd new. Has 214,000+ trouble free miles. Have yet to replace starter, alternator, fuel pump, exhaust system, rear brake shoes, no valve adjustments, no fuel injector replacements, or even the clutch. Has tackled Elephant Hill in canyonlands of Utah more than once uneventful (rated 3.5). Totally stock. No leaks on any gasket anywhere on the truck. Can't say the same for any domestic vehicle ever owned. 10.8 min ground clearance with stock suspension. Shooting for another 214,000 and expect to get it. I do maintain it well; use Marvel Oil in both oil changes, and each time I fill tank, Valvoline MaxLife 5W30 all year for seal conditioner value, and limit rpm to max of 3,000. No need to turn it higher.Anyone wanting to go faster than a crawl over rock trails is just wanting to waste money on repairs. Otherwise - just point it in the direction you want to go, and enjoy the ride. Best vehicle I've ever owned. At 55 yrs of age - I've owned plenty.
