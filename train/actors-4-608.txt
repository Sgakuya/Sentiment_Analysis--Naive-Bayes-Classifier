It's hard to tell about this guy because he was in so few films. There's really no way to gauge his depth and versitility as an actor because you only get to see him a few times. And it's impossible to tell how far his drive and talent would have taken him. Perhaps Hollywood's greatest What if personality. Very sensitive portrayal of Cal Trask in East of Eden, perhaps his greatest role. Fine job as Jett Rink in Giant and pretty good in Rebel, even though that's perhaps his most famous role. He had some very noteworthy performances on television before he made it to feature films. I always thought he was a little too heavy on the Method side, and as a result, the relentless effort to seem natural resulted in overdoing it to the point of being stilted. But he was so young...
