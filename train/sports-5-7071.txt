I admit, I did not like him when he was a player. But to deny Michael Jordan his rightful place in basketball history as the greatest player who ever lived would be a travesty. MJ was a fundamentally sound player who excelled at the most opportune moments. He was also a hard worker, demanding perfection from his teammates. A gifted leader on the hardwood, Jordan had a knack for making his teammates better than they actually were. But he was the main reason why the 1990s Chicago Bulls were a dynasty. He demanded nothing but the best in himself and others, thereby vaulting the once hapless Bulls to glory. Yes, there were other great players of eras prior to the Bulls dynasty. But when fans of the game define greatness in a single player, Michael Jordan is likely to be their choice. He was the undoubtedly the greatest professional basketball player ever. Period.
