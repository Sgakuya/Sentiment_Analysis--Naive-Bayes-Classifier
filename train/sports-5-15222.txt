ladainian tomlinson is a fantasy football players dream. for the moderator who seems to be throwing irrelevant stats into the mix to justify his moronic response; i say this. put priest holmes, clinton portis, ahman don't fumble it Green into the san diego offensive line.... and guess what would happen. priest holmes would probably get injured and not score half as many touchdowns as he usually does. clinton portis will relaize that he needs a broncos o-line to make him at least a 1500 yard rusher.... o thats right.... how did he do on the redskins this year... 5 touchdowns,LMAO LOL!!! ahman would fumble it more than he has with green bay. The only guy who can handle the sophmoric o-line LT has is Ricky Williams, and unfortunately, he's out smoking a tree and growing a beard somewhere in austrailia. To say that tomlinson can blow out a knee and fall from production is also a weak argument. are you stupid??? that case can be made for anyone, and if i had to pick one player who can avoid injury the best, it should be no surprise that i take this guy.... His three step acceleration is unrivalled. his quick cuts when givin enough room can break your f'n anckles off. his surprising strength is unbelievable. his vision and ability to avoid direct hits only reminds me of barry and emmitt. when you look at Ladainian's already impressive stats, add 500 yards and 20 more receptions to every category. because that is what he is capable of accomplishing in Baltimore, Kansas City, New England, Indianapolis, green bay, tampa bay, ny jets, etc etc). money talks. this guy has not signed the richest contract by any runningback in nfl history for nothing. expect to see him shatter every record possible by a runningbasck in nfl history. HE IS SICK! dumbass
