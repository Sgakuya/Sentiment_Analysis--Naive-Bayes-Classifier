I have somehow gone through two of the Gevalia CM500 coffee pots in the last 6 months! If the rating could go any lower than one star, that's what it would be for me. The coffee pot looks great! That's where the "good" ends. To get water in the thing you have to use a funnel or have a darn steady hand to hit the little hole provided to pour water into. My second unit died this morning and now I'm going out and buy me another Mr. Coffee; they're quite cheap, they work and when they break you don't feel like you're tossing out a fancy looking coffee maker that don't work anymore. I read the comment by moranj whose CM500 caught on fire and now, I can't get this thing out of the house and into the trash with the cord cut as close to the unit as possible to hopefully prevent someone from picking it up and burning their house down!
