I give this review as a former 6 year resident. The pros of the city are actually many: though it is over 100 years old, it looks really new, it is reasonably priced, has a warm climate, has as much to do as most other big cities, and the people generally have a good attitude. The tourist attractions I would say are the Aquarium, the Johnson Space Center, the Museum district, the downtown arts district, Memorial Park,the Water Wall at the Williams Tower, the Montrose district, Galveston Bay/Clear Lake recreational area, and the Reliant Stadium/Astrodome/ Six Flags complex. Plus probably the widest variety of restaurants of any city anywhere. Now for the cons: traffic is pretty bad, at most times of day or night, weekdays or weekends. There is always construction. Public transportation doesnt work in a city this large (nearly 600 sq miles) , so everybody drives. They have built a light rail, but it only works downtown. It is polluted, and the SE side smells like sulphur. Also, the city is probably the most haphazard large city in the nation. There are skyscrapers everywhere, businesses mixed in with neighborhoods, illogical street names and directions, bad neighborhoods mixed in with good ones. There is actually one street , T.C. Jester, that starts and stops in 4 different places in the city. Also,some will find the humid weather uncomfortable. It is only really bad from mid-May thru mid -Sept. The rest of the year is really nice climate wise. So, as many people discovered during the Super Bowl visit last year, Houston is an ok place to visit. Just dont commit any felonies during your visit. More people go to death row from Harris County than any other county in America.
