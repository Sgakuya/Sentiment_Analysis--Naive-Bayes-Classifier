great action sequences. i am of the halle berry is hot school of thought, and i was well satisfied with her exposure in this film. the plot is a little goofy, though, while it's complex enough in its developments and the style in which it's told to be interesting, and hugh jackman was very good, but who's going to believe in the type of organization travolta claims to be a part of, when his identity's revealed, besides some kind of x-files nuts? this movie caters a lot to the materialistic element in society, boasting wealth, sexual excess, cool cars, etc. i wanted to slap travolta around at points while i was watching it, to get him to confess how he gave some of his lines with a straight face. worth renting, but it's ultimately candy.
