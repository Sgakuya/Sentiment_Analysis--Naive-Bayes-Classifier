From what I've seen, Chavez seems to be a pretty positive influence on Venezuela. He's made sure more of the countries' substantial oil revenue has gone to social programs, often to the chagrin of the wealthy elites. He's initiated a free healthcare program and a massive literacy program for Venezuela's poor. He has ended all racial discrimination in Venezuelan schools. Furthermore, Chavez has finally begun to end the absurdly skewed distribution of land in Venezuala (whereby 5% of people own 85% of the land) with the Ley de Tierras reform package which grants unused or disused private lands to poorer small farmers (with compensation), giving them a fair chance to work themselves out of poverty. To aid this efficient re-organization of Venezuala's agriculture, the Chavez administration has set up state-run food stores to buy food from smaller farmers and sell them at discounts to poorer urbanites. Although he has some autocratic tendencies, he can't really be accused of being undemocratic. He's won his presidential elections by a bigger margin than most democratic leaders in the world, and won the recall referendum on his Presidency fairly. He has a resounding mandate from the people, which is even more impressive given he was a third party candidate when first elected and given the fact that he's openly opposed by all five of the countries' mainstream TV networks. Any seemingly autocratic measure on the part of Chavez seems pretty mild considering the wealthy elites tried to oust him from power in a coup attempt in 2002 (this resulted in his arrest, but he was restored to power after a single day). Ultimately, in the process of trying to help his countries' poor, Chavez has taken on some powerful vested interests, and won. Chavez has recently avowed Democratic Socialism and, unlike many politicians who would make similar claims, that is a mantle he has earned.
