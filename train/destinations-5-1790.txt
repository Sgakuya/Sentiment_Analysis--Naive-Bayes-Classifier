The greatest and the most misunderstood country in the world maybe even in history. When there is a crisis any where on the planet the first thing the people say is where are the Americans. Why because we are always there to bale people out of a bad situation. The USA has enough space and technology to feed a good chunk of the planet. The USA develops medicines and treatments for all sorts of ailments. The USA gives it people freedoms that most of the rest of the world can only dream about. For all the USA does for an provides to the rest of the world, what does it get in return? Scorn and ridicule, the worst terrorist attack of all time and hate from all over the world.
