I love this vehicle. I do agree you either love the look or hate it. It is such a practial vehicle. This is perfect for Moms, because it is easy in and out to the car seats with the trip door designs. It's not to big but big enough that you feel safe. It is avalible in 4wheel drive. It has great floors for easy clean up and you can add the carpets if you like. It has such a great view out the windows. Pefect for short drivers because the dash is flat no hump, and the seat raises. I am 4'11 and It fits me perfect and my husband is 6'3 and he has plenty of head room. Not a power house, but I dont need to go 100. The sunroof is really neat, it's huge and should be entertaining to the kids. Gas milage isn't to bad 21-24. The only thing I would probably change is make a third set in the back center in stead of the cup holders. I like to put the carseat in the center and extra passenger room would be a plus. This is the perfect vehicle for people who dare to be a little different. I love it and plan to buy one soon. Just wish they would add some rebates!
