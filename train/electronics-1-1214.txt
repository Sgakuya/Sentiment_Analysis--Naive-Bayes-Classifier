IPOD = In Put Only Device. I was truly happy when I first got my IPOD .It is beautifully designed . I cant think of another player that fits in the pocket as nice .It has no protruding buttons or levers to break off or snag on to things.The display is nice , easy to read ,the scroll wheel /click wheel works very nicely. The hold button on the top is easy to access and in the right spot. The sound quality is not bad at all (but the equalizer is very limited).The storage space (20 gb )is more than enough for me. The games are okay to pass the time.The aftermarket stuff is plentiful and useful too. So it all sounds great untill. One day you need to get your music off the IPOD and you can not!!!One day your computer crashes , a virus perhaps , maybe your hard drive dies or maybe a power surge just junks your computer entirely. It can and does happen you know.So you get a new hd or a new computer and you just drag n drop your tunes off the IPOD onto your new machine...WRONG!!!!FORGET IT!!!!IT AINT HAPPENING. IPOD will not let that happen. ITUNES wont let that happen .Anopod ,ephpod,and all the other aftermarket IPOD progs cant get your music off the ipod and on to your new computer. Dont believe me? IPOD = In Put Only Device..you will see.
