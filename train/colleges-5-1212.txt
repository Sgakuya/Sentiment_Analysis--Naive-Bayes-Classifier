I love Penn...and I'm a proud a$$ alum of the Annenberg School for Communication. I actually didn't get accepted to Penn when I initially applied to college. So...I attended another 4-year institute on the west coast...when I realized how I didn't blend in. That's when I transferred to other colleges....and decided to choose Penn. When I first came to this campus...I immediately fell in love with the architect, the students...faculties...the *gasp*...neighborhood. Despite Penn being located in ghetto west Philly....I found this ghettoness waaaayy better than the ghettoness of the college I've attended during my freshmen year. The food...wasn't that great....but I had a great time socializing and networking with a carload of students! Talk about sports! Penn doesn't have those typical "sissy" kind of sports team like Harvard and Princeton does. Penn's basketball team kicks a$$..and in fact went to NCAA championship rounds. Our rival ...that Ivy school in New Jersey...also has a reputable basketball team...and we love to compete with them!! Penn's athletics CAN compete with Div IA teams....well...not on every sports....but most sports. I'd wish UPenn could be called Ben Franklin University...or something else. I hate it when my friends back home think I attend Penn State...and get jealous over the football team making it to the Orange Bowl!! I'm quite disgusted with that matthewBUTTman below had to say in his discriminatory statement criticizing the Asian student body at Penn...since I'm Korean-American. Students like him (if he really is one) spoil the reputation for UPenn and should be tied, gagged and sent down the Delaware River. Penn also has a lot of organizations various students could join...whether it's a hiking club....chess club....your ordinary frats/soririties...or accounting association! Lastly, Penn also has a lot of Natl Merit Scholars....prob. second or third to Harvard & Yale in the Ivy League!
