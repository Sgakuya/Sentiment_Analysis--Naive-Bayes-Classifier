The eastern shore and the D.C. suburbs absolutely stink. Nasty humid weather, rude people, ugly landscape and bad drivers. Really bad drivers, will not only not yield, they'll speed up to keep you out of the lane if you could have made it. There's city driving and then there's spitefully stupid. Just try a trick like that in Chicago, New York, or L.A. why don't you? Haven't seen Baltimore yet, but I kind of doubt it'd change my mind too much. Did like Homicide a lot, but it might say something about your city when they set a show all about murder there. Also, have you seen the Terps mascot? A steroid freak turtle, almost as ridiculous as a Cardinal with teeth.
