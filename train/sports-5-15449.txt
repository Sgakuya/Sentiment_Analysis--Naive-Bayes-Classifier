Randy Moss has enormous talent. No one can dispute that. Also, that Moss is lacking in charator and heart is indisputable. However, to jump on Moss about his mime mooning and leaving the field early against the Redskins, is like making fun of Bush's funny faces. Moss is what he is. Joe Buck must be a sheltered puritanic saint to say that Moss's antics were disgusting. Joe Buck thinks that Terrell Owens antics are funny. It was a pretend act,not the real thing. Maybe America needs to have an athlete wave his dingus to the crowd to realize how petty Moss's actions were. I don't even like the Vikings, but I have to defend Moss on this huge over reaction.
