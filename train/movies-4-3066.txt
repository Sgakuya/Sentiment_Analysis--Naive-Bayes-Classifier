I was forced, by gunpoint and three roles of duct tape, to watch this film with my wife. There was no way I wanted to spend two hours of my life staring at some drunkard Irish bloke crying in a phonebooth. Then...something miraculous happened. The opening credits shot at me with today's digital filming technology capabilities. What a ride! On top of that, On top of that, I was drwan to the comic-book-like cinematography like the greasy, quite kid in middle school,reading his first issue of X-Men. The story, believe it or not, was quite compelling (although the endeing became quite predicatable after about a third of the movie).
