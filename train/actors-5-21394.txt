I was lucky enough to meet Fran last year in Chicago during her book signing tour. (For those who don't know she recently wrote 'Cancer Schmancer' which candidly details her experience and recovery from uterine cancer.) Border's bookstore was PACKED (estimates range from 200 to over 400 people). It was 7 p.m. and we were told Ms. Drescher had a long day travelling, making public appearences etc and she's exhausted therefore due to volume of people there would be no time to take pictures or converse with her. So to get her out before the store closes all she would do was just sign your book and you would move along like cattle. Well when Fran arrived she lit up the room. She may have been exhausted but she did not outwardly show it. And when one 'enterprising' young fan shouted out Fran can we take pictures with you? without a moment of hesitation Fran replied cheerfully Absolutely! We all got the time to take a picture with her. She was extremely patient with all her fans. I heard one incident where a fan was going thru a similar experience with cancer and Fran took extra time to give her encouragement during and AFTER the show. Since the majority of people in line were woman I highly doubt this was an isolated incident. Fran is truly a woman with a heart. She may be a 'star' but she acts like the 'common people' To say, as one reviewer did, that she is egotistical obviously comes from ignorance. As for her acting ability, well many people seem to believe that in 'real' life she acts just like her character on 'The Nanny.' I must laugh for this alone speaks volumes for her acting ability. As for her voice, as if that matters in anything.... well to look like she does and talk like she does makes her one of a kind. She is unique in a world of copycats and wannebees.
