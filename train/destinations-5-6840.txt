North Dakota, I live here, its nice, as for the weather like every North Dakotan says, you get used to it, we get cold, hey Florida can get 30 degrees too, everywhere gets cold, we get hot too our record high is 121, what is Florida like 100. So we can get warmer than Florida. As for the land we are on the bottom of a prehistoric lake so it will be flat, but ND has advantages.. NO earthquakes, NO hurricanes, less crime better schools a kick butt hockey team (UND Fighting Sioux), and better people than the rest of the 49 states. So come to our state if you want too, but for people complaining about it, did someone force you up here, than stay the hell out!
