Good movie. Cuba Gooding Jr. wants to be a master diver in the services. This was set in the 1960s so he was up against a lot of prejudice, and had to fight hard for his goal to become a master diver. Robert DeNiro is the trainer for the divers. and at first gives Carl a hard time.Carl ends up being a master diver only to suffer a horrible accident. his leg is severed and he must learn to walk again and prove he is capable to be a master diver again. Robert DeNiros character comes back and helps Carl this time to get back in as a master diver. I liked the fact that this is a true story about a man who worked hard against all odds and won.!Hurrah for Carl Cuba Gooding Jr. was great as Carl. and so was Robert DeNiro.
