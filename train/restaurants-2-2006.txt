Burger King has better hamburgers than McDonalds, and that's it. The hamburgers taste like hamburgers here, but overall the food isn't as good as McDonalds. First, the chicken itself is better than McDonalds chicken, but the problem is they put on some really STRANGE coating that is disguesting. I hate the coating they put on the chicken, which is so bad, McDonalds chicken is better! The fries... bah! I wouldn't eat these fries unless someone paid me. They're gross and soggy. Unlike McDonalds, Burger King's breakfast doesn't help its score. It's dry mini-cinnamon rolls aren't near as good as McDonalds cinnamon rolls. It's croissants aren't as good as McDonalds McMuffins, it's French Toast sticks are just OK, but far inferior to McDonalds hotcakes, and the round potato things they offer as opposed to hashbrown is a joke! It's about the same price-wise as Burger King, but I'd highly reccomend McDonalds instead.
