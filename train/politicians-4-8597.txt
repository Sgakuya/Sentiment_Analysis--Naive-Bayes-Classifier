I have to say I have more hope for America after seeing so many others with a vision of our country like that of Reagan. But as for those few dissenters, it's important to correct their inaccuracies. GWB@7120M seems to think Reagan spent us into bancrupcy. For someone who can't even spell the word, let me give you 2 in response: Cold War. I'm sorry if you had to walk around in the 80s with a slightly thinner wallet, but the waves of millions slaughtered by the soviets-read Solzhenitzen-would disagree with you on this matter. And they weren't idealogical morans. You should rewrite the dictionary when you get through with history. As for kelo5466et and his/her claim that Reagan wasn't functioning as President because he fell asleep in Cabinet meetings; falling asleep is down time as much as stalling airline traffic for haircuts, having sex with interns, and shutting down the government until polls tell you to pass the next budget. But I do seem to remember Reagan doing a few things right during his terms. Massive tax cuts that swept the country out of spiraling Carter economy that indeed DID trickle down to benefit all of us-note increased investment capital that was available to fund the technology revolution. I realize that will come as a shock to beth5325du and recl5432et who must think Clinton/Gore masterminded the stock market boom by passing the largest tax increase on the middle class ever! As much as I would commend him on his administration, I admire Reagan for the character and decency that has lost its place in our culture and public life.
