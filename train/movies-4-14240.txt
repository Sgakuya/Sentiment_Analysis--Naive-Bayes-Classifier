Ron Howard tells a story the way he wants you to see it. He delves into the amazingly complex mind of a schizophrenic genius, and takes directorial license to make it more of a love story than ever existed for the psychologically frail Mr. Nash. From a director's standpoint, the biggest flaw of the movie is that we are let into Nash's generally miserable treatment of women, but then see that plot line dropped from the rest of the movie entirely, until we see a moving speech at the Nobel ceremony. But, what of Nash's fathering of several children out of wedlock, and his total disregard for the female of the species. The acting is first-rate. Russell Crowe shows that he can portray even the most difficult characters and Jennifer Connelly is wonderful as his wife. To me, the most incredible part of the movie, however, is the attempt to get inside of a brain that works so differently from yours or mine. To see connections in seemingly unrelated data is a rare gift indeed, or after seeing the movie, perhaps, a rare curse, indeed ...
