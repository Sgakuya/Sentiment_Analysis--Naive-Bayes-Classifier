The truck is A-OK. I really had only (1) problem since '98. The dashboard engine temp. gage started indicating the engine wasn't warming up. I took it to Concours Motors Inc. of Milwaukee, WI, (PLEASE REMEMBER THE NAME CONCOURS MOTORS OF MILWAUKEE) and really was taken for a ride. After (4) visits and $140 (for a temp. sending unit), I was told everything was A-OK. But the temp. gage still didn't work. The thermostat was replaced by other than Concours for $10 (and that included the thermostat), and the temp. gage now works fine. Complaint filed w/Better Business Bureau, but Concours insists their work was top notch. STAY AWAY FROM CONCOURS UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO BURN.
