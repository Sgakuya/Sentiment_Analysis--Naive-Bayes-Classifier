I have to disagree with BugahaNE. The city of Omaha is a great place to live and work. I also believe it to be a great place to visit. We have the number one zoo in America (according to Reader's Digest May addition), we have more golf courses per capita then any other city in the United States with a population over 100,000. We have over 900 eating establishments, and many cultural venues. Yes, we do not have an amusement park, but one is in the works! This city is growing and as it grows more and more attractions move to the area. We even have shopping that only the biggest city's in the country have and some of that can be found at One Pacific Place and the new Villiage Point shopping center. We do not have any major sports clubs here aside from the Omaha Royals, but who knows, as we grow, that may change as well. We already have the College World Series! I would say that Omaha is a great place to visit, especially for those who live in the rural communities around us. Omaha offers them a glimpse of big city life, with a small town charm.
