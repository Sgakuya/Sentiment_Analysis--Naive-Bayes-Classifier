Powers is the most popular Irish whiskey in Ireland and there's a reason. It's the most distinctively Irish of the mainstream Irish whiskeys because of the high percentage in the blend of traditional Irish pot-still whiskey - made in a pot still from a mixture of malted and unmalted Barley. It's quite an assertive whiskey, and very different from most Scotches or Bourbons. It's light, it doesn't have a long finish and it is distinctly sweet on the palate. Please note that the quality does vary from bottle to bottle; some are like nectar whilst others are more fiery. Powers is a much finer drink than the better known Jameson/Old Bushmills/Tullamore Dew brands of Irish Whiskey. It compares very favorably with the rare pure potstilled Irish whiskies Redbreast and Green Spot. Indeed it closely resembles Green Spot but it's sweeter, doesn't cost $50 a bottle and you can buy it in the local liquor store. It's my favorite drinking whiskey and probably the best bargain in your local liquor mart. For the record I love Black Bush too, but it is different, NOT better, and it costs 60% more per bottle. Try some Powers. Then tell your friends. We'll convert the world.
