Food Lions are everywhere here. The have driven an Acme Mkt out of business by unethical means, then bought the newly renovated building and offer it for lease to any business EXCEPT a super market. Even their advertised specials are priced above other brand stores regular prices. The organization of goods and the shelf labeling truly suck. They are notorious for putting the sale signs behind non-sale meat department items and not even having the sale items in the meats case. I shop only for myself and have low income so to drive another 20 or 30 miles to the other choices may not improve my bottom line. I long for the day that another brand of grocery store opens nearby, their biggest draw will be the hordes escaping the clutches of FL.
