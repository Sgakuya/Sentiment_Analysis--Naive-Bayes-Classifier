Alright, I'm convinced the people who rated this album so poorly have actually never listened to it, or they just have horrible taste in music. Tom Waits has been around for thirty years now and has produced dozens of wonderful albums. Mule Variations is no exception. He has grown and matured as an artist and this album reflects that. Each song tells an interesting story with insightful lyrics. His musicianship is masterful, the variety of instruments great. His voice is one that may not appeal to all, gravelly, sort of like Bob Dylan's, but despite the hoarse sound the man can still sing. I'd recommend everyone give this album a chance, you will not be dissapointed. By the way, he won a 2000 Grammy(best contemporary folk album) for this album.
