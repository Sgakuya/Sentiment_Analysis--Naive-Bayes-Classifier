Hello all, I have bisiness account with Wachovia Bank for a long time Also the first $100.00 of your deposit is not posted the same day as Wachovia Bank claims. Be aware of $25.00 service charge if you use your debit card and go over the limit just for $1.00 Does not matter if you get ACH deposit next day for $10000.00 Advice do not use your debit card if you are close to $0.00 on your bank account. Some banks are m Making huge profit on debit card fees. This has be address by US Congress banking law regulator. Because this effects mostly poor and middle income people. Wachovia Bank post some debit transactions by the end of the day So you may think you have still positive balance at 5:00 PM and then 2 small debits come for like $10.38 and $3.00 and you will end up being charge 2 times $35.00 = $70.00 total for 2 small transactions. No matter if you deposit money the same day to Wachovia Bank ATM or you get ACH cash deposit next morning. This has be address by US Congress banking law regulator. So you do not need to have NSF checks to get this huge fees. Sometimes for small business can happens to slide for -$100.00 on the account because the debit charges like pree authorizations from restaurants or so. So be wise and do not let them to have the hoe run. Contact you local Congress person and US Senator to change the law to stop those fees for debit cards transaction. Sorry for some grammar mistakes English is my second language.
