France is a fine European country to visit. You will love the history, including Note Dame, Chartes Cathedral, the prehistoric painted caves of Lascaux, the Eiffel Tower, and the Palace of Versailles. Many Americans hate France mostly because of that country opposing the war against Iraq but i have opposed the war against Iraq myself so I have agreed with France. The only gripe is that France is a little too soft on prostitution and drugs but at least, the crime rate is lower there then in America. I also like France because of their ban on religious symbols in their public schools which we don't have for our public schools and they do a better job of honoring the separation of church and state than we do.
