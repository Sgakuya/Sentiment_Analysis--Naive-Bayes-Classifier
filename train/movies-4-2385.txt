I would give this an almost four. A mother and daughter have just moved in this huge brownstone home in New york. The nice feature of this home is a Panic Room that the tenants can go in to be safe from intruders. No one can get in this room. Of course the first night they move in some intruders do come in and the room they need to get into is the Panic Room. It turns out the man who designed it knows of Millions of dollars that are hidden in the Panic Room. I guess no one was supposed to be living there and so the intruders were surprised to have tenants there.Jodie Foster and her daughter lock themselves in the room. and the rest of the movie is between them and the bad guys trying to get at them and the room. THis is pretty well done movie.
