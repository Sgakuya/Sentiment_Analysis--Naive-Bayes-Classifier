A strong academic program (the business, communication, and law schools are consistently ranked with the best in the nation) is complemented by a an excellent quality of student life. The campus is one of the most beautiful I've seen...beautiful, historic buildings with a large shaded quadrangle at the campus core. The current administration is succeeding in attracting talented faculty members. In the fall of 2005, all freshman (with some exceptions) will be required to live on campus, strengthening an already strong campus community. Six new living/learning centers (or dorms) are being built to accommodate not only the increase in freshman living on campus, but the increase in student enrollment overall. And of course, if you're a football fan it would be hard to find a school with more team spirit than the home of the Crimson Tide. The University of Alabama is in the top tier of public colleges in America, and should easily rank within the top ten schools in the Southeast (public or private).
