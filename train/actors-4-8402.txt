I grew up idolising the woman. She was supremely beautiful - almost no-one took a better photo than her. It's just a pity that that beautiful package caused so many people to overlook, or exploit the talent and sensativity underneath. Sometimes wish for her sake she had been born in another era where she could have been recognised for all her talents. However, a product of the times, and its not as though some of the beautiful actresses of today don't still have to battle the same boring old stereotypes. Although Marilyn is seen as a victim, I don't think she would have appreciated being remembered as a 'tragic figure', but rather for the positive enjoyment her art brought to people.
