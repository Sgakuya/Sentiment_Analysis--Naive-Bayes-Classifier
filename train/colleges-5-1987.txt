I spent a total of five years at Clemson and left with two degrees and the knowledge that I made the best choice with regard to my college education. I've yet to see another school match the all-around Clemson experience. From Lake Hartwell to the South Carolina Botanical Gardens, Clemson is home to a beautiful campus and a unique, small-town atmosphere where college students can thrive and grow. Those who call it a redneck school just don't understand what it means to be a Tiger to all who attend and the diversity of the student population allows Clemson students to meet young people from all over the country. Go Tigers!
