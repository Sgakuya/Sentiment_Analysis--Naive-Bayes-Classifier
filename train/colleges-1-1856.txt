Let me first state that I am a current graduate student at Temple and an Instructor. While other postings on this site have correctly indicated the outstanding academic integrity of Temple, I believe they are remiss on the environment of the school. Full and Associate professors view their job of teaching as a burden. On numerous occasions I have students tell me that their professors do NOT care about them and I can verify that by the general attitude of the graduate professors in several departments. Students get in the way of research is a common mantra I hear. Added to all of this the administration is a sea of red tape; the campus is in the heart of North Philadelphia which happens to be one of the more crime ridden areas of Philadelphia. In addition, there is a lack of community for students. Therefore, if a collegiate environment is what you require - do not come to Temple University.
