Well,Geordieboy,I suspect that people who rate where they live are generally going to give it 5 stars.My,you sure are a towering intellectual,your insights are razorsharp,your depth of understanding leaves me shaken.So,americans can't stand movies with out happy ending? Isn't that a wee bit bigoted?You imply the rest of the planet can deal with a sad endings.And some of us are so ugly we should not be allowed outside? So,america is the only country on the planet that has ugly people? And this country has nothing but psychopaths? Well,I am so happy to burst your bubble,you snob,but in every sigle country one percent of it's population has skizophrenia.Even the one you live in.Hows life living underneath a rock?Suits you.
