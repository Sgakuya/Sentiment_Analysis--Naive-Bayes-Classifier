I'm a Colorado native. I must admit, I love my state. I live in one of the burbs of Denver, but I know the state like the back of my hand. Denver is a progessive city. I especailly appreciate our cultural and ethnic diversity. Our population is near the 2 million mark and growing. Yes, we have our concerns such as education, growth and most recently, water. The cost of living is probably a little higher than the norm, however, I just visited NY state. A two bedroom condo in a little hamlet 50 miles north of the city will run you $450,000. In Denver, the same unit would be in the $175,000 range. The eastern 1/3 of the state is arid yet mainly consists of farms and ranches. On the eastern base of the Rockies, we call the front range is rapidly becoming on very large city, extending North, Fort Collins to the south, Colorado Springs. Our mountains are probably the most beautiful in the world. We offer world class skiing, rafting, hunting and fishing. The fall colors in our mountains are beautiful yet short seasoned and I will admit not nearly as gorgeous as the South or the Eastern states. The climate is fair. We have a few days with temps in the single digits and a week or two hitting the one hundred degree mark. Our altitude is high, remember Denver is the Mile High City and many of our peaks reach nearly three miles high! If you really want to experience Colorado, try Steamboat Springs or Crested Butte. Both are beautiful ski towns with real people. I would avoid Vail and Aspen all together. The friendliest little town in the state, in my opinion, is Meeker. It's not very pretty, but the people are the best we have to offer!
