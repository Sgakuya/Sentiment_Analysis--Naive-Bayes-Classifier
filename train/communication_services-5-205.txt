I work at a Radio shack and I sell both sprint and verizon wireless. From my experiences from both providers and all of the customer feed back that I get, I would have to say that verizon wirelss is the best provider, especially in the bay area and california region. The prices are very competetive, although they do not have unlimited features like Mob-mob or unlimited night+wk minutes, they give you a little of both. Digital choice 250 is $34.99 and you get a total of 2250 minutes, plus they have 5 states free roaming and great coverage. I know Sprint can charge up to 60 cents a minute for roaming in an analod area. Verizon phones must pass a test to get approved to work in the service area. Overall, I believe that it is the best service out there.
