First and foremost, we've got both the Red Sox and the Patriots, which automatically makes us great in a sense. As for our accents, yes they're gritty and annoying if you're not from around here, but I don't go down south and complain people's accents because I don't like them. Yes, the weather is cold, but we can't all live in tropical climates. If you don't like it, live somewhere else. The reason why the driving is so bad (at least down here on the Cape) is because we have so many stupid out of state tourists who have no idea how to drive (especially around rotaries). But anyways, we still have the Red Sox and the Patriots...which automatically makes us the greatest state in the nation.....
