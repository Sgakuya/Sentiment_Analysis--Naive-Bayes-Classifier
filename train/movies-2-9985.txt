I think Scary Movie had a lot of hype and appeal, but in actuality was not that exceptional. There were a few amusing parts, but most of the time I had to force myself to laugh at what may have been just crude or tasteless scenes. I did enjoy the various integration of movies such as the Matix and The Usual Suspects because I thought those scenes were entertaining, or at least pretty clever. But other than that, these were a lot of plain tasteless scenes that I didn't think were very funny at all. It was an okay movie, but not something I'd recommend paying eight dollars for to see in a theater. It is something that might be okay to rent and watch during a night at home.
