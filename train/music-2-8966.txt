I used to be a fairly decent fan of Jimmy Eat World. I heard them back in 98 and have liked them ever since. I must say though, I am extremely dissapointed and feel somewhat betrayed by this recent album. Maybe it is because Clarity was just so damn good, but dear god... this is absolutely no display of their talent. This is their display of the american pop culture breathing down their backs and trying to make them the newest cool thing of the mili-second for all the TRL hookers...next thing you know Led Zeppelin will be asked to remake an N'Sync song... and gee, if it is for the world of pop who could ever be against them changing?!
