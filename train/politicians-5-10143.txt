As expected, Bush has won. Thank God. What is amazing is Bush won the popular vote by over 50 percent, a feat that has not been accomplished since his father achieved it in 1988. America has spoken and believes in defeating terrorism and keeping this country and the world safe. I respect John Kerry for not pushing the Ohio results because that would have turned him into another AL GORE and I believed would have hurt the Democratic party even more. Republicans dominated this election, won the presidency, control the Senate and House even more, and Daschle is out(THANK GOD). In my opinion, John Kerry could have defeated Bush, but Kerry rather defeated himself, flip-flopping, his voting record in the Senate, and labeled Massachusetts Liberal I believe hurt him dearly. Also, Democrats expected a huge turnout from 18-24 year olds but didn't get it, which shows the whole ROCK THE VOTE and VOTE OR DIE was useless and pathetic. In addition, another interesting aspect of the election was people speculate the presence of lawyers in many different polling stations allowed a true fair and honest election. What this country needs is unification, I hope that people get over their bitterness and grudges and realize as a nation we are one together in the war on terrorism.
