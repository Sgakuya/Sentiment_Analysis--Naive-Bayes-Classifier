Although some of the clothes there are OK, I hate A+F! Thier sexist, racist, and immature. They sold T-shirts discriminating against the asian culture, they make clothing that is too skimpy to taste. Im a 16 year old teen in High School, and believe me- whenever I see stuff from Ambercrombie and Fitch on a girl (a.k.a. adolecent aged female), I am sickened by it. The stuff for guys there is almost just as bad. Its too expensive as well- Come on! Who can ever pay $100 for a pair of pants or a shirt? The issue about the thongs for little girls and preteens is whole other story. Why would looking at prepubscent girls be cute? In comparison to what?- Themselves!? Are they child pornographers or child molesters? What is this all about?! The corporate executives in Ambercrombie and Fitch are just dirty old men. Without thier jobs, they would be unemployed useless bastards. They can't get women, nor a respectable job. All that they can do all day long is fantasize about nude children and teens.
