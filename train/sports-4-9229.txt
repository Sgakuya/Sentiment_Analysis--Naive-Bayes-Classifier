I FEEL THAT JALEN ROSE IS A GOOD PLAYER BUT SOMETIMES HE GETS SLACK . I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS WRIST INJURY, BUT THIS SEASON HE IS NOT GOOD AS HE WAS LAST YEAR. THAT'S WHY MY RATING FOR HIM WENT DOWN. LAST YEAR HE REALLY REPRESENTED WELL, AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR HIM. PROMISING TO WIN A RING I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR OTHER PEOPLE WHO PLAYS WITH HIM ON THE COURT, AND IF THEY DON'T DO THEIR JOB, THEY WON'T BE GETTING NO KING OF RING UNLESS THEY BUY IT THEMSELVES. EVERYONE HAS TO CONTRIBUTE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO WIN A RING. THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS I HOPE JALEN KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, AND I HOPE THE WRIST INJURY DID NOT AFFECT HIS GAME.
