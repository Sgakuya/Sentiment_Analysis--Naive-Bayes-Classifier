This might be streatching it a little, but Rochester always reminded me of sort of a miniature Chicago. It is on one of the great lakes, it has faired much better than the other cities around it, it has a lot of old historic areas, lots of parks, and very diverse. Just on a smaller scale. It has that family feel like chicago does, where a lot of families have been in the area for a while. One of the unfortunate things about it sort of resembling a miniature chicago, is the crime in some of the seedy areas, and although i hate to say it, there still is a lot of segregation. You dont see too many neighborhoods in the city or suburbs that are evenly white and black. If Rochester's races could unite, we would probably be rated not only ONE of the most livable areas of the country to live like we are now, but likely THE most livable area to live. This could probably happen if people would stop being so afraid of other races. If some white people moved into more of the older nieghborhoods, and black people moved into the suburban areas and white neighborhoods, then a lot of things would probably change for the better. I am not talking about switching, and having all of the now white neighborhoods turn black, and all the black neighborhoods turn white, but just mix it a little bit. East High School is 65% black, and only 20% white, while Olympia high school is about 90% white, and less than 10% black. Racial divistion is probably the ONLY thing holding rochester back from being like it was in its hayday. Think about it, we have one of the most educated populations in the country, lets use it!
