My rating of 4 is for the downtown only. Charlottetown was built on the water and has a street plan dating to Sir Samuel Holland's survey in the 1760's. Province House is worth a visit, Founders Hall is not. A guided tour by college students dressed in period costume is always interesting (and entertaining). Confederation Centre is a good bet with art gallery and main-stage theatre. Avoid Charlottetown on rainy days in summer - all the tourists head into town from the beaches and the city of 35,000 doesn't have the infrastructure to handle the load. Do walk the waterfront boardwalk from Victoria Park to Confederation Landing Park on a nice day. Recommended place to stay are the old-style inns: Inns on Great George, Elmwood, Dundee Arms, Edenhurst, etc. Avoid motels & hotels if possible - typical blandness. Complaints? Small, lack of transit, no nightlife (avoid so-called nightclubs & try pubs & brewhouses instead), planning in outlying areas leaves much to be desired. Overall, for a government town, it's not too bad & it's close to nice beaches & beautiful countryside.
