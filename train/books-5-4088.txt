My father says Hermann Hesse's twisted mind twisted up his own, expressing great concern for a high school teacher who would require it as reading. I, however, found the opposite effect-an unraveling of sorts, an undoing of. The corset laces strapped about my ideals, my beliefs, my philosophies, plural. Not that I have reached any concrete conclusions since but maybe that was the point. A mind like a river, flowing, undamned. Read it, for the history. Read it for the understanding of the revolution of a great philosopher. Read it for the possibility of unraveling the binds about the philosopher in your own mind.
