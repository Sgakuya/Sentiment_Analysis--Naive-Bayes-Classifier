J-Lo can't act and she can't sing. But what she has are nicely packaged songs with great beats, and films that don't make you think - kind of that sugary, syrupy appeal. I like her music, and her movies are okay. But what I like most about her is the entertainment factor I get out of watching her THINK she can do these things. Plus, she is gorgeous (if she keeps her mouth shut - I have to deduct glamour points for her rough gehtto-accented voice) and always looks flawless. In fact, I have never seen any other performer who is always so camera-ready. I also give her credit for making-over Ben Afleck. She turned him into a complete stud overnight. Gym workouts and makeup did wonders for that guy. I don't have opinions on the longevity of their impending marriage, but it'll be fun watching them.
