I purchased a 1998 Saturn SL2 brand new. Two words, NEVER AGAIN! They might be a good car if you get a non-defective one, but there is no way to know ahead of time. Furthermore, after 2 or 3 years, your formerly good car can turn very bad (as mine did). Saturn will not admit the defects or stand behind their merchandise, so don't expect it. As soon as you have a problem, they will weasel out of it any way they can. Mine has an engine (manufacturing) defect whereby the pistons contract and don't fit in the casing properly. It burns oil like gas, in fact I fill both at the same time. My mechanic tells me he sees this defect (with the oil burning) all the time, it is very common. This morning my master cylinder failed, I could have been killed, pedal to the floor, no brakes, on a dangerous highway. The rest of my brake system was good, I had no way to know it was coming (but the brakes in modern cars are not supposed to fail like that!) If you want a car that will last 2 or 3 years with no problems (provided you do not have problems from the start as some do), buy a Saturn. I got 3 problem free years out of mine for my $18,000 +, I would have done better to buy a used car. If you want a car that will last more than three years, buy an import or at least a better domestic car. My next car will be a Jetta or a Sentra, Saturn (or GM for that matter) will never get my business again. I have also heard the air bags don't work in some Saturns, that would have been great had I crashed this morning when my master cylinder failed! Buyer beware! If you get one of these cars there is a very good chance you will be sorry.
