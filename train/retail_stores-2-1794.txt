Ahhhh Planet Wal-Mart here to take over the world. I try to avoid this monstrosity as much as possible and only shop here for specific reasons. The sales clerk don't ask if you need help you practically have to chase them down(the only exceptions are electronics, the photo center, the deli, the bakery and the pharmacy) You have to wait in line. In many cases I've found things cheaper elsewhere. One other thing that's always bothered me is I don't think a retail store should sell fish. They aren't experts on how to feed and handle them. Sure Wal-Mart has been around a long time and is a big store that offers a lot of products, but you can find a smaller and better store with better service and better quality.
