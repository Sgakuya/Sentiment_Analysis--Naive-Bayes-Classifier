i had bought my multicolored gemstone ring in feb and by june one of my stones fell out. i took it back to the store and they replaced it for $65. i just wanted my ring back so i paid it. they never even called me to let me know the ring was ready. the day that i got it back another one of the stones came out. when i went back to the store to tell them that i want it fixed and i will not pay for it. they told me that they WILL NOT do it for free b/c I made it fall out. then about 2 weeks later another stone fell out. i WILL NOT EVER EVER get anything else from whitehall jewelers. the jewelry may look very pretty and elegant but it is made like doo-doo and all they want to do is squeeze as much money out of you as they possibly can. and they will not fix what they made like crap. i advise anyone who wants to buy jewelry to not even remotley consider going to whitehall jewelers.
