Come on down, y'all to the Heart of Dixie AKA the great state of Alabama! We have it all, great Southern culture, nice folk, most of them that is. Don't forget the food! That's right, can't think of Alabama from a non-Southern viewpoint without the food in mind. Some folks would think states such as Alabama contain the false characteristics that have formed over the the years. Very few are true, besides they do not describe all Alabamians/Southerners in general. If you (including friends and family) have plans on visiting the state, I recommend visiting the Port City first, simply known as Mobile. When Mardi Gras time comes, Mobile is at its best! By the way, Mobile is the true birthplace of Mardi Gras. Y'all come back now, ya hear! Pardon me, I just had to let the pride out.
