I consider BP s Wild Bean Caf (yes, the gas station, I was sceptical too at first) to be one of my best coffee discoveries ever. I ve always enjoyed a good cup of coffee, especially in the winter months, but never really got into the coffee shop culture where the more you pay the better it's supposed to taste. Then, this past year, I finally decided to give the expensive stuff a shot. Since then, I ve sampled some of the most expensive concoctions on the market and have to say that for a straight up good tasting cup of coffeee, Wild Bean tastes as good if not better - than anything I've gotten elsewhere. My personal favorite is the Dark Roast strong but not bitter and very tasty! The most noticeable difference in Wild Bean and those that cost three times as much is that the others well, cost three times as much.
