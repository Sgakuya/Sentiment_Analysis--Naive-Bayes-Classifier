It's hard to seperate Harding from Coolidge because Coolidge carried on Harding's policies so well. A former Reagan economics advisor said this about the Harding/Coolidge administration: In another 50 years, Harding will look much better than he does today. His most sensational move was to name Andrew Mellon, the Pittsburgh banker, Treasury Secretary, which is why the Twenties roared. Mellon was the best Treasury Secretary after Alexander Hamilton. Harding's second great move (which preceded his Mellon pick) was to name Calvin Coolidge his running mate. Coolidge is derided because he didn't advocate Big Government, but he was Reagan's hero. RR was in high school in the Coolidge years, when Coolidge best expressed the ideas of low tax rates producing greater tax revenues than high tax rates. It was Mellon who inspired the JFK tax cuts of 1964 and the Reagan Revolution that followed. The only reason Harding is reviled by today's historians is that he MUST be entombed along with Hoover (and Coolidge) in order to elevate FDR. My thoughts precisely. Harding (and Coolidge) clearly rank among the top ten presidents in U.S. history. It's a shame many historians belittle the accomplishments of these two outstanding presidents in order to elevate FDR.
