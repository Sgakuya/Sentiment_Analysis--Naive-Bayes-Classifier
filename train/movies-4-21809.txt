The Lord of the Rings (The Two Towers) was truly a good movie.In fact, I watched it for many times just like the first one.But if I were to compare the two,the first one was really great maybe because the whole story started there.What I really appreciated in the first movie is the settings.I felt that I'm also in the other dimensions of the world where there are magics and fantasies.Just like a dream that I like to be into.The views of the place and the colors of trees mountains, falls, rivers,etc., are like real and I thought of paradise.However, the second movie is also good but it is more on the darkside of the movie and I supposed that we still have to appreciate it 'cause it is a part of the entire story. To all the people involved in making this movie possible, I salute you alland I'm proud of you.
