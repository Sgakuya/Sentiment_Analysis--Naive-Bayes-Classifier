I've seen him in two roles - one in The Green Mile and one in a movie I do not know the title of. It had something to do with football. And my personal opinion is that he should have won the Best Supporting Actor for the 2000 Oscars (another Michael - Caine - won that year, and he was good, but there's no matching this man). His role in The Green Mile as John Coffey was an acting phenomenon. You have to keep reminding yourself that he's an actor. Plus, he's incredibly good natured...his size automatically makes him a scare (makes Tom Hanks look like a midget, and Tom Hanks is pretty big), but he's got a really likeable personality. In the football movie (don't know the title) I only watched him brielfy, but for those ten minutes, he was fantastic. 3.46 stars? What's your problem, people? If I ever see the 2001 Planet of the Apes it will be just so I can see another Duncan movie. Take care, everyone?
