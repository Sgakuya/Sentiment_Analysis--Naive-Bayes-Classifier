Ms. Bening is a good actress who has had some very good performances(Valmont, American Beauty, The Grifters, The Siege). Unfortunately, being Mrs. Warren Beatty, she does not receive all the respect that she deserves as an actress in her own right. She seems to be getting better with age - some of her best performances have come after 40(The Siege, American Beauty), which goes against the Hollywood grain. Perhaps being Mrs. Warren Beatty gives her an extra bit of clout after all. When it all boils down to broth, one cannot deny that Ms. Bening is a smart, capable, and very talented American actress who is alwys expected to make a run at the Oscars. We need to see moore of her work!
