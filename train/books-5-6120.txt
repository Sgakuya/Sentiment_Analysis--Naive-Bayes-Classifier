Informative and excellently written, there's a reason why this book is rated so highly. Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" displays the less-than-spectacular side of the fast food industry, citing specific examples of what you're eating and how people involved in the industry, from the farmers to the servers, are harmed along the way. Yeah, we all know it's unhealthy. That's a no-brainer. I've stopped going to McDonald's long before reading this book. But it certainly gave me a different outlook on exactly how far-reaching the industry's effects really are. An extensive bibliography in the back is also very much appreciated. The version of the book I have has a response to some of its criticisms. One big criticism I have, which he does note and makes an attempt to correct, is the "demonizing" of the Republican party. Not that I'm a big fan of the Republicans (or the Democrats, for that matter), but it seemed to come on pretty strong. He did, fairly, mention in the addition some examples of less-than-stellar actions of the Democratic party with regards to the fast food industry, at least. Overall, this is an excellent book, highly recommended.
