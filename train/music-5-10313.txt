I find it interesting that those who diss Clay won't say what their type of music is. STEP UP AND BE COUNTED!!! For those of us that love Clay that is okay, just don't step on our parade. Clay is an amazing man, who sings his heart out and when you attend one of his concerts you know that you have been totally entertained and the man has given you his all and your money is well spent. Clay works very hard at his craft, contributes his time and talents to many charities, stands up for and speaks out for those with disabilities who can't speak for themselves. Like so many, I love his music and listen to it everyday. I'm proud to be a Clay Aiken fan and look forward to many more years of enjoying the magic of the man.
