Way too overpriced for what you get. Look at how much one of their Coolattas costs! That's just insane. I'm not much of a donut eater (maybe once/twice a year, if that) but DD donuts are not as great as they say. After trying Krispy Kreme (of which there are only 2 in CT, compared to what seems like 100's of DD stores; 5 in my town of 60,000 people alone), I have realized that DD donuts simply do not compare. I've only had KK Original Glazed twice and each time they come out ahead of DD. Warmer, more flavorful, and best of all, NOT STALE like Dunkin Donuts! When KK says Hot Now they are NOT kidding! Plus, their ads are stupid and the company is affilliated with the Boston Red Sox and NE Patriots (DD is based in MA), two teams I hate and despise. Those alone are enough reasons to boycott Dunkin Donuts! The only reason I go there is to buy coffee beans for my sister, who lives in Utah, where she says there are no DDs. I don't drink coffee myself, so I can't comment on that, but as for the rest of DD, I'll pass. To top it all off, I have never seen a cop at Dunkin Donuts either, so the donuts must not be that great, LOL.
