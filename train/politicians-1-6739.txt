A genius and master conjurer. Al Sharpton (the so-called reverend and Dr. King wannabe) is infamous for his racist and bigotted slanders. Any situation he can take advantage of he swipes up in his palms and proceeds to weave a racist tail out of it. Has lead the black people of NYC for decades and decades and has seen nothing but increased poverty and ignorance bestowed on them through his polarized and malicious leadership. Master propagandist who takes advantage of the ignorance and dazed poverty of NYC's black residence to gain political power for himself--check TruthTeller1's comments, how he says that if you don't agree with Sharpton than you're automatically racist; how he compares Sharpton's violence and hatred to Dr. King and the Civil Rightists of the 60's, which is like comparing the Nazi's goosestep to an Independence Day parade. TruthTeller1 is full of nothing but Sharpton's version of truth:--example of his mind control, guys... Remember, when people feel trodden on they will turn to the nearest wacko for comfort--like when the Germans elected Hitler. Sharpton: disregarding of the law, an agitator, a symbol of all black stereotypes put into one man. A speaker who stages rallies and condemns people literally before the law (is put in place) by violence and intimidation. Encourages black people to violence--examples include the murder of a young teen Jew plotting against the black race (Gasp!), his alliances with racist anti-white groups, his support of such black crooks as Pat Dorismund (girlfriend-beater, drug dealer, child criminal), among others; plus his campaign for molested black female Tawana Bardely who was raped by cops and smeared with waste during which he vilified the cops and condemned them to Hell--even though later it was discovered the whole incident was a farce set up by Tawana as a way to increase racial agitations. Did Sharpton apologize to the cops and their familes for mercilessly seeking to destroy them without evidence? No... Sharpton: the very antithesis of Dr. King and the peaceful Civil Rights Movement of the 60's. Terrible man. Notice his great enemy (Giuliani) is MUCH higher on the list! :-) Sorry, Al! The public has spoken.
