Released in 1979 and directed by Carl Reiner (who makes a cameo appearance), The Jerk was Steve Martin's first major film and screenwriting effort. The movie follows the rags to riches to rags story of idiot, good-natured Navin Johnson (Steve Martin) who was raised by a black sharecropping family headed by the matriarch (Mabel King). Navin discovers his true ethnicity when he finds rhythm upon tuning in an easy listening radio station and decides to leave home and make his fortune in the world. Going through a series of menial jobs (eg gas station attendant and carnival weight guesser), Navin escapes from a serial killer, discovers his sexuality (ie his special purpose), falls in love with a wholesome femme fatale (Bernadette Peters), and gets rich from his invention of the Opti-Grab, a tool which keeps glasses from slipping. The fairytale comes crashing down when Navin is sued over his invention. What makes this film work is that Martin can make the material effective with silliness which seems natural and unabrasive. Moreover, the sexual references are well done in a way that matches the aura of the movie as a whole. The bottom line is that The Jerk is a movie that is still funny today and is important when examining the development of Steve Martin's career.
