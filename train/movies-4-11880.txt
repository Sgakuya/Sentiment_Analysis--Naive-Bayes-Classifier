Much like the famous board game, a fun time can be had by all with this 1985 film adaptation. The standout cast brings the "whodunit" mystery to life, with Eileen Brennan, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, Madeline Kahn, and Lesley Ann Warren playing the blackmailed guests at a mansion dinner party hosted by Lee Ving's macho-creepy Mr. Boddy. Ving's manservant Wadsworth (the ever-versatile and always-good Tim Curry) throws a wrench into the plans, and the bodies, secrets, and laughs pile up as the dastardly evening wears on. Excellent sets, with old cars and period 50s wardrobes framed against a backdrop of McCarthy-era paranoia (which figures into the plotline). Watch for Kahn's dead-pan ad libs, Yvette the maid's skirt hemline, M*A*S*H's Kellye Nakahara as the cook, GO-GOs guitarist Jane Wiedlin as a Singing Telegram girl, and WKRP's Howard Hesseman as a door-to-door salesman with a twist. When released in theaters, CLUE had three separate endings (as a neat gimmick to create positive buzz), but most every disc has all three included. A lightweight lark you're sure to enjoy.
