Teddy Kennedy obviously did not make it to Harvard because of his SAT scores. He obviously did not make to the Senate as a result of his political skills. He got spared of charges of murder because of his family connections. Is the reader of this message beginning to understand the disturbing trend in Teddy's behavior? At least his two brothers Bobby and Jack had brains; Teddy is just a liberal ideologue who does not understand the working man's problems. Recently, Kennedy was reelected to the Senate with seventy percent of the vote. Are the voters of Massachusetts really that blind to what Kennedy stands for and the fact that he is an elitist who does not know the working mans problems?
