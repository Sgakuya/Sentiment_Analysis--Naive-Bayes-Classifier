UVA truly is one of the best schools in the country, and for undergrad, I think it is underrated compared to some of the Ivies. It offers a perfect balance of academics and social life, and the combination of great location, hot girls, excellent athletic teams, and proximity to large cities (Richmond, DC, etc.) makes it too good to be true. As an alum, I feel that there is a certain magic to this school, and it makes all of us anxious to return to C'ville whenever we can. Despite what people think, UVA students and alumni are pretty down-to-earth compared to people from the Ivies and Duke, and UVA is pretty damn hard academically. All of the departments are strong for UNDERGRAD education. I barely pulled a 3.3 in the E-school (engineering), and went to a Top 5 graduate program...they know how good the school is. All of my grad courses were repeat and I had a 4.0, and writing my thesis was trivial. A guy from Virginia Tech was in my class, and predictably, he failed out during the first year.
