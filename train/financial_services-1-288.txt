I have been a customer at Wachovia for many years and without question they are the worst financial institution I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Their customer service is horrendous at best. I have maintained the same business account at the same branch for well over 20 years now. I am finally throwing in the towel as I will no longer pay to be treated like dirt. My account was intially opened with Southeast bank which was a great bank. Along came First Union and sucked them up and now Wachovia. I've had so many problems with this bank it would take all day to list them all. Besides their outrageous fees, the biggest problem I have with them is the total and complete disrespect they show the customer. I was just there and questioned a practice I did not think was right and the branch rep without batting an eye said--If you don't like it go somewhere else. Yeah, That is wachovia style customer service at it's finest! Fortunately for me I am selling a large property that will net me a very nice 7 figure profit after all is said and done and you can bet your sweet you know what that not one thin dime will find it's way over to wachovia.
