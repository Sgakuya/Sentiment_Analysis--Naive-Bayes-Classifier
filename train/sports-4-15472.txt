He's a talented player, no doubt about it, but I have my doubts whether he's the dominant future hall-of-famer that everyone said he'd be when he came up. He's very fast, especially for a guy his height, and real quick and agile. His leaping ability and body control are tremendous, and that coupled with his 6'4 frame makes him the top deep threat in the league. Smaller corners can't defense passes against him, yet he'll outrun bigger safeties. He's not a winner, though. He's not a guy that you can put out there with a mediocre second, third reciever, an average QB, and a weak running game, and say win it for us and he does. Minnesota showed that this season, and they showed that the Randy Ratio hurts their chances to win. Throwing to Jerry Rice never hurt Joe Montana's chance to win. And I think that's what separates Moss from the real greats.
