this guy is without doubt one of the best actors of his generation.one only has to witness his perfomances in movies like american history x and primal fear to really understand the depth of this actor.his brilliance as an actor lies in the fact that he can portray such contrasting roles with such feeling and awe-inspiring emotion.to top it all off, this guy has a great work ethic and this further accentuates his all round brilliance as an actor.being a person of a slender build,his hard lean body in the movie amexican history x showed that this actor is willing to go all out to add credibility to his role. edward norton is the best,and i definitely see an oscar in his future, provided that he can choose the right role.as we all know,choosing the wrong movie to star in can cripple an actor's career, irrelevant of how good one is.
