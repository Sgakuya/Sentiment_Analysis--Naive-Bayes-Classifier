A pretty funny movie. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson make a good acting dual in this buddy movie about divorce lawyers who crash weddings to have one night stand with women.they probably have done this for years. it comes to difference when they crash a wedding of a rich family.Each like a different sister. vince vaughn's character attracts this sister who is bit on the odd side. she takes to him right away and things go crazy for him after that. Owens character likes the other sister who already has a boyfriend who of course is a total jerk. they end up at the parents estate and tough stuff happens to The VV character Jeremy, . we see Owens character JOhn really is growing to like his girl of interest. Of course they get caught and we see what happens to both the end is fairly predictable. good movie with some real funny scenes. the actress Isla something is a stand out as the wacky sister who is after the jeremy character.
