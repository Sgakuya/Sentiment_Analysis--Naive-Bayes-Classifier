OK, from now on message boards need to be for people who know what they are talking about. the lost to santa clara because they lacked a point guard. nobody can score if they can't be fed the ball. please try watching a UNC game and then try to say your tmac crap. mccants is the most naturally talented player to come through college basketball since david thompson. he is a superstar, and will be for years to come. thank u to those of you who pay attention to the games, and understand that mccants is twice the player he was last year, and people can stop saying all this he doesnt play defense BS. he blocks anything that people bring to the basket, and he will do it wednesday against duke too.
