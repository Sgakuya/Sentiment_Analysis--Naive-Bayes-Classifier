Michael Clarke Duncan belongs in the top 20. This guy is one of the best up and coming actors today, and his career is only going to shine brighter as time goes on. He gave a phenominal, simply phenominal performance in The Green Mile . I have not seen acting that intense in a very, very long time. However, Duncan has also proven that he has a comedic side with his roles in Armageddon and The Whole Nine Yards . More recently, The Scorpion King and Planet of the Apes were just two more successful films in which this man helped bring to life with his wonderful acting skills. Duncan should rank up there with the likes of Denzel Washington, Harrison Ford and Tom Hanks. A phenominal actor.
