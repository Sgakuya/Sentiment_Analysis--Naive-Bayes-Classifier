I'm a junior in high school and i've been dipping for about a year and a half. I had my first dip when i was 13 and I didnt really get into it until half way through my freshman year.... the best kind of dip to me is either red seal fine cut or skoal fine cut, i like red seal a lil better because you get more in a can and it's cost is alot less.. Here's a lil quote for all the dippers out there "Dipping is a lot like a being with a woman. At first it leaves you with a feeling of an unsurpassable high. The longer you have it the more it withers away until you feel nothing. Then you throw it away and put in a new one"
