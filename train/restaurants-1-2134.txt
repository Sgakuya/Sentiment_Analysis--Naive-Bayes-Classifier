I am currently a Tim Hortons Employee in Windsor Ontario. I would first like to say that im sorry for every wrong coffee or bagel you've gotten in your life time from one of our stores. Now, with that out of the way i'd like to tell you what its like on our side of the window/counter. Imagine having to hear all the people talking all around you and tring to listen to one person over a head set with minimal volume and trying to push the corresponding buttons on a machine. Mind you there isn't a button for everything..we have to wait for a menu to load to enter the type of creamcheese you want...while you continue to ramble on about the kind of timbits you want in your medium size timbit WHICH FOR THE RECORD DOES NOT EXIST!! no where on the menu board does it say small medium or large...so take one more breath and say the number in the box. Next..for you people on a strict time schedule to get to work for 8 o'clock and have been up getting ready for the last hour or so maybe...remember i've already been working for atleast 2 hours and have to keep our drive thru times under 30 seconds to keep managment off our backs. So while your complaining about getting a wrong coffee or ur orders REPEATED wrong...think about this...your sitting on your ass waiting for food...when im running around making sure that there is enough coffee for the people in front of you,for you and after you.(it takes four minutes to brew a pot of coffee so if in the middle of making YOUR order i decide to put another pot on so the rest of the world can have coffee shut up and don't complain cuz odds are the coffee your drinking just finished brewing and if i didn't put it on in the middle of sumone's order you would have been pissed to have to sit there and wait) And meanwhile your sitting in your car waiting...sitting down listening to your favorite song on the radio. In my personal opinion anyone who complains about the service at tim hortons can damn well make their own coffee at HOME and make their own MUFFINS and COOKIES at home..its not tough people..you can buy coffee cans at tim hortons and there are plenty of grocery stores that sell cookie and muffin mix. I espcially hated the day i came during shift change and took the place of sumone who was leaving and the drive thru was really busy and i was screamed at by a lady because she waited in line for 3 minutes..for a single coffee...i told her i just got on shift and that i was very sorry for her inconveinence..she sped off. My personal favorite is being called off of my break to pour some ungrateful customer a coffee..you lazy people get up 10 minutes earlier make yourself soem coffee and put it in a travel mug and spend less time complianing about our service. Thanks very much and have a nice day.
