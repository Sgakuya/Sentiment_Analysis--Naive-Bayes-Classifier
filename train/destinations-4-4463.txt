Hotlanta is a cool city. I was there for the NCAA Final Four weekend + and had a nice time. I hit all the main spots - The Underground,Coca-Cola pavilion, MLK house, CNN tour, Buckhead, Peachtree street etc....and found the place to be pleasant. Atlanta seems a bit like Miami/South Florida in that it's not quite as representative of the South because of the transplants who have come to the city and the major companies that have made the city home. There is a southern feel to it though , but Atlanta is The New York of the South. Atlanta has a large Black professional population as well. It is a mecca for upwardly mobile Blacks. MORE******* Just came from Atlanta and a few more things struck me about the city. Traffic is awful throughout the city all the time. It's a case of road rage just waiting to happen. Even the downtown areas suck in regards to getting somewhere with traffic. Atlanta's airport sucks as well. They do their best, but it's a nightmare getting a rental car to the airport, going thru check in and then taking a shuttle to the correct gate. On the plus side, Atlanta has a great social scene with plenty of bars and restaurants. There are also a lot of pretty women ( and women in general) around.
