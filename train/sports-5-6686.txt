It's time to give Jackson the credit he deserves. When he won six rings with the Bulls, skeptics said anyone can win six rings with Michael Jordan leading their team. Well, now he's about to win a championship with the Lakers. And yes, he has two of the best players in the NBA on his team. But those players have been there for years, and how did they do in the playoffs? The last two seasons they were embarassed in the early rounds. And let me ask: Would Shaq have been the MVP this year if Jackson hadn't convinced him to work harder on defense and make his offense more complete? Maybe, maybe not. And would Kobe have turned into a Jordan-esque superstar without Jackson's teaching and his ability to massage egos in a way that helped Kobe accept his role as the #2 player in LA? I don't think so. Jackson is a master of molding individual talent into an effective team. It would be interesting to see what Jackson could do with a pathetic team like the Clippers, but that's beside the point. Even if it turned out Jackson isn't capable of pulling a Doc Rivers (turning a low-talent team into over-achievers), he would still be an excellent coach. In a high-talent environment, there is no question that Jackson is the man.
