My wife and I have visited four different islands. We are amazed at how each island offers a unique paradise. Our favorites are fishing in Kona and lava on the Big Island. The down hill bike ride on Mauithat starts at the highest peak at dawn with a 32 mile glide through catus,eucaliptic forest,to sugar cane, pinapple fields and finally to the beach. Kauia had beautiful rain forest and the grandest canyon of the islands. Finally, Oahu was a delight to see the cultural exhibits, snorkeling, beaches, and the fantastic climb to the top of Diamond Head. Take time to enjoy the scenary and nature at its fullest. Carry your camera and don't be shy. Hawaii can renew your spirit and appreciate God's wonders.
