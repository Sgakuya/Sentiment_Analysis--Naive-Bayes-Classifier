It seems that Offspring will not go back to the days of 'Ignition' or 'Smash.' However, 'Amricana' is considered by most rock fans as their second best effort. Understandably so. I feel the same way. The logic behind this reason is not just because of 'Pretty fly...' and 'Why don't you get a job', but it's part of it. After all, they were grest catchy songs. 'Pretty fly...' had a good riff and had a message that said Posers' (specifically white or anyone trying to become a different race other than their own) suck and are stupid. 'Why don't you...' had a good caribbean drum beat and said 'Down with dominating and yet....lazy A@@ partners.' You can't beat that. The other reason though why this album is better than the others is because of the songs that shouted out Yeah! This is true Offspring, and it kicks A@@! (particularly 'Staring at the Sun,' 'No Brakes,' 'Walla-Walla,' and 'End of the Line.' IF you're interested in Offspring, GET SMASH! IF ya want to go even further into Dex and co.'s world, start with Americana.
