As I was growing up I had heard so much about this film yet oddly enough could never manage catch it on the tube until I was in my late teens or early twenties. This is especially weird when you consider both the amount of hype it created and the fact that I was an avid movie fan throughout my childhood. When I did finally have the chance to see it I certainly wasn't unimpressed; it really is a very moving love story complete with excellent acting, exotic setting and poignant ending. I do think that people got pretty carried away with it over the years - so much so that all the adoration builds you up to the point that you are expecting the greatest film ever made. So, while Casablanca is an undeniably good film - it is not the be-all end-all movie of all time. To be fair though, no film could completely live up to the amount of expectation that has been trailing behind this one for so many decades.
