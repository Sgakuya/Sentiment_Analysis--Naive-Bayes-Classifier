IHOP is a decent place to eat for a family on a budget.That is important to us since our kids are older and now on the adult menus, we need to find restaurants that offer good deals on their food. So far our meals have good tasting and we get a good amount of food.They offer a lot to choose from.and even at night you can still order off the breakfast menu if you choose. In our area IHOP offers coupons for buy one meal get one free. A big plus for our family since it is a treat for us to get to go out for dinner. YOu are not going to get fancy meals here, but you can get some decent meals at IHOP.Although our kids are no longer on the childrens menu IHOP offers a nice menu for children.
