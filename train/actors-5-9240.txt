IF THERE WAS A RATE OF 100 STARS, I WOULD DEFINITELY VOTE THEM ALL. KATHY BATES IS A MARVELOUS ACTRESS, AND AMBULANCE GIRL WAS WONDERFUL. SHE MADE ME LAUGH, AND I ENJOY WATCHING TV WHEN THE STORY IS FUNNY AND DOWN TO EARTH. I COULD NOT WAIT FOR NEXT SUNDAY, TO SEE WHAT SHE GETS HERSELF INTO. I WAITED AND COULD NOT FIND IT LISTED, AND JUST TODAY, I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT A SERIES, I CALLED ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO AMBULANCE GIRL, AND EVERYONE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A ONE TIME THING, I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. I WANT IT TO CONTINUE AS A SERIES. PLEASE PLEASE KATHY TALK THEM INTO A SERIES, YOU CAN DO IT. I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT. HELP. AMBULANCE GIRL WAS THE BEST THING ON TV THAT WEEK.
