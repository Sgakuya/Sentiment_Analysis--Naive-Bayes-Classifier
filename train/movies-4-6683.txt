A great movie version of a classic book. What makes it even creepier, besides the current Robert Blake murder angle, is that they filmed it in the actual house in Holcomb, Kansas, where the Clutter family lived and died. Blake has never been better as doomed murderer Perry Smith, but equally superb is Scott Wilson as Richard Hickock. The only flaw is that Brooks has his stand-in for Capote- actor Paul Stewart as a Reporter- freely dispensing bleeding-heart liberal sentiment where it's not really necessary; Truman Capote was much more restrained and far more eloquent in his book in conveying his sentiments without being so heavy-handed and obvious. In the case of this film, less would have been more. Also, the Clutter family never really emerges in this movie as anything other than mid-western 1950's stereotypes. Still, even with these reservations, this is still a powerful, chilling movie. I think I read once that Hollywood originally wanted Steve McQueen and Paul Newman to play Perry and Dick. You can't help but wonder how that would have turned out...
