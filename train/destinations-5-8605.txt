I'm 40 now, and I started dipping Copenhagen at 14. I've dipped non-stop since then, so I've probably given $36,000 to the US Tobacco Company (26 years @ 1.5 cans per day @ $2.50 avg). Needless to say, I like my dip. Like everyone else, I'm not made of money, and one day I had to look at other brands. After trying all the others, some of which truly tasted horrible, I tried Grizzly Red. Not bad! Its flavor is the closest to Cope than any other, and at $1.45 a can (Sam's club), I had to try and make the change. I began by buying equal amounts of cope and Grizz, and mixed one can of each in a bowl. I then packed them back into the cans, and dipped 'em. After one week, I stopped buying Copenhagen altogether, and I've been on Grizz for six months. I'm saving $700 per year!!! I use my credit card to make my buys so my wife can keep the budget, and she thought I quit because she no longer saw the huge Copenhagen bills. If you can't bear to pay $4 a can for Cope, you should give try switching, like I did. Just to check my tastebuds, I splurged for a can of Cope, and two seconds after I tasted it, I knew I just wasted my money.
