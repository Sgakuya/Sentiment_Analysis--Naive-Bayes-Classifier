This is probably not the forum for my post but I have to react! Ugh! I'm so frustrated! I was reading a post about "for profit" schools! I don't attend any school right now and I happen to be shopping for a good MBA program. I read a post about the stigma online universities have and I want to say, BITE ME! Excuse me but what year is it? HELLO? Technology is the future. I don't know what I will do for my MBA but I have to say I was so angry when I was reading posts that dissed for profit schools. Frankly I think the teachers have more incentive and the staff is more student oriented when they know a profit is involved. DMV=non-profit snootie UNiversity SAME! Ugh. I'm so frustrated. Internet is the future people. This needs to be perfected and if your narrow views help so be it! A frustrated shopper!
