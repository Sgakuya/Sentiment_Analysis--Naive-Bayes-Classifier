Attention Smyrna Charter Cable customers-please check your bill for this month 01/06 in particular. Since Charter's answer to me regarding the errors in my bill were due to a system glitch, I'd like to find just one other customer who experienced the same thing as I did. I was expecting my total bill to come in at around $78-79.00 after taking into account that my Biggest Value Package increased to $73.99. Instead, the amount listed for my Biggest V.P. was $80.38. Where did they dig up this number($80.38).Next, my Cable card was correctly listed at $1.50.Next up is supposed to be HDTV Service.Instead it was Additional Digital Receiver-$3.95 and Digital Access-$3.00. Further down is a charge for Partial month Dig. Rec. -$4.33. WHAT ADDITIONAL DIGITAL RECEIVER? There is no such thing in my house. Just the one that's included with my B.V.P. Never ordered one, never got one, but somebody added one to my bill. I'll get into more detail after I see if I'm all alone on this.
