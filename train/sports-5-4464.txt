As much as I hate Duke, and I hate them a lot - I have to give Krzyzewski some credit. I have never seen a Duke team not ready to play, and I have never seen a Duke team without poise and discipline. The defining moment for my opinion about Krzyzewski came in the 2000 tournament, when Duke was on the verge of being upset by Florida. The game was all but over, and Krzyzewski had just pulled Chris Carawell, the Senior leader of Duke, out of the game. As Carawell was coming out of the game, Kryzewski stormed down his bench and made everyone on the Duke bench, players, coaches, and trainers, stand and give Carawell a standing ovation. The gritty Carawell stopped, hugged his coach, and burst into tears. Kryzewski cares for his players, and they reward him by excelling year in and year out.
