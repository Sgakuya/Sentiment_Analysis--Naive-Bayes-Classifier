Wow, what can I say. Reagan was easily the greatest president of the 20th century. In fact he ranks right behind Washington and Lincoln as third all time. When evaluating Reagan its important to weed out all of the liberal propaganda and get down to the basic points. 1)He was a key factor in ending the Cold War. While its true that the USSR was having problems one must remember that Reagan entered office at international communism's high point and left office with the Cold War all but over. There is no denying that Reagan played a major role in this triumph. 2)Under Reagan the American economy caught its second wind and Americans had more money. All Americans benefited from his tax cuts and his welfare cuts got rid of strains on the economy and put Americans back to work. 3)Finally, the most important contribution Reagan made to our nation was his ability to inspire the American people. Remember, when Reagan took office in 1980 the nation was reeling from a crisis of confidence Its leader (Carter) had publicaly bashed both America and her citizens in his malaise speech . The US needed a strong pursuasive leader who could remind Americans that THEY were living in the best country in the world. His ability to portray America for what it was and always be, a shining city on a hill , inspired Americans and was the fuel behind America's Cold War victory, the rebirth of the American economy and the birth of a new world order with the United States as the singular dominant power. When you cut through the lies and half-truths and get to the bottom line the results speak for themself... America was at a critical point in her history and Ronald Reagan helped keep her on top.
