IJR banks here, and has never had a problem. In fact, everything has been super. I have been able to cash a paycheck for the full amount even though I had under $100 in my checking account at the time. No other bank I have dome business with would do that. They would demand I deposit the check and wait for it to clear. At another bank I opened a free checking account. Free, if I kept a certain amount in the bank, didn't use the ATM more than a few times, and didn't bank online. Hidden charges all over the place. Since transfering the vast Reilly fortune to WF, IJR no longer gets charged hidden fees. Freaindly tellers, nice people, a great place to bank.
