A waste of money, reminds me of a Chevy Corsica on steriods in 2004. It may not be a bad car, I priced them when I was in the Market to buy a car, and the prices are too high for what you are getting. I looked at the prices on the new models and we are looking at close to 30K, for the same price you can buy a brand new Nissan Maxima, you tell me what would you rather own? You cannot even compare the two, One car is world class with Horsepower, Luxery, handling, everything the Impala is not. I ended up buying a 2002 Maxima, and I will tell you what it is much nicer than a 2004 Impala. Anyone that knows anything about cars will know what I am talking about. GM just slaps their cars together now, they used to make really nice priced good Auto's they are going down hill, to cheap plastic's, all of their cars look alike now and are way over priced. I liked GM back in the day when they had imagination and made the best cars, they fell off.
