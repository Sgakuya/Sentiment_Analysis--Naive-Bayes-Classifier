One of if not the worst state in the union, lol oh yeah i forgot, it isnt in the union. If they were, their state flag wouldnt have the confederate flag on it, and they wouldn't have cross burners. In MLK Jr.s Speach, he said that he hoped that one day the state of mississippi would be a heaven for all races to come together, well im sory MLK jr, but that part of your dream just never has and probably never will happen. Mississippi has been rated the least livable state every single time sinse they started taking that pole. And like i said, that will never change, bunch of hicks! And with that, i have just finished rateing every single american state!
