Philadelphia really is probably one of the best cities in the US, if not even the world. I have been an avid visitor and have been to most other major US cities. It offers something for everyone. A big city with a small town feel with genuine people. It must have the best food of any city with everything to choose from including all of the famous original Philly treats. It has to be the most well rounded when it comes to what a city can offer. It is unmatched with history, one of the best orchestras, best zoo outside of SD, best museams, arts of all kinds, good nightlife that is only getting better, resturants, bars, ect. It has a stunning skyline that is set for more projects from what I hear. It has the largest park of any city and a great park system all together. There is tremendous culture here with proud neighborhoods. There are some of the best colleges and institutions in university city. Phila has some of the best sports fans I have ever seen. Granted, they havent won in a while but they are the most neurotic to the bone of any fans I have seen anywhere. I could go on about how much this city has to offer, you really have to visit everything it offers to find endless supprises. From what I hear, Philadelphia is becomming the next major city to go through a renaissance adding to the skyline, resturants, luxary condos. This city has potential for so much more. I read it will be the first major city to go wireless. I would like to see something more done with Penns Lansing, possibly something like navy peir in chicago at 1 end. There is some urban decay in some of the "hoods" that need to be addressed like every US city. I felt very safe on all of my visits and the city was clean. Too much to do and see, I still havent seen it all. I highly reccommend visiting this great American city that is only getting better.
