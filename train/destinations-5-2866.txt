How could some of you MORONS give NYC just one or two stars?! Are you NUTS? New York City is so grand, unique, and historic, you have to be ignorant to negatively rate the place. You're not being asked to live there (it is expensive), but to rate it in it's totality. Manhattan (NYC) is probably THE most dynamic, cultural, artistic, and interesting city in all of North America, with incredible parks, restaurants, museums, art galleries, night clubs, stores, etc. And the people, once you get to know them, are very friendly and loyal. I absolutely LOVE the 'directness' of New Yorkers, because they 'tell it like it is'. I live in OHIO, and 'I LOVE NY'!!!
