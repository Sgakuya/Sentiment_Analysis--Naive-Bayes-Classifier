What is *with* these bad teeth and I hate the monarchy lunatics? Firstly, we really don't have bad teeth. I wore a brace for 18 months and now they're fine, thanks very much. As for the monarchy, perhaps some people are just a little bit jealous? Could it be that having a constiutional monarchy without much power of its own is a little better than a monkey-brained idiot as both political leader *and* figurehead (i.e. Bush)?? Yup! This is the greatest nation on the planet, without a doubt about it. Hence our immigration problem, mainly caused by Ozzies desperate to get here and make music (Valance, Minogue) and then they stay. Many famous movie stars and musicians make their homes here or buy second homes. London is a beautiful city at its heart, with the London eye providing an excellent viewpoint from which to see Big Ben, the skyscrapers around Canary Wharf, Hyde Park and the arch of the new Wembley Stadium, the best stadium ever!! We read more than anyone else because we're more intelligent than anyone else. We're a literate, cultured democracy with 3 main political parties (not 2) and unbiased television, unlike the US. We have digital TV and digital radio, and are a major player in the European space program, having built many of the experiments on the joint US-European Cassini-Huygens probe. We have extremely low unemployment, low CO2 emissions and green hills. And great teeth!
