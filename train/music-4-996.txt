This album is extremely thought provoking as well as emotionally stirring. I saw Chris Cornell perform much of this album (as well as a few Soundgarden songs) at the Sun Theatre and was mesmerized by the sounds being emitted by this man's vocal chords. This recording had me singing and dancing all through the house (is this a good or a bad thing?) ... The music on this recording is also very different from Chris's music with Soundgarden because it's much mellower; however, as always, the music is just as melodic and grooving. The music on this album even affected me in a way that very few artists have done. It had a special sentimentality to it that really helped me emotionally deal with the loss of my younger sister seven years ago (when I was almost nineteen and she was almost eighteen), which I'd managed to repress for a VERY LONG time and which I only thought about under certain unhealthy circumstances. lettyg74@earthlink.net
