Starbucks is a great success story all the way around. I am not an employee or stockholder, just to get that out. I have been to Starbucks in every city I have lived in or visited, and have never had a bad experience. I have had so-so cups of coffee, but that happens. Good restaurants serve bad meals on occasion too. The thing I like most about Starbucks is the variety of drinks you can get. You can literally get any type of coffee or non coffee drink you want. Strong or mild. Whole milk or skim. Organic milk also. The stores are always clean and the staff is usually friendly. The music they play fits perfectly with a coffee shop environment. Is it pricey? Yeah, a bit. However, you can buy a tall regular or mild cup for 1.50 or 1.60, and for no extra charge flavor it with milk, cream, vanilla, cocoa , chocolate or water. From what I understand, they treat their employees well and take care that their business doesnt impact the environment or their suppliers negatively. Hey, this chain has kept a decade of harried, bleary eyed american workers and students performing their tasks at an acceptable level. Dont hate, appreciate.
