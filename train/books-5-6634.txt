Seeing the movie prompted me to re-read this trilogy, and I'm really glad I did. I'd forgotten how great these three books are. I think Tolkien gets carried away sometimes with the songs and his fascination with language, but somehow it all works together to add to the feeling that you're reading something authentic, something that could really be the mythology of a civilization instead of the product of one man's imagination. I think the first half of Fellowship of the Ring is a little slow, but once I was past that point I had a hard time putting down the books. They're timeless - I hope my kids and grandkids will read and enjoy them.
