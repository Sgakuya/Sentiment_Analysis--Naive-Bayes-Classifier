As someone whose family won't normally watch movies of books with, I was impressed. I spent my time watching this movie in an environment devoid of my usual complaints about adapations. Truely, the changes were few, and needed in many cases. Of course I would have liked to see each character have the shining moments they have in the books, but in the grand scheme of things who is more important -- Ron or Percy Weasly? The movie was 2 1/2 hours as it was! I must, however, refrain from a 5 star rating due to their copious use of computer generated characters etc. Whenever a CGI character appears on the screen, I immediately lose my suspension of disbelief or, alternately, feel like I am watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I am aware that it was best for some things (flying on brooms seemed to be one of the better applications), but why was the grass in the Qudditch field animated? And do we need CGI to make owls fly? All in all, I was enchanted. Drawn in by the same magic that caused me to devour all the books and beg for more.
