Wasted talent, never took on an active leadership role, instead sat back and only reacted to domestic events. Ignored world events. Under his leadership or lack of, he alone and not his intelligence agencies, continualy underestimated terrorism and its threat to America. After nearly a dozen terror attacks on American soil or troops still failed to act decisivley. This is one area we need to trust the commander in chiefs judgement because none of us ever see an intelligence report and he must act without an accurate poll to go on. Credit for bringing the entire democratic party to the center, leading to the republican takeover in 1994. As bad as he was he still would be better than Hillary. Impeached.
