I love this stuff. I first tried it from the General Mills breakfast variety pack. Remembering the commercials from when I was younger and how my mom would refuse to buy me expensive cereals from General Mills until they went on sale ..and by the time they went on sale, the longing for the cereal had vanished. Anyway, to get to the point, this cereal contains less sugar than one would think from just looking at the crunchy squares. They look overloaded with sugar and have a couple of cinnamon swirls per piece. However, a look at the nutrition label will reveal that there's only 10 grams per serving. Consider the new jack-shaped Apple Jacks, with 17 grams of sugar per serving. The first problem I have with CTC is that every time I take a bite, I have to take a moment to suck the sugar granules out of my teeth because it just goes everywhere. To me, this cereal seems unsuited for out-of-bag snacking because of problem number two: it's greasy. I've noticed that every cereal with saturated fat I've tried has left a greasy residue on my milk that tastes just gross. Fortunately, CTC's flavor is so strong it masks the disgusting grease flavor. But any cereal storers or hands that come into contact with the squares will need soap and water because of the oily feeling. Oh, your lips feel greasy, too.
