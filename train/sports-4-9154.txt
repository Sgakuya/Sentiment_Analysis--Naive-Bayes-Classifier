Hi everyone! I'm a longtime Kings fan and love the team that Sac has now. I don't know how many of you are in the local Sacramento area and may have seen the Sacramento Bee but a writer on the Bee staff, Aliene Voison, has been bad-mouthing Jason the last few days regarding the incident with the GSW fan. Several other fans that I talk with feel she has a personal vendetta agains him and we need your help. Will you please write or e-mail the Managing Editor of the Sacramento Bee and voice a complaint about her? If enough of Jason's fans complain the Bee will have to tell her to cool it. It's not that we don't think what Jason did was right but that she's trying to make more out of it than the situation deserves. To e-mail, which is probably easiest use this link: http://www.sacbee.com You'll see a section at the bottom I think it is saying problems or suggestions, or contact us info. Just click on that and go from there. Thank you for your help.
