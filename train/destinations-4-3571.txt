I moved here about 4 months ago after 10 years in the People's Republic of Seattle. It has been a refreshing change, to say the least. Although the area is fairly liberal, there is at least a sense of balance to the political scene, unlike Seattle, which is now referred to as the "Berkeley of the Pacific Northwest." Another plus is that people can actually drive here. I won't get into the driving situation in Seattle, as that could take up the rest of this post. It is the middle of winter now, but it doesn't stop Twin Citians from having fun; whether attending holiday parades, ice skating in the free outdoor rinks, shopping on Grand Ave in St. Paul or France Ave in Minneapolis. As far as eating is concerned, I was pretty sick of salmon (I know, everyone loves it, but there is only so much of the stuff you can eat!), tofu, and triple de-caff extra foam extra hot 2 pump caramel lattes. The Midwest beef, freshwater walleye, and hot casseroles have been delicious, and there are plenty of great bars and restaurants to enjoy them in, both casual and upscale. In addition, it's a great sports town where fans are real fans who not only support the NFL, MLB, and NBA, but who relish the NHL. And finally, but not least, homes and condos are still pretty affordable, unlike the average price of $300,000 in Seattle. After living in Boston and Seattle, I believe the Midwest is the most underrated area of the country. (Although if I had to choose between the two coasts, I would go back East where at least there is some character and substance!)
