I LOVE THIS MAN!! HE HAS THE INTESTINAL FORTITUDE TO SAY THE THINGS THAT MOST AMERICANS SAY IN THEIR HOMES, BUT HE SAYS THEM TO THE PRESS. HE HAS A NO HOLD BAR WHEN IT COMES TO SAYING WHAT'S ON HIS MIND, IF YOU LIKE IT, FINE, IF NOT, FINE. BUT ATLEAST HE DOESN'T SKIRT AROUND THE ISSUES. YOU KNOW WHERE HE STANDS. IF HE WERE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, I WOULD STAND IN LINE TO VOTE FOR HIM. I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD GET ALOT OF THESE LAZY PEOPLE THAT DOESN'T WANT TO WORK AND WANT THE GOVERNMENT WELFARE HANDOUT, BACK IN THE WORKPLACE AND CUT THIS MONEY OUT. I'M SICK OF TRYING TO RAISE MY FAMILY AND SOMEONE ELSE'S TOO. ALOT OF THE RECIEPTIANTS DRIVE BETTER AND NEWER CARS THAN i DO, EAT BETTER THAN i DO, WEAR DESIGNER CLOTHES, AND THEN HAVE ALOT NEWER HOUSE THAN MINE AND ON TOP OF THAN, HAVE THE POWER COMPANY GIVE THEM A REDUCED RATE IN THEIR BILL! DAMN, WOULD SOMEONE OUT THERE WAKE UP BEFORE I'M IN THE MINORITY!!! I WORK VERY HARD TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY AND RESENT SEEING THIS EVERYWHERE I GO. I KNOW THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY THAT'S FED UP WITH THIS BUT NOBODY HAS THE GUTS TO SAY IT. I WISH THAT MORE OF US WOULD STAND UP AND BE HEARD. WHY SHOULD THEY LIVE LIKE THIS AND OUR SENIOR AND ELDERLY ARE HAVING TO MAKE THE DECISION TO BUY MEDICINE, FOOD, OR FUEL TO COOK AND HEAT WITH. IT'S S SHAME. THESE ARE THEY VERY PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT AND DIED IN WAR, WERE DISABLED SO THAT WE COULD HAVE WHAT WE DO TODAY. THEY WROKED LONG, HARD HOURS IN A REAL MILL TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND WHAT DO WE GIVE THEM IN RETURN? ALMOST NOTHING. GOD HAVE MERCY ON OUR SOULS!!!
