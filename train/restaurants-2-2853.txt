Boycott Togo's!! The food is average (on par with Subway) but the service (or management) sucks. Or at least it did a year ago. Despite the fact that Togo's carried a turkey and avocado sandwich, and a turkey and cranberry sandwich, they refused to give me a turkey, avocado, and cranberry sandwich. (Okay, maybe it's gross, but that's what I wanted.) Have you ever noticed that the sandwich makers aren't allowed to collect money? (I don't think this is for efficiency reasons - maybe sanitary reasons.) Anyway, the sandwich maker double checked with the money taker and again, I was told that wasn't possible (despite the fact that I was willing to pay whatever it took to get my cranberry sauce). They couldn't tell me why I couldn't have one, just that it wasn't possible. They must have been missing that button on the cash register...
