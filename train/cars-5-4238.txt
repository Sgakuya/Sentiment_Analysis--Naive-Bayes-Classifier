I've heard horror stories from various chat roomers about sludge problems. TAKE NOTE: The Positive Cranckase Ventilation (PCV) valve's function is to extract harmful gases given off by the lubrication system (oil). In the Sienna, it is VERY hard to reach. I strongly suspect that quick and dirty mechanics don't like to change it because they paid a flat rate for each task. That means, they are almost forced to cut corners and get the jobs done as quickly as possible. If you are having sludge problems, I'd strongly urge you to complain bitterly about this issue. Further, the Toyota maintenance manual, in the opinion of other sources I've read, does not prescribe change-out of the PCV often enough. Coupled together, these two problems might be the initial source of the sludge fiasco. I myself have fortunately escaped this problem by doing my own service. I recommend using synthetic oil (like Mobil 1) and change the PCV with every oil change. I find that with this pre-emptive approach, I can avoid engine rebuilds until the car has outlived its usefulness. In my house, that usually means after 250K to 300K miles (for Toyotas). Other cars don't seem to last this long no matter what you do.
