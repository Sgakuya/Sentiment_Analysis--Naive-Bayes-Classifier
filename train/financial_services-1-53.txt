This is an e-mail I sent today after being told that there is nothing they can do to help ME with the 300 dollars they charged me in fees...I will never again do business with this corporation....if I was eager to bend over and take it on a regular basis I would be a porn star...although then I'm sure I wouldnt have money issues... Well thank you anyway-for your time and compassion..... I will however be closing my account due to my inability to not be an idiot which you are basically implying- through the year or so I have this account you have figured out more ways to charge fees then I've ever seen before-I figure I've probably paid almost 1000 in fees hopefully providing yet another secure paycheck for the hardworking employees that are so able to assess my account- Never once did anyone ever offer to help me or try to understand that your fees are EXCESSIVE.....and unreasonable to a single mother of 3 that makes $300-400 a week, although not last week or this week it seems as once again I will be funding the next branch currently being built to do the same thing to the average joe that gets no respect because they don't bring enough revenue into your bank to matter- so the only way to get them is to charge outrageous fees for everything short of breathing near the bank... unless thats a new one? So I thank you....for your wonderful customer service....next time why don't you just be straight with your customers and tell them you think they are idiots? It saves time and the hope that maybe someone will understand that like for everyone-times get tough- I will be in to my local branch to close my account- thank you ever so kindly for everything....
