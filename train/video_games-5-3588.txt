Let's see. I was already a fan of Final Fantasy, but I've never played 1-6. To tell the truth I did'nt know they existed. I first experienced FF when my sister told me to take over the game while she took a break. Years later, I beat FF10. After that, I nearly beat FF8 but I can't kill Adel. 2 days after I gave up I took FF9 out my sister's room (they're her games). I didn't want to play it by looking at the cover. All I have to say is don't be fooled! The movie sequences are great, the controlls are easy, the characters are good, and so is everything else. On FF8, I found it hard to navagate on the map, not on 9 because everything is close by. It's also very humorous and the storyline is good. So if I were you, I'd get it.
