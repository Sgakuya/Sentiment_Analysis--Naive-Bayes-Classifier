Kidd is the new and improved John Stockton. He's a little better passer and more athletic than Stockton ever was. If his career is lengthy he should eventually dethrone Stockton as the best point guard ever. Kidd is one of the few of the lost art of consummate team play and making your teammates better. He's very physical, also and great on both ends of the court. His opencourt ability to drive to the basket is unparalleled by anyone past or present. His only weakness is that he seems to be finding a shooting groove and then he'll go cold for months at a time. Stockton and Magic, on the other hand, finished their careers shooting for a good field goal percentage. If Jason Kidd could shoot the ball for a high percentage consistently, he would be unstoppable but until he does, he will have issues.
