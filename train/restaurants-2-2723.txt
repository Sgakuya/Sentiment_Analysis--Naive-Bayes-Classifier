McDonald's is so all-American, and has done such a good job on branding itself over the years that it will escape the wrath of receiving a terrible score from me. But seriously, there is not one meal that looks appealing to me when I go in there. The Big Mac is a sloppy mess with way too much bread. Their new version of the Whopper (what's it called? the Big King?) is a pale comparison. Their chicken sandwiches are horrid. And why is it that I'm seeing them refer to the new McChicken in advertisements these days? I remember having a McChicken during my Little League days (we're talking 1978 here). That ain't new. Finally, over the years, my loyalty to their fries has waned -- I much prefer those at Wendy's now. Sorry Ronald Co., but you just don't measure up anymore.
