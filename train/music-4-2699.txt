Released in 1967, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band reflected a more mature, full-length oriented sound as opposed to a group of singles characterized by most of the Beatles' earlier releases. The tracks flow nicely from one song to the next (with a bit more McCartney than Lennon), and even Ringo makes a major contribution in With A Little Help From My Friends (though he didn't write the song). Along with the title track, Sgt. Pepper's includes several signature singles by the band, most notably Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, When I'm Sixty-Four, and A Day In The Life which evidence how the Beatles could transcend musical genres (eg psychedelic, vaudeville, straight rock and pop). Nevertheless, notwithstanding the seemingly contrasting styles, the Sgt. Pepper's flows with a connectivity which wouldn't seem possible. The bottom line is that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band remains a landmark release which has inspired artists, past and contemporary.
