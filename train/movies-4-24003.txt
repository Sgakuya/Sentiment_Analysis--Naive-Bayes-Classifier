A.I. was a pretty good movie. Haley Joel Osment was good as the robot programmed to feel love for a mother. It was an interesting science fiction movie. Some parts of the movie was better than others. THE ROBOT boy seeks out the blue fairy to make him a real boy so his human mother will want him.It is awful long though too long of a movie. I liked the teddy bear' named Teddy. I actually felt bad for Teddy at the end.Gee, what became of him.?It was fun to figure out the celebrity voices they used for the robots and the professor no{ Robin Williams} I liked the movie pretty much but not quite as much as I had hoped to.
