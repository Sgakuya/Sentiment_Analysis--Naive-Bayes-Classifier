I completed my MBA from GBS in 1995 - a year or so before the new building was built. My overall experience with the school was positive. I found it fairly challenging, there were a few outstanding professors, and most importantly, I walked out of there with exactly the kind of job that I wanted - and the kind that I hadn't been considered for prior to my MBA. From what I hear, GBS continues to build on its momentum. I have known Dean Robertson for years, and know for a fact that he is a driven, sharp man who has not failed at much during the course of his career. I am pretty confident that he will continue to attract talented faculty, and build deeper relationships with the business community.
