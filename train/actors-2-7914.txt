I really can't give Jason Biggs a rating higher than this because he's only done a few movies. Geez, you do five or six movies and you're getting 5 stars because you're cute. Being attractive does not at all make you a good actor. I enjoyed American Pie and its sequel, but it did not take good acting to overcome Biggs's role. He showed that he may have some potential in Boys and Girls , a more serious role than American Pie . I really do like Jason Biggs- as Magellan and Wiggum pointed out- he's got a charm about him that makes you want to root for him. However, whether or not he can act or not has yet to be seen. Hopefully we'll find out soon.
