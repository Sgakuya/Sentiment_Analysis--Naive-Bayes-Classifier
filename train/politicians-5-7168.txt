Jessie is an advocate of peace and justice. He has paid his dues, walked every dangerous step that Dr. Martin Luther took, occupied every jail cell. Jessie surpassed Dr king in , the physical abuse he received during the struggle and spent more of his on money to bail himself out of jail and to finance the civil rights agenda and consequences than did Dr King. Most of you complaining either did not love Dr king anymore than you do Jessie, but it is polictially correct for you to make such a claim. Stop trashing a servant of God and mankind. Stop hating Jesse for being a living hero and not a dead one. He feels my pain and yours and is not afraid to expose thoes who inflict it on us. Enough already! Stop looking for another OJ. Jesse is your brother like it or not.
