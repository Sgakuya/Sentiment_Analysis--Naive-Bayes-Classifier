Hey, the man is so full of testosterone he could donate some to all those hawks from the south. Please tell me something. What would you have done if you were, as he was by his own party, threatened with withholding of support and political contributions. If you were humiliated as he was but not being invited to an honor of one of his constituents, if you were told that in the next election you would not be supported by your own party. Would you have had the balls that this guy has? We need more like him. People who really care about their flock regardless of political affiliation. Meanwhile our wonderful president elect fiddles with his fingers about the energy crisis because it doesn't affect the rich and powerful. The hell with the rest of us. His 10 year plan is not going to do anything for me when I will have lost it all. And the saddest part is the HE didn't really win. As they say only in America . And I thought this stuff only happened in the banana republics.
