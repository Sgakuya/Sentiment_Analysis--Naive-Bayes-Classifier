The original Frankenstein must have been something when first seen. The wonderful instant atmosphere--the foggy graveyard, the two slinking figures waiting for the funeral to end, looking for bodies. Karloff, for the first time, actually interpreting the role, using his expressive face and those enormous hands, the appeal to the world to accept his being. Of course, it is entirely removed from the classic book (who says it has to follow the book, an entirely different medium) where the creature is brought to life by some secret means then goes on to become sentient, philosophical, and vengeful. Still, this hulking reanimation is trying to fit in but can't control his base impulses. His very size is his enemy. The carelessness of Fritz sets everything in motion--had he not panicked we might have had an Albert Schweitzer monster running through the countryside doing good deeds. Now there's a horror movie! the Shape has grown to love this film, especially its most famous scenes. The bringing of life, using lightning, Colin Clive, almost frothing at the mouth, screaming It's alive, it's alive, the death of the little girl through a childlike misunderstanding, the encounter with the blind man, and of course, the scene at the windmill, the villagers running with their torches. By the way, where did they get all those torches? Unlike the first reviewer, the Shape urges you to see this film, not because of its lack of faithfulness to the novel, but because of its captivating portrayal of horror. the Shape wish he could have been in a theater in the 30's and seen Edward Van Sloan announce to us that we were about to be terrified. What a moment! Sincerely the ever loving, blue eyed Shape
