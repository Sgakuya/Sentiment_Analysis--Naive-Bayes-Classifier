So great to finally get The Three Sunrises and Love Comes Tumbling on something other than the beat up old 12 single that I have been toting around all these years. When many of these songs were first released I was in highschool and my friends and I used to climb up in the hills around the town where we lived with our boom box and we would look down at the city below and blast U2(long before it was cool to do so). I tell you, some summer nights right at sunset with Three Sunrises playing I can remember feeling alive and young and the world seemed full of endless possibilities. Hearing these old songs again brings back those feelings and I tell you friends, there's nothing better than that.
