All the fuss the Democrats made over the confirmation of John Ashcroft as Attorney General can be attributed to them being afraid that someone with intestinal fortitude will be running the Justice Department. Someone who will not be afraid to investigate the shenanigans of the democratic party. Unlike Janet Reno, who as Clinton's patsy overlooked the criminal mischief that occurred during the Clinton administration, you can be sure that John Ashcroft will not let the Democrats get off easy when they pull their inexcusable acts of filth in order to acheive their agenda. To them, the ends justifies the means. To Ashcroft, true justice will prevail.
