I'm pretty much in agreement with the other reviews so far. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it for what it was, but they did skip way too much of the original story. The effects and cinematography were very good, but the film lacked heart. The first two had a feel to it that made you believe they were made by people who were really passionate about the material, but this one has more of an assembly line feel to it. My main disappointment, though, was how much story they had to cut out to reach an agreeable running time. I'm hoping that when the dvd is released, it will be a special edition containing much more of the original story.
