Looks like far too many people on this site are rating Shaq for things other than his overall performance. They don't like the fact that he raps, acts, makes jokes, etc., or they don't like specific aspects of his game, like his free-throw shooting, or they assume that anyone that huge - talent or no talent - can be as good as Shaq. Come on, can you really deny that Shaq is the most dominant force in the NBA right now? Sure, guys like Kobe and Iverson probably have more talent, but Shaq's combination of size, skill, and mental toughness make him a uniquely dangerous player. The size part is obvious. The skill part shows up when you watch him consistently make tough passes, sink smooth hook shots, and use quick footwork to get past defenders for easy dunks. And the mental toughness part is displayed both on and off the court. Shaq is always in the spotlight, always hounded by the media, and he generally shrugs off that pressure with a good sense of humor. And on the court you rarely see anyone get in Shaq's head. In contrast to a loose cannon like Rasheed Wallace, Shaq never seems to lose his temper. How dominant does Shaq have to be, how many rings does he need to win, before more people will give him five stars?
