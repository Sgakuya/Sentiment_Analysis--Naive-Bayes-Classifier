Wow...all I can say is wow. After years of wanting to play this game but not being able to because I didn't have a PlayStation, Resident Evil finally came to Nintendo. This game is so scary! I am a big fan of scary movies/games and this one takes the cake. I actually screamed out loud once when this zombie came running down the hallway at me...something I've never done before. The graphics are so realistic that it's spooky, and the creepy, eerie background music doesn't ease the suspense either. The voice acting was not too great and some of the puzzles were way too easy to solve, but other than that it's perfect. If you are looking for one of those games you can't put down for hours, this is the game for you. Finally, a rated M game for the Nintendo! I love it...
