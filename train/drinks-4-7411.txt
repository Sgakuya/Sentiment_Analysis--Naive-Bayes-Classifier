Very good potato vodka. Has a very slight bite that makes it better straight than in a martini. I think the slight bite adds character/flavor that is the reason people add vermouth to their vodka to make a martini (kangaroo). I think the bite is similiar to the vermouth flavor and therefore conflicts with it. This vodka was made to be drank up (shaken with ice and strained). It would probably be good chilled also but I think the littel bit of water added from shaking it with ice brings out the flavor. If you like this stuff you would love Chopin... same smooth and viscous feel and no bite. This is my 2nd favorite vodka next to Chopin. That being said I can't rate it as high as I rate Stoli or Kettle one because those vodka's are good straight and mixed. Luks just doesn't mix as well... but again I like it up!
