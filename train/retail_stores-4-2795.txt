Although I now work for Fred Meyers, I was "recruited" while shopping for a friend. Speaking of that experience, i found their policies to be extremely helpful. they offered me a deal and allowed some room for negotiation on the necklace more so than the other stores I visited. I actually felt like a valued customer. on another note, as an employee and the office manager, I can say that we try our best to accomodate all customers. We can be sloppy, however, so if you buy from us or get jewelery repaired from us, be sure to make the salesperson write down all your information on the slip so you can be contacted when your stuff is ready. we tend to lose items frequently, and if you stay on the employees to get your stuff back immediately, you will have a better experience. also, regarding jewelery repairs, each shop differs in how and who makes the repairs. it's a good idea to ask for the repairer's credentials before agreeing to have him/her do any substantial work on your belongings. many are third or fourth generation master jewelery makers--so don't be afraid to have then spruce up your jewelery! hope this was at least a little helpful. obviously your experience will vary greatly depending on the store and salesperson you get. One thing is for sure though, dollar for dollar and value for value, you cannot get a better deal than from fred meyers. No bad quality passing as perfection like in some other "mall-like" store.
