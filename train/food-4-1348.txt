I didn't like jelly beans until that day that I discovered Jelly Belly beans! A bit pricy, but if you're going to have any jelly bean, the best is probably Jelly Belly. They come in many flavors (who would have thought that they could make a somewhat convincing popcorn flavor?), and yes, each one DEFINATELY does taste different than the other! I would advise that, if you want to try them, go pick out the flavors that sound like you'd like 'em--if it's something that you don't like to begin with, it's not going to taste any better in jelly bean form. Eating one at a time, at least at first, provides the best assessment of the flavor. Note that there's going to be ones that you absolutely don't like, but once you find that one flavor (or more) that suits you, it'll be worth it. (I'm totally hooked on Jelly Belly's watermelon flavor). Jelly beans in general are pretty lame, but if I were just rating Jelly Belly, I'd give them a five! (Oh, and if you don't like jelly beans in the first place, you probably don't want to even bother to try these).
