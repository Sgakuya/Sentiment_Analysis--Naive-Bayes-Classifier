'Almost Famous' is the best rock movie that I've ever seen --- by which I mean that to say that the whole movie FEELS the way that great 70s rock records SOUND. You know what I'm talking about if you own a well-worn vinyl copy of Every Picture Tells a Story and you just love the sound of the vinyl popping behind the opening guitar. There's still a great outlaw feeling in those records if you have the will to lose yourself in them, and this movie puts you in that mood. But I guess I can't give the movie a 5-star rating because, by the end, I'm also struck that there's not much to talk about here. It's a wonderful nostalgia trip, well-directed, good acting performances, funny bits, and an honest look at the naivety of so many music figures, but....like most rock journalism, there's not really a point beyond pure music fandom. So anyway, if you want an interesting, feel good movie, I'd highly recommend 'Almost Famous' -- but I'd hesitate to put this one in the great category.
