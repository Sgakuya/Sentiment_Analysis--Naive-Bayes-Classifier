** I have to give Charlie Manuel some respect. As usual, the Phillies will be sitting the playoff outs - but for once, they went down fighting. This team had quit under Bowa the last couple of years, but this year they played their best ball during the last month of the season. The only reason they're not in the playoffs because it's tough to overtake a team that can field a rotation of Clemens, Pettite, and Oswalt. Anyway, back to Manuel. He's not the game's greatest strategy guy, but he has his players backs, and when he had to, he laid the discipline down - like when Tomas Perez was goofing off between innings on national television, with the Phils down 6-0 to the Mets. These Phils played hard to the end, and I think Manuel deserves credit for that. Lets see what he can do with a full year with Utley and Howard ** ** Original Comment** I was kind of hoping for Leyland who is more of a proven winner, but I would agree with most of alpepper's points below - the drill seargant approach wasn't working with this particular squad. Manuel's lighter touch will hopefully let these guys go back to having fun again, and go back to what comes naturally - living up to their talents as baseball players.
