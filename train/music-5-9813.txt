This is definitely an awesome CD. All the songs are great. Some of them will make you wanna get up and dance (Bailamos, Be with you, Oyeme, Alabao, Rhythm Divine) while others can actually make you cry (I have always loved you, You're my #1, Could I have this kiss forever), and the rest are great also. The way the songs are arranged, the different styles, the diversity, the brilliant words, the way they can touch your soul is what you look for in a perfect CD. Enrique is one of those CDs. You can listen to it no matter in what mood you are, because it's guaranteed it will brighten your day, your life and make you feel different about things. If you don't believe me, just buy it and you'll see what I'm talking about, you'll love it... just a fan...
