Beautiful state and my home for the past few years. Comments about the crime rate and heat are justified in the Phoenix area. Phoenix city is one of the least attractive parts of the state. It is also one of the hotter parts, but it does have lots of great hiking and the largest municipal park in the world (South Mountain). The cities in the valley of the sun are growing at a rapid rate and the water consumption for crap like the umpteen golf courses reminds me of Rome before the fall. If you go, there are other places like Jerome and Bisbee, the Hualapai and Havasupai reservations, the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert areas which are well worth a visit. Sedona - well it is stunning scenery, but don't expect much from the actual town. The only place in the town to walk around in is a cheesy faux-Mexican village. Otherwise, you are crossing back and forth across very busy roads. If you go there, better to camp up by Oak Creek Canyon. Grand Canyon - well that is a whole theme in itself. To say it is worth visiting is an understatement.
