Sweet, sultry, and smart - this is one actress who cowbines drop-dead sexiness, wit, charm and acting skills into one shamfully underappreciated package. Every film the MooCow has seen with Ms. Tomei, she has shined - happily, she has chosen to do many independent films which have allowed her the chance to explore many diverse roles, rather than be another Hollywood bimbo. Check her performance out in In the Bedroom to see how far she has progessed from My Cousin Vinny. Also check out The Slums of Beverly Hills and Welcome to Sarajevo to get an appreciation of this gifted actress's work. Snuggly, sexy, and a good paisano - you go Marisa!!! :=8D
