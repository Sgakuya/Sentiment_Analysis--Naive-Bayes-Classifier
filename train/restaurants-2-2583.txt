I've read the comments all almost every person here and let me tell you that it is if more than 100%all true. Good and Bad comments...I used to work there back in my teenage years and let me tell you the things that happened. Cooks were sloppy,food was dropped and put back on your order. Fries were refried by that lazy staff on slow shits instead of putting in a new batch. Timmers on the burgers were changed intead of changing the burgers when their time had expired and no one purchased it. Fresh salads were old *sometimes for days** The food trays are not always washed...they are cleaned by the same rag that was used to clean all the dinning room tables and counters.**recommends you to take it to go instead** even if they use a liner. If a customer complains, the mngr. gives them a free meal on their next visit(that'll shut the jerk up for a while)and if they are really pissed off, a few free meals and a apology does the trick.....they know that they'll be back as soon as their kid starts begging for the new toy collection. >>still want to go there? should i start on the chiken nuggets ?..I'll just leave it to your immagination. Would i ever go back to work there again?? Hell no! not for what they pay and the abuse and on how they cheat on your hours and don't give you your breaks on time if any! I'm so glad that that's all behind me now.:)
