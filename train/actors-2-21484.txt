I have never been a faithful viewer of Ally McBeal. I just never really got into it. Plus, most of the characters annoy me and the whole lawyer thing doesn't appeal to me. I did catch the episode last night and now I think it is clear to me why I don't watch the show. Calista. I used to think she was cute or whatever but her character (or how she plays her character) is so incredibly annoying, I couldn't believe people like the show. She is whiney, pathetic, emotional and stupid. I am up for skinny girls (I would love to look like her), believe me, her wieght has nothing to do with this review (I think a lot of people talk or review what she looks like and how she looks like she is going to die from starvation). I really just think she is bad on the show. I have yet to see her in the movie, Mid-summer's Dream ? (I think that is what is what called, or something like that). Maybe I will be able to judge her acting ability more in that but as of now, she is just annoying.
