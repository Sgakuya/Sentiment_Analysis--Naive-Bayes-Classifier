This is one of spain's and possibly europe's most beutiful city. Santiago de Compostela is the third holiest city rigt after Rome and Jerusalem because it has one of the oldest cathedrals in the world which is the tomb of St. James the Apostol. It is a typical medieval town with narrow streets, cobbled streets, statues, and the people there are very friendly. Santiago de Compostela is has been a popular pilgrimage site for hundreds of years and it still is today. People walk, ride horse/bike, etc. from all over europe to visit the great cathedral and pray over St. Jame's tomb. If you are interested in art, history, and religion, then this is the perfect place to go! And to the user Realtraveler, you cannot be a real traveler if you think a city so well preserved for thousands of years is dirty and disguisting. In the contrary, the city is full of life and bars and people walking and tourists wearing Pilgrim suits. The older buildings might have some deteoration but thats normal in europe!
