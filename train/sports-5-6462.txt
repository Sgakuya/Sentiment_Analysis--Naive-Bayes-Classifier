Tommy Amaker has done an unbelievable job rebuilding this program. Every year that he has been there he has had recruiting classes that were among the top in the nation. His teams give great effort every night, as well. Just look at what he did last year, taking the Pirates deep into the tournament with a bunch of players who were not recruited by him, but would have run through a brick will for him. This year, the Pirates will be strong again with two of the best freshman in the country (Eddie Griffen and Andre Barrett) and veteran leadership from Ty Shine and Darius Lane. Unfortunately, if Amaker looks to go elsewhere, Seton Hall will have a similar fall to when PJ left.
