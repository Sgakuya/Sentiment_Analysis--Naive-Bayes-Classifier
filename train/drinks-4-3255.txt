My favorite gin without question. I'd give 5 stars, but that leaves no room for improvement, and there are gins I haven't tried yet (looks like I'll have to find Hendrick's to try). Someone else said not as smooth as saphire...that's absurd. As my good friend stated, "Magellan makes Saphire taste like swill!" I do agree, Citadelle is quite close, as is Tanq. 10 and Plymouth. And Magellan is undoubtedly better than regular Tanq. Alas, Magellan has changed their process and will no longer have the blue color that makes it worth the extra $5-10 over Plymouth or Tanq. 10. They claim that the new process is to "appeal to a more mainstream gin market" in their response to my email inquiry. Magellan also claims that the taste is not affected in any way (Iris root is now distilled in the 4th distillation instead of infused after distillation). This simply is not true; not only is the blue color gone, but the gin isn't as smooth as before. I am in search of the last remaining bottles of blue gin before switching to Plymouth.
