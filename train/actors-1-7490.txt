Oh my, I think 'actor' is a rather kind word to call Freddie. No offense to anyone who likes the guy or his acting, but he is terrible. He is solely going by on his looks, which to me aren't that great anyway, and he has not real acting talent. The guy better get some acting lessons soon, because he won't be able to play the teenager for long and he can't rely on his trusty teen audience anymore. I definately do not see a long career for him, he does not have what it takes to sustain one. All his movies are carbon copies of each other, just with different names and he's constantly playing the same character over and over again. He plays himself basically, that's why he doesn't deserve to be labelled an actor.
