I usually don't like Tom Cruise as an actor, but this is one of the few films where I do. I first watched this film when I was a kid and I loved it then. Charlie (Tom Cruise) is a young, selfish - want to get the deal type of man who doesn't really care about anyone else, finds out that his father has died and has basically left nothing to him and has given the estate to an unknown beneficiery. Charlie finds out who and drags his girlfriend with him and eventually he finds out that he has an autistic brother called Raymond (Dustin Hoffman). Charlie decides to kidnap Raymond in order to get the money - but instead goes on a voyage that willchange him forever. The relationship between the two main characters develop and matures and it seems so realistic and so moving. The momentum of the film is very slick and works very well. This is a very heartwaming story and is one that you can watch over and over again.
