We couldn't get in to hanauma bay the first time we tried because there was no parking...but once we got in it was well worth the frustration. If you don't have a mask dont worry because you can rent one there. Parking was one dollar and I dont remember admission but it was probably just a few bucks. After that you can stay all day they have okay bathrooms and grassy areas to lay out on if you don't like the sand. We went on a day it wasnt very crowded but I understand that it can be pretty packed sometimes. Lots of great fish to see and theres a handy guide of pictures and names so you know what you're looking at. Great place to spend an afternoon.
