One of the classics of modern American literature. Brilliantly written and constructed, dense yet supple, evocative and rich in reference, incredibly funny take on our American ethos and the object of desire. Nabokov broaches a very sensitive, taboo and sexually-charged topic, which is a very daring project, but there isn't a single obscenity or direct description of the sexual act in the entire novel. If you're looking to read a dirty book, don't look here: you'd be wasting your time. However, I strongly disagree with other posters here: the book becomes meandering at a certain point because Humbert himself is meandering, and his obsession becomes monotonous because that's what obsession is essentially about. In this, the construction, tone and tenor of the book become apt corollaries for its underlying action and theme. The objectification here of the 14 year old girl is hardly lacking in uniqueness: in fact, as this book appeared in 1955, essentially every objectification of the nymphet appearing in American culture since then derives from Nabokov's model. This book isn't about men's sexual exploitation of others; Nabokov's topic is the deranged and remorseless sociopath. And if terribly real literature angers you, don't read it. Read fairy tale crap like Stephen King, Tom Clancy or that other birdbath, John What's His Face, the pinhead who writes those dreadful and boring legal thrillers. Furthermore, Nabokov was hardly a pervert : just because someone choses to write about an unpleasant, dark or sick aspect of the human condition that doesn't mean the author is of the same ilk, and to come to such a conclusion is reductive and simplistic to the point of idiocy. Read Bend Sinister and Pale Fire if you're interested in other great Nabokovian reads. Considering that Russian was the man's native language, yet he wrote masterfully in German, French and English, Nabokov has to be considered one of the greatest literary geniuses of all time, period.
