Well, I've owned two now. A 1991 GS and now a 1997 GS-T. Both were/are wonderful. I can't answer as to how they hold up with mileage over 70,000. The '97 is getting closer and I will update this page when appropriate. To date, its been nothing but a complete blessing. Love the way it looks. Love the way it handles. Love the way it accelerates (especially in 3rd gear). Love the way it holds up in an accident (both hold up well -- no, I'm not accident prone but have been in two accidents ... both in eclipses adn walked away without a scratch both times). I've noticed no adverse rattles. The drive train has held up to my driving style which is to say the least agressive. To put it simply, my next car will most likely be another eclipse. Love it, love it, love it. Do you get the message yet? I really love this car.
