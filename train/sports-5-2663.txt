Let me go on the record as saying I am not a Yankee fan. Yes, he has George's bottomless pockets, but what makes him The Skipper is that he is a NY guy who isn't fazed or intimidated by The Boss, the expectations or the pressure of winning in the Boogie Down. He has ice in his veins. He is calmer than someone doped up on Thorazine or morphine. You can't just know your baseball and manage or play for the Yanks. It is a totally different monster. If you aren't from NY or haven't lived there, you don't understand. Managing the Yankees is bigger than any other post in American sports, and maybe bigger than coaching Manchester United. You are essentially Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. The guy is thinking three innings ahead all the time, and had the balls to stand up to Steinbrenner a few years back when George wanted to ship Pettitte to Philly. He has earned his credentials with The Boss, MLB, and the fans of the Yankees. You don't have to be a Yankee fan to respect an amazing run.
