I like the old guys like Magic and Kareem but the current Lakers make me sick. Shaq is just huge compared to everyone else. How much of that is fat we'll never know.. haha Honestly though his skill level is right there with my grandma's. I actually think she could beat him in a free throw contest. Give her a couple hundred pounds and she'd just as good. Kobe is a Jordan wannabe and that's all there is too it. Can he complain a little more about getting calls either? The call in the Timberwolves series on the three was a joke. The Chicago Bulls of the 90's would've destroyed this team. Over Rated is the lesson of the day.
