OK, visit if you want to, but warning: DO NOT LIVE HERE! Seriously, if you're some Europe-enamoured American, please stop and think about how delusional you are. The houses are puny, and before you actually own a medium/small house, you'll have to have worked decades, since a house that size costs half a million quid + mortgage interest. The pollution, expensiveness, claustrophobia/crowdedness, dirtiness, crime and lack of sunshine (awful damp climate in general - winters are really grey and dark, SNOWLESS, sunless with very short, sombre days, wet, windy, murky, too long, depressing and gloooooomy - summers are usually cool and cloudy but really humid and unpleasant. If you get any sunshine, it will be through a kilometre thick haze) will get to you eventually. These things will slowly consume you, and before you know it, it's too late to escape. Visit, please. Your money eases our suffering. But don't live here. Oh, and don't get a train to the city centre before 10am. It might only be a couple of miles, but it will cost you 12, which is like 20 dollars. It's cheaper to pay the fine.
