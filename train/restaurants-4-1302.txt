It's good to see another alternative to the normal burger joint. Arby's, at least all the ones in my area, serves thin-cut roast beef that is anything but greasy on a pretty generous bun. Their menu may be a little repetitive, but now they're adding more things like their Market Fresh Sandwiches (great idea, I just didn't like their bread too much), and chicken sandwiches. Their fries aren't much to speak of, but at least they offer both normal and curly fries. Their potato cakes might be a better choice, if you like tater tot kind of potatoes. The atmosphere for the one in my neighborhood is consistently clean and comfortable (there's always someone ready to clean the tables pretty much as soon as it's vacated). One word of warning: I don't believe that there are any vegetarian choices on the menu, if you or someone who is eating with you can't eat meat, this isn't the place for you.
