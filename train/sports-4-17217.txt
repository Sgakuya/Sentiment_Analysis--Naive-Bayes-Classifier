Although I am a big Cowboys fan, I have to admit that they are not as good as their current record. About 50% of it is the magic that Bill Parcells can work, and the rest is the young guys on this team are starting to believe in themselves a bit more. Although I think they should finish somewhere around 10-6, they won't go far in the post season. NEXT YEAR, however, will be a different story. Parcells will probably get some good free agents and perhaps a good running back (sorry Troy Hambrick, but you're a role player, not a starter) and some more protection for Quincy Carter. Carter is not a top-caliber quarterback yet (will he ever be, who knows) but he is working very hard and until he starts consistently screwing up, I say let him keep the job.
