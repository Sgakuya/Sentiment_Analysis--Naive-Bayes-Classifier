I was almost 8 years old when Nixon lost in 1960. I had a strange feeling then that the election was stolen from him. It wasn't until years later that I read (in several sources) of the fraud committed against him in that election, in Illinois and probably Texas as well. When Nixon died, commentators kept referring to him as a good policy man but a bad man personally. I feel the opposite was true. Many of his political moves were much too liberal for me. But if you want to know what kind of person a man really is, look at his family. Nixon had a wonderful supportive wife and his daughters turned out great, and they always looked up to and adored him. An arch-villain could not have produced a loving home like that.
