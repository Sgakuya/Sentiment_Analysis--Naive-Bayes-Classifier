Boy, are you people delusional. Lets go over all your comments. To TRZ2, your first Harley is one too many. It is neither solid and it is definately not well engineered, unless you use 1950s standards. ubursy now. Cleanest and fastest my @ss. Go up against a VTX or a Mean Streak and they will eat you for lunch. Oh, and it has been around for a reason, H-D's R&D are sleeping at their desks. Ok shor3734om, smooth and best handling, compared to what, a paint mixer? Hop an Valkerie if you want smooth. bks81358om appartley has no game, so he uses his bike as a prosthetic penis to get chicks, sad. upchuck, yea, that's what I feel like doing right now. Nice and sporty? I think you mean old and antiquated. And finally, jkri642om, Harleys are no value. Crap at any price is still crap. You fell for their marketing and obviously know nothing about motorcycling. It's not about the brand. It's not about resale. It's about the ride, and you all seemed to have missed that. You were fed a line of crap from who- or what-ever, and you bought it, quite expensively to boot. Wake up.
