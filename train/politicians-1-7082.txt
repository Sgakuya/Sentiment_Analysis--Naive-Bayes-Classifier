The more that people like jesse jackson, al sharpton and johnnie cochran continue to use this 'black' thing like a crutch, they will never amount to much. Your actions should match your words and if you conduct yourself in a manner which merits respect, you will get respect in return. Guys like these have people running scared because they just don't want to be called 'racist' by them. Everyone should be held accountable for their actions, starting with these three. And jesse, everyone knows that if you want to give this president grief, stand by... you should have known this was comming down the pipe. Keep it up and you won't be amounting to much. They'll undermine you by digging up more dirt (that we all know is there) as quick as you can say 'racial profiling'. buh bye
