One of the very best economy cars around and a best seller in Canada, Europe and Asia. Designed for the Asian and European Market, the ECHO is known as the Yaris in Europe and Vitz in Asia where in both markets it's sold as a 2 or 4 door hatchback. The North American market ECHO is powered by a lively and fuel efficient 1.5 litre VVTi motor making 105 HP. Matched to a 5 speed transmission 0-100 km/hr (60 miles per hour) takes 9.0 seconds. The ECHO is very roomy with the best seats I've encountered so far in a car in this class. Numerous storage areas abound and the instrument cluster is mounted dead centre of the car where it should be - your eyes do not have to leave the road to read it! As for the style of the ECHO? some will love it or hate it. It is modern and fresh and very European, inspired by the European market Renault Twingo. If you want a roomy, economical, realiable, powerful small car with more room than a Corolla in a smaller space, the ECHO is for you. Fuel consumption is only 5.4 litres per 100/km.
