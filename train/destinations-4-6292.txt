Most of my experiences in NC are from having spent some time at NC State in Raleigh. There is probably more geographic diversity in NC than in other southern states. Unlike a lot of northeastern cities and rust belt cities of the Great Lakes, the metro region of Raleigh is very wooded. There doesn't seem to be indiscriminate chopping down of the vegetation. This adds to the physical attractiveness of the city. Many of the homes and lawns in and around the city seem well maintained Raleigh is about 30-45 minutes to the college towns of Durham (Duke) and Chapel Hill (UNC) affording the student the opportunity to attend big time college basketball. The beaches of NC are about 3-4 hours from Raleigh and the water is ususally warm enough to swim in and the sand is of good quality. Overall, NC is a relaxing state with a decent amount of geographic variety and the weather is warm most of the year. People tend to be polite here too
