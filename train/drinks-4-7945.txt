This is the best tasting bourbon I have tried with the exception of Bookers. It has a very smooth even flavor that does not rough up the palet. It is great straight, with a dash of water, on the rocks, and even in 7UP ( I know that is almost blasphemy, but on a hot day after cutting the grass it tastes great!). Most of my friends love this bourbon which is why when I have a party I pull out the Ridgemont Reserve ( I can go through 4-6 1 liter bottles in a night) because of the cost. I reserve my Woodford for special friends and special occasions. You will not regret sipping, drinking and enjoying the aroma of this bourbon.
