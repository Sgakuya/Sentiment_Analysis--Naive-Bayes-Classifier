To be perfectly honest I bought this book thinking it was going to be like the movie. It wasn't but fortunantly in this case, different meant better. This book made me laugh, cry and amazed me. Her complicated attempts to explain what goes through the mind of a 'crazy' person, and what it's like to be around other 'crazy' persons. Lisa was a breath of fresh air although she wasn't mentioned much, you were arguing with yourself wether to love her or hate her. Poor Polly with her scars, poor Marsian's Girlfriend, poor Daisy, and poor, poor Susanna. Something that bothers me though, is the lack of character development. Some of the more colourful characters from the movie seemed kinda... flat. Otherwise my biggest complaint is that this book was far too short!
