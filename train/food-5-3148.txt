I buy Amy's frozen foods quite often. The pizzas are really tasty, and they're much healthier than traditional frozen pizza. I also like the cheese enchilada with black beans, the vegetable meatloaf, and the burritos. The pocket meals are really good, too. I recommend the spinach and feta cheese pocket, the vegetable pie pocket, and the cheese pizza pocket, all of which I have eaten several times. I've tried a number of different Amy's products, and I haven't had a single disappointment. If you're not into healthy, vegetarian eating, though, you should probably steer clear of Amy's frozen meals. I'm guessing that they appeal to a fairly limited market.
