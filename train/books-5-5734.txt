I have not read all of Sir Conan Doyle's Sherlock stories, but I can tell you that The Hound of the Baskervilles is a wonderful, chilling, and exciting mystery. It takes place on the beautiful Dartmoor of England, and a man named Sir Charles Baskerville dies mysteriously...I won't tell you the whole story, but I can tell you I give the book five shining stars. If you are a fan of the book, I suggest you go on Amazon.com or some other site and search for 'The Hound' in the movie section. You should run into one version made 2003. It was made for the PBS Exxon-Mobile Masterpiece Theatre, and out of the 6 movie versions of The HOund I have seen it is by far the best. Identification tips- starring Richard Roxburogh and Ian Hart. Made 2003. PBS with Exxon Mobil masterpiece theatre. WHEN I BOUGHT IT I WATCHED 4 TIMES IN JUST 2 DAYS!!! give it a try
