I moved to Rochester almost 3 years ago and I'm hoping I'll be out of here within another 3 years. Rochester is quite simply one of the most boring places on earth. The only good thing about the place is it's location which means that you can escape to Toronto and NYC relatively easily. Nothing ever thrives in this city, the downtown area is a depressing mess of empty stores and an ugly old shopping mall, it's deserted most of the time. There have been many proposals for new developments to inject some life into the place but these never make it to fruition due to the incompetence of the city officials and the apathy of the cities population (who never seem to get excited or passionate about anything at all). Add to this the fact that it snows for 6 months out of the year and the summers are virtually non existant and you have a place with very little going for it. I feel as though my life has ended since living here and I'm only in my early 30's. Do yourself a favour and stay away!
