Excellent browser. Avant Browser 9.02 B101 is under my testing. It is great browser that really helps and speed up browsing. Quick searches is an excellent feature which I have come to use a lot. The interface is very customizeable. However, the pop-up blocker could use some work. It is powerless against floating banners. It has the compatibility of Internet Explorer and it's security. It has easy accessibility to web media extensions such as Flash, scripts, applets, activex, etc, for a faster or safer web browsing. I think it has the best tabbed window system of them all. Very configurable are the tab behavior unlike Firefox which is very limited. It is a very small download, about 1MB. I think the user who gave it this highly functional browser a mere 2 out of 5 stars is biased. Avant Browser has a lot of features. Maybe because it starts with Internet Explorer? My I disclose the myth that browsers like Firefox are more secure. They are not proven to be so. You can make Internet Explorer just as secure as Firefox. People take the misconception that whatever gets hacked more is poorly-programmed. Not neccessarily true. Simple fact is Windows is popular, so is Internet Explorer. The famous get stalked more. Browsers like Firefox are very unpopular according to a statistic. Frankly the simple act of changing or switching a program only gives you some security. Like just changing a software firewall. One may have a exploited security flaw, the other doesn't. Most people percieve that Linux is more secure than Windows, or Mac OSX to be more secure than Windows. Think about it. The conincidental thing, is that both Linux, and MacOSX are not widely used. Think about it. The same goes for Internet Explorer, and Mozilla browsers. One is widely used, the other barely being used. There is no such thing as secure software.
