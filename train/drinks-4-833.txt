For a Jamaican beer, tastes quite American. I found it quite tasty while downing bottles on a hot day in Montego Bay. The little beachside Tiki bar at Sandals only sold Red Stripe; but I would always go to the bartender and ask for something arcane like an Amstel Lite or a Yuengling Black and Tan. The native laughed with me but I'm sure he had visions of smashing my skull with a bottle of Red Stripe by the 20th time I did that. Being a big fan of Ian Fleming's James Bond, Fleming always talked about Red Stripe in some of his early books (Like Dr. No). I kind of had a genuine curiosity of the beer based on that. You can get it just about anywhere now and it's worth a try.
