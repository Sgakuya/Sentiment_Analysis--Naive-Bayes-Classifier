Great taste but as an Athletic Trainer and a Paramedic the only thing worse you can drink after working out or in the heat is coffee. The problem is that gatorage packs in so many solutes (sugar, vitamins, electrolites (tranlate, things that are not liquid)) that it actually robs water from your body through diffusion/osmois (water trasffer). The best way to use gatorade is to dillute it, we use 1/3 gatorade to 2/3 water. That will rehyrdate you and give a good bablance of electrolytes/suger. Also, if you have not just had a strenous workout, Gatorade is packed so full of sugar that it will casue you to GAIN weight.
