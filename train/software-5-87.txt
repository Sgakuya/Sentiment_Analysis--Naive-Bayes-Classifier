Parents, students, teachers -- anyone who has any interest whatsoever in educational software, check this marvelous site out! www.criticalthinking.com is the URL for the Website of Critical Thinking Books Software. You can find something here for everyone as their books and software are for preschool to adult. I have ordered from these folks before, more than once, and I rate their customer service, demos, speediness of delivery, and their mail-order catalog very highly. They have very unusual software -- not the usual cartoon-characters-with-chirpy-little-voices disguised as games, presumably so kids will like the programs more. This is serious, very well-done higher-order thinking in standards-based content for hitgher grades higher test scores, as quoted from the top of their great catalog. The subjects covered are reading, writing, math, science, and social studies; they have over 170 products from the critical thinking leader for over 40 years. Further quoting, 8 out of 10 top-performing schools in the country use CTB S Products! This easy-to-use software is made to be used on BOTH Macs and PCs. Some titles: Editor in Chief, Academic Challenge Cup, Memory Challenge, Reading Detective, Thinkanalogy Puzzles. Their phone no. is 800-458-4849; fax 831-393-3277. Their address is PO Box 448, Pacific Grove, CA 93950-0448, USA. No, I do NOT work for them. I simply have an interest in good educational software. Check 'em out.
