I've Been at Radio Shack for 3 years. I've put up with the most miserable people in the world for 3 years. Employees, managers district managers, Regional manager(saeed), And most of all customers. I don't understand how anyone believes everything they hear. If another idiot walks in and says, they said I could... I'll lose it. People get a freakin' clue. CSRs of other companies or your buddies buddy doesn't have a clue. New motto: you have the stupidest freakin' questions I've ever heard in my life, We are sick sh*tless of them. Now fellow employees.our new DM has a major bug up his booty that breaks down to the fact that he was promoted too early and is in over his head. He has inspired as many people to leave the company as last years Retro-fest which continues this years as project of the month or we don't know what your store should look like. LOOK, everyone is panicing because the economy is not as great as it was 3 years ago, and the powers that be have all the Chuztpa in the world to make us remodel the store AGAIN! Shouldn't we be paying our attention to the customer? I'm quiting the company soon simple because the idiots in higher places are freakin out about there pay and pushing everyone below them to work outragously hard, hold ridiculous expectations of themselves and their people. But, let me tell you, if you need the stuff we sell, you can't get it anywhere else! And the deals on phones and dishes are the sh*t.
