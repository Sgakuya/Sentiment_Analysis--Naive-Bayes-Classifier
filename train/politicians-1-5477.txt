Kerry, so very scary. This man is running [only] on his war record (of more than 30 years ago), yet shortly after the war ended, he condemned that very same war. What has he been doing for the last 20+ years (besides gold-digging and marrying heiresses)? And why are the taxpayers of Massachussetts paying him for not showing up to work 76% of the time??? If I missed work that often, I think I'd be canned! And one more thing: like his running mate, John Edwards, he claims to be the candidate for the lower and middle class -- I think neither really knows what it's like to be lower or middle class American. I think none of us (even the devoted liberals and Democrats) knows the real John Kerry. He's all about $$$ and his own ego and fantasy.
