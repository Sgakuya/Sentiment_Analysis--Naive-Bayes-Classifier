I personally don't believe the picture of the villainous tyrant which Shakespeare so vividly paints. Rather, Richard was actually rather benevolent for the time. The last Yorkist king (and the final monarch before the foundation of the Tudor dynasty which ended the wars of the roses) Richard established legal aid for the poor and also reformed the legal system in such a manner that the common man could better defend himself (meaning, he had all trials standardized in English). It's also true that Richard was very brave on the battlefield, at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 he died cutting down Lancastrian soldiers, merely metres away from his fleeing rival Henry who he intended to duel in single combat. Henry, being an honorable man, had Richard's naked and mutilated body displayed in the capitol before (Having realized Richard had a more credible claim to the throne then him) initiating an epic Tudor smear campaign that ultimately turned the relatively popular Richard into the hunch-backed stage villian we know today. If one checks into the records of those who had personal correspondence with the king, there isn't even any evidence he had a hunched back! Ever more proof for the old adage: History is written by the winners.
