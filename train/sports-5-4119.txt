Saying that Diddle did never achieved national prominence is just ignorant. His legacy suffers because Western Kentucky slipped to mid-major status in the 1970s and most sports writers and fans don't know their history. Diddle's WK was the first school from Kentucky to be invited to the NCAA tournament and the NIT (this was in the days when only 8 teams were invited to each tournament - so you had to be highly respected just to get an invitation). Before there even was an NIT or NCAA WK was invited to represent the South in the 1936 National Olympics. He took his team to 3 NIT final fours, including the 1942 title game, in the days when the NIT was superior or on par to the NCAA. At the time of his retirement in 1964 he was the winningest coach in college basketball history. He took a small town college and turned it into a national power on a limited budget. In short he is the finest coach the state of Kentucky has ever produced.
