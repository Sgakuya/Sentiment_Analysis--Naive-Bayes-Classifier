Any coach that has kept a clean program at UK for nearly 10 yrs is a great coach.Him not doing like Pitino,Sutton,Hall,and Rupp did is a testament to his great character & integrity.After all, how can any true UK fan bash Tubby when he is 1 for 1 in F4 appearances,while Pitino is 1 for 5 in his F4 appearances.I guess if Tubby made it back to the F4 & did'nt win the title he'd be doing what the great Pitino has done.I still see F4 banners hanging beside 7 NCAA titles in Rupp Arena in2005.Support your coach fans,he's gonna need it the next decade after the Heels 4ever this time pass uk in NCAA titles & wins.You don't hath to worry about F4 banners.UNC 16 UK 13 head to head UNC 18 to 10.Tarheels rule!!!!!!!!!!
