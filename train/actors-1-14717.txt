The movie Selena is what made Jennifer Lopez famous. After making that movie she told everybody she could sing as well as act and then released her God-awful, ear wrenching album. Uuuhm, sorry J-HO, you can't act AND you can't sing. Anyone who told you that lied through their teeth! The major reason she got the part in Selena was because she fit perfectly in her clothes, other than that, she could NEVER compare. Selena had talent which J-HO greatly lacks. She has a nice body, yes, but her ass isn't going to stay up forever... it's a little thing called gravity. Bottom line is that she's a terrible actress and an even more horrible singer and she needs to stop.
