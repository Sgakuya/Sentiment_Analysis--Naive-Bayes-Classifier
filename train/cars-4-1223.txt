I currently own a 1998 Corolla LE.. my first Corolla was a 1992. Previously I owned a Tercel. I do a lot of driving for my work.. so, I do push these cars pretty hard. For the most part, I have been happy with my Toyotas, however, I have not been as happy with my 98 Corolla. It drives beautifully.. but the interior seems to be poorly made and designed. For instance, the utility door beneath the radio on the dashboard broke off its hinge within a few months of my purchasing the vehicle. The hinge is just plastic and obviously not strong enough to withstand normal use.. The design of the cup holder is also poor.. It claims to be able to hold different size cups, but it is too large for soda cans, which spill unless one has a can on each side. I also had the car heater fan fail before the car hit its first 30K miles.. very disappointing.
