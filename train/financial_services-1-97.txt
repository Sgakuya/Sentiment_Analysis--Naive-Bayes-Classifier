I was a minor when I got my debit card, so my moms account was attatched and she had a copy of my card. Well the cards got mixed up and she was using mine for about a week. Since I only had about 50 in my account it all overdrafted into her account and we never even got a call! Over a week period! She paid the overdraft fees because, well it was a mixup, nothing they could do about that but they should have called us to tell her that her daughter was draining her account! I am now 19 and I have requested a new card several times and have not received one. The one I have now I can only take out 100 a day so its hard to buy textbooks and things like that. I am switching banks and suggesting to my mom that she does the same. The only thing I like about wells fargo is being able to go online and make sure they arent screwing up my account like they do everyone elses.
