I have lived in most all Hot Major cities ,other than LA (but I visted there every summer for 8 years) I was shocked at how much I adore the South. Atlanta is a huge mix, they have a huge Hip- Hop Ind. here as well as Country Music. You have everything from Punks hanging in Little 5, to deluxe homes , tons of celebrities live there, an extreme amount of celebrities live here. You cant go clubbing without running into someone. Hell , I was in Fayettville ( 40 minutes south of atlanta) and ran into Dre from Outcast. I must say , he is an absolute pleasure in real life. A sweet guy. I've ran into Chili from TLC 3 different times at Lenox> Elton John hangs out in Downtown, Evander Holyfield runs up and down his street for exercize, which his home is on a major street with no gate access. ( His home is gated) I seen Webster at Hooters. Anyone who plans to move to Atlanta, this is the only things that I can tell you.1. Leave the chip on your shoulder somewhere else. People down here WANT to ne nice they WANT to help and be friendly. 2. Dont be paraniod, if you spill your purse and some big 250 pound man wants to help you pick up your stuff. He is not out to harm you.3 keep a book in your car, Traffic is HEAVY( more proof that its a great city) I love this place, so much that my job offered to transfer me back to Dallas, Texas with a 20,000 a year raise. I said Hell No I am here to stay.
