THE MOST OVERRATED manager in baseball. Lifetime winning percentage (as manager) ranks 37th, just BEHIND the beloved White Rat. Any manager/team can rack up the wins if they've been around long enough. If Dusty hadn't become the Cubs manager, Tony LaRussa would have been a natural fit for a team that is in the top ten in wins, but has not won a World Series in 95 years. Unfortunately for the Cardinals and their fans, LaRussa has said he will return for the 2004 season. I can not recall a manager who has had so many talented teams, yet finds ways to submarine his teams' World Series aspirations. I contend that the Cardinals win in spite of Tony LaRussa, not because of his managerial skills.
