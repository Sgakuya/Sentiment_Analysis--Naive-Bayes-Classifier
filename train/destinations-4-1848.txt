I love my country. I love the ideas that it was based upon. Although most of those ideas are but a whisper nowadays, I do not waiver in my patroitism. I do think we are a country who is weakening ourselves by not raising our children with honor and dicipline anymore. Our Mothers have gone to work to try to be something else. Our young men have little honor any more. Our young women care more about there power and there image more than raising good children. Our attempts to try to appease all of our racial groups who feel victimized has become ridiculous!! I want to say that America is a country of equals. That means we all should do our own thing. It means you dont have any excuses for being an underachiever, whether you be black red white Jew, hispanic or anything else. White America does not owe anybody anything. Black America does not owe anybody anything. We are all on our own! Any other way of thinking is choking our freedom, choking our freedom of speech and is turning us into paranoid robots who are called ignorant just for having our own minds. I just hope that something will bring us back together soon. I fear it might take something really bad to make it happen. But I still have faith in our people as a whole. We just have become too self absorbed to remember what America was supposed to be. God Bless America.
