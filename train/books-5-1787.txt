This strip is great. The storylines are addictive, and full of real-life Drama. Sometimes, when a threat is going on against one of the characters, I find myself worrying about him/her until a resolution is published. The author takes risks. How many other comics have dared to tackle a serious take on homosexuality, and have it published in mainstream media? Even so, there is plenty of humor in the strips, even if the more recent ones have had more serious content than humorous, the humor's never been completely lost. And, the characters age, and grow as people, living their own lives, making their own choices. When my favorite online comics website quit carrying FBOFW, I almost quit going there altogether.. instead, I searched the internet until I found the best online resource of FBOFW comics.. the authors own website.
