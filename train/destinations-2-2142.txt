South Korea is a country that has lost their identity. I lived here in the 1970's and actually had a better experience then than I did now. I am primarily living here because my wife is Korean, and she spend far too many years chasing me around the world, so I feel like I 'owe' her a few years. But I live, work, and play on the American post - and have no urge to live any other way. It's not that I inherently dislike Koreans - it is just that the language and the culture are too different. Along with that, with the industrial transformation of the country since the Olympics, the entire country has 'lost it's soul' to the West, picking up all the very bad habits of the West - especially the run away greed, rudeness, crassness and egocentrism - and none of the good qualities such as willingness to give, acceptance of others, etc. I have found them always to be somewhat suspicious of foreigners, but with all of the other bad qualities that 'Westernizing' the culture brings, most Koreans are not afraid to let you know what they think of foreigners these days, especially Americans. If you have a real, real sense of adventure, you might find this a OK or even fun place. But if you are trying to live or work here, the excessive drinking culture, the dislike and disrespect and rude treatment of foreigners, their weird ways of doing business, and the excessive crowding of the cities (especially Seoul) wear you down. I'm lucky - I can escape to the 'American Island' of the US militay post (and it is NOT an 'American ghetto' - if it was then why do all the rich Koreans try and get a pass?). Unfortunately, most of my expat collegues do not have the same privileges - so they stay as long as they can, drown out their stess in Itaewon, and then finally go home when they can't take it anymore. And that's some of why South Korea fares so poorly on RateItAll.
