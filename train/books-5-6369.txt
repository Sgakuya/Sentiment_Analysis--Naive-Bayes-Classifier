i just have to laugh at some of the comments you people make about this woman. you say she is hateful, mean and evil, yet you call her a hag and a wh*re,and a bimbo. real mature, huh? none of you have any intelligent argument against her. i know what she says may seem a bit harsh but its the truth like it or not. she has to be the feisty, in your face republican, because there are so many republicans that feel the same way but dont have the courage to say it for fear of ridicule. I bet all of you feel so smart using big words like fascism, huh? Come up with a reason as to why this woman isn't intelligent, well-spoken and well read and i'll give you a purple heart that you deserve alomost as much as John"flip-flop" Kerry. This woman is a real breath of fresh air, and if you liberals don't like her? Good, hate is a waste if you're not hated back.
