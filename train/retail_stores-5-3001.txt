I think it depends on the store that you shop at. I have recently been shopping at a local Kay in Portage, MI. The sales people there are great. They work with the price range you are looking for and go above and beyond. My fiance purchased my engagement ring from Helzburg (big mistake, never go there) and have had nothing but problems with it. The people at Kay offered to fix my ring and even to go over to Helzburg with us to try and help us get decent service for a change. We will shop at Kay from Now on. Our wedding bands are picked out and were more beautiful that we could have imagined and still in our price range. IF YOU WANT EXCELLENT SERVICE, GO TO KAY!
