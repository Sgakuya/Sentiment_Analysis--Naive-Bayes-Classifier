 Cats and Dogs perpetuates the popular myth that dogs are always good and cats are always bad. As a person who has kept both cats and dogs as pets for much of my life, and has found traits to love in both animals, I find that both untrue and even slightly offensive. Sure, my cat appeared sneaky and conniving why - because she was born that way she meant no harm by it. She was simply smart enough and patient enough to figure out which of my buttons to push to get what she wanted. My dogs, on the other hand, always took the more forward approach stare me down with the big limpid brown eyes, whine, or roll over on their backs and go for an all out beg-a-thon. Either way they re just trying to survive and you have to respect that. I do, and even with that slight fault, I still enjoyed this combination live/computer-animated feature. It had a lot of very cute points and though it wasn t quite on the same level as Shrek it also had some nice detail. I wasn t really sure why they cast Jeff Goldblum in his part as the father though I guess when you re looking for an oddball he doesn t make a bad choice. Overall, this is another nice family film with nothing to truly offend or write home about. An enjoyable inoffensive hour and a half something I dare you to try and eke out of three back to back sitcoms.
