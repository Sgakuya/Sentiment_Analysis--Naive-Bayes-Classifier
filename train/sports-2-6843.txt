A better GM than a lot of guys there, but he's a liability that will soon be fired. He's made a lot of silly and amateur decisions, which include among them firing Rick Carlisle and selected Darko Milicic with the number 2 pick in the draft. There was also the Mateen Cleaves debacle earlier. Dumars has gotten lucky so far with his pick of Rick Carlisle, who proved an exceptional coach, especially with a team of scrubs. However, firing him, regardless of whether or not his personality clashed with the team, has arguably sent this team on a downslide. Ignore the fact that the Pistons won a championship last season; the trade that sent Rasheed here saved this team, as it noticeably began a terrible losing streak before then. Now that Rasheed has his contract and no longer feels the need to play hard, Carlisle's system that Brown is riding off of is slowing beginning to show it's age. The Pistons are really playing terribly following last year's epic win, and I can't say I'm surprised. I've been flamed at RealGM over this topic, but it's true; Dumars will be exposed soon and fired. He's caught a lot of lucky breaks, but sooner or later his problems will destroy his team. Anyone who credits the championship to him better look elsewhere, otherwise the coach of Indiana. Too bad the ungrateful hacks on the Pistons can't realize that. Oh yeah, Joe D., your coach hates Darko, trade him and end the nonsense!
