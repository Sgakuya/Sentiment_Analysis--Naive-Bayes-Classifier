Though not as physically gifted as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, in my book, goes down as the greatest basketball player of all time. Controlled the ball better than anybody (without the carrying that is so prevalent in today's game), and ran the game like a second coach. While not possessing a Bird-like jumper, Magic's ability to hit a clutch shot during the course of a game was uncanny. Those who know basketball know that a timely 3 pointer can mean the difference in a game. His ability to incorporate all of his teammates and get the most out of them is a tribute to his unselfishness as well as his understanding of the game. He was awarded the finals MVP award his rookie year, repeating the accomplishment twice, playing all five positions (yes, even center). His versatility, knowledge, and sheer joy of playing the game really outshined his monumental accomplishments. It was the man and his approach to basketball that puts him atop the greats.
