Unfortunitally I currently work at UsBank in the credit card division. I HATE it! Not only is USB horrid to their employees, they are also horrid to their secruity guards. They are more concerned about who they're screwing and the art work than their employees being safe. I have a credit acct with them that is $235 over the limit all because I paid my acct FOUR days before the due date and they didn't post it until the day AFTER it was due! As an employee I do feel bad for our customer and the things we are told to tell them. Its not right and I'm out as soon as I can be! I love helping customers and I always try to do everything that I can for them, to the best that I can.
