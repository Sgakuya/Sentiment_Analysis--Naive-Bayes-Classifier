Want to play something both simple & fun, aside from the more complex board games (Monopoly, Trivia Pursuit, Chess, etc.)? Somewhere in a local store, there is bound to be a rectangle shaped box containing a foldable board with 64 squares (red and black) in a checker pattern, along with 24 (same colors as board) pieces under the name checker. If you find this box, then congratulations! You just found Checkers, where patience is queen and anybody can be king. In the game of Checkers, you start off with a group of 24 men, checks, draughts, or simply checkers. Your pieces must defeat the other halfs group of 24 through the power of jumping. If one or the others piece reaches the other side, that piece is crowned king, which means you can move that piece in any direction of the board. With a little strategy in mind and as always in Checkers, patience, I assure you fun and success down (up, left, right) the board of squares.
