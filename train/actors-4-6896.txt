Read through all the comments about Arnold and have a few things to say...the worst actor in the world is not Arnold; it's Tony Danza. Yes, Arnold's had some bad movies; who hasn't? I really thing there's some jealous people out there who don't understand nor appreciate Arnold's accomplishments. To be the best bodybuilder in the world, is an almost impossible task. He was the best SEVEN times as Mr. Olympia. This man's desire for challenges and success is hard to measure. Now, it is possible he will start paying for steroid use during his career. But, let's think about this: he used them to enhance his athletic performance. Not to get high, not to profit from the sale of the drug to others and he sure as hell didn't get rich by producing it. I don't see how steroid use can be viewed as cheating when every professional bodybuilder in the world uses them. This is a man of great accomplishments in spite of his shortcomings. That means he's human, folks. I also venture to guess most of you don't know the charity work he's done for many years. This guy is a legend and a decent person. If you don't like his movies, don't go but don't drag him down to your jealous level. 'Enuff said.
