Some people say that he has no talent and that all the publicity is based on his looks. I wish that some could see the talent that I see in him. He's been in many different movies and he's expressed himself in many different ways. Yes the last few movies have not been so great but if you looked as some of his older films like This Boy's Life , What's Eating Gilbert Grape , and The Basketball Diaries , you'd see that he has some amazing talent. Those who say he plays the same character over and over must be blind. Yes, his looks have got him far, but those who only like him for his looks need to go further and actually see some of the films he's been in. He's a wonderful actor, and no matter how much you trash him, he will always be a great actor.
