I have very specific thoughts about this chain. Find the one that is the busiest. Ask one of the employees which one sells the most in town. Go to that one and you'll find the best meat and produce. Things are more organized. I learned this after living next to the largest one (claimed they sold twice as much as the next higher one) and moved to an area with just an average Albertsons. I didn't even need to experience it, all the neighbors hated it. It took me about a year to find out that they were right. Also, I swear the prices were higher. Maybe not, but the 2 liter soft drinks never seemed to have the .99 in store special. Of course today, with the fuel so high, I don't think we'll see many sales of Coke and Pepsi products in the 99 cent range again. If they build a Super Target near you, don't miss shopping there. The best quality meats and produce. The Deli has better products too. It's a little more expensive but not a "lot" more expensive.
