This is the most overlooked state in the country. Yes it's small, but it has everything you need and more. Wilmington is changing into a Northeast destination and the beaches are great. Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Fenwick Isalnd, Lewes and Bethany Beach are all great. Old New Castle is beautiful. There are a lot of nice places to eat and hang out in Wilmington and Newark. Newark has a nice main street with outdoor eateries and some historic bars. Don't let Delaware's size keep you from coming. It is a great place to live and vacation. I've lived all over the world (Hawaii, Ohio, Illinois, Alabama, the Philippines, New Jersey and Virginia) and I would have to say next to Hawaii, Delaware is my next favorite place I've lived.
