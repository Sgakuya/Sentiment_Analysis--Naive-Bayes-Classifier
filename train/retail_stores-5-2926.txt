I have bought several Expensive [ieces from Zale and I absolutely love it there I have my own Jewler there that I can talk to at any time. I always get messages on my machines when the best sales are going on so I know when to shop. Every time I go in there my ring is always ckecked and cleaned they take good care of all of my jewlery I even had a special diamond ring for my husband they did a great job i have yet to have any problems with the any purchases that I have made there. In Daytona Beach there is a great Zale ask for Craig he will help you with any of your jewelery needs and if you have any questions about any thing that you have bought any where else he helps with that too. I have learned that if it sounds to good to be true than it probably is. They keep their prices at the standard for the cut and clarity. It is a great store.
