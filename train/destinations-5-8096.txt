I visited this museum many years after I moved to Houston. I never realized we had a place like this. Its a truly harrowing walk through a particularly dismal chapter of human history. That any human could inflict such atrocities upon another human is practically beyond my comprehension. It would be tragic, however, to ignore the facts portrayed by the wealth of photographic images and documents in this place. What is equally horrific is the fact that in some places even now (Southeast Europe, Central Africa), people still engage in the insane practice of ethnic cleansing. Who in God's name can actually justify that, and not come off sounding like a hateful maniac?! My visit to the Holocaust Museum made me want to cry... I highly recommend it to anyone needing a reality-check. (They should build one of these in Jackson, Mississippi to remind all those die-hard, heritage -embracing red-necks why America must continue to vigorously enforce her own civil rights legislation. There, but for the Grace of God, might we have gone had the United States Government not prevailed against the renegade southern states 136 years ago!)
