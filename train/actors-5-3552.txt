I cannot believe that Ed Harris is this far down the list (#48 as I type). Harris is one of the finest actors working today, and apparently one of the most underrated. His small role in Enemy at the Gates is a great example of his appeal and talent. He played a Nazi officer who proves to be what you would expect from a Nazi officer, but he never takes it over the top. He makes you see things from his charecters perspective, and while it falls short of being sympathetic to the Nazis, you understand that to this officer he is doing his job. The Truman Show is another example of taking the part of the bad guy and making him human. It was an understated performace, which is exactly what the role needed in my opinion. He could have played it as a mad man, twisting knobs and playing God. Instead, he was more of a father figure, albeit an overprotective, controlling father. One role that I think is over looked is his part in The Rock. Harris brings depth and sympathy to his charecter that is not often seen in action movies. It might well be his best role. Excellent actor, and deserves to be higher on the list.
