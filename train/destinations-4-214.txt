Considering this city was flattened in WW2 the '50's feel to the place is not altogether surprising. In my opinion, the whole reason to go there is to visit the Peace Memorial Museum, a comprehensive exhibit depicting the before and after of the dropping of the atomic bomb. The objective manner in which the material is displayed only enhances the impact on the visitor, and I, a hardened realist, left with tears in my eyes, which again, well up as I write this. Allow more time to explore than you would expect to need. My only other 'tour' was to nearby Miyajima Island - as far removed from war as you could possibly imagine. Ancient shrines dot this island and a peaceful atmosphere pervades the place. Tame deer walk about all over, and there are some wonderful craft shops in the tiny village. Again, allow much longer than you would expect to need.
