I would rate Paul Martin as one of the biggest assholes in Canadian politics. Of course, he's not the only one in this category but these comments are not meant to be encyclopedic. The Liberals,in general, seem to be especially adept at taking advantage of the screw-ups of the other parties and making this work for them in the public arena. When the neo-conmen under Mulroney in Canada and Reagan in the United States nearly deep-sixed the North American economy (through massive tax transfers from the middle class towards the top , the so-called trickle-down theory )the parties that eventually replaced them could then use the excuse of fiscal need as a way to attack the social safety net. Paul Martin as finance minister and now as PM, was and is, the master and commander of the look at the mess the other guys made game. And it seems to work even after three terms for these characters. Now that's real PR!! Consider one example; our system of semi-socialized medicine is more effective and efficient then the mainly private system developed in the US. Off-loading this to the private sector,or in some cases leaving people to suffer, is not efficient even in a monetary sense, but like GDP figures it looks good on paper. That's Martin in a nutshell.
