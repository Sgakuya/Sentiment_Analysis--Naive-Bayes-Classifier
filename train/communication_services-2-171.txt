Verizon Wireless has decent coverage - that's the good news. They're customer service is a 0.5, the only one lower is Nextel. They just put me on a 2-year contract without my knowledge. I received no new phone, I simply changed my plan, but I distinctly made it clear I didn't want a 2-year contract. I tried to reduce the paln to a Loyalty plan of $15 or $20, but they said the only way I could get it was with another 2 year contract. They don't get it. Customer NO Service only drives people away. I will no longer be a VZW customer because of their arrogance, uncaring and outright deceptive practices. UNHAPPY WITH VZW!!!
