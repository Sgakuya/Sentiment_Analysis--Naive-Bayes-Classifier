Very OVERRATED! She is a white lady. She looks white. If she was SOO interested in being black she wouldn't have gotten a nose job to make her nose smaller. She really plays both ends perfectly. She looks white so whites love her but claims to be black so she can get love from the black community. She should just accept the fact that she is biracial and stop taking the glory from real BLACK women who may not look white, but are just as beautiful and talented as she is. There are a lot of women who are prettier, but she just got that label and it stuck. Exotic women like Rachael on BET, Salma Hayek, girls in some videos, Shakira (singer) Sharkara(Model) are all beautiful. I am tired of Halle Berry. NEXT.
