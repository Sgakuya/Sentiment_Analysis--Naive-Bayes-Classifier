I live in the deep South, so we have no In/Out Burgers here. When I travel to northern California, it is my number one food stop. I can afford to eat any where, but I always enjoy the clean,friendly and well run restaurant chain. Clearly, they are not run by some corporate America know it alls. They simply stick to what got them there and should serve as a role model for all that it can be done and priced right day in and day out. I wish them the best as I understand how hard it is to pull this off, as I once was a Division Manager for 7-11 for some 300 stores with over 3000 employees. Gillis Hill - Baton Rouge, La. 70815
