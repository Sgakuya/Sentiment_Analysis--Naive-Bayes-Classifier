Just wanted everyone to know that Move plus, located in San Diego, CA is the worst moving company. Very dishonest, scam artists, and rude. They gave me a quote for $1500.00, by the time they showed up it went up to almost $4000. Bye the way, this was for a 1 bedroom apt. Free storage--- that's a lie too. After i refused to pay the new amt. and I cancelled the move they left my apt. in complete disarray and took one of my sofa cushions and refused to return it. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE UNPROFESSIONAL, BY FAR THE MOST DISHONEST AND OVERALL BAD NEWS. IF I COULD GIVE THEM 0 STARS I WOULD. SHAME ON YOU MOVE PLUS.
