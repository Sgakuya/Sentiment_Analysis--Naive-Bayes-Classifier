My Wife and myself orderer with Papa Johns online this evening (or as we have begun referring to it lately it Poo Poo John's Incompentance). The order was for a veggi Pizza with two 2 liter bottles of DIET coke NOT regular coke. Order showes up with the pizza all ok but the arrogant little thought he knew it all Smuck brought two 2 liter bottles of regular coke. I told him that was not what I wanted or ordered in the beverage department because of health reasons. He offered to give us $2.00 to make up for the $4.00 goof they made on the screwed up soda order after we told him we could not drink regular. And it clearly showes on the order form I pulled back up later that I HAD placed orders for two 2liter diet cokes. He offered to go back to the store and bring back Diet Coke and I told him since I had already charged all on my Pa Pa Johns card and by the time he went back to the store credited my Pa Pa Johns card and returned, it was not worth it to us as the Pizza would most likely be cold when he returned, and after all this He got a $5.00 gratuity on my Pa Pa Johns card on a $22.27 =/- order. I sent him back with regular Coke and told him to give them to the needed. Because we were tired could not and do not drink Regular Coke and did not want to spent half the evening adjusting the sale. I was so furious I lost my appitite threw the Pizza in the trash. Next I called the store manager, I tell him the story portrays himself as a very arrogant person himself. I tried to explain to him what happened but he was ratteling on as if he did not care or want to listen, he was also very rude, I told him I guess I would be doing all my busuiness with Dominos' Pizza from now on. He then started giving me a smart ass laugh and before I had chance to tell him that is bad business mannars needing improvement as a store Mgr. and I did not appreciate him laughing at my valid complaint over their goofs and there overall smart ass attude toward thier customers he hung up. I called Clark back (the store mgr.) and he started laughing and wound not want to listen to me over a valid issue and hung up again. There was, in this case however, an underminded toung cheak appology that was more sarcastic than any sort of meaningfull appology. I WILL NEVER EAT NOR ADVISW OTHER The store in question is Papa John's 5814 Oleander Dr. Ste. 1, Wilmington, NC store Phone (910)392-3310 I did find that their customer service at headquaeters was very understanding and was trying his best to look into and rectify the situation. . Oh, one other tid bit about the delivery guy. He gave us a dirty smuck head look over somthing that was his fault never really appologized about anything and went tearing out of our driveway, I hope he didn't damage any of the sprinkler heads in the process, beleive you me if that happened, Poo Poo Johns Pizza is going to repair that and any sod damaged not to mention the fack he never really apollogized for the goof about the regular Coke being delivered instead of Diet as is clearly stated on the computer printout it was clearly mentioned in the internet receipt. Now it gets even better when I call the manager of the store to file a complaint, I also followed up with a complaint to their headquarters who was slighyly more concerned than the delivery guy or store Mgr was. The manager at the local store would not talk back to me had no excuses or any real appologizes (did however offer to send the diet coke which gets back to the Pizza is going to be cold by them. He ratteled of a few words and I told him I guess I would take my future business to Dominos. He then comes back with a sh**y chuckle and hung up with out so much as saying we hate to loose your business or we're sorry please give us another chance. In a scence I'm his boss and pay his salary in a small way that can add up quite a bit when bonus time roles around. I called him back informed him that his attitude was very non business like and that in my business If I cought my manager, assistant manager or any other of my employees relating to customers or potential customers in that fashion in my business I would give them about 30 mins to gather up their personal belongings give them any severance pay they might be due and send them out the door.
