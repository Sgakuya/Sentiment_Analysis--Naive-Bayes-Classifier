Fun quick moving game that you should try some time. Here's the basic layout. Min 2 players (no real fun though with only two) Players all have 4 cards in their hand Spoons in the middle of the table equal to # of players -1. (like musical chairs) OBJECT Lead person picks from the main pile of cards and chooses whether to keep the card or swap it for one that is already in his hand. The chosen card goes to the person left of him who in turn makes the same decision and then passes the card he cooses to keep to the person left of him. This goes on until ONE of the players has a 4 of a kind and when he does he picks up a spoon. And when that happens everyone is suppose to pick up the spoons. The person who's left without a spoon is loses or is scored against. Simple concept that can be suprisingly fun.
