I have a 1994 Honda Accord EX and I purchased it with 44K miles and it now has 192,500 miles. I've only had one timing belt replaced at 90K miles and I get oil changes every 3K-5K miles. My car keeps going and going and going like the Energizer bunny. It gives me no trouble at all and the man at the Honda dealership said it is just kicking in. I plan to drive it until it doesn't drive any more. I love not having a car payment and I love the fact that it still looks good. My car payment money now goes into my 401K plan for the past 3 years! The only problem I can say is the A/C doesn't work as well as I'd like, but it does the job okay. I read about the A/C problems before purchasing the car in the Consumer Reports Buying Guide, which everyone should check before purchasing a car or anything major. I swear by Honda's. This is my 2nd Accord in 11 years. HONDA ROCKS!!!!
