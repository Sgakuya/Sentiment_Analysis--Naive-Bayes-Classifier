Look I am here to say what you all need to hear. The Job as president of the United Sataes of America is not an easy one I would think. All your life you work to this goal to better your nation, and once you get there they bring out all the bad things you have done to slander you. No matter how good you are they still find things. Look at Clinton he was critisizes for many things from having the Chinese embasator sleep in the lincoln bedroom at the white house and the sale of seacrets. But what will he be rememmberd for the Monica insident. Not the good he did like market and jobs. George W. is a great American yes he has had his shares of incodents and Yes there is a lot of people say that he got us into this war for oil, "laugh" could of fooled me look at your Damn gass prices if we were after only the oil by now we would have had oil prices drop a lot. Do we all have Problems yes we do You would not be any better than him. For you that call him a TERRORISTS for you that live in the US you should feel bad for even saying that. Yes we did go to war to remove a dictator and yes we did it under a thought of wepons of mass destruction. I we did not watch this guy he would of had them if he could of, you know this deep down he slayed his owne people. In that part of the world we need and a friend and if we help them many other countries may fallow. War sucks many friends of mine are over there and 2 of them gave there life to help those people. So to call Bush a Terrorist you now call the troops Terrorist and even the USA a Terrorist Sate. This makes you who live in American a Terrorsst too. So shut your mouth and if you dont like the contry and its leadership you run for office and do something about it just do sit here on the net BITCHING about it! Also if you cant support the USA GET THE HELL OUT! France would probly love to have you...
