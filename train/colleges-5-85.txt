There is an intensity about Darden and it is focused on returning to every student and alumnus the highest possible return on their considerable investment in a graduate business school. We evaluate Darden and the quality of our programs by the degree of lifelong professional support and value we deliver to graduates. We cannot put our mission more succinctly than did one such graduate, a well respected FORTUNE 50 CEO, who says, Darden hardwires you for success.
