It's a rare treat in cinema when a natural talent emerges from the depths of tired, saturated ditzy T A spread far and wide across the entertainment industry. It's a rare treat to feel especially moved by an artist's performance. I was moved with LEON. I was moved with BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. I was moved with HEAT. I laughed, bubbled like champagne with EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU. A sci-fi fan, I thouroughly enjoyed MARS ATTACKS! -I cannot say I enjoyed ANYWHERE BUT HERE or WHERE THE HEART IS much. I don't enjoy soap-opera dramas which I think these two latter films were. I will always remember Natalie Portman as Mathilda. STAR WARS was alright but. . . well, at least I have oodles of Natalie Portman toys. +++ I run a gallery of surreal Natalie Portman art at http://wmegiwf.virtualave.net +++++ I think you'll enjoy it. Please visit my garden. ...follow your eyes...
