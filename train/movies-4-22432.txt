Now that I've seen Episode II, I understand why the critical reviews are all over the board, with USA Today, for instance, giving it 3 1/2 stars while other papers trash it. It's all about why you're going to see the movie in the first place. If you're looking for sharp, original dialogue and good acting, you're going to be very disappointed. The acting is wooden and there are several lines (especially in the romantic sub-plot between Anakin and Amidala) that are so goofy they'll make you cringe. But if you're looking for great special effects, a lot of light saber battles (including one with Yoda), and the typical Star Wars storyline, you're going to enjoy the movie. There are some worth-the-price-of-the-ticket action scenes, including a great high-speed chase scene near the beginning and a huge battle scene at the end. I should probably mention, though, that I'm biased. I was 7 when the original Star Wars came out, and the initial three movies were a big part of my childhood. I can't hear the music and see A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away without getting chills. And on top of that I'm in love with Natalie Portman, so even if she's forced to say terrible lines I still like seeing her on the screen. Episode II isn't a great movie, but it does its job of setting up Episode III, and - if you even remotely enjoy fantasy/sci-fi movies - it's worth seeing.
