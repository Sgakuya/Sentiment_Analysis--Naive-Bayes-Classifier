If you ever watch TV in Rochester,then you have proably seen the corny commercail with the slogan Rochester, Made for Living It is very true! Rochester is an ideal place to live in many ways. It would be quite a challenge to find an area with more a sense of community, culture, history, and family than Rochester. It is a very friendly place, and it is rated one of the least stressfull cities in america. It has unfortunetly come to a time in america where for the most part you either have to choose between a city with a great sense of community, history and family, but that has economic problems; or choose a city that is very well of economicaly, but is a generic, prefabrocated system of interlocking suburbs where everyone is mean. In this sense, unless you can afford to live in a city like New York, Boston, or Chicago, you can't really have a city that is very well off in economics, and has a nice community feel about it. So Greater rochester in this case, is a wonderful medium. Like i said, it has a great sense of community and history, and while it doesnt have a booming economy, it is a little above average, the unemployment rate is exactly at the national average, and its population goes up my just a little bit ever year.I left rochester for 9 years, in the south (north crapolina ) I have to say, i would take the 70-90 inches of snow that rochester gets any day, rather than have the hurricanes, unimaginable heat and humidity, and severe storms/tornadoes that you get in the south, and the earthquakes, firestorms, and brown air of california. i am very happy to be coming back to rochester now and will never make the mistake of leaving ever again!!!!!
