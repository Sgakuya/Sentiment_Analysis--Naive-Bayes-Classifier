Ilove Hillary Clinton, the women is attractive, admirable, and a gifted politician and it would not be morally wrong should Hillary have the love and comfort of a man who would can be trusted. If it was possible for me to see Hillary, I would love to be that man. If Hillary had any honor and self respect she would not touch her husband with a ten foot pole. I can understand the marriage being a matter of convienence, but any man who has so many multiple sexual encounters is endangering his wife with a gentital disease, and his persistent unfaithfulness should keep him in a permenant dog house. All bets are off if Hillary again shares the same bed with her licentious husband!-- A woman has to be awfully jaded to forgive a man who has caused her so much shame and disrespect.
