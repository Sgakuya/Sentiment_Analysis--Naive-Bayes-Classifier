Since a fellow reviewer contrasted Bob Hillman with John Mayer, I'll put my two cents in as well. While axirod2003 claims that Hillman is better than Mayer, I believe that Hillman's songs are very Mayer-esque (and that's a good thing), but would be better if Mayer sang them. Hillman's voice is worse than mine- and I don't sing. Ever. As for Mayer's Room For Squares, it is quite a versatile collection, ranging from the slow, melodic St. Patrick's Day to the fast-paced No Such Thing , the anchor track in terms of airplay. In between, however, are some real gems: My Stupid Mouth , the fascinatingly new sound of 3x5 , and the quaint reminescence of 83 . Sadly, though, Mayer inserts some duds as well, which prevents me from giving him the full five stars: City Love is slow and boring, and Great Indoors is neither intriguing or good. Overall, though, Mayer's album is a good buy, and far superior to Hillman's Welcome to My Century .
