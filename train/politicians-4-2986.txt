Have any of you actually followed his politics? I agree that he comes off as a goofball, but I work in the MN capitol... in fact, I can see Jesse's car right now outside my office window... so I know what he's done politically. He's fiscally conservative, socially liberal. He is a staunch supporter of women's rights, public housing, and gun control. He prevented a number of ultra-conservative (and frightening) bills from passing the MN legislature that would have all but eliminated abortion rights, and one that would have allowed people to obtain permits to carry concealed pistols in public places! Obviously, if you're socially conservative you wouldn't agree with my rating. He has been pegged by the MN media as a bully and an idiot, and is attacked by liberals... if they'd only pay attention, they would realize that he's done them a great service during his four year term. I think he's done a fine job from a policy standpoint. The fact that no one's realized it is his own fault... and partially the fault of the media. Not until he was elected did I truly realize how much the two main political parties control our society, and our minds. That's no joke. Ventura is a questionable figurehead for the third party movement, but he's fighting the right battles. As for the XFL, if this were a sports figure rating, I'd give him a 1. :) Seriously, though. Look at what he stands for and stands against.
