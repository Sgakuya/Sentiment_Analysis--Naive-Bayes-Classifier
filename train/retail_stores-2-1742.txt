I thought I'd be nice and give them a 2 star rating...but only for their low prices. I recently graduated high school, and since I am on a pretty tight budget starting out on my own, I have really no other choice but to shop there because they are so cheap, but I do have some complaints about them. First, would it be so hard for them to get new shopping carts? They're a multi-million dollar corporation and yet whenever you get a shopping cart from there, they either have a broken wheel which causes the cart to make a loud obnoxious noise which to me is very embarassing, or they are very filthy. Second, why are the aisles so damn small? With the amount of people that shop there at any given time of day, you would think they would be bigger...but no. Instead, people have to push through other people's shopping carts, or wait ten minutes to get out of an aisle because you're stuck behind some slow a** person taking their sweet ole time, and you can't get by them cause the aisles are so small. And God forbid you get in the stock person's way while they're trying to stock the shelves. I had a stock person give me an attitude because I accidentally hit a box on the floor, am empty box on the floor actually. So I told them in a polite way that it was in the way and I didn't mean to hit it. And my last complaint is why...oh why, do the cashiers double bag a bag with two light things in it, but they don't double bag heavy things like milk or soda? I politely asked one cashier to double bag my soda, and she looked at me and was like If you want it double bagged, do it yourself. Excuse me? But who is she to tell me to double bag my stuff when she gets paid to do it? I understand working in retail sucks...but why be rude to someone when they're not being rude to you? There are times when I'm at work when I want to scream in someone's face, but I don't, because you just don't treat people like that. Sorry this is so long, I just needed to vent.
