J. Crew's catalogues and seasonal collections look the same, year after year after I've received them without fail. However, since I live in trend-conscious California, I've found that J. Crew's fashions are so terribly boring. The fabrication and the cuts of their clothing are so frumpy and look like overpreppy East Coast fashion. Their associates are also not very knowledgeable, nor are they helpful. When I enter their stores, rarely do associates say hello or even check up on me in their fitting rooms. Banana Republic has much better fashion-right fabrications and their seasonal collections carry sophisticated interpretations of modern clothing, not frumpy outdated East Coast style. I suppose it's ok to look like you stepped out on a ranch, college town or somewhere on a Virginia beach..but as far as L.A. and San Francisco fashion-aware people tend to shop, the majority really do not appear to be wearing J. Crew as much as our East Coast brethren. But as for me personally, I wouldn't direct any of my friends to shop there, unless they want to look like an outdated 80's prepster.
