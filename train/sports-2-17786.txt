This team has actually regressed from last year. They were below-average and now they're bad going terrible. Steve Spurrier has not adjusted to the role of an NFL coach very well at all. This team has paid so much for good players and have nothing to show for it. That stupid fun and gun scheme might work in college, but poor Patrick Ramsey is going to be dead before he reaches the end of the season if he doesn't get protected better. Spurrier is also responsible for letting Stephen Davis go because he didn't fit into the system. Well look now the Panthers (with Davis) are 6-2 and the sorry 'Skins are 3-5. After 8 games, Davis is 8 yards shy of 1,000 yards and Spurrier's best running back has a grand total of 295 yards!!! For crying out loud is something wrong with this picture??? Dan Snyder better send Spurrier and his 5 million per yer tab back to coaching college after this year. It doesn't matter, because the Redskins are going to suck for a long time no matter who coaches them.
