I WORK AT CHUCK E CHEESE'S IN INDIANA AND THE PLACE ALWAYS GETS GOOD COMMENTS. EVERYONE THINKS OUR PIZZA IS BAD ON THIS SITE BUT I CAN'T SEE HOW... OUR PIZZA IS NOT FROZEN... IN FACT WE GO IN AT 8:00 AM TO ROLL OUT THE DOUGH SO THAT IT IS PROOFED BY 9:00 WHEN WE OPEN... WE DO ROLL OUT 3 TIMES A DAY SOMETIMES MORE IT JUST DEPENDS ON HOW MANY PEOPLE WE HAVE COME TO OUR STORE. OUR FOOD IN INDIANA IS NOT OVER PRICED. FOR A LARGE PIZZA 4 LARGE DRINKS(FREE REFILLS) AND 100 TOKENS IS ONY 32.00 THATS NOT EXPENSIVE. ALL OF OUR GAMES ARE JUST ONE TOKEN. SO WITH 100 TOKENS YOU CAN GET A FAIRLY AMOUNT OF TICKETS... YES I ADMIT THAT THE PRIZES ARE BULL SH** BUT WHEN ITS A PLACE AIMING TOWARDS 2-12 YEAR OLDS WHAT CAN YOU REALLY EXPECT? SO URGE EVERYONE TO GO TO A CHUCK E CHEESE AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THIS TIME THEN IM SORRY AND THE PLACE WHERE YOU LIVE NEEDS SO BETTER PEOPLE WORKING THERE OR YOU JUST NEED TO FIND A CHUCK E CHEESE THAT HAS GOOD FOOD AND GOOD EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU FOR READING THIS IF YOU DID AND PLEASE RESPOND BACK... ASHLEY
