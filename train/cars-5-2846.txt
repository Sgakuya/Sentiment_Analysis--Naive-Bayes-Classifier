How can anyone not like this car? I own two of them. My 1992 Mustang LX (2.3 four cylinder engine) is driven everyday, has 130,000 miles on it, and looks and runs like brand new. It gets about 26mpg and is way quicker than your average Civic. Handles great,is very comfortable for two people, looks good, and is EXTREMELY reliable. No complaints at all. My 1999 Mustang GT convertable is my weekend warrior. You want speed? This thing blows the doors off 80% of whats on the road. Its comfortable, get LOTS of looks, handles superbly, has an excellent stereo, and most importantly is VERY FUN TO DRIVE. Its also easily modified into a serious performance machine.
