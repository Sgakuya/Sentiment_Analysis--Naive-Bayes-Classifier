Oh, yes, i love the man. He's so wonderful for my personal entertainment. Here's a man who cannot distinguish between a menstrual period and an infection , and who claims that men are driven to go out and hunt giraffes. He's also the champion of apocryphal stories - like his tale about a ten-year-old put in detention for saqying grace (which turned out to be entirely false). I don't have a problem with folks who want to be conservative, but they could at least base their opinions in verifiable fact. And speaking of which, where were all the conservatives who are STILL harping the Clinton thing when Mr. Gingrich was caught with his pants down?! He isn't one of the worst, which is why I gave him the extra star, but the main thing that I have against him is that he's a complete idiot. I'm ashamed that the man is from Georgia.
