I had unkowingly witnessed Jason Isaacs in Dragonheart and Armageddon before being completely blown away by his performance in The Patriot . Rarely do bad guys affect me. Instead, it is the quality and calibre of a performance that keeps me hanging around until the end credits to find out exactly WHO a certain actor or actress is. He was phenomenal. As an actor, he brings to the role of Colonel Tavington an incredible range of emotion exhibited so very subtly. Pay attention, Hollywood, forget Stallone Pitt. Someone out there(Emmerich Devlin) have finally recognized a master of the craft. Yes, Jason IS a master of his craft. It is a simple matter to compare his real life interviews to the diverse characters he has portrayed and realize that he truly is an actor not just someone playing the same basic role, over and over and over again. Not for Jason Isaacs will you see a Patriot Part 6 . Instead, you will see him starring in roles that are increasingly important and complex. Embrace this actor, it is high time he is recognized.
