Connery is one of my favorite actors. First of all, he's the ultimate James Bond. What a tough act for other Bonds to follow. I have nothing against Roger Moore, but he lacked Connery's perfect mix of coolness, toughness, humor, and sophistication. With the bar set so high from the very start, I can't imagine any past, current, or future actor ever really being more Bond than Connery. And how about Connery as the tough cop in Untouchables - maybe his best non-Bond role. It's getting kind of hard to watch him play an action star who hooks up with women in their 20s (e.g., Entrapment), but he can definitely pull off the role of an over-the-hill action hero who isn't what he used to be but can still teach the young guys a thing or two (e.g., The Rock).
