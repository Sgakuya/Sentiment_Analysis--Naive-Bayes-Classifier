Easily their best album, "Free Form Guitar" is an unnecessary feedback drenched experimental instrumental, but everything else works, though "Liberation" is way too long. "Poem 58," especially the second, somewhat ominous part of it is great, as is "Listen," the bluesy "South California Purples" and the hits "Questions 67 and 68," an outstanding take on the Spencer Davis hit "I'm a Man," "Beginnings," and "Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is?" They wrecked their legacy after, say, 1972, but in this period, they could play and sing very, very well, especially underrated drummer Danny Seraphine,the great guitarist Terry Kath, keyboardist/ vocalist Robert Lamm, and Peter Cetera, who at the time was a great tenor and magnificient bassist, and not a recorder of saccharine drivel that one might hear as the background music for an episode of General Hospital.
