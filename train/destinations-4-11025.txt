I have worked at this park for a total of 11 seasons and left in Dec 2004 for a full time job somewhere else. I have to admit that visually the park looks better than it ever has in my lifetime this year. The flowers, clean up and painting that went on in the last two years is paying off. Ok, things good about this park: it is huge, there are many rides for many different ages, likes etc., the atmosphere is getting better this year and there have been tons of families present. It is a must visit amusement park in my opinion. Things that are not so good: Linecutters (this is a deepseeded problem in the industry in general, it is hard to combat and hard to get rid of, hang in there when it happens, call security and be willing to follow through with your part) Waiting in lines (go on off days, try to choose days with overcast or call for rain, do not go on weekends, go the first weekend of Fright Fest if you want to attend this festival) Prices of food (this is common to the entertainment industry, easy ways to combat...bring a bag lunch and store in lockers or car ourside the gates, get a handstamp and go down the road for lunch and come back....or get the fried chicken dinner for families at Granny's, best value in the park) Some employees (the park has trouble keeping staffing levels up due to the majority of the workforce being college students who do not arrive until june and leave late August.....due to staffing levels some staff gets stressed out with busy, long days......combat this by being polite,trying to be patient and calm and realize that kid standing in front of you listening does not own the park he/she only works there) Parking lot (they redid the traffic pattern....its bad, really bad lol.....try to carpool as much as possible to save on parking fees, gas and aggrivation.)
