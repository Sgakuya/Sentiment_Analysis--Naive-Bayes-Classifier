We just visited Belize by cruise ship and were tendered far offshore. We heard that Belize City is pretty bad, but never saw for ourselves. What we did see were two charming little islands Caulkers Caye and the better know Ambergise Caye. There was no outside development that we could see....just the unassuming small buildings put up by the natives. It looked like a beach bums paradise...cheap rooms, and lots of locals to help you get to the reef (2nd largest in the world) for world class scuba diving. We saw rooms with shared bath (at the end of the hall) for $30, or you could splurge for your own in-room bath and pay $40. The rooms were small, but clean, but don't expect any amenities. Diving was just $50 per two-dive day ($40 special for you, my friend). The water is very shallow off of the islands, but drops straight down on the other side of the reef. Very 3rd world, enjoyed the stroll on sand streets, with school kids in uniforms. Hurry, we hear that the first condominium development is being subdivided. Or maybe, if you like Cancun - wait 10 years.
