Being a life long resident of West Virginia, I am hurt at all the misconceptions displayed on this web-site.This state is not predominitly poor, and uneducated as some suggest.We are not back in the woods and we do have technology in which we utilize on a daily basis. We (West Virginians) dolive in nice homes, take nice vacations, and are well educated, just like any other state,and we are not all on welfare. there is bad in every state you go to. there are ghettos in the cities, which contain crack heads, prostitutes, murderers, an abundant amount of homosexuals, and places that you can't be caught in after dark. i would much rather live here where I know I will not be car jacked, or raped just walking down the street from my home. Think about what you are saying, everything you put us down for is happining in the very state you are living in as well, except maybe the curvy roads.In conclusion, I would like to say that it is you, who are the truly ignorant ones because you obviously do not have any idea of what you're talking about when it comes to the most beloved state in the union.
