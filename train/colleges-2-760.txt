Capella University suffers the same problems that all for-profit institutions have get the money! Never mind if the University drops the ball; it seems their policy is: never admit fault, because it is always the customers fault! I tried Capella because I believed in online education, but given my experiences I would not recommend them. In the time I have been there I have seen the names on the instructions list change often, and given what Capella pays the adjunct faculty I am surprised they put up with it. It is sad when an institution is comprised of nearly 90% adjuncts. Well we can see where Capellas priorities are I guess I would not mind paying a premium tuition rate if the institution was sponsoring research, but let us face it, Capella is a meat grinding machine get them in, spit them out! From an academic point of view, the faculty is great for the most part. However, from a business point of view, they are just like any other for-profit business masquerading as an education institution. Perhaps I am cynical, but I am uncomfortable what I see coming out of the institution. Just my two cents.
