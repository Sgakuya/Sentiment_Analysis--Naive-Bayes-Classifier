I,m so glad Gore opened his eyes ,and conceded. He should have done it November 7th. Gore has mislead so many people, with his lawyers asking for recounts. Trying to make the american people believe that thousands of votes in Florida weren't counted. You can't count a vote that not there. I feel Gore would have lost no matter how many times, or ways the votes were counted.It's very obvious to me by watching the news, that many feel their vote wasn't counted. I say to them its the voters responsibility to make sure their ballot is correct before casting it. I guess thats something they didn't do. I have been a voter for 16 years, and have always made sure my punch took, and it was correct before casting it. Men and women have died for my right to vote, and I take it serious. This election is one that will go down in history. I'm very proud to know that George W. Bush is my president. I feel we will be in good hands. Bush has shown himself to be a good honest man with values. Thats something this country needs, and I will support him 100%.
