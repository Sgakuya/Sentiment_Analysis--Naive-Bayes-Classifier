Toughest player in the Game PERIOD. He has consistintly put up numbers with no one. Him and C-Webb should work well together as wlong as he realizes that it is AI's team and AI's city. AI can take over a game, and if you try to hack him out, you;ll just get him mad, becasue you know he will get up and you can be even more sure that he will make the free throws. I mean think about who was on the team he took to the finals. If you can name 2 others that arent mutombo you either Live in Philly or are a 40 yr old man who has no life. To be hnoest with all you AI is the best player in the game today. I WILL PRDICT THAT IF THEY MAKE IT TO THE PLAYOFFS THEY WILL UPSET EVERYONE TO WIN IT ALL. but only if he and C-webb can work together long enough to make it to the playoffs.
