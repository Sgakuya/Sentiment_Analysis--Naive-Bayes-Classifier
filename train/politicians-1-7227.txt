Jesse Jackson calls himself Reverend. If he were really a true Reverend and man of God, he would try harder to unite this country. He insights violence by making everything in this country a racial issue. He thinks that he is another Martin Luther King, and that will never happen. Martin Luther King was a man who stood up for the rights of African Americans in a nonviolent way. Jesse Jackson promotes hatred, which is something this country fights everyday to abolish. I agree with a lot of the comments already written on this sight. A true man of God treats all humans equally, Jesse Jackson is not a man of God. He does not preach the word of the gospel, treat your neighbors as you would yourself.
