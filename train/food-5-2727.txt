Why are these rated so low? They are like the best candy bar ever made. I am biased because I am one of those rare people who is nuts over white chocolate (I know, I know, it's not REAL chocolate if it's white), but this is one delicious candy bar. I make my mom hand these out to trick-or-treaters because there's always a bunch left over and I go over to her house and pick them up and have snacks for the next few days. It's like eating a bunch of Oreo's all crunched up in ice cream (except less messy and not as cold), which is pretty much heaven. If they could somehow make them nutritious I could probably live on them.
