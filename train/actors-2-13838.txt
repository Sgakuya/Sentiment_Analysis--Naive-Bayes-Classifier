Julia Roberts is SO overrated. She's got all this PR selling her. Julia Roberts - How does she do it?? She's got people doing it for her. I'd be all smiles and look great too if I made all the money shamelessly playing the same roles. But really...does anyone remember her more serious roles in the mid-90's? Doubtful. She was forgotten after that. And then came My Best Friend's Wedding where she had to look like she did in Pretty Woman. (Rupert Everett stole the movie anyway.) I've always considered her to look mousy with a big horse mouth. THANK GOD she did not take the role in Shakespeare in Love. I cring when I hear critics say that she would have been terrific in that movie!???? GASP
