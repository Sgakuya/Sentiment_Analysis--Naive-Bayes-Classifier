Here you go Bigpeter flat out this car will kill a Honda Accord with 240 HP. Oh ya and 1996 Chevrolet Impala SS, 7.3 0-60,15.6 1/4 mi. You can bet it's worse now with 100k plus on it. 2003 Mercury Marauder, 6.9 0-60 15.4 1/4 mi. So keep on running your mouth about the Jap crap you bought to all your minimum wage earning friends who will never own a car past the year of 1990. Buy a real car when you earn enough money punk. To the rest of you doubters for less than 325 dollars you can purchase a chip for the traction control, transmition shift points, and speed limiter, all improving this car considerably making it eat Accords for lunch. Or hey if your bigpete you can tune it yourself since you know so much.
