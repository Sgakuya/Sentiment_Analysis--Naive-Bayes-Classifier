We love going to Universal Studio Parks. Both of them. We probably favor the Studios over Islands of Adventure. We like the rides better at the Studio's. The Mummy ride is awesome. Islands of Adventure is fun too if you don't mind walking around wet all day. I got completely drenched on Jurassic Park and the Popeye ride is a blast too. On our last trip to Orlando we originally made plans to spend three days at Disney World. The first day at Magic Kingdom my kids were complaining of boredom. By 3 o'clock they were ready to leave and these are teens! We decided to bag Disney the next day and go to Universal instead. We spent two and a half days at both parks at Universal and my kids were begging to stay longer! We had to leave on the half day to return home or we would have gladly stayed the entire day. My kids say they never want to go to Disney again.
