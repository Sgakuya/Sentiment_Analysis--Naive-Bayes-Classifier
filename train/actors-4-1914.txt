I have to concur with Andrew Scott in that I do not really consider Johnny Depp to be one of the finest actors around today, but one cannot deny his overwhelming popularity and charisma. His natural charm translates into an exceptional screen presence that captures the attention of the audience throughout all of his films. His career has shot off like a rocket--- its hard to think back to some of his earlier, less publicized roles (as the rebellious teen in Cry-Baby; the desperate father in Nick of Time; the wholesome farmboy who finds love in What's Eating Gilbert Grape). I really enjoyed Depp's performance as Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow, as well as a similar role in From Hell. With the recent success of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, its clear that we have not seen the last of Johnny Depp, and that he has a bright future ahead of him.
