Being a Blazer myself I can see the obvious problems with this program. One our star quarterback was hurt at the height of our season, two we are playing thrid fiddle to two of the best programs in college football, and three, we simply haven't had enough time to build up a successful football program, that's not to say we won't. I have to give UAB a five because they played TCU to the final minutes in a very close game that would have been theirs if Hackney hadn't gotten hurt. They made Georgia sweat on their Homecoming game. Both were played with our freshman quaterback. Next UAB is going to take C-USA and get a bowl game for sure.
