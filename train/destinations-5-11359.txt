I have gone both to the North Rim and the South. The first time you see it, or anytime you see after a gap of some time, it is hard to believe something like this exists on earth. That gap, phew, it is unbelievable. The only problem is that, it is difficult to really experience the big canyon. You have to be in excellent physical shape and have a lot of time at hand to go down the canyon or something worthwhile in the canyon. A must see for anybody. A better, more accessible Canyon/Park is Bryce Canyon, a short drive from the North Rim. South Rim is where most people go, and it is nice, but North Rim is excellent too. The drive to North Rim is just breathtaking. It has vast areas of green pastures, colors in the fall, and so many deer and other wildlife. Not many people make it to the North Rim, so it is a lot more peaceful and you can enjoy the canyon more. Beautiful sunsets too.
