Mr Cathy has helped out alot of people in our community and all about in general, I go to his church, which is a huge church so I have never actually met him but I know alot of people who have and he has helped many people and given them homes and things that they needed. He also has a childrens camp in North Georgia for children to attend every summer, he is a wonderful christian man and their is so many organizations that he has, and he has given so much money away to charity it amazing that he has money left. We have driven by his house, he is a very conservative man and has a normal size home and a normal car. Nothing fancy, just like you and me. He has a wonderful delicious food chain to add to it, one of a kind Chick Fil A
