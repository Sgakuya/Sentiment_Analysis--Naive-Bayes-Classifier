I've only seen Chris Leak in one game, against FSU. I was thunderstruck by his play. Everything he did was done with a poise and skill far beyond his years. His ability to switch from one receiver to another was lightning-fast. His execution of the option was similarly perfect -- he was running the ball with full intent to keep running, then lateralled back to the running back with no hesitation -- it was almost like a no-look pass in basketball. His handoffs were beautiful. His play-action passes were astonishing, he sold the run completely convincingly. Either he has tremendous natural talent or he has been working hard at every facet of the quarterback position since he was 2. Perhaps it's both. I feel that he has a precocious talent much like that of LeBron James. I can't wait to see more of Mr Leak over the coming years. If he remains healthy, both physically and mentally (both difficult tasks!) then he will be amazing. Thad Beier
