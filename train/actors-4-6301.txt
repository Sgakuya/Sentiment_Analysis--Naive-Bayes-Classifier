Ryan Phillippe is a very, very talented actor who if given the right role can go very, very far. His best performance so far had to be in Little Boy Blue - his character's struggles were communicated very well to the audience. Another one of his best roles was as the snooby over priviledged teen who finds love in Cruel Intentions opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar. He was OK in I Know What You Did Last Summer . What confuses me most about Phillippe is his choice of roles. He has had the oppurtunity to assume huge roles which would have boosted him into stardom, but has turned them all down. I suppose he's either to humble to go into the Hollywood elite or he doesn't think he can handle these roles. If given the right leading role, I think he can.
