A great little Tyrolean mountain town, on the Italian side of the border. Like every town in that part of Italy, it also has a German name (St. Ulrich). Very picuresque, very relaxing, good food (you can choose between Italian or German fare). They speak Italian (which predominates just very slightly over German), German, and Ladin (NOT Latin!). Ortisei has to be the woodcarving capital of the world; it seems that everyone is a woodcarver (from pre-teens on up to geriatric cases). Some of the carving is absolutely beautiful. I'm told that Ortisei does rough carvings which are then shipped to other parts of the Tyrol (to include Oberammergau) for final detail carving. Really a great place to visit (although driving there on the mountain roads from Bolzano can be an experience in itself).
