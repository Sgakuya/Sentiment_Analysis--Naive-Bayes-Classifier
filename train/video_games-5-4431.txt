My review is just a review of another: it's even worst then the first. the developers decided do be realistic and make buildings bigger then the people, but what we got is buildings the size of your whole screen (the castle), and you must scroll half an hour to get to the second end of your camp. you can't get an overall prespective of your camp, cus all you can see is one building. TRY CHANGING YOUR RESOLUTION, MORON. And up your scroll speed. also, it takes too much time to destroy buildings, Only because you can't figure out that militia aren't very effective. A trebuchet can destroy a building in seconds. and too much upgrades, you just keep upgrading more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and it doesn't over. That's the point! It's called 'research'! We've been at it for 5,000 years and we're still not done! Besides, it's a side part of the game. You don't just wait until you upgrade everything and attack. Even then, you end up finishing 90% of the techs an hour through the game. even longer and as boring as the first. nice intro though. I don't give a flying **** about the intro. I got tied of the first faster than this one.
