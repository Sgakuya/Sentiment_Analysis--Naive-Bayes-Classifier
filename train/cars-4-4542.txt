Most of these comments or worthless on the site. Fords are better or chevy are the best and fords suck. Both are okay but both have there problems also. I have had some minor problems with the silverado. Like a lot of people complain about piston slap. Mine isn't that loud but some engines are loud and should be replace but chevy says they are normal. I use fuel cleaner additive and it helps. The brakes are much better on the 2001 and up. Dont like the power mirrors because they shake to much. The air condition is really good but dont leave it on the coldest setting all the time or you will get a lot of mold build up. Haven't had any major problems. Just think some of the interior kind of cheap but the ford is about the same on that also. They put some really cheap tires and floor mats on these new trucks. I think they are good trucks but definetly not worth the money. Most of the parts are made in Mexico. GM must pocket a lot of money on that cheap labor. Ford trucks have there problems also but I like them too.
