not only the greatest of his generation, he will be the undisputed all-time best when all is said and done. Just wait until production is measured without public opinion of his attitude. 5 MVP's(no one else has more than 3).He was the second 40/40 man ever. He is the only member of the 400HR/400 SB club(only 7 steals away from 500/500) 8 gold gloves/records for most HR in a season(73), highest single season on base percent, highest single season slugging percentage, most walks in a season,most IBB in a season career. He's also shatttered the playoff bust myth. No one has ever dominated an era more completely. As of 6-4-03 his career rankings: home runs- 4th/doubles 30th/runs-11th/rbi-19th/hits-78th/total bases-13th/walks-4th/stolen bases-36th/on-base-pct,-5th/Slugging pct-6th/extra base hits-5th. Like Jordan with the Bulls, Bonds stopped trying to win alone and realized you can only get to the top by making those around you better. He's done that. Ruth had Gehrig protecting him in the lineup. Who has Bonds had?
