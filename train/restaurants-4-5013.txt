Your food is prepared when you order it. You can substitute pretty much anything in your meal for something else and have it prepared however you like it. Try it, it will prove to you that your food was not premade. There is frequently an hour plus wait. You need to understand, if you wait for a table for an hour plus you will wait longer for food, drinks and appetizers than you would if the wait was shorter. Everyone in the restaurant is working hard. Making your way through the kitchen during peak hours is like trying to walk through the biggest crowd you can think of, carrying food on a tray without spilling it. This is true of most any restaurant during peek hours. Please be patient. It is a pleasure providing service to nice people. People who know what they want to order, ask for everything they need in one or two trips and leave 15-20% gratuity. Waitresses make $2.65 per hour and anwser to everyone in their section while you are there. Not only that, but they stay over an hour after their shift cleaning the restaurant. Be kind!! Most of us are just trying to get through college!! Most decent restaurant will cost a couple at least $30 and a $5-$6 tip. If you cannot afford to eat out STAY HOME!!
