Best current coach out there right now. He has done such a great job with his player personnel that year in and year out the Spurs have been atop of the league. With the savvy moves of drafting Ginobili and Parker, and Duncan always being mister consistent, Pop has seen Robinson leave and was able to continue winning, and other role players--which are essential for a championship--leave, only to be replaced with just as good if not better players. He is probably the most underrated coach because the Spurs are not the flashy, run-n-gun team that people want to see. Though that is changing with Parker and Ginobili's style of play. Parker can penetrate on anyone in the league, then either hit his floater, dish it off, or create space to get all the way to the basket while at times even drawing big men over that come too late and foul him. Ginobili is a great shooter, can weave between any defenders, and can dunk on centers that are of all-star caliber. Tim is...Tim-the Big Fundamental, who gives you 25 pts., 12 rebs., and over 5 assists per game. Poppovich did not inherit a great team, he made them great after Duncan came along. Duncan, as great as he is, needed Ginobili and Parker to help win championships. That was "Pops" great coaching and management that made that happen.
