Whenever I see film critics (who usually have as much talent as a pile of doggy- do) slate a film, I know I'm in for a better movie than has been painted. True the accents can disengage occasionally in this film, the make-up focusses your eye and some of the acting is stilted but the story and sets were fine and lavish and told me much about Alexander, (which for once in Hollywood was as historically correct as possible) I heard that it bombed in the US because of the homosexual content. I hope that that isn't true since the guy DID take (as it was quite normal to do) lovers of both sexes. It seems to me these types of 'abstainers of high morals' are quite prepared to see people getting their guts spilled out on screen but not two members of the same sex hugging, which is quite pathetic. Overall the film showed the pointlessness of waging continual battle to try and 'conquer' other peoples in order to bring them 'out of barbarianism', the loss of innocent lives (and of animal's) through one man's greed, insecurity, arrogance and vanity. What is 'Great' about that?George Bush, born around the same birthday as Alexander, should take note. A little note to Kamy: I believe we may have received the unedited version over here but even then there seemed to be not the remotist sign of 'pornography' or 'gross sexuality' in the film, in fact, Stone appeared to go out of his way to tone down any truly graphic scenes. Alexander's motivations were spurred through his relationships with his parents and his love of his best mate as well as his sexuality, so this was entirely appropriate. I also found the story very easy to follow (except for Anthony Hopkins' ramblings in the opening scenes.)
