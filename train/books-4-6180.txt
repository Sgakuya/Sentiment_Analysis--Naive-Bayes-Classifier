Ancient Chinese text translated into a modern handbook about lessons of War. This is often a misunderstood book- it is actually an anti-war book. It begins with the premise that the ability to wage war is 'the life or death of a nation.' In other words, it is the duty of the ruling class to protect the common people against the threat of invasion. The ART OF WAR is not a gigantic philosophical text, but it is underrated in academic circles. Like it or not, understanding war is necessary at this stage in human history. You are either a victim or victor- you might as well know what works. This book is a trendy gift for the type-A businessperson who wants to show off a 'uber-cool' book collection at the office. Read it as an excersize in human negotiation and influence, don't be scared off by it's title. Master Sun always says that all avenues must be explored and war is a last resort thus an ultimate failure of human communication. .. as I said, it is an anti-war book at heart with some tough, modern-day lessons. Not perfect, but very readable. . .4 stars.
