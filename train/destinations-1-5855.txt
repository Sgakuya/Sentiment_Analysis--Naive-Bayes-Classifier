My husband, daughter, and I just moved to New Jersey from Colorado. I was excited to get a taste of "east coast living." To say we are disappointed in this state would be the understatement of the year. We have been here six months and have yet to meet anyone who is not a local - everybody has connections, and that's the only way you can get anything done here. If you are moving from out of state, be prepared for a nightmarish ordeal buying a house, getting a drivers license, and looking for a job. Nine million people crammed into a tiny state create a real feeding frenzy when it comes to competition for resources. Even though I was warned the people in Jersey were rude, I didn't want to believe it. Sadly, the New Jersey stereotype well-earned - honesty, integrity, and compassion are rare qualities in the people here. It's a shame, because the state is (was?) gorgeous - world class beaches and beautiful forests. The people make it ugly.
