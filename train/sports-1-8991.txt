My 1st review is about Yao Ming. Yao Ming stinks. seriously, there are alot better centers that houston could start. they could just keep in Strotomile Swift as a starter. 1st off each game he play's he gets into foul trouble so u only get a stable 20 monutes a game out of him nice! He should be averaging somewhere around 25 points a game. He can put his chin on the rim enough said. he's taller than everyone so there should be no reason u get locked down by players like Boris Diaw.I really feel that it his size that is what got him into the league and a starter. He's just so unaggresive in this sport where u have to flex some muscle.
