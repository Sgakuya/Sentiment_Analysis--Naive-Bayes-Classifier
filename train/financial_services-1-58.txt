I worked for USBANK for four and a half years. They even terrorize their employees. Please don't bother them, they know how bad the bank is, they need a good paycheck and that's the best paying job in town. My comment..... I had funds in my account, but because I used my check card to make two five dollar purchases with a true balance of 85.00 but I had authorizations of 82.00 those two five dollar purchases brought me in the negative. Acceptable. BUT, they then charged the fees on the two five dollar purchases, then processed the 82.00 in charges, refusing those, charging me 120.00 more charges. A total of 180.00 in charges, when I had funds to pay all but two of those. They charged me because of what I was going to do then refused the charges that caused that overdraft. I called and was told that was the policy, process the fees then go from there. When I explained that there should have been no fees without those purchases processing and being paid, I was informed that was policy, again. I regretably have lied to customers, not helped them with what was available to me, and gotten in trouble for seeing a problem and telling the customer instead of letting fees apply. This is WHY I left the bank, because of their unethical practices. What else can I say, but to push to the limit what you can. They won't respond unless you do. Also, feel sorry for their employees. They put them in a position they almost HAVE to bank with them, then when there is an issue, you have to let your supervisior and manager know, then if they like you they will help you... The customer has more pull, and the more money you have the more pull you have. If you are an average joe.. you're screwed.
