After nearly 25 years in Hollywood, Jamie Lee Curtis is well on her way to living up to the reputation of her illustrious parents. She bounced onto the screen at the ripe age of twenty with her leading role in the horror classic, Halloween and its sequel. The success of those two films soon propelled her into superstardom, leading to Trading Places . She was absolutely hilarious in A Fish Called Wanda . She continued to flourish in the 90s. I really loved her in the My Girl films. Her performance as Dana's stepmother Shelly was so believable- she really played a likable role in both of those films. She gave a riveting performance opposite Mel Gibson in Forever Young , but by far, my favorite of all of her roles was that of Helen Tasker in True Lies , mainly because of the classic dancing scene that she does in that film. Talk about sexy! Halloween: H20 restored credibility to the series after a long string of lacking sequels, and of course, Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job of bringing Laurie Strode to life. I wouldn't go too far by saying that Jamie lee Curtis is the best there is, but she has such a likable atmosphere about her, and she's definately in my top 10!
