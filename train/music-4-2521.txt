I think this album is one of the most overrated Beatles albums. Not to discredit In My Life (in my top 5 song list), Nowhere Man and Norweigian Wood which are all excellent, and there are a few others that I like, but overall, it is far from their best. The albums can be compared to the life of a person...the first albums were when they were cute kids, Rubber Soul is that sort of awkward, as someone else said, transitional stage in their lives, glasses, braces and all that. But by the time Revolver hits, they begin to outgrow that, start becoming mature adults. And for you kids who are comparing the music to that of today, fine. Since the Beatles are arguably the most influencial band of all time, it would make sense that you would think some tunes sound like N*SYNC. Because in some way, absolutely, they have been influenced by the Beatles. As far as comparing talent, though, keep in mind that the boy bands of today do not play instuments (unless you count their little try-to-be-bad-a$$ side projects) and do not write their own songs. Which I know is said over and over but apparently people are still overlooking this as a minor detail.
