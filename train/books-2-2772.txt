Welcome to McRelationships, how can we help you today?

The key operator here is Highly Generalized. If you're in your 30's or 40's, and have been through your share of relationships-- and maybe have even done a little thinking about WHY those partners are now EX partners -- then you'll probably read this with a sense of Well, DUH! Who didn't know that? Since we're all individuals, canned solutions written in a mass market style may not be the best answer to solving relationship woes...
