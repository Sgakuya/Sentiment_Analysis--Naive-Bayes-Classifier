The Matrix is Real - It is Bank of America. So you want to know "What is the Matrix"? Its an OFFICIAL Bank of America program designed to "protect you?" from overdraft if you chose NOT to have overdraft protection. Bank of America acutally calls the prorgram "The Matrix" option on their banking systems. And Yes - they signed you up for it without your knowledge when you decline their overdraft protection. Here is how does The Matrix works. 1. Suppose you have debit card, and 2. you decline overdraft protection because you just won't be writing any checks. 3. Suppose you know that your balance is $0.00 and you go to the ATM to withdraw $40. 4. You'd think the ATM will decline your request - citing insuffient funds. But that is not the case. You will get $40 cash. And you can still run around and put gas in your car for $6, and grab a meal for $5. 5. Hey, shouldn't all these transactions be declined? 6. No - not if BOA put you in "The Matrix". Two days later, check and see what The Matrix has done for you. A whoopin $93 in overdraft protection charges. Now you can go to them and ask how on earth can you make an ATM withdrawal when you have $0 balance, and no overdraft protection. They'll tell you "most customers prefer not have their transactions bounce". "Th bank did a survey (which unfortunately you were not part of) and our customers would rather not be embarrassed (in front of the ATM and the gas pump)". To sum it all up - The Matrix is just ONE of the programs set up by the Bank to make it possible to charge your account overdraft fees and transcation fees. These programs decide how to make your account look one way, and then wake up only to find 3 or 4 charges against your account. Ask your bank about "The Matrix"
