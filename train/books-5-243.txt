Hell To Pay is excellently written, researched and indexed by a woman who spent years examining Hillary Rodham Clinton and researching her life. This book reveals Hillary as an ideologue, a True Believer in socialist policies that put the government in charge of telling the rest of us how to think, dress, eat, sleep and throw out our garbage. Her beliefs are so strong that she will do almost anything to see her view of society come to fruition. Sticking with Bill was one of those things. I admire her guts and persistence as a True Believer but I shudder at the world view that she promotes. Through this book I came to understand Hillary much more clearly, and I recommend it to anyone who really wants to know who she is.
