The movie, simply put, is BAD. Never have I ever seen a romance between two characters done so badly. In one scene, the dialogue and acting between Hayden Christensen's Anakin and Natalie Portman's Padme was so bad, I literally cringed and tried to ignore what they were saying. There are also many other parts of the movie where the dialogue is just plain...crappy. However, if you ignore the frequent terrible writing and acting (...like I did the second time, AFTER laughing throughout the first time), you might get some time to admire the wonderful special effects that quite literally make the movie. The effects are numerous and you have to wonder how much time it took to make all those computer generated images. However, special effects can't make a movie good, let alone special, if the plot and acting itself aren't in decent condition. All in all, this movie isn't really worth your time, unless you like sci-fi films or if you're intrigued by the Star Wars saga (I'm a fan of Star Wars, not the Star Wars films)...
