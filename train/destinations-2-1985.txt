This is a review of Trinidad, not Tobago. Put plainly, Trinidad is a third-world country. Don't ever go there unless it's for business. Ask any family in Trinidad to visit you instead of visiting them. The people drive horribly here, like they want to die. Bodyguards of government officials carry assault rifles; I saw a Ministry of Health bodyguard carrying an M4 assault rifle at an outdoor shopping mall next to a candy store! This is the same weapon Special Forces use in Afghanistan folks! There are stray dogs everywhere as the government makes no effort to pick them up. Garbage is strewn about anywhere. There was a spate of kidnappings when I was there a couple weeks ago in December of 2004. Most of the regulars, much like the government, demonstrated ignorance and apathy towards doing something about the problem. Apparently, a lot of crime is caused by people looking for money to spend on costumes and items for Carnival, which is a sad misappropriation of priorities. A lot of Trinidadians, especially the East Indians love to drive their fancy BMWs and Mercedes and wearing their expensive clothes. I can only assume, given the country's poor condition, that many of them are stealing the money. Ladies and gentlemen, your classic third world nation: Trinidad.
