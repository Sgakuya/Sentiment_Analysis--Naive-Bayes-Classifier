O.K. so I'm a big Elvis fan, so maybe a lot of readers will discount my five-star rating of Graceland. But let me tell you, I walked in ready to be disappointed by Graceland but came out very impressed and very touched. There's a lot of cheesy decorating in evidence, the likes of which you won't find on the HG channel anytime soon. But you also get a wonderful audio history of Elvis's life, and you are swept up by this realization that you are THERE where the King himself spent his days, hidden away from a world that became too infatuated with him. It's very moving to come to his gravesite with his incredible song If I Can Dream swelling in your headset. For even greater kicks, you need to go to the Sun Studio tour (where, of course, Elvis recorded his legendary Sun sides that were the Big Bang of rock and roll). That's where the folklore becomes reality to the Elvis pilgrim. I've read that this tour can be a bummer if you get a bad tour guide, since there's virtual nothing to actually tour (its Sun Studio not studioS), but the one that I saw was great. Anyway, if you are a real Elvis lover, you may want to stay at the Heartbreak Hotel right outside of Graceland. Its got Elvis movies running 24 hours a day (though its really just like a Holiday Inn with Elvis gimmicks and a higher price). You will definitely want to take the tour of Elvis's plane, the Lisa Marie. The food around the Graceland complex is pretty lame. Go instead to Rendevous and get some dry-rubbed ribs.
