Whole Foods is a disgusting anti-union craphole which not only pays its workers terrible wages, they are unfair and arbitrary in their raises and promotions. Policies are changed weekly. Workers have no voice, no power, and if they express a desire to see things a little different, they are told to leave. I know that is the same b.s. that every other employer offers, but Whole Fools claims to be different, they say they are people driven. In fact, workers at the store in Madison, Wisconsin organized a union, and the suits at Whole Foods fought it as hard as they could, making up bogus objections to the outcome of the election. After a hearing the objections were dismissed and the union election victory made official, Whole Foods now refuses to negotiate a contract. In fact, I urge you to boycott Whole Foods and tell everyone you know not to shop at Whole Foods until they show their workers respect and dignity by negotiating a contract with them.
