I agree with the person that said if you like headaches, go with T-Mobile. Besides dropping calls continuously, their customer service is terrible. I live in south Florida, and after Hurricane Wilma, I had no electricity no home phone, and my place of employment was closed. I knew I was going to go over my minutes so I called T-Mobile to add more minutes to my plan. Their customer service department told me not to worry about it, as they were helping out customers in south Florida due to the hurricane. I received my bill 2 weeks later, and needless to say there was quite a bit of overage on it. I called customer service several times and spoke with many different people, all who were useless. I finally spoke with a a supervisor, even though customer service said "there wasn't one available" and she of no help either (she probably wasn't even a supervisor). I explained to her that I had spoken with cust. serv. after the hurricane, and they assured me they'd credit me. She could have cared less and basically called me a liar without actually saying it. She told me if I don't pay my entire balance in full, my phone would be turned off, and of course it was. If you do decide to go with T-Mobile, I hope you have a better experience than I did because as far as I'm concerned, T-MOBILE SUCKS!!!
