For the first time in a long time, Woody Allen has cast an actor in a lead role other than himself or a transparent surrogate for himself. Jonathan Rhys Meyers has much more in common with Matt Damon's Mr. Ripley than with any previous leading man of Allen's. Like Ripley, Meyers' Chris Wilton remains a cipher through most of the movie. And much as with Ripley, we find ourselves, despite ourselves, wanting him to get away with the atrocity he's committed. The key difference being that Chris, though a criminal, is not the sociopath that Ripley is. Allen makes it clear how Chris finds himself on the path he does, and it's impossible not to sympathize with him and wonder what we would do in his place. Allen achieves this effect by staying close to Meyer's viewpoint at almost all times (it's one of the reasons he remains such an enigma through most of the movie: we are never able to see him through others' eyes, only others through his eyes). Previously, I might not have thought Meyers was up to the challenge of this role, the maturity and subtlety, but he proves an inspired if unexpected choice. And Allen's camera loves him just as much as it does Scarlett Johansson and the London backdrop. From a strictly photographic point of view, this might be Allen's best looking movie since Manhattan. My only complaint is that--much as Woody Allen often either over- and mis-uses jazz in his soundtracks--the opera score becomes tiresome and cloying. Foolishly, an aria can be heard throughout the crime sequence, oddly diluting the tension and drama when silence might have accomplished so much more. But this is nit-picking in an otherwise admirable, evocative, and even haunting movie.
