It seems I've been doing nothing but new-car shopping lately: I bought an '01 Maxima SE, my sister bought an '01 Focus ZX3 and my wife recently bought an '01 Civic Sedan, 5sp. Between shopping with wife and sister I've driven all the new offerings in the small sedan category, and a few that are somewhat long in the tooth (Corolla). Bottom line: the Civic sets the standard in this segment. It is a marked improvement over the vehicle it replaces in all aspects, save for the move to a strut front suspension (and away from the unique double wishbone) which will only bother true gearheads. The Civic is extremely spacious inside, particularly in light of its compact exterior, and surely the equal of the Accord from a generation or two ago. Exterior design is typically Honda-conservative, but I find it to be quite handsome and it will surely age well. Interior appointments are first-rate, demonstrating a real understanding of ergonomics: no sci-fi gadgets, but all controls work well and have a quality feel. Honda is pretty much the undisputed king of small-displacement engines (Exhibit 1: S2000) and this engine displays the typical eagerness to rev that lends a sporty element to the driving experience. The gear shift / clutch combination is just about perfect: light effort with a tactile feeling of mechanical precision. When you factor in Honda's enviable reputation for reliability, this car really doesn't have any weaknesses. Okay, a broader colour selection wouldn't be a bad thing.
