In the Shapes humble opinion, Halloween II was the last time we'd see a decent movie in this series until the summer of 1998 (Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later). Like the James Whale sequel Bride Of Frankenstein, Halloween II picks up right at the end of the original film, seamlessly going from one film to the other. A well-done feat, considering there were a couple years in between the two films. True, Halloween II does not come close to Carpenter's original masterpiece. But come on, that's a pretty tall order. You really have to judge Halloween II on its own merits, and when you do that it stacks up pretty well. Plenty of scares abound, and we're lucky to get return performances by Curtis and Pleasence. The rest of the cast does a good job, especially the police captain, sneering at Loomis as he quips You let him OOUUUT! Overacting at its finest. Carpenter scripted this sequel, and he does a good job at putting a few twists and turns in the plot (even if a few are needless, such as the secret between the hero and the monster). the Shape does remember hearing an interview with him (although he doesn't remember when) where Carpenter said that he had a real tough time coming up with this screenplay, making it fresh and original. The one thing this film did manage to capture was the spirit and feel of the original Halloween. Maybe the Shape has diluted, nostalgic memories about seeing the original Halloween, but after around 1988, there was something missing, some spirit of the good ol' horror films that has yet to be captured again (and we're moving farther and father away from that feel as each successive Scream clone is released). Taken as a whole, Halloween II makes a nice bookend to the original classic.
