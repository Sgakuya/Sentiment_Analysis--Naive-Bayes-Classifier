Oh My God!!!!How can anyone say anything negative about this excellent athlete. My frenzy started when i was a micheal Jordan fan and not yet enlighted by Reggie. I saw him in the olympics with his smooth shades on. His performance was amazing. from then on i knew i was going to ditch his airness for the world renowned Knick killer. In my opinion he's the best 3point shooter to ever walk the court. There are two kind of people when it comes to the fans that hate him. They're are either jealous of his success or they are pouting because he drained a three at the last second to beat there favorite team. Thank you for your time and if anyone has any pics e-mail me. Peace!!
