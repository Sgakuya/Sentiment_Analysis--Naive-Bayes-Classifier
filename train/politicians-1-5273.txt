Al Gore is a liar, he and his administration are turning our whole electoral process into a circus. When a person goes to take a licensure test, for example the MCAP or NCLEX, he/she can't take it again based on it being confusing! I am MAD, that tonights Dateline broadcast polls, in no way reflect the attitudes of the entire population of this country. Everybody knows that Gore received predominantly inner-city votes, what about the rest of America, the Heartland, we don't agree one bit with what is going on in Florida. And you people are not broadcasting the whole story. Just like you left out the rest of what Buchanan had to say about how Gore should not request a re-count, that Bush had won the election. Gore does not want to abide by the rules, regulations or laws we have in place now. What makes you think he will abide by them if he becomes president? Can you say DICTATORSHIP!!!!!Where would we be without laws, rules and regulations? How many elections would have been different if this had been allowed to go on in years past? This just makes me sick. And if Al Gore gets into office the rest of this country will be sick too.
