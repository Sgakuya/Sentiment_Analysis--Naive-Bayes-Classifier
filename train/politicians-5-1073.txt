YES!!! Today in a bold press conference attended by fellow disengagement protestor Natan Sharansky, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced he is seeking head of party (Likud) and the premiership! Unlike Sharon who responded with unspecified cries of lies and fantasies, Netanyahu diplomatically recalled his accomplishments such as stopping the Oslo agreement, leading the country to economic revival as Finance Minister, and have nearly no suicide bombings when he as Prime Minister told Arafat he'd send him to Tunisia if he continued terror. With an admirable strong humility he also said, My stance isn't just based on past experience. The measure of every leader is based on his ability to grow and learn from past mistakes, and I am ready. No 'Road Map' crap under this leader's watch! Smart, brave, a humble servant-leader...heroic and needed.
