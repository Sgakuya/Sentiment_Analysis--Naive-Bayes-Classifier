This game is somewhat of a hollywood phenomenon, somewhat. Starring such voice actors as Ray Liotta (as Tommy Vercetti, the central protagonist) and Jenna Jameson this series has immensely annoyed parents all around the world with its vivid and often humourus depictions of voilence. With an excellent soundtrack direct from the eighties and a couple very entertaining political satires in the conversations between DJs and guests as well as the brilliant mockery of elements of popular culture contained in the commercials this game certainly has its own feel. a vast range of vehicles are included with whitch to wreck havoc from fire engines, ambulances, police cars, helicopters, speedboats, motorbikes and my favourite: the electric scooter. Boasting superbly detailed graphics, excellent logevity and replay value this game is truely a killer-app for the PS2.
