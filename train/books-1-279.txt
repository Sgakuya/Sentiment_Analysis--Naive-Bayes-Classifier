Lacking in credibility considering the blindly allegiant nature of the friendship between author and subject. The mixing of biography and fiction is totally bogus and I can't see how any self-respecting editor or non-metally retarded publisher would go for it. And let's face it folks: the passage and deepened perspective of 15 years has taken quite a bit of the sheen off of Reagan's very uneven, and sometimes frighteningly lame performance as President: this book is nothing more than a transparent attempt by the rightwing to protect a fragile (and some say totally negative) legacy by sugarcoating the truth and submitting to the old drooler favorite, namely, revisionist history.
