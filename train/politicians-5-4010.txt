Allright, I must agree with scarletfeather, gmanod, and Jeff Britain here. I worked the campaign and devoted countless hours of time, and I mean countless here in my home state, but I want to bring a perspective here that no one has. I got the honoe of not only MEETING the good Senator twicce, but I got to SPEAK to him as well, I actually got to take up a good chunk of time with him twice. He is one of the most sincere, caring and forthright individuals I have ever met. Sure, he was a trial lawyer, SO WHAT? What abotu the 23 million dollars he has won for peopel whose children were injured due to medical malpractice? Few politicians will actually take time during a busy campaign to talk to their constituents but he did. Sure, he has charm and charisma but it doesn't make him a slimeball, it simply makes him the total package, quick wit, integrity, intelligence, hope and passion. This man would have my vote any day of the week...PERIOD...and that's coming from someone who knows him a bit more than the average person.
