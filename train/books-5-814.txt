A fine introduction to the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Ms. Rowling knows how to tell a good tale that both children and adults can enjoy. Her use of forshadowing, giving slight hints and clues to what is coming, is terrific. You can quickly read over an important bit of information without realizing it. She also has great charecter developement. Some of the charactors are simple and easily shown for what they are, weather they be hero or villian, but there is always a chance we have jumped to the wrong conclusion. There is an early line in the book in which Professor McGonigall states, He will be the most famous boy in our world. A truer statement has not been made. Nearly every child knows and enjoys Harry and his friends.
