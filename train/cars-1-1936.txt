I bought a 1996 Plymouth breeze in May 1998. In February 2000 the front seal blew Cost $360.00 to repair it. In February 2001 the same front seal blew and cost $249.00 to repair. In the mean time Chrysler had came out with a steel clamp to put over the seal so it wouldn't push out. But in the mean time 2 blow seals has done some damage to the motor. Wear and tear on a lot of big parts of the motor. I was told that 2.0 and 2.4 that they have been blowing seals. And all I know is chrsyler were of no help or assist. This car has under 45,000 miles on it and I take good care of the car. They claimed if they get enough complaints that they will consider this problem a recall. How many people blew a motor not realizing this problem? And how many people realize that when they blow a seal that they have no oil in there car? The amount of damage happening to the main bearing and rod bearing. Wear and tear on the crank shaft, lifters and camshaft. It probably has aged my motor to about 90,000 to 100,000 from blowing 2 seals! As I can hear the valve lifters knocking!
