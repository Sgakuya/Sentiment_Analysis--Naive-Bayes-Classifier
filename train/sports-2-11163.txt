He got the job by default for one. How many more OSU/ND losses will we endure before someone in Ann Arbor decides enough is enough. Anyone that supports Carr at this point is clueless. How many games were blown in the fourth quarter? Lets see--Minnesota, Wisconsin,Ohio State, Nebraska and they struggled againt Northern Illinois in the first half at home! How about last year--getting beat by Texas in the fourth quarter--losing to OSU and a crappy Notre Dame. It's time for a change. Cooper got fired for not beating Michigan--will Carr get fired for not beating Notre Dame, Ohio State and 3 consecutive bowl losses. Last year they had the number 6 recruiting class in the country--and went 7-5. Save the nice guy crap..Carr sucks.
