Though many consider FDR the greatest of all time, and certainly I was brainwashed into believing this as a student, the precedence he set during his tenure created the most dangerous mindset among Americans...that of helplessness and dependency. Even today you hear politicians on both sides of the aisle decrying the need for government assistance to our citizens in the form of jobless benefits, social security and presciption drugs. I can tell you that the many ills of our country will not cease until the government stops passing laws that protect people from themselves. FDR championed this idea: old people were not smart enough to save money, so we will save for them and pass the burden onto the younger generation. What happened to social responsibility being a personal choice? It ceased to become one with this presidency.
