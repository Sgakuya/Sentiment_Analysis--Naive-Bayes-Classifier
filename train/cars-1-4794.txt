I have a 2001 Ford Ranger Edge with 25000 mi and aside from having it in 2 different dealerships at least 8 times, the clutch just went and is NOT covered under the 3yr/36000mi bumper to bumper warranty. After all the poor service and lack of concern by Ford Motor Company, it's no suprise. So, I'm sure a lot of folks have great luck with theirs, but be ware, because when it needs fixing, you'll be paying! Never had a problem with any other manual transmission (6 so far), in fact, had 95,000mi on my 93 Mazda (before Ford bought them out)! I used to preach Buy American , but Ford is not in the cards for me anymore. Hopefully I'll have better luck with Chevy!
