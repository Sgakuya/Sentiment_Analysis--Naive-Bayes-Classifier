I think Jason is on his way to true stardom once he moves away from the mediocre teen exploitation films he seems to be in presently. He is extremely good looking, has a nice body, and I truly adore his smile!! I think he is a genuinely likeable personality that doesn't get submerged in cliches that overflow in trite films such as Loser. That movie wasn't a truly bad movie but I can never buy that Jason plays an outcast (except for his silly hat poor relations with his even bigger loser roomates) because he is so good looking and likeable. Give him some fresh roles where he can play a natural winner and not a silly teenager and he'll be the brightest major srat of the 2000s.
