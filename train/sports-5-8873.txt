Iron man baby! Whole lot made out of Ripken and Favre - what about Jamison?! Hasn't missed a game in like 83 years! Knock on wood. Aside from that impressive consecutive games stat, AWESOME scorer, good rebounder. Dallas definitely would have made more noise last year, if lame Walker had backed up Jamison. I have this discussion with people all the time. WHAT WAS NELSON THINKING!? When will Cuban fire this dumby? ! Now he's doing the smae thing with Stackhouse. Finley goes down, Stack gets 22 a game. Finley comes back, Stack can't even get in the game ahead of unproven sophs. Also, HELOOOOO DALLAS, you ain't gonna win without D! Hellooooooooo, fire NNelson. With this guy coaching in the league, Carolina will break the record for most 6th man awards by any school in NBA history. Daniels? Howard? With Stack sittin' over there watchin'? PLEEEEEASE! Get outta there 'Stack - before he ruins your carreer!
