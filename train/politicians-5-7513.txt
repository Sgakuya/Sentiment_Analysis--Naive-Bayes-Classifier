Abe Lincoln was killed for the same reason John F. Kennedy was killed and by pretty much the same people (European bankers similar to the Federal Reserve): issuing interest free money (greenbacks!!) to the American people and to the Union soldiers (Blue Jackets!) fighting a very successful civil war. Honest Abe did a fine job and will always go down as one of the great ones of all time, maybe even greater than Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. And of course, first and last and vice versa: he freed all American black people from the bondage of slavery that had been their vise since 1619. God bless America, God bless liberal minded people like JFK, Abraham Lincoln and Bill Clinton.
