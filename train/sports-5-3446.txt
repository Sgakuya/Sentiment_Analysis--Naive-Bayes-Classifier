One of the Hall of Famer's five original inductees in 1936, Honus Wagner combined rare offensive and defensive excellence throughout a 21-year career. Despite his awkward appearance - stocky, barrel, chested, and bow-legged - the longtime Pirates shortstop broke into the big league hitting .344 in 1897 with Louisville, the first of 17 consecutive seasons hitting over .300, including eight as the National League batting champion, compiling a lifetime average of .329. The Flying Dutchman also stole 722 bases and led the league in thefts on five occasions. Honus Wagner was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936.
