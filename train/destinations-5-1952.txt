You know Geordieboy I started to write an intelligent response to your negative comments regarding the United States. In doing so I discovered other posts you authored on this web site. Although your originall statement posed minor merit - I realized trying to reason with you would be sinking to your quite literally put (moronic level.) If any one is pathetic, it is you. For the benefit of other readers, below are other posts, authored by Geordieboy . 1) What can I say? 6 nominations at the Brits and not a single prize. Because he's a muppet. 2) A freak of nature - the man (or maybe not a man) has no taste and no talent at all. His music is crap with no intelligence to it, the lyrics are those of a psycopath, and his antics are childish. 3) Another band I want to die very slowly, very painfully. They have offended my senses too much and for too long. They must go. They can't be arsed to write their own songs, so they ruin someone elses instead. They are a completely manufactured band, they do the stupid dance-and-no-instruments thing, they look gay and probably are gay. Should be shot every one of them. 4) DIE SCLUB7 DIE!!!! I hate everything about this manufactured band, their clothes, their crappy TV show, their daft little dance routines, their sickening teeny-bopper songs. UGH! What a hateful, hateful band. 5) I hat Limp Bizkit with a passion - he can't sing, all he does is whine at high volume, the lyrics are inane and there is far too much guitar work that does your eardrums in. And the guy's a tit. These are just a few you wrote. Dude, you need to get some counseling. In the meantime, get off the Internet cause your eatin up good bandwidth that could be put to better use...
