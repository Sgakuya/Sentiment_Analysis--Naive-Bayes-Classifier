A dump. Tangiers has a reputation for being a fun place to go, thanks to the Beatniks, especially the great writer Paul Bowles. It's worth keeping in mind that they went to Tangiers back in the 1940s, when it was a very different city. Now it is crowded, dirty, dangerous and otherwise dull. The touts and beggars are possibly the most obnoxious in North Africa, the city is practically run by the Mafia, and the police are more corrupt than in Mexico. Sadly, many people come to Tangiers and get a bad impression of Morocco, which is a lovely country: just visit Casa, Fez, Ceuta, the Atlas mountains, anywhere but Tangiers. You've been warned.
