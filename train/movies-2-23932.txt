 K-Pax was a big disappointment. It gets off to a great start, and then halfway through it starts to fall apart. The second half of the movie features the plot collapsing in on itself and going up in flames. I was surprised because I thought the story sounded interesting (it's about a psychiatrist who has a patient claiming to be from the planet K-Pax), and I really like Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges, the stars of the show. Once Jeff Bridges (the psychiatrist) starts hypnosis sessions with Kevin Spacey (the mental patient), everything goes downhill. The ride to the bottom is filled with triteness and manipulation, and the ending is contrived. If you must see this movie, at least wait until it's a rental.
