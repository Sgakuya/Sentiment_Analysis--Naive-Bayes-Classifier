Miami is NOT the tropics. Miami in it's natural state would have entirely temperate zone vegetation, no more than, Swampgrasses, Red Maple, Bald Cyprus, Slash Pines, and Cabbage Palms (temperate zone species hardy to 7 degrees www.hardiestpalms.com) All of Miami's tropical vegetation was IMPORTED (only the hardiest tropical species) from Cuba and Central Amercia. Miami can't even grow the delicate tropical vegetation like breadfruit, jackfruit, durian, mangosteen, rambutan, longan and chemedak. Miami is in the 30-40 degree USDA growing zone with a record low of 30 degrees. Miami regulalrly gets 40-45 degrees every winter for 15-20 days. Miami offcially reaches 32 every 7 years. Miami was 37 degrees the last three winters. www.weatherunderground.com Miami hasd snow in Jan 1977 www.google.com Miami is NOT freeze free area. Miami's ocean water temp in January is 69. Varadero, Cuba's ocean water temp in January is 75-77 Huge difference. Miami DOES NOT have tropical caliber ultraviolet radiation. Miami is above the Tropic Of Cancer and DOES NOT have tropical UV strength. The Caribbean has the direct light from the sun. Places outside of 23N and 23S DO NOT have the direct light from the sun , it is oblique. The stratospheric ozone is also thinner in the tropics. Tropical caliber sun strength is due to tilt of the Earth and the curvature of the Earth and how that relates to the sun's light hitting Earth DIRECT. . HAWAII IS BELOW THE TROPIC OF CANCER AND HAS TROPICAL CALIBER UV. HAWAII IS THE ONE AND ONLY TROPICAL US STATE!!! Don't be fooled by Miami tropical wannabee pretenders. Exposing The Tropical Wannabee State for the MISADVERTISING fraud that it is. Yours In Tropicalness, Razwell AKA Kuala Lumpur Vacationer 3'.07" N
