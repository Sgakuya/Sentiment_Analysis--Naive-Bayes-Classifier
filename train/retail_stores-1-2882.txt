I bought a replacement diamond from Whitehall in Oklahoma City in 1999, to replace a lost diamond in my wedding set. We spent $1200 for the diamond. Within 2 years the diamond was cracked and chipped. Picking up the lifetime replacement guarantee I made my way to the mall. The manager happily told me that this only applied to LOST diamonds, not damaged (I'm a housewife...I don't do MANUAL labor!). This year I took the ring for it's annual clean and check..don't know why I bother! The manager said you know it's cracked? My reply:yes, but your people have already said they'd do nothing to make good. He said well, I'm the new manager here, and I say you'll have a new diamond for only the cost of mounting! I left the ring with him. We received a call about a month later, telling us that sorry, no replacement free, but we'll be happy to sell you a new $1200 diamond! (Like I'd even consider throwing away more money with Whitehall???) I've written to the manager, and to the corporate offices. I've had no reply from either place. Never again will I cross Whitehall's doorway!
