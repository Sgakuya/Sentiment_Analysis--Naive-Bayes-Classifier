good but not great. will probably go down as the least favorite of the prequels and the least favorite of the entire series. however it did have it's moments and there were no ewoks(at least jar jar could speak somewhat) in my mind two things stand out, the pod race(some of the best use of sound ever in a movie) and the darth maul/obiwan duel. say what you want about the matrix fight scenes but what ray park and ewen mcgregor did was unbelivable with only miminal special effects. i only wish was it had been longer(one on one) i got the sense of two guys just going at it all out.(which they did) however it seemed very real. nothing was sped up. wicked scene. best duel of the series so far. i saw this film about eight times in the theatre mostly just to watch that one scene over and over but stil wanting more. also the music was great as always especally duel of the fates which is to the prequels what the imperial march is to the original flims.
