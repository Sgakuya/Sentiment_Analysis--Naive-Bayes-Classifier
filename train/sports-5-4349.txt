The second best coach(behind dean smith) ' i'm so sick of people callin him a traitor... if u loved carolina u would be extatic! hes awesome dagummit! he's not afraid to get in a players face or take them outta the game for screwin up ' he will always be a tarheel... he coached at carolina before he even went to kansas... so why does kansas deserve him? they don't! and they suck this year because they don't have him, but carolina does and theres no doubt in my mind, carolina (lead by roy williams!!) will be the 2005 NCAA champsss!! we love you and appreciate everything you do roy!!! We're so glad you came home again! UPDATE! Excuse me.. dean smith won 2 NCAA tournaments... thats better then alot of other schools... so HAWKBRAND...i would stop tryin to sound cool UPDATE: I'm SO SICK of people sayin he hasnt achieved anything because he hasnt won a national championship... get over yourself.. have u won a national championship? At least he's been in final fours(this year for instance)! Can some coaches even say that? geez, go rag on them
