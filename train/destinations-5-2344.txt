The problem with the people who do not appreciate this city is you probably donÂ´t know how to treat or react to people from a different country. Did you learn much Hungarian to greet people with their native language? What do you do in USA when someone walks up to you and starts to speak french? I LOVE Budapest and see it as one of the best cities in all of Europe. The architecture is beautiful as are most of the people I have met. There are some dirty parts of the city but take a walk around New York city...... I have been traveling through Europe, East and West for 2 months and Budapest ranks tops on my list next to Rome and Barcelona. From one American to the others, wake up........
