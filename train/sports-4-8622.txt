KOBE BRYANT! WITH THAT NAME COMES GREATNESS! HE IS WITH NO DOUBT ONE OF OR THE BEST NBA PLAYERS OUT THERE TODAY! HE MAKES SURE THAT THE JOB GETS DONE! AND THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES. SHAQ IS TOO SENSITIVE AND SHOULD NOT TELL OTHER TEAMATES NOT TO PASS KOBE THE BALL! B4 KOBE I CANT SAY I WAS AS HARDCORE OF A LAKER FAN AS I AM NOW. AT TIMES KOBE DOES BALL HOG BUT HE ONLY DOES IT WHEN OTHERS ARENT GETTING THE JOB DONE! KOBE AND SHAQ MUST WORK TOGTHER THOUGH, IF THEY WANT ANOTHER RING.THE LAKERS CAN DO IT BUT IT HAS TO BE THE LAKERS AND NOT KOBE OR SHAQ! EVERY1 HAS TO PARTICIPATE!THE LAKERS WIN NOT JUST ONE OF TWO PEOPLE! AND ALSO KOBE IS THE FINEST NBA PLAYER TODAY!
