this game really works well, the jagex team has a nice way of making good updates while not changing anything really big so fast, world of warcraft is to hard for me, to many buttons you need to know, runescape is a game where it is easy to learn to play, tons of quests, (way more if your a member) of course, there are those mean jerks you meet that sware at you when you dont trade with them, but thats the only thing i could point out bad about that game, the graphics arent amazing but i almost think they made those grahpics like that on purpose, it adds a laugh to the game, the people who dont like this game PROBALY havnt given it much of a shot because the appearance of the game, i reccomemnd you dont become a member until you beat most of the quests
