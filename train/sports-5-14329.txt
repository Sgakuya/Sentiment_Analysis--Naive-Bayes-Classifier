The Best QB ever. With no defense and no running back to speak of he singlehandedly kept Miami Dolphins a contender. Consider this: only one losing season (6-10 in 1988) throughout his entire 17-year spell. During that spell, Miami defense is worse than 20th EVERY YEAR in both yeards allowed and points scored (except the last two years) During that spell, not a single Miami RB gets 1000 yards a season! The best, Mark Higgs, had 920. Only once in his 17-years career, the total Dolphins running game amount to more than 1750 yards. This was 1918 in his first season. Simply put, if Marino were on 49ers, he would win 6-7 Super Bowls. If Montana, Elway, or Kelly were on these very one-dimensional Dolphin teams, they would never even have made it to the play-offs. Well, maybe with Elway once or twice.
