Okay, for me it's a quasi-copycat of Civilization and Warcraft II -not too original- but it took the same concept to a different level. I never owned the game, but rather always played it at someone else's house. And while I was never the best at it, building up armies of 50 or more peons to wipe out other people's regular armies was never funner, battles with lions were a hoot, and the I could engage in developing civilizations and waging campaigns for many hours at a time without losing interest. Not the best game ever but certainly one of the best Real Time Strategy games ever and a blast to play. It really grows on you.
