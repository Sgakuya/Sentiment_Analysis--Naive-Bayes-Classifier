JRR TOLKEIN has not simply created a book... he has created a legacy... a whole other world. While some may complain about the length... you try writing the entire history of various (yes more than one) civilizations, and weave a compelling plot simultaneously! Its nearly impossible... but as Tolkein so kindly proved... not totally impossible. Its hard to describe the amazing amount of life he breathes into his characters... they all have unique personalities... living and fighting under a shadow that threatens to consume them all. Each of them brings a bit of variety... from Frodo's determination and resilience, to Aragorn's majesty and versatility... to even Pippin's immature innocence... Everyone has to love someone! And the plot... its impossible not to become totally into it. Its almost as if TOLKEIN drags you into his fictional world, making you pine for the grandeur of Lothlorien, or the glory of Gondor. And because he put so much effort into it, you can totally relate.. hes explained every legend from the beginning of time, to the end of the age... as long as you're already ensnared, there's no feeling bored! I'd say so much more, but then I'd probably give away the plot... or even worse the ending, and then obsess over the amazing characters (can't you simply imagine Aragorn being so totally gorgeous? and Legolas... *sigh*) Lol, so here I leave you. If you haven't read it, or dislike it... READ!!!!
