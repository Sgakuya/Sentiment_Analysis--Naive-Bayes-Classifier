This guy is a real dillema for me. On one hand I can appriciate someone like Buchanan who encourages high moral standards, especially as our own seem to be eroding away in this country. However, good morals come in many packages and I have a real problem with a man who can condemn myself and my family as infidel heathens without even meeting us. Just because we are muslim does not make us evil. High morals come in many different packages and I'm tired of seeing muslims, gays and foreigners who are kind, compassionate people get trounced by someone like Buchanan who cannot open his eyes wide enough to see that moral values are not confined to white american christians. Until he can be more accepting of others, I can't help but see him as an intolerant bigot who really misses the point.
