Fiscally one of the very best, one of the most intelligent. Great charisma and connecting power. NAFTA sucked but it was bi-partisan the selling of America, endorsed by every politrician looking for a fat handout from big business, that's why you can't find anyone talking about it. Yeah, a personnal lapse of judgement in the oral I mean oval office is unnacceptable. Was that the most they could dig up on him, that he's a real man and has a problem fighting off those instincts instilled by the maker in order to insure the survival of the species. I'm not saying it was right, I'm just saying was that it? Bush is a church dude who has administered all those state sponsored killings in Texas. No telling how many he will kill to get at that oil! They couldn't find anything worse? The best president since Truman.
