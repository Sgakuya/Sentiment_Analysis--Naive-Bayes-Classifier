Pittsburgh is underrated on this list. It's actually a surprisingly pleasant city. People think of Pittsburgh as a steel town, but all those steel mills have become loft condominiums. If you drive through the Ft. Pitt tunnel, the city suddenly appears and the skyline is beautiful. There are new stadiums for the sports teams along the river, restaurants all over the place in cute neighborhoods like Shadyside, and rolling hills great for biking surround the city. Pittsburgh is a well kept secret - it's not the cultural center it should be yet, but it doesn't deserve to be on this list with the far less interesting Phoenix and Atlanta.
