It's going to be a long hot summer here in the desert. The D-backs have lost thier power with Alomar and Sexson out for the season, and Johnson ain't getting any younger. Team Owner Jerry Colangelo bought a World Series title a few years ago, and the team has not aged well since. Steve Finley and Luis Gonzolez have maybe one or two more good years in them, and Mark Grace not graces the announcers booth. A very poor start has left this team deep in the hole this season, and I don't think they will be able to recover enough to get into the play-offs, but they might gain some respectabilty. If Bob Brenly doesn't do something soon, he'll be posting his resume on Monster.com any day now. UPDATE: Brenly is gone, the team is on the verge of losing 100 games. Interim Manager Pedrique will more than likely be gone at the conclusion of the season. It's really sad, as this team had the talent and the potential at the begining of the season. Injuries sidelined Richie Sexson and Luiz Gonzolaez, and Steve Finley went to the Dodgers. Bad front office managent has killed what could have been a dynasty.
