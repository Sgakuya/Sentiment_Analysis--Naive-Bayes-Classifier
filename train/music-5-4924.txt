Gilman has god-given talent, which has been meticulously developed. He may be a Yankee, but he understands, and clearly loves country music, and Country music is darn lucky to have him. The original tracks (Oklahoma, Snake, Voice) on the album are remarkable, and the up-tempo tracks were great displays of Gilmans energy (She likes me, Litlle Bitty, Little things). The love ballads (Whats forever, Till I Can Make it, Hero) were obviously picked because they showcase Gilman's range and voice command, and he's got plenty of both. I intended to point out some of the shortcomings of this album (by the way, I think One Voice is musically the weakest song on the album), but finding flaws is hard with this kid's debut. We won't likely hear another like him any time soon.
