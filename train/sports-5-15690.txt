Currently, the best reciever in the NFL. Steve Smith breaks big plays game after game. He is a workhorse, and, despite his fancy celebration dances, he is much more modest than you'd think. He is exactly what I'd want in a receiver. He has over 1400 yards so far this season and 11 TDs and is closing in on 100 receptions. All this in a frame that's just 5'9" and 185 lbs... And that's what he lists at, so you gotta wonder if he's even that big! UPDATE: The Seahawks showed that it is possible to stop Steve Smith. All you have to do is hope that the Panthers are on their 4th string running back and double or triple cover him all game. He's the only reliable target on the whole Panthers team, so you really can get away with single coverage on everyone else and bear down on him... assuming that the Panther's running game has been dismantled somehow... such as injuries. Still the best reciever in the NFL. It's going to be up to the Panthers to find a reliable #2 reciever in the offseason.
