Cheju Island is like not other place in S Korea. It's dubbed the "Hawaii of Korea" I like golfing at some of the courses in Cheju. The beaches are excellent...in fact has the best beaches compared to those 'crowded' beaches in Pusan (never know whether those millions of people pee in the water while having a day at the beach). I also did some snorkel diving two summers ago, catching fish and some mussels. There was also this slope where objects would roll up the slope rather than down the slope. Forgot the name of that place. The small downside is the cost of food...etc...but hey...it's an island..and I suppose shipping cost is factored into their food and gas prices!
