I'm gonna repeat someone elses comment here and say Yum . Colin Farrel is supersexy indeed. You can't beat the accent and he's so out there and open and I can appreciate that. He's got the reputation as the bad boy/party boy and that's fine, he's young and that's what youth is for. He's in a certain position and he's working it. He's not my usual type and I think that if I had just seen a picture of him I would have said cute guy and that's about it but it wasn't until I'd seen him interviewed and he had such an in-your-face attitude that I really took notice. He has that anti-star star thing going on, he seems like he's really trying to maintain his roots and to make sure that everyone knows that he takes no b.s. Beyond all that he's a very talented actor and has a great deal of range. I'd like to see him in a big romantic lead. I'll be buying a ticket for that.
