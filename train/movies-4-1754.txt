What a creative, original film. I spent large portions of the movie trying to prevent my mind from wandering to take on the issue of how hard it would be to live your life without a short term memory - having to write things down, take pictures, tattoo yourself, and have absolute faith in your system. Then I spent some time trying to poke holes in the confusing, unexpected twists and turns of the plot. Then I tried to make sense of a movie whose scenes are shown in backwards chronological order. By the time I got through all of these mental exercises, the movie was over - and I was left with a vague, confused feeling that I had enjoyed it. Don't watch this movie unless you are prepared to concentrate.
