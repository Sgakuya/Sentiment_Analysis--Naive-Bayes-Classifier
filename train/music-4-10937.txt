A cool cd for all you party peeps out there. I like the group NSYNC but not as much as BSB. I do like the tracks bye bye bye and it's gonna be me they have that cool party feel I like, the track space cowboy ios a solid rap-falva hit with left eye. I like it and several people have made japanese anime music videos to it and I think it goes good with cowboys in outer space. I also like the song this I promise you it's a good slow-jam, I also get my party on with the bringin da noise it's one of those with the club flava going on! I think this cd is one of those listen to it of your hyper and happy cd's that I really can't get enough of!
