San Antone pulled it off! Horry's got 6 rings with 3 different teams! Timmy's got his 3rd MVP trophy and another ring (even though I think Ginobli should have been the MVP with as much heart as he had). They were the best team in the league this year. The series went to seven and no one can say that they just got lucky. They fought hard all the way to game 7. It just depended upon who had the legs and the heart to pull off a win. San Antone did it. They beat a hell of a Pistons team. I don't see how they only had one foul the whole second half (until they had to start fouling). It's just amazing to me that you can play such hard nose defense without fouling. It's crazy! But anyway....way to go fellas! The trophy is back in the heart of Texas where it belongs! YEEEEEEHAAAAAW!!!
