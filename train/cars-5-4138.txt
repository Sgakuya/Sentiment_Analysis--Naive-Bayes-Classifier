Incredible vehicle. You know what I like most? Irritating the idiots that don't own one and make worthless evaluations. They are the suckers of the world, having opinions on issues when they don't even know what the issues are. A subculture of the uninformed. Anyway...I have the AWD GT w/1SC package and love it. Having looked at hundreds of reviews from owners (not lookers), I've yet to find one that is not only pleased but actually excited about their purchase. It took me 10 minutes driving one and I was sold. The vehicle makes a statement about the owners....confidence is not determined by the little people with little minds.
