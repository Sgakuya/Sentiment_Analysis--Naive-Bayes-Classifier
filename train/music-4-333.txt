I remember first hearing Just a Girl on the radio in 1995. I thought Gwen Stefani s voice was interesting, so I stopped by a store to check out Tragic Kingdom. On the back of the CD there was a picture of a drop-dead beautiful blond, and I remember thinking there s no way that could be the singer because if someone that hot was singing songs that catchy, it would have been all over MTV by then. Turns out I was just about two weeks early, because before too long you couldn t watch MTV for longer than 10 minutes without seeing Gwen s face. Well I bought Tragic Kingdom, and after five years I still enjoy listening to it every now and then.
