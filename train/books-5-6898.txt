how does a kid raised by martians relate to humans? thou art god, of course: it's the only common denominator. with a head full of martian philosophy, he's completely devoid of guile, or evil, (almost as if he never had a mother? heinlein is a raging sexist) and he's also telepathic and telekinetic. thus when he's established his little empire, he's none too popular around angry mobs. few living gods are. heinlein focuses too much on the finer things in life: his characters are (generally) long-lived, happy with life, wealthy, intelligent: they rarely suffer hardships that they can't overcome, and like some characters on star trek thei humanity is therefore questionable, i think. you never see them tested, you never get to see what they're made of. this book epitemizes that tendency, in which rob writes off humanity with a few trendy catch phrases from mars and incidentally proves that there's an afterlife, and that the kind of people he likes wind up running all things when they've died. though i criticize his politics, it's without question worth reading.
