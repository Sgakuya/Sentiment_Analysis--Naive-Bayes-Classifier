Every time I end up going against my resolution to never shop there again (for convenience--proximity), I end up thinking I am part of some prank show or psych. experiment to see how many buttons these WalMart people can push; 1. Professionalism: non-existent 2. Customer Service is a nightmare whether I'm there to exchange something or return it (with a receipt or without, it does not make a difference) 3. The floor people have no clue about their merchandise, nor basic human skills, like greeting (I won't push it and ask for them to smile) We had one cashier get all bent out of shape because one item had the wrong price and we wanted it taken off, he rolled his eyed, huffed, and said:"What the hell do you want?!".. huhhh?! we complained to the manager who did not seem too shocked to hear that, and he gave us a $10-gift card (yeah, so I can make sure I go back and get abused for 10 bucks.. thanks but no thanks).. Oh, and this cashier still has a job with WalMart.. Sweet! Conclusion: If you have no skills whatsoever, if you've run off all your friends and no one seems to like you, if you cannot get a job to save your life, go to WalMart, they will be more than glad to make you part of their team.. If you are in search for cheap prices, convenience and you require no more than a pleasant person to help you, WalMart is not the place to be.. Go to Target. They might not be the smiliest bunch but at least they're trained to be professional and helpful, when needed.
