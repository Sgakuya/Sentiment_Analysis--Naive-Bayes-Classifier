I admit I have not read a Harry Potter book and have only seen the first movie. But I feel reading the books is not necessary to comment on the miracle of Potter. In my opinion Ms. Rowling is a genius. In this day and age it is dificult to get most s to read even so much as a brochure, let alone getting children to read a book. Her latest Harry Potter release is over 800 pages in length. Many an would shy away from a book that long. Most children won't read something without more pictures than there are pages of text. And yet Harry Potter is nothing short of miraculous. Ms.Rowling's latest book is setting record sales around the world. Thanks to her a new generation of children are reading like never before. I think this is wonderful. It is a sad pity that there are critics of Harry Potter, those who want the books taken off library shelves claiming they will lead children into black magic and occult. They seem to have forgotten the joys of make believe. I think we should praise Ms. Rowling and her works. It doesn't matter if some find the material cliched and simplistic or not. She deserves praise because of what Harry Potter represents: the rebirth of reading for children.
