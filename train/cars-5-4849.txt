2002 F-250 SuperDuty, Crewcab, Powerstroke, 4X4, Long box. This truck is a monster! I wouldn't have any other. Back in '99 I wanted one but bowed to family pressure and got a GMC Suburban. When it crapped out (after only 2 1/2 years and 45,000 miles) I went back and got what I originally wanted. In 8 months I've put on 20,000 miles and haven't had a single problem. The ride is great. I get 15-18 MPG. The only fault I can find is the turning radius....in a small crowded parking lot its a real pain in the ass. I can't understand why 50% of those giving their opinion rate as terrible. I did notice that none of them left a comment! Adios
