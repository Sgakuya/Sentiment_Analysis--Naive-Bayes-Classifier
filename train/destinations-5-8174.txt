We drove from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon-total drive time 10 hours- but well worth it! The sheer scale and beauty of the Grand Canyon is almost indescribable. We were surprised how much we loved it and we enjoyed watching the clouds go over and changing the color of the canyon every 5 seconds. We went at the first of May and it even snowed on us for 3 minutes! There are a lot of foreign travelers but that does add to it. Also it is 20.00 per car to enter the Canyon and I would suggest eating before or after you come to the Canyon, food is very expensive and bring bottled water with you because again bottled water can run you 3.50. We went to the South Rim and every bit of it is gorgeous, we are even going to blow up some of the pictures we took to hang up. It is a good place for a family to go and every member will enjoy it. The park rangers are very helpful and can answer any question you ask. This is a natural wonder that should not be missed!
