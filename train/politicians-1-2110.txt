Gray Davis is just another bleeding heart liberal puke. He sists there in California unable to help his own state and blames his problems on Texas. Governor, you and your tree-hugging, socialist cohorts have created California's problems, not Texas. You are like people on welfare. You want someone else to fix what you have managed to screw up. If you will stop letting the likes of Diane Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Maxine Waters and people of their ilk run your state, you wouldn't be having these problems. As far as the Texas energy companies go, they are screwing us too. Reliant Energy has raised its rates twice in the last 9 months to help offset its production costs. That didn't seem to be a problem when they shelled out $300,000,000 to name the Astrodome and adjoining facilities. See Governor. We all have problems with energy companies so quit peeing on everyone elses leg and do something to fix your own.
