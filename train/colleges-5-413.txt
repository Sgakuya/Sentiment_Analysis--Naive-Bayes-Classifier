I am currently a MBA student at Lancaster University. As an American I had an ample number of MBA programmes with which to apply, but Lancaster University in the north of England is where I found my home. The Lancaster MBA has a five star rating for research excellence and this research excellence is transfered into the quality of teaching at Lancaster. The program is one year long and has opportunities for international exchanges, management consultancy projects, and top corporate and EU guest lecturers. Our current MBA class of 75 is a friendly and diverse group from 22 home countries around the world. If you want a top MBA programme that is up and coming on corporations' recruitment list, look at Lancaster and see if it is the place for you.
