Incredible leadership day of 9-11 and days after. Reinvigorated NYC by reducing crime which enticed new businesses to the city and made it safe for the general public, cut taxes which get this- increased tax revenue to the city treasury, he reducing the welfare rolls and just over all was a great mayor. I had the privledge of seeing him on his Leadership tour and was very impressed with his command of the stage, delivery and locution. I have a problem with the inherent contradictions of his public philosophy regarding abortion and gay marriage but as a mayor they did not play a role. (gets only 4 stars for being a Yankee fan...LOL)
