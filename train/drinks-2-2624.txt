The thing that's tough about judging things like Coffee is that so much of what you like or dislike in coffee can be a result of how it is prepared. For instance, I love Dunkin Donuts coffee, awesome, great stuff but there are many Dunkin Donuts shops that prepare it terribly so it tastes watered down and just flavorless. You tell this when you brew your own at home, more grounds or less grounds, more water or less water. Anyway back to the point which is I had this coffee at several different places and I gotta say YES it could be poorly prepared in each place BUT from my experience this c-o-f-f-e-e b-l-o-w-s!!!
