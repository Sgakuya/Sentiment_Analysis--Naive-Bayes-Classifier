Best all-purpose player in NFL. He's really natural out there, he's got good instincts, vision. His balance and footwork are excellent. He's at his best on sweeps, outside pitches, off-tackle stuff. There he can cut back, accelerate in the lane and explode. Where he struggles is between the tackles, especially in short yardage. He tries to dance and tip-toe around to make a big play instead of lowering the shoulder and pounding his way in. Recieving the ball, he's unmatched among halfbacks in the NFL. He's got great hands. He's the best at setting up screens, he does it so naturally. After the catch, he jukes defenders really well, makes guys miss. He's like another WR in the backfield.
