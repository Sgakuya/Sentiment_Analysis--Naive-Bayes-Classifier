Say, does anyone know where I can find a copy of the movie The Girl Most Likely To ? I think it came out in 1973 or thereabouts, and starred Stockard Channing, one of the Grease actresses. The Girl Most Likely To (not to be confused with the similarly titled The Girl Most Likely ) was a dark comedy, about an ugly girl everyone made fun of, but who got plastic surgery after a car accident and was turned into a beautiful young woman. Then she used her new good looks to get revenge on everyone who had mistreated her earlier. It's a quirky comedy that never shows up on TV anymore. If any of you have info that will help, let me know.
