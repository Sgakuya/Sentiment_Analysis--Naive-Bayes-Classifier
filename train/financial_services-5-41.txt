USBank is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. If you are aware of policies, if your branch employees are kind human beings(as they are told to be), and if you truly keep a register to manage your own money, you would be just as thrilled. This is the ONLY bank that I have seen not throw money away on commercials, billboards, and needless advertising. They throw their money into the customers. I understand that fees can be frustrating and I can make a courtesy refund here and there, but when it is obvious that the customer is not balancing nor keeping track in a diligent way, I can't continuously give fees back. EVERY bank is that way. EVERY bank charges Overdraft fees, and EVERY bank has funds availability. As for the $100 from the check being available right away, that means $100 is available. Whether you choose to take it in cash or deposit it in your account, you only get $100 until the check clears (overnight typically). Its a check, not cash or guaranteed funds. If you have the money in your account to cover that check if it is no good, you should have no trouble cashing the check and depositing the cash. USBank has spent the last two years on a new focus. Customer service. Random surveys are being completing, employees are being ranked based on their service (individually!), and managers are tracking this! We get paid bonuses to givegreat customer service. The better we are the more they will give us in bonus. If that is not a very effective way to give consumers the very best service, I don't know what is. I have been with the company for 5 years and counting. I will never bash this company nor say a negative word. I have worked at other banks and have realized the true meaning of service and great products. We are steps ahead in products, fees, and service.
