A comment about Mr. Obama states: What a breath of fresh air Obama has been in this fatalistic election campaign. There is at least a glimmer of hope if he can be part of our political future. Oh...down with Bush. Can you possibly gush anymore about a senator who has hasnt even been in office long enough to achieve anything? Contrast that to the comments made about Mr. Watts: Can you say oreo? and Mr. Keyes Oreo. I suspect scorp66 wouldn't have dared make an Oreo statement about an African-American democrat, as that would be racist. Minorities are only admired by the left if they are LIBERAL minorities. If they think and act independent from that, theyre called Uncle Toms, unqualified, a tool of the Republican Party or Oreo. Now thats tolerance and diversity. Oh what hypocrites you liberals are.
