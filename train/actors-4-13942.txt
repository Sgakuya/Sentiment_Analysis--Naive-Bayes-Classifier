She is cool. I didn't like her in Notting Hill but loved her in Erin Brockovich. I think she's made a lot of entertaining movies (and some flops like I Love Trouble with Nick Nolte). She's enterprising as well and she does a lot of charity work, in addition to the stuff that is publicized. She's just a girl who likes what she does, and that is to her credit because she sought after what she wanted for a career and succeeded. She seems like a truly happy person inside and she shares joy with others. I am envious she has such a cute and down to earth boyfriend like Benjamin Bratt. My favorite Julia Roberts' role was actually early in her career: Daisy in Mystic Pizza. She has a sense of humor in it, plus she was good in the scene where she comforts her sister, Kat. She wasn't too skinny in that movie- in my opinion. Is her hair naturally curly? That would be so awesome. I am just in awe of her as a person and as an actress and I wish her all the best. I can't wait to see Oceans 11 with her and George Clooney among others. I don't think she has worked with Robert DeNiro yet but she has a long career ahead of her because her talent comes from within and isn't based solely on looks. Julia, you go!
