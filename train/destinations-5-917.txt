Greece is one of the five most beautiful countries in the world. I was stationed there in the Navy from 1989 to 1991 and I loved it. I love their Greek salad with olive oil and goats' cheese, souvlaki, kalamaki and other foods. The mountain and beach scenery is priceless. Bring your camera if you go. It's well worth it. See the Acropolis and other ruins around the mainland such as Meteora, Corinth, Delphi, Sounion and Thessaliniki. Then tour the Greek islands for some good nightlife. Great beaches on Crete, Paros, Ios, Tinos, Mykonos, etc. The beaches on Mykonos are NUDE. So, make sure you bring your birthday suit with you. The Greek people overall are friendly but a few don't like Americans because we are an arrogant people and we are what they used to be about 2000 years ago. It used to be very affordable when the Drachma was the monetary unit. Not anymore since they adopted the Euro. It's expensive now. Sooooo..... Get your souvenirs, pictures and experiences when visiting Greece! And last, but not least, make sure to visit the island of Santorini(the best one) and see the Minoan ruins. Greece IS the history and culture of the world. And yes, Greek women do take it up the ass. I had a brief affair with a Greek girl down on Crete and she let me hump her from behind one time.
