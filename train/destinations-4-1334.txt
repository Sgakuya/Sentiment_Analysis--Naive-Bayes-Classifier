Guten morgen, I wish to be woken up, the wake-up call says. They must have been joking! I'd never even gone to sleep because I was looking around at all of the sights so much. Germany is such a cool place, with great food and hospitable people, with those heartbreaking ruins of the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps, and of course with the famous Munich Hilton. Better than any room service you could eveer hope to find in the US, according to most people whove stayed there. I never actually stayed in the MH, but I've heard the fantasy stories about it. Like nasha said, you should learn about ten words of German before going here. If you say so much as Guten tag the people there will love you. Germany is a cool country, but not quite deserving of five stars. Take care, everyone!
