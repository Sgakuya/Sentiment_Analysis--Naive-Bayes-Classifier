Matthew Perry is the hottest guy in the world! love it when he plays Chandler Bing on F*R*I*E*N*D*S! I know that he was on drugs and people say that hes bad but if he was (bad), he wouldn't go to rehab or get help! (Duh...) I really want to meet him someday. I wish I could marry him, but theres a HUGE age difference! He's so funny and really hot! (Yes, even when he gained weight and got really skinny) So his movies aren't blockbusters, I LOVED THEM! And when I heard that he was in a car crash, I CRIED! (Call me a crybaby, I DON'T CARE!!! LoL) I think hes a great guy and that he really deserves the 5 star rating. '*ChandlersSweetAngel*'
