Everybody's got a strong reaction to Harvard, whether or not they actually know anything about it. It's tempting to say things like Harvard is a bastion of elitism and you can get a better education for cheaper at a state school because that puts Harvard into an easy-to-define category of Snob School. (Note that some people who complain about Harvard are peeved because they wouldn't be able to get admitted. That's fine, as we're all resentful of groups we aren't invited to be part of. Just make sure you're aware of the bias there.) Don't hate anybody because they've gone to Harvard. On the other hand, don't start kissing their feet, for the love of God! That's even worse. Let them prove themselves; let them be people rather than Harvard graduates. Harvard is a collection of resources, first and foremost. Ask for a ham sandwich, and you get a pig and a loaf of bread; it's what you make of the books and minds surrounding you that determines whether or not you're getting a good education. You're in charge here. Enough with the Harvard-hating, enough with the Harvard worship. I'm an environmentalist, a writer, and a web designer... and I'm a Harvard undergrad, so I guess I know whereof I speak. I applied to Harvard as sort of a joke, and I very nearly went elsewhere just because I was a rebellious little thing and I didn't like the idea of succumbing to The Establishment. Well, The Establishment hasn't conquered me yet. I've got lovely, humble friends who I feel sure are going to change the world for the better, and I'm in an intellectual paradise where I can learn about anything I choose. That said, I've got friends who came here purely for the brand appeal, and they're miserable. Don't stay away because it's Harvard ; don't come because it's Harvard ; look carefully and decide for yourself.
