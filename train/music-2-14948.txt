Well, I bought this c.d. for Christmas when I was in eighth grade. It used to be in my o.k. c.d. list. Now it holds maybe , well three songs that I can even listen to without gaging. Radio Head and Garbage are timeless. Their contribution to the sountrack are in my opinion the most impressive. To You Everything I Bestow, if that is the name of the song (I have forgotten over the years) is a very good love song. I forgot who the artist is or if he went anywhere, but that song is beautiful. It can still make me tear up. Other than that, there is not much to it. A run of the mill Everclear song, a pretty yet cliche Des're song, an off beat tragically uninspired song by the Butthole Surfers (whom I am still a big fan of) and that horrible You and me always and forever slop. If you are a fan of Any of the above mentioned bands then check this album out. But uver all this is a rather passable live with or without c.d.
