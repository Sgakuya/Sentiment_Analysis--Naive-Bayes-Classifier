Yikes. My fiance was trapped by Sprint, and if it weren't for my divinely-inspired powers of persuasion (vs. her screaming motherf*ckingc*cksucker at the top of her lungs at the supposed customer support personell) she still would be. The service was pathetic, dropped calls were a way of life, bills were staggering, billing policy was asinine, insulting and borderline entrapment, and the customer support people had a total 'tude when I told them we wanted to cancel. The 19-year-old f*ckwit on the other end told me he couldn't cancel her policy, so I said the magic words (I suggest you write them down): We're moving. He was like, So? Well, I needed to enlighten the poor retard: FCC code was working for me, and his poor 19-year-old ass couldn't f*ck with the FCC mojo I was workin'. The truth is, all you need to do to get out of ANY cell phone contract--and this is WITHOUT a penalty, thank you very much-- is go to the Sprint or Nextel or whatever kiosk at the mall, look at the coverage map and find out what part of your state has no coverage whatsoever. That's where you tell the company you're moving to. Here in NH, finding a non-coverage area isn't hard to do. By Federal law and FCC code, the cellular provider is REQUIRED to discontinue service without a penalty if you move to an area that they don't cover. It's the LAW, beeeatch! So, that's how we escaped Sprint. I feel bad for the rest of you poor dudes who got suckered into their lousy service. Can you hear me now? Hello? Hello? Are you there? Are you there? Hello? Dude? F*CKING SPRINT PCS! ARRRRGGGHHH!!!!
