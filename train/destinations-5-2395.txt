One of my favourite cities in the world. The best confluence of the Middle East & Europe. Besides checking out the typical tourist draws, you must shop at the Spice Bazaar, watch the Whirling Dervishes during their unique & dizzying form of prayer, and have a turkish bath. Also, the club and bar scene was unexpectedly liberal and cool for a Muslim country. I was surprised to see girls in mini-skirts and off-the-shoulder dresses, all drinking alcohol (which is banned by Islam) and smoking. If you can, see Turkey with a native. It will totally enhance your experience. Oh yeah, another plus? A lot of people speak English. Their best universities teach classes in English.
