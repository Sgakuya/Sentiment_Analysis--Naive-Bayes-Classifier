I enjoy watching Denzel Washington and believe he is a pretty good actor. I don't consider him to be great but then he still has time to change my mind. I couldn't thoroughly enjoy him in Training Day because I really hated the movie. I am not certain an Oscar for that role was legitimate. But I look at is as a make-up for being passed in Malcolm X. His Oscar for Glory was completely valid. But what I really loved him in was Man On Fire. He is 100% believable as a drunk with an extremely hard exterior who finally gets his heart touched by a young girl he grows to genuinely love and protect. I am waiting to see more but it seems like he alternates between great movies and horrible ones. And I would like to see a bit more range. I fear he is falling into that "one character role" as most actors do after they have been around for some time.
