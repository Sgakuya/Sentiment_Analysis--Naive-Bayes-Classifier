 It's the biggest god damn hole in the world! - C.W.G Fantastic trip! If you go you have to hike to the bottom, and no taking those damn donkeys! It's a long hot hike down but well worth it. Take the north rim if you can it's much less crowded and along those same lines more beautiful because of it. Campsites in the canyon are hard to come by so you need to make a reservation months in advance, or take a chance and get there hoping someone else will cancel and get their spot, we did so you might get lucky. Bring plenty of water you're gonna need it, oh and bring a buck or two cause along the trail at the bottom of the north rim there's a guy who lives down there and has a big old jug of iced lemonade for a couple of coins and believe you me you're gonna want that juice.
