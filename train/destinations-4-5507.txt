I think it is a wonderful place to visit, but living there is a totally different story. I came across a lot of redneck hippies. I also came across a lot of rednecks straight up. Many were racist or just narrowminded. The state is divided between conservatives and liberals. Oregon is beautiful because there is something to see no matter where you are at. However, finding a job in this state will prove to be quite a challenge. There's a lot of people starving over there because they can't find work. At least that's what I would see on the news daily when I used to live there. I donated food to the shelters and food banks because I felt bad for all of the hungry people in Portland. So if you visit don't forget to feed the people. Despite Oregon's problems, crime isn't as big of a problem as in California (where I now live). There have been people moving from troubled cities across the US who have been bringing in their problems and crime to Oregon.
