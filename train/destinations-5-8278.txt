If you have a disability, think twice before going to Disneyland. The poicy has changed recently. Before the change, if your child had a disability, you would recieve a pass to bypass the long waiting. Granted now they have the fastpass, although it gives you a time and a hour window to go back to the attraction, you may only get one fastpass at a time per ticket.And not all attractions offer the fastpass. Which means alot of running back and forth. We dealt with that, what upset me was the coldness of the customer service rep when I asked about the special pass. A few days before I had spoken to someone on the phone at the Disneyland resort, and mentioned my sons problems, asked if I needed a Doctors note, she said it would not hurt to do so. Never mentioning that they no longer offered this pass. I would not have booked the trip had I known this. In line before me were two obvious disabled children who would not need a wheelchair but obviously would not beable to stand in line long enough to enjoy themselves, they were also sent away with the advice of using a fastpass. You will get use to it said the rep. I thought Disneyland was for the CHILDREN, Walt would be very upset about this. I remember as a child how wonderful Disneyland was. A place for kids. If you have a disabilty, be sure you bring a wheelchair. If you get tired easy, suffering with cancer, mentally challanged, name it,If you do not have one rent one, or you can rent one there AS SUPPLIES LAST. Or you could buy your way to the front of the line, but what family has that kind of money when they put every ounce of their lives including love time and money into their children. I will never step foot in that park again.
