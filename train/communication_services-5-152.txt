GET IT. The good: - Unlimited local and long distance for '$40/month including Canada. - Cheap international rates. Check vonage.com for details. - you can check your voice mail over any phone, on the internet, voice mails can be downloaded, voice mails can be E-MAILED to an address you provide. - You can specify the options for call forwarding to any phone number you provide. You can provide a forward to number in case your ISP is down, or in the case of an unaswered call. - You can use any phone you want. Vonage sends you a Cisco box that handles the connections to make it exactly liek a normal phone. - You can take your Cisco box with you if you travel and calls will be routed to the phone plugged into it (given it's on a network) - You can keep your old phone number if you switch from an encumbant provider - You can get ANY area code you want. - Digital phone quality is so much better than regular phone service. All of the above is free with the '$40/month cost. You will also need a router if you don't already have one. Vonage offers a good netgear four port for a reasonable price. The bad: - If you need an always on phone, your uptime will only be as good as your ISP (for me not a problem). - If you are used to having multiple jacks throughout your house you will need to re-think how to place your phones. I plug a phone cord splitter into my Cisco box, then out of one I plug in one of those expandable base phones that you can add wireless phones to (that do not need to be plugged into a phone jack). And in the other I plug in a typical 2.4 Ghz wireless phone.
