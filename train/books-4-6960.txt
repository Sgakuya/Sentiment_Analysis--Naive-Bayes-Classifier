A superb parable (made into a watchable movie by Francois Truffaut) about a future age in which firemen no longer put out fires, but instead start them: their goal is purge the world of books, with their inconvenient, contradictory, and messy ideas. (It takes off from an idea given in the Grand Inquisitor episode of the Brothers Karamazov we just wanted mankind to be happy... the mystery and uncertainty made the people miserable... if we could give them the truth to worship and accept, we could take on the responsibility of dealing with the uncertainty of the cosmos ourselves, and by taking on this suffering we would be Christ ourselves...) The ending of the book is a little weak but overall it is magnificent; don't miss it.
