I can't believe that anyone, that is educated in politics ,can find much fault with John McCain, and I did say educated in politics, not someone sitting in front of the TV listening to the Republican spin. Tell me how many other politicians want the dirty money out of politics?Money for favors. He speaks for the American people, not the special interests. Do you realize that when McCain votes againest a big Republican legislation it is because of the pork added to the bill, the wasteful spending of the taxpayers money, and he will tell all on his website, he lists every pork barrel spending that pops up in every piece of legislation. So lets see, no dirty money in politics, and no wasting American taxpayer money, and some of you have a problem with this?
