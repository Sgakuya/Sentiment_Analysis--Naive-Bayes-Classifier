a highly recognizable talent and deservedly slow. a few years back i thought Hollywood had chucked Meryl aside in the same manner they'd done w/a host of other talented older women, but having resurrected herself in indie fare such as Adaptation and The HOurs as well as fantastic cable films like Angels in America Meryl seems to have revived her career in full force. that is not to take away the credentials of the past for this highly talented actress. when one considers Meryl Streep they must look at films like Silkwood, Sophie's Choice, and Out of Africa to see that she stood far above her peers at a younger age as well.
