Ha. I've read all these comment and all I can do is laugh. I've had some good and some bad experiences with Blockbuster Video. But I've had good and bad experiences everywhere. OF COURSE blockbuster makes money off late fees! Do you boycot the Public Library because you had to pay because you voided the signed agreement that said you would return your BORROWED items on time? No. If you look at it, Blockbuster impliments late fees to DETER you from turning a movie in late....I hate late fees. They tick me off. But thats a risk I'm willing to take when I don't take my movies back on time. If you cannot bring them back by noon because of work, take them back the night before!
