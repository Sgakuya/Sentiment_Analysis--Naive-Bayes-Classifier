I appoligise for my earlier post. PBeaver told me his stats, and he deffinately is a legand. However, I also cant give him a 5.... Its just because I truely belive that Ted Willams should have the best baseball player ever title. Back in the days Babe played, it was easier to get into the Big leauges, than when other greats where in, so baseball was easyer. Hell, my grandfather made it into the minor leauge system of the yankees at the time of DiMagio! Plus, like someone pointed out earlyer, he would get drunk and stuff like that. If you look at Ted Williams, he has had SO much success, on top of the fact that there were more people that were stars! take today for example. Bonds, Sosa, Gonzalaz, and others, who are just starting to show their stuff. Going back to what I said about the majors not being developed when Ruth played. Before Ruth hit any single season home run statistics, the record was 27,set in the year 1884, wich was about 40 years before the Babe.
