I have attenede the DeVry online course format for one session and so far I am impressed at the courses being offered (BIS 150 and MGMT404). The instructors appear to be experts in their respective fields. Previously I had attended University of Maryland in residence and before that I attended a private Catholic college called Mount Marty. The delivery format is very easy to use compared to others that friends or coworkers are attending (embry riddle and UMUC). The only complaint I have is that most of the online courses require you to use the E-Book and if you want to order a hard copy of the course material you are still required to pay for the e-book. The e-book is a pdf format of the actual books, but I personally like a physical copy versus a digital edition. Tuition is a bit steep compared to public universities,but I have the GIbill and military discount; between these and the FAFSA I only have to pay for some of the course materials. For those without the GIBill or other types of tuition reimbursemet I definately feel sorry for you, but your degree is worth it in the long run (college graduates earn on average 1 million more in their life time compared to a high school diploma).
