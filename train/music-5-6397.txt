This album is really good; however, I really don't think it measures up to his older stuff. The music is not as versatile as earlier albums and the music is pretty generic. In the past the music alone would be enough to determine that it is Alice Cooper. I think it has a lot to do with the producer Bob Marlette. I think he had Alice Cooper doing things that just aren't Alice Cooper. I just went to see him live the other day and have to say that this is the best concert I have ever seen. This man can still top the rest while even topping himself. If you ever have an opportunity to see his show, do it. Even if you don't like the music the show is worth it. And as I said about Marlette may just be true. These songs from Brutal Planet were 120x better live. If they relese a live album from this tour do not hesitate to buy it.
