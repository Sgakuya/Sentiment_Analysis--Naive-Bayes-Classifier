I admire Wal-Mart. They are ruthlessly efficient and good at what they do, and their efficiency translates into unbelievably low prices. I watched a 60 Minutes Special on Wal-Mart's use of technology as a strategic advantage, and it is impressive. Everyone's talking about how Google and MSN are locked in this struggle to the death for world dominance. I would not rule Wal-Mart out of this equation. If any company is well positioned to capitalize on the Chinese market, it's Wal-Mart. On a personal note, I went to school with Sam Walton's granddaughter (Cary, Kerry?). She was sweet and humble as could be (and beautiful), and left me with an overall good impression of the family behind this corporate behemoth.
