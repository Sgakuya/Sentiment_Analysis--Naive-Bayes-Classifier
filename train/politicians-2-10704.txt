I have never been a fan of Richard Nixon and my opinion is not based entirely on the infamous Watergate fiasco. I vaguely remember when he ran for office in 1960 against Mr. Eastcoast Uppercrust Don t-I-Look-Swell-on-TV Kennedy. When the defeated Nixon first had the gall to show up again in the late 1960 s I can remember my grandmother (a lifelong, staunch Republican BTW) remarking that she didn t trust him because, after losing the race with Kennedy, he stated emphatically that he would NOT run again so he was very obviously a liar. Family members laughed at her remarks and at me for repeating them but in the end, they would all have to admit even if only to themselves she was right. After having been an eyewitness to most of his odd political career I do find it amusing these days to read input from the X-gen and younger crowd concerning Nixon and what he was or was not stuff they ve no doubt gleaned from their trusty revisionist history books. The funniest part is that these poor little saps don t even seem to realize that if you just changed the names in many of these statements (i.e., lied to our faces on national television ) we could be easily be talking about Mr. Southwest Middlecrust Don t-I-Look-Like-Kennedy Clinton. Oh well, I guess we re all entitled to our own demons.
