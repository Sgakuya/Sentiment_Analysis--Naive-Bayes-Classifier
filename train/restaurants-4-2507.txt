I love McDonald's and hope that they don't screw something up like most other fast food places I've been to. I love their fries (they're #2 behind Chick-Fil-A but I don't eat there anymore) and their side salad is okay...just like any other fast food restaurant. There have been a couple bad experiences I've had with McDonald's but for the most part it's good. Although, as I was on vacation out to California I ordered their fruit and walnut salad 3 times and every location was out of the walnuts but only one told me at the time I ordered, the other one told me as they were giving me my order, and the last one didn't tell me at all.
