Though Robin Williams puts in a very believable performance, One Hour Photo is still little more that a 90-minute bore. Regardless the film s ability to evoke a bland eeriness it still fails to completely intrigue. The story is plodding and fairly predictable. The characterizations are frail and incomplete and almost as blas and boring as the fictional discount store (ala Wal-Mart) where William s character lives out the public portion of his cheerless and troubled existence. In retrospect, I m sorry I spent the money for theater admission but I might not have been as sorry had I waited to rent the DVD in a few months (or weeks - whichever comes first).
