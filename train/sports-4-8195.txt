Far be it from me to say he isn't a great player: he is, aside from his troubles with free throws. He has great presence inside, and all that. However from another viewpoint, he,like most big stars, gets away with murder from the refs, and he has a rather unlikeable personality, and strikes me as a self- aggrandizing, coarse, crude, dumbass. Looks like an ogre or giant who's threatening a village, should play armed with a spiked club and wear filthy, worn, animal skins so ratty you can't even tell what animal he 's wearing, kinda reminds me of the dummy giant Bigmouth from The Smurfs. Anyone remember the time he played a genie in a boombox or his hideous rap songs? (Shiver) And I think from an aesthetic viewpoint, he's like a rampaging elephant, who, more than any other player, has helped to ruin the artistry and intricacy of the game with his water buffalo tactics.
