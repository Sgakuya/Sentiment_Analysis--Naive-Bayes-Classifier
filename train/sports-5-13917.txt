I agree. Sanders had trash O-Line's, and he still efficiently carried his teams offense. The only year he had a passing game was when Scott Mitchell passed for 4,000+ yards, and Moore and Perriman set the record for most yards and receptions between a receiver duo. And he retired because he never envisioned the Lions ever winning a superbowl. And I agree with his decision, the organization expected him to do everything and wasn't committed at all. But the way he did it, in the middle of training camp was a little unlike him. But still, nontheless he had a good reason I suppose. And Emmitt Smith wouldn't have the TD's he had if the Cowboys decided they would let Aikman throw the TD's at the goaline instead of Smith running it. Priest Holmes is a really similar player, except he had a passing attack even betterthen Aikman's, which means that Priest might actually be on the same level as Emmitt in his prime.
