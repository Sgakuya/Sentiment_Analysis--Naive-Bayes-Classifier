Cold Mountain is definitely a worthwhile movie. The early scene showing the battle scene during the Siege of Petersburg was truly excellent in execution. But this movie does not revert to a 2.5 hour Civil War Reenactment (which Gods and Generals did with disasterous consequences -- Ladies don't want to watch Civil War reenactments). However, the story is actually a depiction of [quite austere and sometimes brutal] life on the Confederate homefront in North Carolina. There is also a love story, a very poignant one; but, I am not here to give away the movie. The movie is brilliantly acted. Though some have criticized Renee Zellweger's Oscar-winning performance as an over-the-top impersonation of Irene Ryan (Granny on Beverly Hillbillys) as a 30-something, I liked the fact that Zellweger played a rough and tumble character rather than her typical portrayal of doughy little girls in love. Even Nicole Kidman flexes some muscles here. Two actors whom I loved in Talented Mr. Ripley, Jude Law and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, are great in this movie as well. Everything about the movie was great: acting, soundtrack, and cinematography. My one (actually my wife's) gripe (one-star penalty assessed) is that the ending was so predictable that when it happened, it kind of left you flat. Despite that, Cold Mountain is a MUST SEE.
