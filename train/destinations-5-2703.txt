I could go on and on about all the great things about Chicago but all the reviewers have pretty well covered that. For the ultimate urban weekend there is no better place to go than Chicago. well NYC is awesome too, LOL. Friends who have never been always make the remark about crime. That is totally baseless. All the times we have been to Chicago, we have never had any criminal activity directed at us. we've walked through the loup at 3 in the morning and felt totally safe. If you're driving through some dark neighborhood trying to buy crack, yea something bad is probably going to happen to you. The worst thats ever happened to us is someone coming up to bum a cigarette. which I never have a problem giving, I always think and feel fortunate had the situation been reversed.
