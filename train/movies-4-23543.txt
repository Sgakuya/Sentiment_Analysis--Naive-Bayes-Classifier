Way better than the first one, but still does not deserve a 5 star rating. One of my favorite aspects about Spiderman 2 is all the drama, and I mean there was so much drama in this movie that I was almost beginning to wonder why anyone would consider it an action, comic book type movie. But the action finally hit the screen and it was extremely awesome. Tobey McGuire is perfect as the push-over Peter, and of course Kirsten Dunst is always as perfect as ever. I didn't really care for the villian as he was too human and not monster enough, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. I would definately say go watch this movie, I recommend it.
