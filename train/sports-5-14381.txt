The very best Quarter back of all time!!!This guy has a hart the size of florida.I absolutely love Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins but they did Dan wrong If Dan was still there the Dolphins would have gone to and one the Super Bowl this year the ravens I mean come on! How stupid are the dolphins they get rid of Dan the man for Jay Fiedler the guy is terrible he sucks they should of not ever hired jimmy Johnson he did absolutely nothing for ths Dolphins exept push Dan Marino into retirement Dan if you ever read this you retired to soon. I kind of wish you would have went to Minnasota to prove what you can do with a good running back wide recivers.
