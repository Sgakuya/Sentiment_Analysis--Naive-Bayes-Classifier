What happened to this franchise? As a long time eagles fan, I can't say that I felt even one ounce of sympathy for the 41-14 dismantling that took place against the birds. Dallas got thrashed in every aspect of the game - from the offensive and defensive lines, to the skill positions, to the coaching. This team has gone to hell in a hurry, and hopefully we're only glimpsing the tip of the iceberg of how bad they really are. They have no quarterback - Aikman should retire, randall is too old and too disinterested, and galloway, the same galloway that the cowboys bet their future on by trading two high draft picks for, will end up 2000 having played a total of about 30 minutes. Jerry Jones was happy to build this team into one that dared other cities to despise them - now it is a very pleasant feeling to see them as a franchise that is clearly in disarray. Time to pay the piper.
