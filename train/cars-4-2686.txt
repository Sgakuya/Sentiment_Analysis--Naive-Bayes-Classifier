I don't happen to own a type R, just the plain old SVT Cobra. I have driven a Type R before, however, and I can only say, Blisteringly fast. If the maintenance is anything like that of the regular cobra, however, you can expect some pricey visits to the mechanic. My car seems to be holding up well to an everyday commute (now at about 76,000 miles) with NO major maintenance - just clutchwork and brakework, and no signs of any in the future. My slower version can dust just about any import out there - definitely any stock import, and even the occasional SS and Z28. I wouldn't recommend the Type R as a daily driver, but the plain Cobra definitely makes a sweet commuter car.
