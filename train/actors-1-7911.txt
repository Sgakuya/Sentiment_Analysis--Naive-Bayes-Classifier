i just saw this moron last week at the bed bath and beyond near Lincoln Center. what a jerk? i was hanging around outside while the wife was shopping, wondering when we were going to the bar, when i heard that famous Biggs voice. the idiot was on a cell phone, pacing back and forth in front of me saying crap like Dude, so you're only in the big apple for one night? we gotta hook up after my play. yeah. he said Big Apple and hook up and this moron gets paid a lot of money to be in films. anyway these two little red state tourists chicks came by and saw Mr. Biggs and almost had a coronary. they kept going in and out of the bed bath and beyond and giggling and laughing while Biggs paced and said more stupid things. after that, Biggs went into the store and kept trying to push the pull door, just like a far side cartoon. soon the wife came out and we went and got some beer. oh...and i think Jason Biggs is a bad actor too.
