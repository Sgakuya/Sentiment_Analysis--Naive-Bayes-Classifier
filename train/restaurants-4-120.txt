I will not bash Starbucks (Charbucks) because that would be too obvious. They do what they do very well and people enjoy the consistency. I am from Europe and like strong coffee but strong and bitter are not the same. I don't like all the funky drinks they make. Why not offer more blends of coffee a day and not just one regular and one decaf???? If you are a coffee house you should focus on serving coffee and not silly sugar and fat-laden concoctions (sp?) I am willing to pay the price if the product is good. I admire them for their benfit packages they give even their part time ees. I like how they balance capitalism with caring about their workers. However, I still think any one of the Canadian chains would beat every chain listed on this board!!!! Van Heutens, Second Cup, Tim Horton's, etc!!!!!
