Bridge is simply the best card game there is. When played at the highest levels, it's a true battle of skill with very, very little luck inherent in it. This is not the bridge your grandmother plays. It's a game where you and your partner communicate in a language all your own - both bidding to describe the 13 cards in your hand, and on defense to further describe your own cards. At duplicate, you will hold exactly the same cards as every player you are being judged against. Whether you win or lose depends on how well you do with the same cards as those othe people. Now, that's a game of skill. And, that's why bridge is the only game of its type ever to be considered as an Olympic sport. To learn more about it, I suggest going to www.acbl.org, or call the American Contract Bridge League at (901)332-5586 to get more information.
