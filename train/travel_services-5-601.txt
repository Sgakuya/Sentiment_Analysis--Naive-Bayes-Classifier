Of course the problem here is the fog, but no biggie since there are many sunny days in the airport. This one now with the BART and the AirTrain is the most efficient to go to and from and around the airport. The food there is healthy and great, most of the the big name airlines are there and it is almost always much cheaper to fly to and from there than going to Oakland or San Jose. It will be difficult to explore the terminals since they have them not interconnected, but even though, this circular place with their new, acessible, state-of-the-art international terminal is one of a kind for on time travel.
