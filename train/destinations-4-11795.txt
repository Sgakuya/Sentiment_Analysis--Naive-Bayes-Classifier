The Baltimore Zoo is alright--it's a fairly large zoo, with some hills (definately need confortable shoes). They have an excellent exhibit of Maryland's habitats, with a neat tree slide and giant plastic lily pads for children to cross. Their barnyard area (for children) has a petting zoo full of goats, and on the side of the chicken barn, you can watch the incubation of little baby chicks. For adults, their Africa section is pretty neat, and they've got a huge pool full of penguins. They feature Keeper Encounters on scheduled times for certain animals, where they talk about the aniamls and their habitats (and sometimes feed the animals right there). The favorite animal of the zoo is Magnet the Polar Bear; he likes to do laps around his pool, he's very playful. (He is also rated America's favorite zoo animal by Microsoft's Zoo Tycoon game, where he is specially featured in the game). Admission is fair ($11/adult, $7.00/children), Parking is alright, the Kiddie rides aren't that interesting (I've heard their complaints), Food Services are, well, good for a snack, at least. I know all this because I've had a season pass and went every week for a summer; if you're planning on going multiple times, or are planning to go to multiple zoos (most if not all zoos in the US honor the season pass), it might be worth getting the season pass. Enjoy!
