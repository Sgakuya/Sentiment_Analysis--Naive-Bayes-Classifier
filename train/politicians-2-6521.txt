Weak as water, as decisive as a gnat. With leadership like this, no wonder the Democratic Party is in Nowheresville these days. This guy, who ostensibly is in support of traditional Democratic values, backpedals every single time the going gets tough, every time public response to his poorly-expressed statements is negative. As a result, he reveals little alligiance to his party's goals, indicates he has the spine of a jellyfish, and presents the impression that the Democrats have lost their way and have been moderated out to the point of being inconsequential. In large part this is true, but this so-called leader of the party should be doing everything he can to arrest and turn around that disquieting trend. He should stick to his guns and ignore what the opposition says. He should develop thicker skin. He should figure out a way to gain 6 inches in height, the shrimpy, sawed-off little runt that he is. This twerp is enough to make anyone be ashamed to be a Democrat, and there's little reason to feel that way otherwise.
