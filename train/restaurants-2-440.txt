This was a good idea that lost its way. The burgers used to be very good, but these days it seems they're using roadkill for the meat. The fries were always so-so, and the specialty sandwiches they introduced in the past few years basically suck. Some of the salads are edible, though. It seemed this chain was going to be the Saving Grace of American Fast Food, but corporate greed and that typical U.S. tendency to cut corners for the sake of profit once a captive market group has been established resulted in Wendy's being just another entry in a notably mediocre industry. I really miss the days of the ol' Mom and Pop hamburger stand when some sort of pride was infused in the product. Unfortunately, those days are more than 30 years behind us...
