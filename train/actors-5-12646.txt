Charlize is extremely beautiful, talented and graceful. Shes done some amazing work The Italian Job, The Yards, Mighty Joe Young, Devil's Advocate, Men of Honour, The Cider House Rules, Celebrity the list goes on and on. Another thing I admire about her is that she's not one of those actresses that whines, goes on television to tell their life story and wants the whole world to feel sorry for her. When challenged on numerous occassions about Hollywood not casting asthetically challenged women who could have played Aileen in Monster she defended herself so well. She's not just another pretty face she actually has talent to back those looks.
