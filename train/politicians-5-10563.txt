I give George W. Bush a five star rating. I am glad that President Bush is placing the security of the United States as his top priority. Other matters to be addressed: (1) place a complete moratorium on immigration; (2) place a zero tolerance policy on illegal aliens (3) create a Constitutional Ammendment to make English the official language of the United States; (4) give intelligence gathering top priority; (5) upgrading the caliber of our military; (6) return to the good of the whole philosophy instead of the self indulgent complete individual rights philosophy that has been so detrimental to our country.
