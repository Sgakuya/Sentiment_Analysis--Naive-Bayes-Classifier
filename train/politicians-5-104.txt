Being an American whose ancestors fought in the Revolution, I naturally have a strong distaste for any monarchy. BUT...the list is asking me to rate Charles the man, or so I take it. Being so, I actually feel sorry for the man. First, he has little or no privacy, except when he's at his private estate. His every move is monitored, and all because he was born a prince. As for the way he treated Diana, who are we to judge when studies show that the majority of Americans cheat on their spouses. Besides, it isn't like he went out whoring around. He had a relationship with the only woman he supposedly ever loved, but was forbidden to marry. Let us not forget, before we fall into hero worship, what a flawed human being Diana was. It's not like she was an angel herself. Always remember, you never know what goes on behind closed doors. To Charles credit, he seems to have always been a loving father, he is very charitable, and he seems to have improved with age. As far as monarchs go, I kinda like the guy.
