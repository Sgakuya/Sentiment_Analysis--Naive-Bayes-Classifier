Awww, come on! Get off the poor guy's case. I could point out to you Clinton-bashers that many of you helped to vote a convicted DUI offender into office. After all, we should be looking at his politics. This man was a decent prez, and he did a lot to pursue equal liberty and justice for all. I think we owe this poor man a serious break. As well as his daughter. Rush Limbaugh referred to Chelsea Clinton as the First Dog for eight years, but oh no, reporting on the Bush princesses can't be tolerated. Oh, and I might add: Clinton was a Yale graduate, and he got in ON HIS OWN. Not like some OTHER people I could mention. We're rating him, if any of you bothered to read the category, by his career as a politician, not a person. So lets do that, ok?
