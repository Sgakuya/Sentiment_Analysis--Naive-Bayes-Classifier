The Maryland Science Center recently finished its renovations with excellent results--it houses an impressive new dinosaur exhibit, with many interactive activities for children and many little kiosks with informative videos (note: it's mostly for the kids). Kids and adults can also enjoy Newton's Alley, a room full of little experiments and hands-on exhibits, like a little tower that has seats which kids can pull themselves up on to show the power of pulleys. The Your Body: The Inside Story exhibit is pretty neat--there is a table where you lay down on, and you push a little button which raises the bed of nails through the plexiglass, to demonstrate how distribution of weight is so important. Most things are for chilcren, but some things are for adults: Currently, thre is a temporary exhibit called Beyond Numbers, and while most of it is pretty easy to understand, try imagining turning a sphere inside-out without puncturing it or causing any creases (there are two things that I just can't ever fully comprehend: one is astrophysics; the second is theorhetical math--I wasn't doing too bad until they mentioned making things wavy or corrugation, and then I lost it). The planetarium is pretty nice, though may not be suitable for children. A temporary exhibit in now is Discovering Chimpanzees: The Remarkable World of Jane Goodall, which is not bad. Of course, the Maryland Science Center also features an IMAX theater and an Observatory. Located in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, it's worth a look. Go to http://www.mdsci.org/ for more info.
