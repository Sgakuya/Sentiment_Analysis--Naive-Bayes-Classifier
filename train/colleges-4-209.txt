We kind of had too much latitude when it came to choosing classes. Obviously some were for experienced professionals, MSF students-with prior knowledge of the material and others for MBA/MA with little or none of such knowledge. Such latitude made it somewhat frustrating for MBA/MAs when one had work on cases prior to being taught the basics! Although the approach worked in half the number of cases, depending on the classes one took and how much risk one wanted to handle. For me, it worked out fine as I loved the risk and managed it quite well plus some nice cross registratyion with other colleges such as BC, BU,Bentley etc. Overall. I think Brandeis-IBS will become a very strong brand within 15-18 months due to the rate of evolution and expansion of its programs(to include ops mgt and other business and non-finance/econ staples), facilities and new faculty.
