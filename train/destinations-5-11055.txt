Just one of the best theme parks I have ever visited. I love the rides there especially the roller coasters. Linear Gale and Geopanic are great, but the monster that takes the cake is Thunder Dolphin. This ride bunny hops over a building and goes through the middle of a Ferris wheel. Oh yeah, it's the 7th tallest roller coaster in the world (262 feet), and goes 80 mph. The other rides are great, too. Dropper and the water ride (don't remember the name) are awesome. The location of the park is great, too. Smack dab in the middle of Tokyo Dome City. The only bad thing about this park is they don't say the ride safety things in English...but hey, what can you do about that? You're in Japan! But visit this theme park if you ever visit Tokyo.
