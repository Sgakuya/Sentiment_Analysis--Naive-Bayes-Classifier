Besides beng the greatest pure halfback that ever lived, Gale was also the greatest kick and punt returner. His combination of sprinters speed, unmatched elusiveness, and driving power were astonishing. His play was breath taking. When Gale went down with his first devastating knee injury, he was averaging 6.3 yards per carry in the ninth game of the season. Upon close analysis of his progress to then, it is clear that he had reaced a point of being Jordanesque. He had become a man amongst boys! It is tragic that the NFL And the Television Networks remain locked up in litigation, preventing us from seeing all the games in their entirety. Truly,if we had access to watch those games, people would surely watch every single game Sayers ever played before the injury, with jaws dropped from the 1st touch of the ball to the last tragic carry. Only seeing is believing.
