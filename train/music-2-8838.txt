I can hold a camera and walk backwards at night on a beach with a rat man walking after me singing a cheesy song about yellow stars and bleeding himself dry. What a waist of time. I would rather be having a grande latte enima. Watching paint dry is more interesting. We are supposed the video, not the song, right? A certain someone has slightly altered my view of this video. The meaning behind it is evident. I tried to close it off and pretend it did not exist. But yes this video incompasses this very lovely song rather well. Even if the video is bland as corn flakes and as exciting as a Baywatch marathon. Damn those who alter my friggin thoughts! See this video if you like home videos of animals attacking people. Especially rat people. On the beach. At night. Singing love songs. In slickers. Very slowly. Um, rather...poo.
