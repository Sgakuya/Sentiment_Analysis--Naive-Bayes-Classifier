I bought mine one year ago and like it. As other comments indicate, it's not an offroad vehicle. Clearence is pretty good but there's no special undercarriage protection and the suspension is meant for roads. Really, this is just a car that happens to be shaped like an SUV. I still rate it Good , though, because as long as what you want is a car shaped like an SUV, you can't go too wrong here. I got the 4-cylinder AWD model. When it snowed I was wishing I had the 6-cylinder, but it still handled the weather well enough. Now that gas prices are up, though, the 4-cylinder is sweet. I get all the cargo space of an SUV and all the gas milage of a normal car. The drive-by-wire steering feels great and the Continuously Variable Transmission gives smooth acceleration at all levels. It's no Hummer, but then, it also starts out at around $18k. If you feel some manly obligation to spend $40 grand or more for a V8 offroad SUV when you never go offroad and never tow anything, it's your money, for if you want a roomier city cruiser, this is a good bet. Oh, it has the standard Saturn goodies, too. No haggle sticker price, Saturn service has always been good, side impact beams in the doors, fuel shutoff if your ignition is tampered with and my favorite, plastic polymer door panels that mean it takes special effort to put a scratch on the door and it's basically dingproof .
