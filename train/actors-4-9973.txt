She reminds me of a New York East Coast toughgirl with a lot of interesting stories to tell. She seems like the kind of woman that I'd find myself arguing with often at a retail job, but then soon we'd end up dating, or even married. She has a realistic array about her that needs to be presented in Hollywood more often. Her abilities as an actress are stunning, gripping, almost fearful in the sense that she is one of those method actresses who really dives deep within her psyche and becomes the role at hand. As far as her physical appearance I find it mean, and welcoming. Some people might think that I'm sick, but I'm not I'm just honest, and I can honestly say that I like and appreciate difficult women, for me they're easier to get close to because they do the hunting. Her nose is sharp, yet comforting. Her lips are full and kissable. Her hips are a bit wide, but it's her and she is built perfect just the way she is. I'm glad that she is an actress in movies today. She does the Hollywood of today justice, because for the past decade there has been nothing but movies set up with story lines to direct the human cattles decision making this way. Toni Collette is a great talent and a beautiful woman, I tip my hat to her.
