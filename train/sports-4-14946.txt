Blanda was my first football hero (Houston-they were on TV every week). My favorite play was the screen passes to Charlie Tolar. He had some great years in Houston, some not so great years, too. He threw many INTs. He seemed to play without an ego though. A few times when he started a game playing poorly, he was taken out of the game for several series, and then brought back in later (playing much better). But it was as a kicker that he earned his pay most of his career. With Oakland he really made it pay off. They didnt need to use a roster spot for the kicker, because he was also as good a 2nd string QB as there was in the league. Then he had that great year winning all those games in a row. Most importantly, John Madden seemed to think he was a great asset to the team.
