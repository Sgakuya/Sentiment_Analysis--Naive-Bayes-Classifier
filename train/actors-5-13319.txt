I recommend The House Of Yes to every Parker Posey fan out there. She plays a rich bitch psychotic who dresses up like Jackie Kennedy and totes a gun around- it's awesome! Anyway, I, too, am a firm believer that this actress should get a big break playing lead in a major picture (if any have an adequate enough script) but then again who will be our Sundance Queen? I have seen her in so many indies that I don't know if I could handle her being in a studio picture ( You Have Mail and Mixed Nuts were bad enough!). By the way, is it just me or is it that on a closer inspection Parker looks amazingly similiar to a young Katherine Hepburn? OH, OH, IDEA: When they make a Katherine Hepburn biopic (And you know they will!) Parker can play Kate. I have every confidence she can pull it off!
