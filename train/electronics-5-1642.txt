(Rating based on the TX-P2670WH model) This happened to be my husbands Christmas gift: the Samsung TX-P2670WH, the cute little 26 widescreen HDTV that holds its own pretty well . . . well, I guess I shouldn't say little--it just looked little compared to everything else on the shelf. It wasn't all that little, though, when we tried loading into the back of my poor little Saturn, and it DEFINATELY wasn't cute when lugging that 90-some pound monstrosity up a flight of steps. Yeah, it's not that much weight, but it's hard to get your arms around, and it's not that much lighter than me, either. ANYway . . . It's flat-screen, it's got got enough Audio/Video input jacks to hook up anything you could possibly want (3 sets), Digital Video Input, a V-chip function (for the kids, if you have em) and you can hook up your PC to use it as a monitor (with a little tweaking). The picture quality is excellent, and you can change the screen size (16:9, Panorama, 4:3,and two zoom settings). Its not the most expensive one on the market, and its certainly not the biggest nor the best, but for the price (under $700), its not a bad choice. Were happy with it.
