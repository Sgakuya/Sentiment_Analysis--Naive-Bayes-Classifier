Too bad there one star is the lowest rating possible. I'd like to give a negative Buyer beware if you shop at Diamonds International. On a recent trip to Mexico, I purchased a ring that appraised for $1100 less than what I paid for it. (I had two seperate appraisals, both done by an independent gem labs.) Diamonds International is refusing to refund my money. The friend I traveled with also purchased a ring which appraised for considerably less. Learn from me and do your homework. Do not be fooled by the fact the DI is a recommended store by most/all cruise lines. As I found out after returning home, those recommendations are simply paid endorsements from the cruise lines. They mean nothing. Before you buy from DI, please go to some cruise/travel message boards and search for DI. You'll see that many other people have had similar problems.
