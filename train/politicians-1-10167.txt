He ranks with the likes of Millard Filmore, James K. Polk and Herbert Hoover. He has disemboweled environmental protections, alienated the world against the U.S., divided the nation among the haves and have-nots, gutted our Constitutional guarantees, piled up the largest budget deficit in history, and created a catastrophe in the Middle East that will dog this country for generations to come. The son of privilege, he traded on his family's connections from one business failure to another, greased his way into the National Guard and made a fortune on a baseball deal that cost the citizens of Arlington, TX, $60 million. When it came to passing out integrity, Bush was passed out. His favorite rhetorical tool is the Big Lie.
