To the person below: I lived in Knoxville for a year before moving back to the notheast. My job took me all over the state and i met lots of people and while they were friendly, they seemed backwards and on the country side to me, not very bright. Can't tell you how many times i heard Blacks referred to with the N word esp. in Knoxville, you call that an educated population?!? I don't. The fact is TN ranks low or bad in many catogories as others on here have posted: 3rd highest divorce rate in the U.S. (no small wonder since just about everybody here marrys right out of high school and gets divorced a few years later) HUGE numbers of Meth users, (seems like every nite on the news some moron got busted for having a Meth lab) TONS of Teen single Moms, everyone smokes it seems (nothing worse than a women who chain smokes and i saw many in TN, ugh!) and many people are out of shape, recently TN was ranked the 5th most overweight state in the U.S. i guess you can't deal with reality and your wonderful State. Knoxville has the most amount of fast food chain restaraunts than any other U.S. city, that is a FACT, go look it up somewhere. Those upsale places were full of stuck up yuppies btw, maybe you are one of those people so it's no wonder you'd like those restaraunts. As for the vols, well who cares. If that's all a city has to offer for entertainment than i feel sorry for you, the nitelife in Knoxville is PATHETIC unless you want to hang out with drunk college kids which i did not. The Vols team is made up of thugs and date rapers, quite a team to be proud of.
