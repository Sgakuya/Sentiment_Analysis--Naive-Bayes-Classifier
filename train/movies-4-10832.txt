Kevin Smith and his View Askew universe has been an enormous part of my life since I was in sixth grade and I saw Clerks for the first time. The humor and the realism he brought to his characters and his films were brilliant and can never be reproduced. Now that he has chosen to retire his two trade mark characters Jay and Silent Bob a spot in the movie realom that has once been filled by Kevin Smith's wonderful characters and films which I looked forward two year after year is gone and leaving behind a large void. This movie brings together just about every character from each View Askew movie and blends them together perfectly. Jay and Silent go on an adventure to Hollywood to halt the production of the feature film Bluntman and Chronic because everyone on the web believes these two characters are dickheads. So Jay and Silent Bob get set on their merry way and stray into many misadventures along the way. Including avoiding the cops, stealing monkeys...tell you what, why don't you go see it and let the surprises have you. This movie also pokes fun at Planet of the Apes and a movie that is still in production that is based off a very popular Hanna Barbera chartoon. Very funny but not the best of Kevin Smith's films. HIGHLY HIGHLY REcommended for fans. Not so much a newbe friendly movie as a lot of jokes come from the previous four films. Still a great comedy. I almost started crying at the end when it finally sunk in that that this is it for View Askew and their great movies. Long live Jay and Silent Bob!!!
