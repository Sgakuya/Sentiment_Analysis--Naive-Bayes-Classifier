Wow a lot of fierce remarks in here about Alaska. I can say if you come here with an open mind and get past the oil and politics it is a place that can change you (in a good way). One thing this place has going for it is its unspolied scenery, more than anywhere else. The lower 48 has become so saturated in real estate and so much pristine land is gone. There is still an abundance of striking scenery, wildlife, and pristine untouched land left up there. Mountains here are more impressive than anywhere else in North America. I won't disagree there are a lot of weirdo's living up there and I can do without 9 months of winter and endless nights, but at least visit here. Like I said come with an open mind and you will find it one of the most remarkable and unforgettable places you've ever seen.
