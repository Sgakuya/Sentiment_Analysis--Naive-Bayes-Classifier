The Rock has its detractors. Some say it's too light and watery; others dismiss it as skunk urine. I have been drinking it regularly since sneaking in as an underage drinker at Smokey Joe's and other rathskellers in Philly. One reason I like it is that very lightness. I can drink a few without getting that bloated feeling I get when drinking Bud. It has a good taste to it; not too much bite. Incredibly, I have been able to find it almost anywhere in the country and even in Italy. The mystery of 33 always intrigued me. Some theories I heard is that the number of words on the label add up to 33 words, the Old Latrobe brewery is along Route 33, and it is based on the year prohibition ended - 1933.
