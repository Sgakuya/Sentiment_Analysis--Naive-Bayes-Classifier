Anybody who does not like Matt Dillon for his looks, acting, and talent, there must be something wrong with you. After seeing the Outsiders in school and reading the book 3+ times, I believe it changed my life, especially since I luv Matt Dillon. The one thing I want to do before I die is to meet Matt Dillon. I know almost everything on the internet about this great actor/writer/director and seen 16 movies out of his 38, and not one did I not like. I can rate him a number over 100, because I luv him so much! Matt Dillon rocks this world! His funniest movie is There's Soemthing About Mary, his saddest movie is The Saint of Fort Washington, and his best adult-role movie was probably The Big Town or Drugstore Cowboy. His best teen movie was probably The Outsiders/Tex. I luv you Matt Dillon! You are and always will be the actor I worship and luv until the day I die!
