No question about it---R.E.M's best album. Sweetness Follows is possibly the most beautiful, peaceful song ever written! Monty Got a Raw Deal , Man on the Moon , and Try not to Breathe are amazing, too. There isn't a person out there who will not find something to like on this CD. For those of you who like harder rock music, listen to Ignoreland . If you like softer music, Find the River is the song for you. And if you just want to sit back and listen to a nice little tune, check out New Orleans Instrumental #1 . Automatic for the People is definitely for the people ! No argument can be made against this album. Period. Exclamation point! End of story.
