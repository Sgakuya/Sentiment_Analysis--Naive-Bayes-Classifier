I think she is way too outspoken about topics that she is not educated in. I think she sponsors many good causes (i.e. donate a phone, UNICEF) but for her to spout her liberal crap every time a camera is turned on her is way over the edge. She has a high school education and works and lives in fantasy land. What the hell does she know about world affairs? She seems to be forgetting that men much like George W. Bush are the ones who died so she can shroud her liberal crap in freedom of speech. If she is truly proud to be an American, quit overextending her rights. Hers end where mine begin and I am terribly offeneded by her stand against this country. If it is so terrible here, please let me extend an invitation for this communist wench to leave. Maybe move to Iraq?
