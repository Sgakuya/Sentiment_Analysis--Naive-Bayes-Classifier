I've owned 2 Sevilles so far - an 88 which I traded at 170,000 miles for a 91 which currently has 172,000 miles - Both EXCELLENT cars - Only big complaints, my 91 has always had a slight hesitation in accelerating, never stalled, or given major problems, but still a slight annoyance. ALSO I had a bad string of Transmissions - IF YOU HAVE ANY TRANNY PROBLEMS DO NOT REPLACE THE CONVERTER UNLESS IT IS FAILING. I have gone through 6 transmissions (All but 1 on Warranty) and still it seems to have problems, nothing that will leave you stranded, but Service Engine Soon lights and poor mileage. My 88 was all original when I replaced it, and it ran fine, I just wanted an AirBag and ABS. It probably is still on the road!
