George W. Bush is going to make a terrific president and those who think otherwise are idiots. Bush has made incredible progress in Texas, cleaning-up after the previous, Democratic, Gov.. Clinton/Gore have made a mess of the morals of our society, among other things; Bush promises to turn it all around and restore dignity to the office and I believe him. Bush has admitted to not having a perfect history, I for one respect him for the honesty. Gore, on the other hand, refuses to be honest about anything. I hate to break it to you liberals, you're being fooled; nobody is that perfect. Gore will say anything to you and you idiots believe him. He promises everything yet his record shows that hardly any of his promises have been kept. Another thing, for those of you who think Bush is dumb, think about this for a minute... Bush has a Harvard MBA and Gore failed out of Devinity School and Law school! Now who's the smarter guy?! He failed out because he was a pot head. I am discusted in all of you partison democrats, you would probably vote for Gore if he killed one of your family members. Where are your morals? GO GEORGE W. BUSH... you have my respect and my vote!!!
