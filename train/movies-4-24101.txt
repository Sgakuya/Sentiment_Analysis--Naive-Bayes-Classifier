This movie is not a monumental piece of cinema so your attitude going into it will determine a lot. Those who are SERIOUS comic buffs will no doubt find flaws but, considering the genre, the overall film is done well. To really enjoy it, remember that it is an adaptation from a storyline that's been around a long time and is fantasy. Affleck and Garner do credible jobs but the real highlights are Duncan's Kingpin and Ferrell's Bulleye (whom I wish they had done more with character-development-wise). There's a ton of action and a little more violence than just high-wire martial arts. Probably a bit too much for the real little ones and not for the serious cinema-goer. I have come to expect certain things from comic book adaptation movies and that's the reason I enjoyed this film. Take it for what it is. Guys, you'd better know for a FACT that your girl likes this kind of movie (or drools over Affleck) of she might get bored. Although I do know a few women who liked Electra because she kicked butt (direct quote from two sources). Gals, good chance your man will dig this one (fair warning; Jennifer Garner is that hot and don't think Hollywood didn't costume her accordingly).
