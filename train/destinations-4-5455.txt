From 1982-90, lived there off and on during my early days in the Navy. It's a small state, but a diverse and interesting state. Newport is a fun town. I spent the summer of 1983 there (the year the U.S.A. lost the America's Cup). For a single guy, it was a target-rich environment. There were incredible nightclubs all through Newport and all the way to Narragnasett and Point Judith. My favorite hangouts were Harry's 103 on Bellevue Ave. in Newport (closed down), the Coast Guard House in Narragansett, and Schillers. Though I didn't score a beautiful, rich, debutante, I had lots of fun trying. One crazy Rhodie Girl (from Middletown)liked doing crazy stuff in the darndest places; we had an adventure on the hood of her Camaro, at Seashore State Park in the dead of winter and another in the back seat parked outside a bar in a busy part of town (thank you, foggy windows). I found just about every restaurants in Newport quite good. Salas, Brick Alley Pub, and the Chart House were 3 of my favorites in Newport. There was a place in Bristol where you could get twin lobsters for 11.99 I didn't visit Providence that much, but it too seemed like a fun town. When I got married, my wife and I spent 6 months there. She did not care for it at all (hence the 1 star deduction). One other Rhode Island tip: If you travel to Boston, don't go through the hassle of Logan. Just fly to T.F. Green in Providence. It's an easy hour drive.
