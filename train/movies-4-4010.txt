Disney is behind this film, so the mother is put to death early. And this time hundreds of her unborn offspring perish as well. All this carnage even before opening credits roll. Why are whole families so distasteful to Hollywood, especially Disney? That sweeping complaint aside, this film is nonetheless a very memorable one with astounding animated imagery and clever characterizations. It captures, either in parody or sincerity, nearly every pelagic creature you can ponder! The storyline, if a predictable one, proceeds unfettered and reaches an imaginative conclusion as a widowed father searches for his lone surviving child.
