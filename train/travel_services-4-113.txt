Update: I completely forgot about their customer service. I had a flight from Sacramento to Portland and I wanted to change it to 1 day earlier. I figured there would be a $100 fee or at least a hassle. I called their number and was not put on hold (the first time I have ever called an airline and not been on hold) and a woman spoke with me and said it would be no problem and no fee, and I she gave me three different times that I could change my flight to. A month later, I called customer service again, and again I was not put on hold. I had forgotten to collect my points and this rep I spoke with was also extremely friendly and I had my points and was off the phone in 30 seconds. In a day an age where customer service seems to be severely lacking, I can say that customer service on this airline was excellent. Old comment: Old, small, crowded planes, and fairly unorganized. Upside is cheap fares.
