I think some people may have missed out on the main theme of the story... American Beauty shows you both how shallow people can be with having affairs, pretending that you have had sex when you are a teenager, hating gays and hating your job. But then it delves deeper than that - but this tends to happen with small parts where the characters aren't talking. His wife who ends up having an affair shows her fragilty when she tries to sell the house and at the end bursts into tears and hates herself for doing it and takes out her unhappiness on her husband. The teenage friend who boasts about all the sex she has had - where we find out later on that she is in fact a virgin, shows her fragilty when she is wiping her tears away and looks at herself in the bathroom, as well as when her friends boyfriend tells her exactly what she is. Sad and lonely.. And the main character finally sees that his life isn't as bad as what he thought it was, he has a beautiful wife and daughter. He realises that he has to think about the small things and what he has and not what he thinks that he wants. Then as soon as he realises, he dies. The one liners Spacey has in the film is fantastic as well. But that is American Beauty....
