It's worth noting that The Godfather movies took almost 4 hours of story directly from the novel (all of the first movie, plus the Young Vito portion of the second), and STILL omitted at least 4 major story arcs (Johnny Fontane, Nino Valenti, Lucy Mancini, and Dr. Jules Segal), as well as the backstories of at least a half-dozen characters. It's incredible how much The Godfather packs into only a few hundred highly readable pages. Also: As this was the most widely read novel in history (at that time), the movies were made with the assumption that the viewer had read the book. It's been said by other reviewers, but if you've only seen the movies (as great as they are), go and read the novel. Then watch the films again, and see how much more you understand, and what a great storyteller Mario Puzo really was.
