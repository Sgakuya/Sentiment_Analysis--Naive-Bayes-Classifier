Until I made the terrible mistake of paying for me, myself and Irene I would have given jim carey high marks. But like most great comedians, i.e. richard pryor, robin williams, eddie murphy, etc, he has chosen to take his act into the gutter, making a complete fool of himself and his god given talent for making people laugh. maybe he is trying to attract more of the black audience by using the word MF constantly and attracting a larger % of the porno hollywood crowd of his constant referals to sexual acts. I never would have thought jim carey would lower himself to such a sick and terrible movie. It appears to me that only Sinbad is left to bring to people what true comedy is all about and using his god given talents to make people laugh of all ages, races and genders.
