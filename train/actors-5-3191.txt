I am 15, nearly 16 years old, and I'm constantly thrown images of teenstars. I'm supposed to be awed by the aesthetic beauty of these people and then automatically decide that they are great actors. To most teen girls my age, what you see is what you get; pretty face= pretty good actor/ mature, ruggedly handsome man= Tom Cruise wannabe with no acting skills, a.k.a. action hero. Until I discovered Russell Crowe, I found this to be true, what with the likes of Bruce Willis (who I love, don't get me wrong) and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Russell is a mixture of both action-hero physique and Anthony Hopkins' talent range; from a merciless skinhead in Romper Stomper, to a pudgy familyman in The Insider. In all of his performances he puts in a great effort to actually become his characters, which is more than I can say for the teenybopper starlets of my generation. His career is well-rounded, and I beileve he is one of the finest actors ever to walk the Earth.
