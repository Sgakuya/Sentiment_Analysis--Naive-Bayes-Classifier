After enduring a particularly painful ordeal (in more ways than one) shopping for a pair of formal shoes, Nordstrom saved the day. Let's just say that I was desperate- I'd spent two days trying on every single dress shoe in the Denver metro area, and I had nothing to show for it. Furious about wasting so much time on such a ridiculous mission, I limped into Nordstrom's shoe department as a last resort. I ignored the salesclerk's initial response that the only pair of shoes that would work was bizarre-looking and cost $175, and we scoured the department together. Within minutes, I spotted a pair of fashionable, fairly comfortable, black patent leather pumps for $60, and I snatched them up. The salesclerk even stretched them a bit in one spot where my toes were cramped in order to make them more comfortable. Since I'm not yet willing to buck fashion dictates and wear athletic shoes with a formal dress (even though I think women should start doing that!), I am very grateful for the shoe department at Nordstrom.
