This has to be the best comic strip of all time. Lots of great humor, positive messages always underlying the storylines and the friendship between Calvin and Hobbes is one for us all to strive for. I remember following the comic strip one week or so when the two found a wounded raccoon and tried to bring it back to recovery. That particular series of comic strips is still stuck in my head from over 10 years ago. Strange how little things like that stick in your head and have such long-lasting impacts on your life. The imagination and seeing life through the eyes of a young boy was always such a great way to start my day. I was so sad when I read that Bill Watterson was hanging up the pen and was no longer creating Calvin Hobbes, silly how some lines on paper can affect you so much.
