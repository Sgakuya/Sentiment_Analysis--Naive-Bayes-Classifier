I graduated from one of the most prestigious private high schools in Chicago and was accepted by an Ivy League school when I was a senior. However, I could not secure enough funds to attend. I ended up going to UIUC and I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics. In my advanced level mathematics courses I was competing with students from the top engineering schools in China and Japan. My professors were geniuses from Russia,Hungary,Germany, etc. The courses and students were definitely top notch and the engineering facilities were outstanding. There are many people from my High School that come to UIUC to study either engineering,math,finance,accounting,biology/chemistry,or psychology. In general, the students who are studying these subjects do not think that U of I is a party school...AT ALL. Many of my friends have gone on to Harvard, Yale, U of C, Stanford, Dartmouth for graduate study in a variety of areas. My GPA was a mere 3.2, but I took the GRE Mathematics Subject test and damn near got a perfect score with very little preparation ... much higher than my friends who studied at Harvard, MIT and Northwestern. I can attend almost any graduate school I want because of the quality of UIUC academics. But then again, I think that I would be able to say the same thing no matter where I spent my undergraduate years. I admit that U of I is very boring, but academically it is definitely taken for granted by some in-state students and overlooked because of the seemingly superior rival schools such as Northwestern. BTW, in Quantitative Analysis U of I is ranked 10th (2005). Don't assume that students that attend UIUC are there because they aren't smart enough to go to better schools.
