I've gained mounds of respect for this state the past few years. First of all, Mississippi is the only state whose citizens had the balls, tenacity, and good sense to keep their state flag the way it's always been. And second, they were the first state to hang In God We Trust posters all over their schools. You gotta love a state that sticks to its principles like that. And I encourage all of you to visit Vicksburg to see the Confederate battle fields and the Old Courthouse Museum. That entire town is bursting with history and culture. And if you want to have a good look at the best college in America just make a stop at Oxford and stroll around the sidewalks of Ole Miss.
