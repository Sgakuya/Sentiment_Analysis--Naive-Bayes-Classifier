The Running Man is a sci-fi shotr novel set in a future where game shows rule the tv netwkrs. The most popular is a game called The Running Man, where convicts are set free with the chance to earn their freedom provided they can avoid the killers chasing them for a period of time. This story is much more complex than the dumbed-down movie version (The Running Man is an Arnold classic featuring Richard Dawson as the game show host. The movie was a lot of fun but very different from this book). King shows that he can do near-future sci-fi with the best of them and this story has plenty of twists and turns. You will blaze through these pages. this book was published as a single novel at one pont, however it can always be found as one of four novellas in King's The Bachman Books. The Bachman Books rank a firm 5 stars by the way; this story itself gets 4 from me.
