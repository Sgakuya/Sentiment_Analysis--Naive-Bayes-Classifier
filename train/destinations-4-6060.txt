First off, I love the desert and the big sky you can get out West. I like Arizona, where else can you where shorts on Christmas day? I like Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff (Nah-Noo-Nah-Noo), each has it's own climate. Smog blows into the Grand Canyon from Vegas on occasion. Not a place for weed smokers. An uncle of mine was once the drug czar of this state and arranged for me to go on a ride along with some cops. I mean they busted the hell out of these to Mexican guys for a little skinny (pinhead) joint and charged them with felonies, you'd have thought they shot Reagan. I'm not in favor of drug use, but damn. Phoenix is really spread out. Sedona, Arizona has got to be my favorite spot. Full of friendly new-age types. A great place to just rent a room for a week and chill with the scenery. Never made it to Nogales, Mexico, heard I didn't miss much though.
