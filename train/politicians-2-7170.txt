Jackson may have sold out to the Republicans. He was correct, of course, to protest against the voting irregularities in Florida, where, among other things, it appears that several thousand blacks were kept from voting because they were falsely accused of being former felons by a company based in Texas. I hope the NAACP lawsuit is successful in exposing all the corruption down there, though I suspect a lot of white people will simply close their eyes to it. Lots of whites are fond of proclaiming their lack of bigotry, but then they show no interest when there are legitimate accusations of systemic racism. But even Jackson himself seems less interested since he talked to Dubya. I hope I'm wrong about that.
