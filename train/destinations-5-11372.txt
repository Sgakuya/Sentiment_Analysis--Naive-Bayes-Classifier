I have a sad sad story about my trip to Yosemite. I had been really looking forward to going to Yosemite for a long time. I had the trip planned out. Car camp the first night, hike the next day to campout up near this little water hole then hike back the next day. The camping trip was ruined by the 8 hours of traffic (it usually or should have taken only 4 hours to get there), when we got over that first hump, set up camp, and ate our dinner...we were in the tent, on the verge of sleep when I heard footsteps. No not footsteps, BEAR steps. The campground was visited by two bears. They went through our neighbors camp and tore it apart. Needless to say we tried to sleep in the car (that didn't work well) while the whole night people were screaming Go away Bear. The next morning, totally exhausted, we decided to just go on a small hike, swim in the lake, and go home. It was so sad.
