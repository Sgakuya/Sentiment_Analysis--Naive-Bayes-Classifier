skoal is the best chewing tobacco on the market right now but i live in canada and compared to the states our selection, prices, and our 15 gram tins are total garbage. the only selection we have is skoal apple, straight, berry, cope short, mint, wintergreen, spearmint, classic,cherry, vanilla, redman. i pay 8$ for a tin which lasts me about 3 dips and i take about 4 or 5 dips a day and when u pack a canadian tin you get a huge portion of the tin filled with air which really makes me angry. ive been to the states and wow all i can really say is...its chew heaven. the tins are cheap,you get such a selection,its always always fresh, packed to the max, and never leaves me unsatisfied. my buddies and i have gone through about 325 canadian tins over the summer which totals to about $2535. skoal peach is absolutely amazing. ive heard of watermellon being made but having no friends that live in the states makes it hard to believe. does anybody have any info on any new flavors coming out in the near fututre?
