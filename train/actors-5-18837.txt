The best and greatest film maker ALIVE! This man is a god! His work is revolutionary. His power, his art is so real and so gripping it is beyond discription. The two films he has made are Pi and Requiem for a Dream. Both of these works are phenominal, brilliant and breakthrough films. No directooor alive has ever brought the horrors of mental illness, the insanity behind numbers, the horrors of drug abuse, and the deep dark feeling of failure lose regret sadness pain sickness happiness love getting high like Darren Aronofsky. He is the modern day Stanley Kubrick. This guy is better than Kubrick! His eye for beautiful visuals, his ear for gripping nail biting scores, his nak for finding truely and honestly gifted artists to inturn bring his gorgeous works of art to life makes him, now, with only two films under his belt, my favorite film maker of all time. Darren Aronofsky is pure and total Genious! No one can do it better.
