As advertised, Elvis Presley's Number One Hits (released in 1987) is a compilation of all Elvis' singles that topped the Billboard charts, including Hound Dog, All Shook Up, Jailhouse Rock, Are You Lonesome Tonight?, and Suspicious Minds. While this may sate the appetite of the most casual fan, the majority of those interested in Elvis will not be satisfied with this lone recording as it doesn't feature any of his hits that didn't reach #1 (eg In The Ghetto and Burning Love). Because of all these substantial omissions, most fans will want to find a series of compilation recordings that cover a set number of years each, notwithstanding the excellence of Number One Hits. Nevertheless, in my opinion, no greatest hits package should be on this list as a compilation cannot really be compared to regular releases and does not represent the concept of a full-length effort.
