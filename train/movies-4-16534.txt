I had my doubts about goping to this movie. Several friends had seen it, and said that it was slow. I wasn't around then, but it rang 30's to me. Paul Newman plays an Irish mob leader in 1931 Chicago. Jude Law is his good-for-nothing son. Tom Hanks is the son that Newman wishes he had, but alas, he's not really his son. Tyler Hoechlin is wonderful as Hanks' son. And, Jennifer Jason Leigh - she was just kind of there. I'm a bit surprised that the filmmakers would pay her price (I assume it's fairly high) for essentially a bit part. But, back to the movie. It is a little slow, but it has to be. It has the pace of realism. Real life doesn't go at the speed of Star Wars. As the movie goes along, each character grows, and the endiong is totally expected ... or is it? Go see for yourself.
