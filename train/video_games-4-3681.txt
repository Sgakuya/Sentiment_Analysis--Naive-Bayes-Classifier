I think most people who are serious Chrono Trigger fans might be upset with CC. However, I still think it's a good game. It's the only game I know of with 44 playable characters and over 10 endings. It doesn't really have very much to do with CT, though. You don't have that big of a world to explore, and there are only two diferent times to which you can travel. It's still fun, though. When you beat the game, you have a feature called New Game + where you can do cool things. You restart with all of your good weapons and you're as strong as you were when you beat the game the first time. You have a feature where you don't have to play as the main character, and you can make everything go really fast. New Game + and different choices in the game (which allow you to acquire different characters) give the game a ton of replay value. It's fun, but it's not that much like CT.
