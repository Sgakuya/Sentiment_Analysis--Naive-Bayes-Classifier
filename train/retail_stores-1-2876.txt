I bought a 4500.00 ring in 98 for my fiance. A week later, I got hired on the other side of the state (Texas). True love being what it was, she decided she did not want to move. I took the ring back in less than 30 days after purchase date and was told they WOULD NOT take it back, unless I upgraded. I told them this was against their policy, and I would leave the ring on their table and walk out to get my money back. The store manager told me that if they found a ring on their table, they would turn it over to mall security, and I would still owe the whole amount. I ended up sitting with that ring for 5 years. When I went to trade it in on a different ring for my new fiance, the salesman tried to sell me a ring for 5200.00. Good thing I was paying attention, because the EXACT ring she had picked out was pictured on one of their table top standees...FOR 3950.00!!! Then he played stupid, like he did not know it was there. I ended up having to buy her an expensive watch to get where I needed to be money wise. I dont recommend anyone go to whitehall jewelers. They try to suck you out of everything you have, and if you dont have it....FINANCE IT! They dont hold up to their policies and even the store manager wouldnt honor their policy the first time. Oh, and their four month checkup is good for people who live in major cities where Whitehalls are...but is terrible for us who live an hour away from a Whitehall and dont go to the malls very much.
