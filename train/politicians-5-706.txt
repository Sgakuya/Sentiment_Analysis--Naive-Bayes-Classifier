Sultan al-Nahyan's regime in the United Arab Emirates is a good example of how a Middle Eastern nation should be run. Here is a man who put together a nation from various local tribes and created a well differentiated modern society all in the span of about thirty years. Oil profits are distributed to all of the people. This is a modern post-industrialist society in the Middle East. To all those who say that Arabs can't live in peace and prosperity, I say look towards the UAE. al-Nahyan could have been like other leaders in the developing world and kept the money for himself, but he instead decided to invest it in human capital and the result was the creation of one of the most modern societies in the world. A big problem in the developing world is that wealth is not properly distributed. Governments in these nations should become more selfless and invest in human capital; it will bring a worthwhile return. It isn't that difficult to do, invest in infrastructure, education, and social services and the rest will solve itself because you will have independent people who are not impoverished and that are productive. Massive land and wealth redistribution programs akin to the Stalinist system of government will not solve anything. Our greatest natural resource is people. al-Nahyan realized that and he is reaping the benefits of his progressive policies.
