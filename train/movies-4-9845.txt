I was surprised when I ended up liking this movie. It's not great cinema but a cute movie. Romy and Michele have been friends since school days they are now roomates and have been out of school for 10 years. They are going to their high school reunion. Both had some unhappy experiences in school and were never part of the so called in group .they decide to make up a lie about inventing the post it to impress their ex school mates.I love how the snotty group of girls who made life miserable get a bit of their own back. For example Christy who was a cheerleader and miss popular turned out to be a nobody.and her boyfriend turned husband also popular was a drunk and a joke.I also liked a message at the end of the movie that everyone had a person who make their like miserable in school' It kind of showed we were all vulneralbe to the sometimes cruelty that comes with high school. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino both did well as Romy and Michele.If you are looking for an oscar calliber type movie, this is not it. But a movie for the fun of it, this is not so bad.
