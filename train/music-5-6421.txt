Anyone that gives this album a bad rating, is doing it clearly for meaness or hasn't heard it, because it is flat out awesome. I will be honest, I never owned an ALice album before this one. I had heard some songs on the radio and thought they were good, but after seeing some cool reviews about this one, I thought, Why not? I couldn't believe how great the whole thing is. Hard rocking, dark, and a mature album. The type of album Alice needed to make. I got this album two weeks ago, and yesterday went and bought a couple of other Alice albums. This guy is great, and shame on me for overlooking him. I plan to buy more soon, but Alice I am with you and will see you on tour this year!
