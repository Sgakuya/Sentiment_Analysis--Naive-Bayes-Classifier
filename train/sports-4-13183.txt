HELLO BRINGER OF FAMINE!! It seems u have a problem with the whole state of Tx. I don't know why, nor do I care, but for you to say it's been years since Texas Tech had a respectable team just goes to show how much you watched (or didn't) this past season! We swept the state of Texas and ended a remarkable 9-5 season. Tech had a top 20 schedule difficulty rating, and pulled off some remarkable upsets i.e. Beating 3rd Ranked Texas. Our QB, Kliff Kingsbury landed more NCAA Big XII records than you can shake a stick at: almost 50 pass. TD, over 5000 yrds. passing this season (3rd person in History), #1 Ranked NCAA Offense. I believe 4 Big XII Player of the Week awards, USA Today player of the week award, Heisman candidate, Golden Arm candidate. We'll all see him go to a great NFL franchise in the top 5 rounds of the Draft. We also have Wes Welker, the greatest all purpose player of my generation. Scoffed at by all Division 1A schools but Tech, Wes proved it's not size, but heart and determination. Finish 2nd in Big XII all purpose yards, 4 or 5 punt returns for TD and more. Don't forget about Lawrence Flugence, a GREAT DB for Tech. This LB cause one heck of a rucous through-out his career at Tech. He's another player sure to go in the Top rounds of the Draft. We can't leave out Aaron Hunt, who set the Big XII All-Time Sack Record this year. Tech hasn't had a RESPECTABLE team in years? What do you call a 50 t0 15 ROMPIN' over Bowden and the Clemson boys @ the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando? Look in the dictionary under RESPECTABLE, and you'll probably see pictures of Lady Raiders coach Marsha Sharp, BB Coach BOB KNIGHT and Big XII award winning coach, MIKE LEACH. How many other Bix XII teams created their own offenses from scratch? Let's see, that RESPECTABLE team ran by Stoops up in OU is using Mike Leach's Offense. You DO REMEMBER Leach was the Offensive Coordinator up there, don't you? I can't wait to read your comments about Tech in 2 to 3 years when the Red Raiders is a TOP NATIONAL CONTENDER!
