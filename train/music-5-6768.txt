Ok first of all Dorian. You are just an idiot. If you are into rock then you would probably kno that rock, is pretty much screaming. They are not talentless. The only person talentless here is you. You cannot judge them properly because you cannot even spell. Their songwriting makes perfect sense. Obviously music lyrics mean nothing to you and your too stupid to understand the message in most of their songs. They do not whine. It is called singing their mind, or in ONE of the singers of the band he raps it out. Music is speaking their mind. Obviously you cannot seem to understand this. And some of the modern rap if pretty good. Maybe your just too OLD to understand any of it. Most of the bands you have listed are OLD. This is a nice cd. What it is, is a remix of all of their songs, and a lot of new ones with different lyrics. Also Stuf if you love the group then you would have noticed that they have new songs and the lyrics have changed been remade. The cd is about being a big remix. Nothing else.
