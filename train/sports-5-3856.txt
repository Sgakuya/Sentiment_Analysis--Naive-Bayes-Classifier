A very capable and dangerous slugger. Maybe his numbers - over a single season - are not that spectacular (one year he couldn't even bust the Mendoza Line). They look kind of like Jose Canseco (though Jackson was far more durable) or Rafael Palmeiro numbers. He won just one MVP award, in 1973. That year, he had an interesting Triple Crown, leading the league in HRs, Runs, and RBI. That's kind of like a hockey player leading the league in both goals and assists. But Jackson's intangible greatness is that wherever he went, teams won. From 1971 to 1982, he played for four different teams and went to 10 post-seasons. Five times, his teams won the World Series ('72-'74 for Oakland and '77-'78 for the Yankees). His 1977 World Series was possibly the greatest series batting performance in history. His dynamic personality and flair for controversy doesn't hurt his stature either.
