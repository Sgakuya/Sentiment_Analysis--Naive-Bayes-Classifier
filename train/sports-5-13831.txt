I met Payton (VERY briefly) in a mall just outside the Louisiana Superdome in December of '89. He was on his way to do some analysis for an NFL game that was about to be played. What struck me about the encounter was that Walter Payton A) had been retired for two or three years, and B) had a reputation of being a bit small for an NFL running back. But when I shook the guy's hand he had the the strongest grip I have ever felt (and he wasn't hurting me or squeezing hard). He was just a thoroughly ripped powerful, powerful guy. He oozed of physical strength ... and he was so thick and solidly built ... After that meeting I could understand how he got all those yards. Quite frankly, I simply find it difficult to imagine anyone having been able to knock the guy down.
