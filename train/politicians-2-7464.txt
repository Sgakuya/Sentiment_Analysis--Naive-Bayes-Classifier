Chickencow, he certainly has the correct track record for a democrat presidential candidate, looking at the last seven democrat candidates, prior to the elections. To say he shares "some" of the blame for the post-Katrina debacle is like saying the driver of the car in a one-car crash is "somewhat" responsible for the damage to his car. This guy was elected by the people of New Orleans to be their "leader" in a time of crisis. Anyone giving him a pass, even a partial pass, explains why there are so many incompetent and corrupt career politicians. Did he fail or not? OK, others failed also. Did HE fail, or not?
