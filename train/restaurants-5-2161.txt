(I do not work for Tim Hortons) Tim HOrtons has always had a solid commitment to quality and service. (Visit their website to see: www.timhortons.om) There have been issues and problems with food before, but they have always come out of it stronger. Who knows, maybe with competing franchises entering the market, that advertise their freshly prepared donuts, Tim Hortons will revert back to their -prepared in store- policy. I am still a Tim Hortons Fan, a Tim Hortons donut lover and will forever be drinking Tim Hortons coffee._____ _____ _____ _____ ADDITION: I've noticed that the quality at Country Style has declined. They have smaller muffins, bagels, and other baked goods. This in responce to CountryStyler.
