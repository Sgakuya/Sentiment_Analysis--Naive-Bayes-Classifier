I love Kubrick and Nicholson and horror and Stephen King, but I hated this movie. Nicholson sucked as a villain, Duvall can't act, and I never got the whole mental powers shining thing. Some classic scenes, like the elevator of blood, here's Johnny , the twin girls, redrum , and the woman in the tub, but they're all visceral and seem strung together. The movie could've used a more claustrophobic feel - the hotel seemed too big a backdrop to feel fear in. We never see Nicholson and Duvall share any real scenes as husband/wife, so there's an empty feeling when he starts acting mean and loony. They could've made this movie better. Kubrick was good w/ movies that required distance - this wasn't 1 of them. And Nicholson should stay away from horror and super heroes.villainy - he's best as an anti-hero.
