Well, let met just push my way through the Vanderbilts and the Rockefellers and say this about that; I've had $100 per bottle champagne and I've had $15 per bottle stuff and yes - uncool as this sounds - have actually enjoyed both! From my experience, Korbel Brut is one of the best of the less expensive variety. It's tasty, bubbly and especially good with strawberries (frozen ones are excellent - they stay cold as they soak up the liquid). The best part is, you don't have to take out a small loan to enjoy a glass or two. So, while I might splurge for Dom or Perrier-Jouet for very special times (weddings and anniversaries, etc.) for most other times, Korbel Brut fits the bill just fine - not to mention it's also much kinder to my bank account. Cheers!
