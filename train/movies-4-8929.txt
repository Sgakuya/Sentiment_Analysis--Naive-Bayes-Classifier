I liked this movie more than I thought I would. An old TV. show called Galaxy Quest.the actors still travel the country so fans of the show can meet them. None of the actors have done much since the show.All resent the fact that these roles are the only ones the public will accept them in. Everything changes for them when it turns out aliens from another planet have seen the show. The only thing is the aliens do not know it is a show and thing the actors are real space heros. they recruit the actors to help them save their planet. Now the actors have to actually live out their roles. this is an enjoyable movie for the fun of it.
