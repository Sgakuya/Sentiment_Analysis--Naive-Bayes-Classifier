Another great series that I am currently reading. Snicket has a easy manner and tone and I think he connects with the reader on numerous levels. The addition of vocabulary words is great but even without that, his story telling technique contains a darkness to it that is really appealing. I have heard a lot of comparisions made between him and and Rowling, which personally, I don't subscribe to. They are two great writers putting out work that inspires imagination. Leave it at that. Also, Snicket comes from that school that is reminiscent of Edward Gorey. Philip Ardaugh is another great writer one might look for...if one were so inclined to look for other great writers in this particular genre.
