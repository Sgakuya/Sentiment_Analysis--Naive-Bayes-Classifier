To my mind the single most influential and greatest player of all.The ultimate general:ruthless,determined,scimitar-sharp brain, utterly composed under pressure,and able to instil in his team a total belief in victory,which he would inevitably conjure (magician-like)from the most unlikely circumstances.His record is legendary,his partnership with Jerry Rice still unmatched.Above all he was a winner. I say all this with no home town bias,being British-there,my credibility's completely blown!I was not a 49ers fan,indeed i almost invariably supported Montana's opponents in Superbowls and otherwise(i must admit i took a shine to the Seahawks when American Football was first shown here -an act of noble-naive masochism as it turned out),which over the years only increased my respect for the man. In Britain unfortunately the magnificent gladiatorial sport(such dynamic pace,skill and power!) is no longer screened on T.V.It reached a peak of popularity when the Bears(Taylor,Payton..)briefly ruled the forest,but slowly declined-it was always more for the armchair spectator rather than of mass participation here.I was an avid weekly viewer and greatly regret its current demise in Britain,but here's hoping it continues to excite and create new great heroes to rival Montana,Brown,Rice,Payton,Sanders..
