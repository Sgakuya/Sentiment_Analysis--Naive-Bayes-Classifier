I adore him! So what if he's a power-hungry, promiscuous megalomaniac? Saddam is a truly strong (and not to mention, secular) leader. A man as great as him does not come often, and Saddam should be honored! It is very obvious that those 'bash' him have been listening to underhanded American propaganda for far too long. ' Saddam's performance in the USA's funhouse-court was refreshing; his words ring true. He has shown us once more his ability to persevere under the most difficult of circumstances, and I can only hope that his followers in Iraq will find as much inspiration in his recent appearances as I did.
