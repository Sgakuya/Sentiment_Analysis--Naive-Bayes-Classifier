I grew up thinking of White Castle as one of the more rare fast food treats. That's probably mostly because my mother only had an urge for them about once every 5 years or so. When I grew up and started to make my own fast food decisions I would choose White Castle now and then ... mostly for the same reason you do a lot of things when you first leave home - because I could. It only took one bad late night/early morning munching episode with White Castle in general and onion chips specifically to convince me that this is the home of the original gut bomb. I admit that I still like the taste of just the plain old burger. But I seem to have inherited my mother's tendency to not want them for about 5 year intervals. One thing though, I think they have really excellent coffee and it's much more reasonably priced than most other fast food restaurants.
