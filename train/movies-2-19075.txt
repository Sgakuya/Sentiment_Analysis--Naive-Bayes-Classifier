Ok, I enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining waiting to see how each kid was going to die and being startled when a teeny bopper got axed out of no where. That is all nice and everything but it does not constitute a great movie. A good idea though. The idea alone puts it above (but not far) the scream and I Know movies.What ever happened to suspense? Shock is nifty but it is momentary. It happens, it's over! Hitchcock, why have you left us(sniffle,sniffle)? I saw this movie a second time and it is really lame on the repeat viewing. See it once and then relish in the after glow. If you see it again you'll end up like me...not necessarily a bad thing.
