First of all, I think the quintessential Eastwood art form is the Western. I don't really like Eastwood movies that are non-Western, and I don't like many Western movies that are non-Eastwood. I prefer his brand of revisionist western. The old John Ford movies, with the good guy wearing white, who would never draw first or shoot a man in the back, are merely fantasy versions of the old west. In Clint Eastwood westerns, by contrast, he is the hero by default; every other character is so miserable and dishonest that Clint looks angelic in comparison, even if his character is mainly motivated by money, and not above stacking the odds in his favour. He is the epitome of the lonesome drifter. Maybe he is not a very versatile actor, but is so likeable and charismatic that he will forever be an icon of American cinema. He has also done a lot of work for environmental causes, and is a good man. For anyone to dismiss him as some right-wing glorifier of violence is to entirely miss the point of everything he has ever done. Watch his Sergio Leone films, there is not a drop of blood but the violence is still brutal and shocking, which is hardly a glorification.
