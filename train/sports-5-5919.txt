JJ is really something words can't describe. And to all of those who say crap about him, be serious! Until you can shoot free throws at 93% or make threes like he can, you don't have the right to say he sucks, etc. I've really had enough of people who come up to me and are like Did you see JJ miss that one three? He was so off! when its like Did you see the other 10 he made? I'm not saying you can't have your own opinion, but at least base it off facts. And if you're thinking then why isn't he have a great three percentage, why don't you think about all the opposing guys guarding you? When you are the guy to watch on the court, and are getting followed every spot you move to, its kind of hard to be right on. Plus, nobody is PERFECT. So, bottom line, JJ rocks!! --oh and one more thing, GO DUKE!! ACC CHAMPS. ONCE AGAIN!!
