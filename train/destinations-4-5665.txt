Living in CT for the past few years allowed me to make many trips to Mass. It's a pretty small state but there's a lot to visit; Plymouth has a ton of history, Salem has all the witch trials and is the best place in the world to be on Halloween, Cape Cod is beautiful and is so much fun in the summer, Springfield has the Basketball Hall of Fame, and Boston has everything you could ask for in a big city. People say New Englanders aren't the most friendly people, however I've found them to be friendly enough it's just that their sarcastic. Come with a sense of humor and you'll be fine. One thing that I don't get about Mass is how to pronounce their towns. Try to say these towns, and then found out how you're supposed to pronounce them: Tewksbury, Haverhill, Worcester, Bellerica, Woburn, Peabody...
