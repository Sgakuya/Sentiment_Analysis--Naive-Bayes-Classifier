People such as Neil8 make me sick. In trying to sound intelligent, he sounds ridiculous. There is absolutely NO PROOF WHATSOEVER that Washington had sex with his slaves or had mistresses. I invite him to come out of the PC world of fairy tales that states that if one owned slaves, he was automatically sleeping with them. Stop trying to apply modern day morals to the 1700's. Every home in the United States should have a picture of Washington, there would absolutely be no USA if it hadn't been for this man. His birthday should be celebtated and his life should be taught about with the same emphasis that is put on MLK day by the PC crowd. After all, MLK was as flawed as Washington was supposed to have been, and no one has a problem with him. Stop the hypocracy!
