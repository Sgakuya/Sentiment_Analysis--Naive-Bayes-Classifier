WELL WELL WELL!!!What a mixed bag of reviws.I have lived in Hungary for two years now and I love it.Women food drink and people are all soo nice.Ilived in london for 40 years and know the city better than 99% of the people there and I tell you know London is a 1st class sh*t hole.I fell in love with Hungary four years ago and couldn't wait to emigrate here.No its not perfect or high tech.But it works.Transport system is exteremly efficient.People are helpful and friendly and polite.It helps to learn a few simple words or expressions in Hungarian and the people will love you for it.Budapest is a beautiful city and clean.Like any place when travelling you will always find tourist sharks .I have watched them in Rome Amsterdam Paris and London to name just a few.It seems the negative comments are people speaking through their pockets who have been ripped off by their own stupidity and lack of common sense.As for the hygeine of people and suggestion of lack of hot water.I can only say that if you stay in cheap accomadation you get cheap facilities.Go on the metro or tram at 8 o clock in the morning and look at and smell the georgous smart women passengers.I have trouble keeping my hands to myself.When you go travelling anywhere spend 10 pounds on a guide book and READ IT and it will tell you the scams and rip-offs in any situation.Then take your head from out of your a*se open your eyes remove the MUG sign from your forehead and enjoy the experience of travelling.If you come to Budapest use the airport minibus service and not the taxis.If you want taxis I reccomend only CITY TAXI Company.Be certain to buy travel tickets on the tube and tram system before you ride and DO NOT FORGET TO VALIDATE YOUR TICKET.The ticket inspectors take no prisoners and will fine you 2000 ft.Even I forget to sometimes.Enjoy Budapest, its a great place. 5
