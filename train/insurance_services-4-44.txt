i work for progressive as a claims rep and i deal with alot of insurance companies on a daily basis when arguing liability and resolving claims. I have to say progressive is the most honest and straight forward insurance company out there. We do not just tell customers what they want to hear we tell them the truth and reality of the situation. As far as the gripes about the use of aftermarket parts this is standard practice in the insurance industry and if it weren't premiums would be triple what they are now. Progressive offers a lifetime guarantee on any repairs done by one of their recommened shops. How many other insurance companies can you say the same about?
