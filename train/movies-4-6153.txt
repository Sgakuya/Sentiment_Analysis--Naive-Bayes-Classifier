Released in 1970 and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, Patton is a film biography of World War II American General George Patton. The movie opens with an unforgettable visual of Patton (George C. Scott) giving a famous speech in front of a huge American flag. The film then goes on to portray Patton's campaigns in North Africa and Europe, his personal eccentricities (eg his belief in reincarnation), flaws (eg his striking a soldier suffering from shell shock), and conflicts with his more politically minded superiors and peers including British Field Marshal Montgomery (Michael Bates) and American General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden). This film is an epic three hours long; however, George C. Scott gives an epic, Oscar winning performance so good that entire generations picture Scott when they think of General Patton. (Scott refused his award.) The bottom line is that Patton is more than a war film, but rather a condensed biography of a flawed man during exceptional times.
