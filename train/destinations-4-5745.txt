Florida is an ideal vacation but not somplace I'd consider living year round (maybe Fort Lauderdale as an exception). A Florida vacation is a great remedy for winters up north. The gulf coast has amazing beaches with powder white sand and emerald green water and occasionally dolphins are spotted leaping out of the water. The sunsets here are very nice as well. Orlando offers a world of fun but of course that go's without saying. Disney World can make any jaded adult feel like a kid again. Miami has a big city pulse and cosmopolitan environment not found anywhere else in the state. I did find Fort Lauderdale to be the nicest of all cities in Florida as it is very clean and it has a very inviting beach and just seemed a bit more liveable than Miami or Tampa. On that note Tampa is crap, if you're ever in the area, skip it and head straight to the gulf beaches.
