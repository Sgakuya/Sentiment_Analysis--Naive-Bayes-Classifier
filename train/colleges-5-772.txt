Currently a PhD student at Capella, I find the experience energizing, challenging and the perfect solution for my learning style. With a Bachelor's and Master's from traditional 'brick and mortar' universities, I always felt like I was faking it. Show enough admiration for the 'sage on the stage', turn in summaries of what they said, and you get an A. Challenge their thought, think for yourself, express desire for doing more than listening...you'll suffer. I don't have to suffer or fake it at Capella. I can travel, work, 'come to class' 24 hours a day, and be challenged to produce exemplary research. If this adult, online, self-directed, collegial experience wasn't available, I would never have returned for a PhD. If you're not satisfied with listening for your education, check out Capella.
