To Inmyopinion, Ra-cha-cha (Rochester metro) isn't the only metro Upstate gaining population. The Syracuse metro and the Albany area are also growing recently(2000-2005). Meanwhile, the Buffalo metro, Utica metro, Binghamton metro are all declining in population. So Inmyopinion I don't know what you are talking about. The Rochester area lost 11,000 jobs since 1998, while the Syracuse area gained 7,000 jobs. Rochester also has a crime problem way worse than Syracuse or Buffalo. Rochester has nothing like Armory Square in Syracuse(a place downtown with restaurants, shops, museums, and clubs all cluster together) and Rochester has no real sport teams that the rest of the country ever even heard about, let alone cares about.
