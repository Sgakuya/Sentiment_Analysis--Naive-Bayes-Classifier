I flew Frontier for my last two flights, and I had a good experience overall. One thing that stood out was how nice the flight attendants were. One woman even offered to carry my bag down the aisle of the plane, which has never happened to me before on another airline. On my flight to Las Vegas, the flight attendants organized an entertaining betting game. The snacks they served (hot pretzels with mustard, chips and salsa, and Wheatables) were tasty and and a nice change from the standard bag of peanuts. The only drawback was that one of my flights was delayed by an hour- hardly anything to complain about these days, though. I definitely plan to fly Frontier in the future whenever I can.
