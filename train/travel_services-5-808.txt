Portland's mass transit system has been viewed as an example both nationwide, and around the world as standard from which to design other systems around. The downtown core has two one way streets that are almost exclusively designed for bus use. All buses, with some minor exceptions flow in and out of the Fareless Square area of this downtown hub. With three light rail lines (and a fourth in the planning stages), plus the new Portland Streetcar, area residents will be offered a number of convenient options for traversing the Portland area. Currently, light rail extends in three directions throughout the city and into Portlands suburbs, with an additional line traveling directly to and from Portland International Airport. By the end of this decade, a fourth light rail line will connect another major suburban area and the Portland Streetcar will likely have two new extensions that connect the downtown core with thousands of new, upscale residences on the edge of the central city. There are approximately 7,500 park-and-ride spaces conveniently situated alongside area rail lines, and an expansive free transit district that covers both downtown and the Rose Quarter, making light rail even more enticing.
