Olga can't act, can't even pretend to act very well. She reads her lines like she is reading a book. No emotion, no intensity and a total lack of life in her performance. She was hired because she is moderately pretty. She makes a horrible lesbian and should stick to having sex with men, cause she has no passion for Bianca whatsoever and it's a joke to see her phone in her lines all the time. Aside from all the votes here from her fan club, I doubt anyone would agree with the rating she currently has. Kind of obvious when each person has rated one item on the whole site. In time the rating will come down to where it should be, near the bottom.
