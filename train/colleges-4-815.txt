How very interesting that those students posting complaints about the UOP all refer to the same issues: FINANCIAL AID; Academic the unprofessionalism of the staff; the UOP being a degree mill etc. They are all true. Believe every word that is spoken. Not only was I an online student with them for a little over a year, the continued turnover rates of these people in critical positions was a joke. You never knew whom to call; you were never informed; the tuition per credit hour was just a royal hoot for the education being obtained. Return calls, oh that's a joke. I ended up leaving the UOP and had to enlist the services of my Congressional Leader since the UOP assumed they were going to keep my $1400.00 credited to my account. Yeah right! While I did receive high grades, I will admit, I did work hard for them - no doubt about that however, the deceitful, manipulative, greedy and darned right pestering practices this school used(uses) leaves alot to be desired! On the other hand, WESTERN INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY (a newborn of the UOP) is no different. They are just as deceptive, manipulative, greedy and very ill informed as individuals at the UOP. I advise students to check around. There has to be something better out there than either of these two "institutions" of ill repute. Did I mention your hard earned degree isn't worth the paper it's written on? Heard that DIRECTLY from an employer that said they wouldn't hire a UOP graduate if they were the last individual on the face of the earth. Wonder why? When the DOE contacts the school for information regarding a student and the school does not respond that should send up red flares immediately. In essence, both degree mills should be shut down and made to return the monies they've STOLEN from many students based LIES, LIES, LIES, LIES!
