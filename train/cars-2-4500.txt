One Windstar owner I spoke to about the headgasket problems transmission problems on 1995 Windstars put it well: The reason the Windstar has such high safety ratings is that you never get to drive it because it's always in the shop. My headgasket failed at the cost of $1800, and I'm planning on selling it before the transmission goes. It's a nice car in other respects, but it doesn't do you much good if it has such major defects (and defects they are if you just do a little research on the internet)that you can't depend on it. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy a 1995 Windstar and I even feel bad selling it.
