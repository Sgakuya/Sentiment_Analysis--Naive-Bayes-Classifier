Suffers some from its dated 1980's feel and sound-track, but I found this to be a fairly gripping thriller when I first saw it, and I'm not adverse to watching it again when it's on in re-runs on cable. I've always thought William Peterson was a good actor and I'm sorry that his career never seemed to progress further than it did (although he apparently still has a viable enough career on TV and sometimes as a character actor in film). This was also the first movie I saw Willem Dafoe in, and he's chillingly sociopathic here. Also (not that I'm a big fan of car chases), this film features one of the better car-chase scenes you're going to see. Doesn't beat "French Connection" or "Bullitt" or even "The 7-Ups" but it had me on the edge of my seat the first time I saw it. Not a classic, but there are worse, far-less entertaining ways to spend 2 hours. And I love the California scenery.
