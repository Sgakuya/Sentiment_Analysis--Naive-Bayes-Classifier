The most overrated film director of all time. When you look at his movies today, letting the passage of time filter their qualities and put them in a relative perspective, you have a lot of trivial populist pap and kidstuff. ET was a ridiculous, maudlin bit of nonsense; The Color Purple was one of the most boring and adrift films I've ever seen; Jurassic Park was just another special effects film with a $29.95 script supporting it; Jaws, with that totally unrealistic shark, was the most unfrightening thriller ever made; Close Encounters was a tepid and tentative effort that really didn't know what it was after, so it never found it; Saving Private Ryan was totally ludicrous. All of these films were based on ridiculous or relatively inconsequential premises, so as a result, none of them rang true. Spielberg's magnus opus, his one film irrefutably aimed at an adult audience, Schindler's List has the look and feel of a made-for-TV movie. He has a very heavy-handed storytelling style, and visually, there's nothing particularly compelling here. He gets allright performances out of his actors, but nothing special. These films have not aged well already, so they are likely to look totally bush league 20 years from now.
