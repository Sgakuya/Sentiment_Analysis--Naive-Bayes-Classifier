I never thought much of the US to begin with, but after reading some of the comments on this site, man oh man you people are so f***in FULL of yourselves!! the US is not the greatest or richest country on the planet, not by a LOOONNNG shot and all you do (not all of you, some) is brag about how great you are, how great your country is, why don't you get off your huge asses and start being more humble (at least a little would go a long way). Bush is a moron (on basis of his recent actions), and while the US itself (landscape, attractions) are nice, you people need to seriously get a life. While you may be the ruling power of North America for now, don't count on it forever. Do something smart for once and go live in Canada. A real country that doesn't try to make false allegations about itself, but is a multi-cultural, thriving nation that has great people, beautiful land and a good government system. I'm sooooo sick of hearing about American ideals, (while freedom and liberty are great, stop preaching and start worrying about the huge poverty, homeless and countless other issues America has). I'm not saying other countries are perfect, but the US is a HUGE self-promoter and doesn't have a humble person on the country's soil.
