i love how people that obviously hate duke always say all he can do is shoot the three it just shows that you know nothing about him. Yes he is an incredible three point shooter and you should be bitter hes not on your team, but he is way more than that, you would know this if you actually did your research. So go on crying because you cant/didnt get into duke. You're just making yourself look like an asshole UPDATE the only unanimous All ACC pick, and ACC tournament MVP how are you going to say he's not good? Keep in mind that it is not all Duke fans that make these selection, so don't give me any bias crap. He is talented, one of the best, no ifs ands or buts. **Oh no a college student that smokes weed! thats not normal...and please illegal screens JJ hits shots when he's got two players sticking their hands in his face. that is just an ignorant comment that shows you obviously dont watch enough games to make that statement.
