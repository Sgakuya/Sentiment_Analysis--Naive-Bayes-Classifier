Jerry West was flat out the greatest clutch player of all time, with all due respect to MJ. There has never been a deadlier player taking the last shot of a game. Despite a career average of 27 points per game, being the first guard to ever score over 60 in a game; being the first player to record a triple double in the NBA finals, Bill Russell referred to him as a far better DEFENSIVE player than offensive. Limping through his last year in the league, steals were kept as a statistic for the first time in history, and West became the first player to ever record ten steals in one game. Connie Hawkins biography makes a reference to a Suns/Lakers playoff game in which West had FOURTEEN steals before it was a stat.
