yeah we can switch to shelden but how are u running out of space? ALl i do is delete my last comment and start a fresh comment. Oh and about beating us 19 in a row the dean smith days are over and Duke has thrashed unc in the last four games winning three and why could you not mention the sweep huh why . Unc has a great basketball program, But Dukes is better I dont care if unc has beat duke 1000 times we are better and you will see next year while duke has a good record like 31 and something will carolina is 19-11 so enjoy your little one year title cause it is definetly going to be a champion whether duke wins it or not if yall play santa clara they might beat the defending champs again with a double digit win
