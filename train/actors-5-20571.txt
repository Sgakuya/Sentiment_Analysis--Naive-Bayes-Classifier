As much as I have seen of Love, she hasn't done anything that would warrant such horrid descriptions of her. I've watched her from Birds of Paradise to today. She didn't want to do anything but have fun and help others have fun. The roles she plays are the roles she likes to play because they are the closest to her heart. To continuously take the same path, as in staying with PoF, offers no growth as an actress. She knew the series was going to end, so she tried to carry it on with her own character and make her character grow. Sad to say, it did not last. But this is beside the point. Love is a lady who has much to offer. As an actress, she has much talent to bring to the screen. All she needs is the time to hone her skills. Some movies won't exactly be Academy Award winners, but people who can do that from the very beginning are few and far between. What she doesn't need are a bunch of f#cks who have their heads jammed up their arses, who don't even try to think about what an actor or actress has to go through to become great, who have to talk sh!t about someone before they have a chance to show what they are really capable of doing. These sorry people need to go stick their haeds back up their arses so the rest of us open-minded people can enjoy the freakin' movie! If you don't like her, fine, that's your opinion. But at least give her a chance to show what kind of actress she can be before passing judgement. In the meantime, I'm gonna go see Heartbreakers and see Love in a very different light!
