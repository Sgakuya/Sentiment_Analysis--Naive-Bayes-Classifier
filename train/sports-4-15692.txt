Not that great. He's one dimensional. He's good at making plays, but if you watch him on an average play you will see him make alot of mistakes. He's overrated because he's fast for a linebacker. He overpursues alot. However, he's also undersized and honestly piss poor against power backs. There are plenty of great players on the Bears defense, including Nathan Vasher, Tommie Harris, and Mike Brown... It's their strong play that allows a weak but fast linebacker like Urlacher to make plays. By himself, he's average. UPDATE: I'm willing to admit my opinion of him was a little outdated. He still will make more mistakes than the average linebacker, but he is maturing. I still think on a bad defense he would look terrible. However, he does make some great plays. He relies too much on talent and not enough on his mind. I'll give him a 4 for now since he is a great talent.
