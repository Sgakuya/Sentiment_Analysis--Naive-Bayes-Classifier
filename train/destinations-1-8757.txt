I started chewing this crap while playing baseball in my teens to be cool and continued into my late 20's. This stuff will burn a hole right through your lip. Quit while you can!!! I chewed this worm dirt and wasted my money until I couldn't drink a cup of water without my lip burning. My gumline around my front teeth was dissapearing rapidly, add that to the white bumps I was developing which I was told were the beginnings of cancer I decided to quit. Quitting was torture!!! But it was the best thing I've EVER done. I now use the $100 a month I wasted on this crap to take a vacation every year. Quit this crap before it's too late!!!!
