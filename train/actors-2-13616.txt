Her acting is OK and she is great for the character on Friends, but she really is so overrated. I have always felt sorry for her about her looks and find it really really puzzling that anyone thinks she's beautiful. I can see something attractive about nearly every celebrity, but I think she is really ugly. Her hair is so boring...I can't believe people worship it. It was the absolute worst when it was really long and looked like she had split ends and needed a good cut, and now she's got the most boring and style-less bob I've ever seen. I don't consider her to be a good role model because she lost too much weight...and apparently the actresses on Friends are instrumental in setting the standard for body shape in Hollywood. Now women with beautiful shapely bodies like Tiffani Amber Thiessen have to lose weight for roles. I think it is disgusting because she already had a stable acting job, and her vanity and warped body image now make it harder for women with remotely normal bodies to get work in acting, and it perpetuates a dangerously thin body image.
