ugh. i didnt want to read some of the comments on here about this novel. boring overrated racist i know the words before i looked. say what you will but this is a masterwork of American Fiction. maybe the most American of all novels the people of this nation produced. true Twain's use of common racial vernacular can make for a testy reading in your modern day literature clases, but if you dont understand the times you are doomed to repeat them. But what about the emotional impact? the story of being unwanted and outside society. a true road novel before Kerouac even breathed, only it takes place on the mightiest stretch of water we have in this nation. i guess that's it. most people in this world, blinded by striving for inclusion, could never see what rests in Twain's book, what is at stake for both Huck and Jim in the society they live in.
