I had a Festiva, but she got smashed up when a dickhead slammed into the back of it at some traffic lights. It was totalled and I cried, not because I was injured and had cuts and blood all over me from the crash...but because my poor little car was sitting there on the road smashed to bits. We'd had so many good times together. It was so reliable, never had a thing wrong with it until that guy smashed it up. It was bright red with tinted windows and even had some little mag wheels on it. I got that car for my 17th birthday and I loved it way too much. Sometimes I would spend hours just driving it around, and it also seemed to attract guys... the first thing me ex said to me was Hey aren't u the girl who drives that red festiva?. My ex-boyfriend even used to tease me and say I loved my car more than him, and it was probably true! R.I.P. Frisky (My Festiva's name)
