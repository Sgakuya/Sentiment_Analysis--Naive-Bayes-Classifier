At 5th in the AP poll they are overrated and their guard play is going to haunt them in the tournament. However, I think they would more than hold their own in any conference in the country. Morrison is the most versatile scorer college basketball has seen in a while and he has proven it with some of his best games against their toughest opponents. Batista has as good of touch around the basket as anybody and they are also the best free throw shooting team in the nation, which could prove to be crucial in close games (and has already in their latest win against St. Mary's). They have already beaten Maryland, Michigan State, Virginia and Oklahoma State. Losses to UConn, UW and Memphis, all three of which could make the final four. They have the toughest out of conference schedule in the nation. The whole of the WCC is really bad except for Gonzaga, it matters little how much you win or lose by, but whether you win or lose period.
