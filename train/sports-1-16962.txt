I think everyone pretty much figured the Bears weren't gonna be Super Bowl champs when the signed the king of the world, KORDELL No I ain't gay STEWART for crying out loud. He did wonders for Pittsburgh, so let's put him on a crappy team. Whoopee, we're good now!!! The running back A-Hole is the only thing better than average on offense, and Brian Urlacher isn't exactly challenged as the best guy on defense. This team will probably never, ever be good again. But then again, aside from the freak 13-3 campaign two years ago, when was the last time that anyone thought that they didn't completely blow donkey's?
