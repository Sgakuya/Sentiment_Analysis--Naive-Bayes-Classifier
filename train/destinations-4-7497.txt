Oberammergau is a really pleasant Alpine village, good for relaxing and enjoying a nice blend of nature and a quaint German mountain village. Food is good, wine is OK, and beer (I'm told) is great. There's not a whole heck fo a lot to do there (I was there for a couple of NATO courses when there was still a NATO school there). Stayed at the Hotel Wittelsbach for a week; not a bad hotel, and the hotel dining room served some very good venison dishes. Prices were generally decent for ost meals and local crafts. English wasn't really a widely spoken language there. People tend to be commercially friendly. In addition to the times I went to O'gau at the behest of the government, I went a few times on my own hook, as I enjoyed the scenery, food, and peacefulness of the place. I like Oberammergau more than I like Garmisch; I think O'gau is somewhat less commercialized. Nice place to visit if you're anywhere near Munich.
