The impact that A Beautiful Mind will have on you depends on how much you buy in to Russell Crowe's performance as the schizophrenic genius, John Nash. If Crowe convinces you, you will walk away from this film moved and inspired - if he doesn't, it's going to be a long couple of hours. I ended up somewhere in between. I thought Crowe was absolutely brilliant in spots, especially in the second half of the film. However, there were also parts of the movie that I could sense that he was acting. Despite the occasional lapses in the movie, A Beautiful Mind is definitely worth seeing. The idea of a man who is able to use the power of his mind to overcome the terrifying delusions that this same mind has conjured up is remarkable. The fact that John Nash is a a real person makes it even more so.
