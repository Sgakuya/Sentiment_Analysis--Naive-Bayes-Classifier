Emmitt's line his first few years in the league is overrated by today's fans. He eventually had the best line in football, but only in his prime. Later in his career, when he was STILL going to the Pro Bowl, he had a sorry line. Last year, given his usuall carries, he still would've eaked out 1,000 at his advanced age with one of the worst lines in football. The great line argument holds no water. He also caught. He also blocked. He carried his team. He once got the Cowboys into the playoffs single handedly beating the Giants. Literally, his other arm was hanging at his side! He had Payton-like heart and was consistent. He had a gain almost every play. He didn't need long runs to get his numbers. He was consistent, which is FAR more important than occasional bursts with many losses (cough-sanders-cough). A complete back with heart. And rings.
