Good General MBA. Hands on MBA. Real Projects for real Clients. Completed Exectuive MBA programme within 2 years (2002-2004) undertook projects for Unilever and Aggregate Industries. Had opportunity to research into new business opportunity under Entrepreneurship Project (importing and distributing fair trade toys). Corporate Recovery and Turnaround is highly recommended. Some of the faculty members' knowledge, experience and teaching abilities are questionable. Use old case studies quite often. Facilities are adequate. Made me become who I am today(trying to become an entrepreneur - visit www.ebdex.co.uk). Would recommend Executive MBA programme to anyone. I am now a Committee Member of the North West Alumni Committee.
