This film romanticized Stroud, glorified him, humanized him. The truth of the matter was Stroud was a psychopathic, cold-blooded murderer, a predatory sex criminal and a most unpleasant, churlish and disagreeable man. His contributions to aviary pathology were grossly exaggerated in this film: it turns out that most of Stroud's research was not valuable in that insufficient empirical controls were applied to his experiments. Stroud had virtually no knowledge of virology, which made his findings narrow and short-sighted, as viruses, not germs, as Stroud supposed, are the cause of most serious aviary maladies. I guess this film is diverting enough, but is a radical departure from actuality, a typical Hollywood sugarcoating of the truth, which ends up as a misleading little trifle about an insignificant little man.
