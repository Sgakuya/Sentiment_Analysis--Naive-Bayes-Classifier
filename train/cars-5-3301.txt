I own a 1988 Jeep Laredo with over 200,000 miles and she still runs strong and was quite impressed that she had pleanty of power to pull a party barge boat (pontoon) anyway, I recently upgraded to a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ltd, 5.2L V8, that also towed the same boat with no hesitation, all the bells and whistles that come with this vehicle are wonderful, everything works beautifully with the exception that my switch for my sunroof needs to be replaced. (your everyday wear and tear). I love my Jeep and would never own anything else. I am sorry for those who have managed to find the lemons, but please remember ALL manufacuters have lemons. I personally cannot wait to get my Jeep dirty! Good luck to those who are not having a good experience in finding a vehicle that they love as much as I love my Jeep!
