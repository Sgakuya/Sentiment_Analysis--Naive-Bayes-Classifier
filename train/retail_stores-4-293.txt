I own 4 or 5 bras from victoria's secret and ALL of my panties are from there as well. I have been shopping there for over 3 years and have learned that the simple things such as their 'Signature Cotton' collection looks (on the internet) like what you will recieve in the mail, although the more complex items such as; clothing, bustiers, corsets and their 'Glamour by Victoria' collection isn't always what it looks like on the models in the pictures of their catalog or on the internet. Moral of the story in store shopping is always best but when you can't go with simple materials/fabric and size charts. I must say though, I did go off on a limb and purchased the Very Sexy leaf lace push-up bra via internet and it is now my favorite bra.
