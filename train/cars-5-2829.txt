can u say sweet car ? the ford mustang is the best bang for your buck sports car. the mustang is the original pony car. all you chevy owners out there that think your chevy is better...well your wrong..u need to open your eyes and check out the 2003 mustang cobra. its the best mustang yet, and it beat the camero SS. so eat that. and dont give me that BS about how the mustang has a supercharger because the camero used to have 50ci over the mustang so its all good. and if the camero was so good then how come they stoped making it?!! yeah thought so. and even when they did make it the mustang outsold it by far. (i think it was 3 to 1 but im not sure)
