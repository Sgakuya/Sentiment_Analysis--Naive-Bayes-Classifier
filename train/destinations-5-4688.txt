I grew up in St. Louis and I still consider it home, even 5 years after moving away. Sure, it has its share of crime and pollution and traffic, but what big city doesn't? It's still a great place to live. The cost of living is one of the lowest in the country, there is a fair share of wonderful restaurants (don't miss The Hill for Italian cuisine!), museums, galleries, theaters and shopping. And it's awesome for out-of-towners, because there is SO MUCH TO DO! You need a day just to enjoy the Gateway Arch, Old Courthouse and Union Station downtown. Then you'd need several more days to enjoy Forest Park (with one of the best zoos and Science Centers in the country) Six Flags, the Botanical Gardens, and a sporting event- after all, St. Louis is one of the best sports cities in North America. I guarantee that if you just give St. Louis a chance, you will enjoy it immensely. It has an interesting blend of cultures, where East meets West and North meets South.
