 It is surprising that no public effort has yet been made in all these years to restore to the people of the city the seven miles of waterfront lying between the [Chicago] River and Hyde Park. This effort should now be made, and if the purpose carried out, it will add a new and beneficial element to individual lives in the city. ... A very high purpose will be served if the Lake shore be restored to the people and made beautiful for them. These were the words spoken by city daddy and visionary extraordinaire Daniel Burnham two years before his master plan for the City of Chicago became a reality. Chicago now boasts THIRTY miles of undeveloped lakefront green space for its citizens and visitors, and you can rest easy that it will never be less than thirty miles. You see, that's part of the Chicago Plan. And in the old days, when tycoons would still try to build the occassional building there, heroes like Montgomery Ward would step in and file suit to prevent it, thank God. Grant Park is a phenomenal place to spend an afternoon. Gorgeous views of both city and lake make it a photographer's paradise. There is always something happening at Grant Park, like free Chicago Symphony Orchestra concerts or free Movies in the Park , where old black and white classics are shown outdoors on a huge screen for your viewing pleasure, for free! Thank God for the city's early visionaries who made it so. What is known as Chicago's Front Yard is the pride of a city which has a lot to be proud of!
