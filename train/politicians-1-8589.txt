Lets all give thanks to the man who left us two wonderful legacies:AIDS and the crack-cocaine epidemic. AIDS began under Reagans watch, and it continues to rob the lives of people(including innocent children )all over the world. Reagan could have been a hero to humanity but instead he ignored AIDS. In his biggoted mind it only affected gays and drug addicts(some Christian, huh?). He never even mentioned the word AIDS until Rock Hudson, his priveledged friend died from it. No, Reagan didnt cause AIDS, his lack of compassion and moral,Christian leadership allowed it proliferate. Crack cocaine became a national epidemic under Reagan's watch. His failed response was three pronged: cut drug rehab programs implemented under Nixon, a Just Say No! program aimed at white,middle-class marajuana use, and of course the typical Republican response to all social ills- building more prisons. It failed!!! Crack availibility is worse than ever, making inner cities and many schools a national shame. His policies artificially inflated the price of drugs, making all Columbian drug lords very happy! Don't take my word for it, look up what conservative William F. Buckley has to say about Reagans failed drug policies. We criticise LBJ for his failed War on Poverty , the same needs to go for Reagan. Thus we can properly lay the blame for two national/international epidemics at the feet of Reagan. As these two problems get worse, history will point the finger at the man who was silent about AIDS,and who's drug policies made profits for his Facist friends in South America, but caused misery for American families. Lets not forget the time he consorted with known cocaine traffikers(the Contras), subverted congress, took on the powers of a King,LIED, and wipped his butt with the Constitution during Iran-Contra. Thanks Gipper, thanks for nothing
