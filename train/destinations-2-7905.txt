For God's sake, this place is more of a tourist trap than Disney World. Oh-so-expensive prices and lack of stuff to do make this a place to go only after you've been everywhere else in Chicago, or you have an out of town visitor who, to your dismay, announces that she would really like to see Navy Pier. (Hi, Sara!) The one thing in the vicinity of NP that's really neat is the Architecture Boat Tours that leave from Ogden Pier. They are a fascinating ride past some of Chicago's most recognized buildings, and also offer a great way to get close-up photos of said buildings. (Hi, Sara!) The merchants at Navy Pier's mall sell mostly crappy, kitschy stuff for 400 times cost. Parking is impossible at NP, but that's not the fault of the pier itself. Parking is impossible anywhere in downtown Chicago, but who cares, because we have a clean, efficient, easily understood rapid transit system that will get you there lickety-split. Did I mention parking is now 25 cents for five minutes in downtown Chicago? Yepper, $3 will get you a spot for one hour, then you better look out for Lovely Rita, cause Chicago, like every other city, is having a budget crisis right now, and we would sure appreciate you donating to the city's cause with a parking fine.
