Jodie Foster is a very talented actor with a unique acting style. I've really enjoyed most of her movies. I thought that she gave a wonderful performance in The Accused as the trailor trash girl who is raped in a bar. It seemed that she was SO into that role. In Silence of the Lambs , there again seemed to be a unique sense of work ethic there and I again felt that as in The Accused , Foster had actually become her character. So much so, that the sequel to that film, Hannibal , really didn't do much for me because Foster declined playing Clarice again. She also gave great performances in Sommersby , Anna and the King and Contact. Most recently, I also enjoyed Panic Room . In the final analysis, Jodie Foster is a wonderful actress with her own unique acting style who is dedicated to her work she chooses her roles carefully, and works hard to become those roles.
