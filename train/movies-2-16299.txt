I think that Gibson is so egocentric and hungry for attention that he chose the most opportunistic subject and manner of depiction possible: religion, Jesus, snuff movie-like violence,top-models (Belucci) as Biblical figures (JESUS! indeed). She was OK, but was it really necessary to cast such an en vogue sex-bomb in THIS movie?Filming was good,but what's the point?I never liked Gibson too much anyway, but after this, I hope I don't hear from him again.It is Ok to have an opinion about any subject,including Jesus,but the whole project seems commercial and forced. Leave the directing to other people, Mel, and maybe do another Mad Max movie? Maybe Mad Max fighting a severe hemoroid condition?
