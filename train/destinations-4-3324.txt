New Orleans is extreme in everything. The best music, parties, nightlife, and people (99%). Also the worst schools, crime, housing, sanitation, and people (1%, but watch out!). Beautiful parks (though badly maintained) architecture, museums. Mardi Gras is wonderful, but Jazz Fest is a lot of fun too, and there are fewer obnoxious tourists then as well. The French Quarter and Garden District are beautiful and one-of-a-kind, but don't expect the whole city to look great-most of it is boring Houston-style sunbelt or scary Detroit-style slum. Since the oil industry packed up and left for Houston in the 80s, the only major industry in New Orleans has been tourism and the universities. So don't come to New Orleans looking for work; there isn't any, except for badly paid service work during Mardis Gras. The city government is notoriously corrupt and callous (last Mardi Gras they kicked the homeless people out of the shelters to rent the beds to college students!). The very concept of 'public service' does not exist in New Orleans; everything is for sale. Anyone who can afford to sends their children to private school, hires private security and goes to private hospitals when they get sick. In other words, not a city you want to live in unless you have lots of $$$s and can afford a house in the Garden District or the French Quarter. But a great place to visit, for anyone, anytime.
