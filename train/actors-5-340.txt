I love Buster Keaton. He was not only an amazing comic, but an amazing director and actor too. I just finished his Autobiography My Wonderful world of Slaptstick and he's also a great guy. I don't think he's better than Charlie Chaplin but I think if he didn't lose control of his films so fast he could have been. I highly recomend Keaton to film goers because he shows entertainment at it's best. I suggest The General - a funny and moving picture and also Our Hospitality -a great slaptick side splitting film. With his pork pie hat and his great stone face I believe he can make anyone laugh, and if not atleast entertain you.
