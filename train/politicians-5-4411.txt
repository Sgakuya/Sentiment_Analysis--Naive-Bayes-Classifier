I find it hilarious and very telling that brainwashed blacks find other blacks that are successful, well-educated, responsible, ethical, followers of Christ so frightening. Why are so many intimidated by the idea of valuing a hard-work ethic? Only whites can be educated? Only whites can have strong family ties and ethical values? If a black achieves greatness it's because he or she must be a closet white? How dumb. Every time I hear the cry Uncle Tom and Oreo, I read insecurity, fear of success, peer pressure and a sheeple mentality. Condi Rice is to be commended for being a woman of principle, determination, inner personal strength and character. She thinks for herself - go ahead and call her playground names - doesn't challenge her character - puts yours into question . . .
