I cannot beleive so many people like Mass. I mean come on, to buy a decent house, it will run you $560,000 compared to around $300,000 in other states, the price of gas is the highest of any other state. The people are very rude and ignorant and not nice at all campared to some other states. The weather is absolutely horrible with snow and extreme cold temps. Also, the school systems suck. I know someone who school doesnt have gym or art or anything. There is nothing to do, BORING!!!!!!! Especially in the winter unless you go to the movies. WTF, there is no point of living here with these awful conditions. Other things that annoy me about Mass are the annoying accents, high unbeleivable taxes and food prices, and also the fact that it is overcrowded. The only thing I like is the Beaches and even those are short of amazing. This state is awful and I pity people who live there. Move out while you still can!!!!!
