Barry was one of the best, and having seen so many running backs over the decades, if you're one of the best that's saying something! Yeah, he had the most yards lost, but what other running back had the guts to take the risks that Barry took? Name one. He was a leader and very compassionate, too. One season he paid each of his offensive lineman $1,000 dollars for every 100 yards he got over either 1000 yards or 1500, not sure. Anyhow, this is a moot arguement. Barry should have been complimented during his career with a good quarterback, but never was. Drew Brees is better than the scuzzy QB's he had to support. Notice that every good runningback that wins a superbowl has a good quarterback. Always. How many playoff appearances did the lions even have? Go Barry!
