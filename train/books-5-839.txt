J. K Rowling's Book are totally amazing! Once you've started reading them, you can't put it down! It's like you want to finish the whole book, know who the bad guys are in one sitting! I personally DON'T THINK that the Harry Potter books promotes WITCHCRAFT like what other schools and teachers say. Yeah, HP is sort suited to the young people age bracket and that there's portrayal of death, spells, wizardry, witches, blood, you name it! But arent' these things presently and apparantly present in the world we live in? Right now, today? I believe the BEST WAY to teach our children to grow up properly to love them and guide them. What more could a child ask for if he/she is happy with his/her family? Guideness is the key, love is the key not banning things. Being strict and stuff like that.
