Man, I really don't get the anger and animosity that some of you people have toward Los Angeles. Well, I certainly don't claim L.A. is paradise, it is certainly not what most of you claim it is. I think those of you that seem so angry are full of crap. I have lived here for fifty years, and for the most part the people that live in L.A. and Southern California in general are just regular people, just like you would find anywhere else. As for rude or superficial or flakey or whatever, yea, I would imagine that we have people like that just like any other city, but we are not unique in that. I think maybe you left with bitter feelings because, and I'm just guessing, maybe you couldn't keep up, and maybe your feelings were hurt, I don't know. If it makes you feel better to downgrade a whole population, well, than I suppose there is nothing I can do to change your mind. Also don't confuse Hollywood with the real Los Angeles, most of these creeps come from your part of the country and believe me, you can have them back, really. Also, and maybe it's just a coincidence, but since all of you left, the air smells much better and California has been doing quite well. Coincidence? I don't think so.
