The Stanford campus is such a magnificent campus with rolling grasslands...looks more like a HUGE campground than an university. The buildings are nice with a Spanish-like architect touch. I have studied here for a summer just to see my GF since she's a smart-a$$ student who has studied at this institute. The students there are also very friendly...and although Stanford is known to be more conservative...I think there were a lot of open-minded students I've encountered. There were also snobby students I've met...however....they never mind talking to me in the dining hall. I am quite shocked and disappointed though, that there were some racist prick who sprayed racial slurs on some of the buildings on campus I think two-three years ago. I was going to go to stanford for a graduate program in liberal arts...but I've decided to change my career to medicine..and am taking courses at a small 4-year university.
