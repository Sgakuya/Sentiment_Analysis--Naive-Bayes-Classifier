Essentially faceless and bland, not a far right ideologue.His reign was kinda blah... I bartended his gubernatorial party when he was elected. Let me tell you one truism. If you bartend a working class family's party for a wedding, or another event at which everyday people are having some sort of celebration, expect good tips. At this event, which was attended primarily by influential movers and shakers in the Republican Party, both national and local, young bluebloods of prominence,Tucker Carlson types, etc the tips were really, really cheap! No idea how the Democrats and other parties tip, but it couldn't be any stingier than the G.O.P! P.S. I think Tucker Carlson calls up Farrakhan each morning to make sure they're both wearing the same outfit! ring...ring.."Hi, Louis.. so what are you wearing today?"
