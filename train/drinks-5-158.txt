In my earliest days here on Rate It All, I wondered why this Duvel was so highly rated. So I set out to find it. Unfortunately, I have found only two establishments here in Kansas City that serve it, and not a single store that sells it in any form - if anyone in the KC area knows where I could get some of this for private consumption, please, indulge me. I was blown away by this Belgian masterpiece. For the longest time, I was a fan of Americanized Belgian-style white ales like Blue Moon and its authentic Belgian counterpart, Hoegaarden, so I fell in love immediately. However, I do still have some questions. I see a lot of reviewers referencing an alcohol content of 10%, yet every bottle of Duvel I've had was marked 8.5%. Am I to assume that there are multiple variations on the Duvel theme? Either way, this stuff is bottled gold. At $5+ for an 11.2-ounce bottle, one tends to think that that's getting a bit pricey. But crack open a bottle and you'll soon understand where the extra money is going. And at 8.5% ABV, $5 a bottle comes out to roughly 2.6 beers for just a hair above the price of one - with superior quality to boot! Call it fuzzy math, but I think it's safe to say that alot of things get blurry when you've got three or four of these things in your gut.
