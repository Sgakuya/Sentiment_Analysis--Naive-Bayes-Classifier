People who buy the line that Al Gore is a liar and a person of poor character vs George Bush is truthful and has good character are naive and gullible to the max. Politicians are politicians, and it doesn't really matter who the candidates are. The only important thing is which political philosophy one believes. I'm confident that Al Gore will uphold the philosophy and values of the Democratic Party, which advocates for ALL people-- of any race, religion, nationality, poor, wealthy, physically or mentally impaired, outside the generally acceptable sexual orientation, infants, elderly and all ages between, the rights of individuals and families to make personal decisions about their lives without governmental interference, the environment. It's also called stewardship, which I understand is a Christian value. Kind of reminds me of Jesus.
