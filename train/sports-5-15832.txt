Warren Sapp is by far the best defensive tackle in the game. With him drawing all the double teams, and still getting sacks and tackles, it frees up the rest of the D-line to do their magic. Throw in a stout secondary, and you have Sapp as the leader of one of the best defensive lines in history. He could get mad about the double teams, but he knows that it helps his team. That is the mark of a team player. As for his sportsmanship, Warren likes to talk like so many players today do. If it had been a player that confronted Sapp at the end of the Green Bay game, would we have had so much controversy on the verbal altercation?
