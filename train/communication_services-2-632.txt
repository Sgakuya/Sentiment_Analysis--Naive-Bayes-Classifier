Effective 1 Dec I will drop Cingular and never look back. I was satisfied with AT&T, but when Cingular took over the problems started. One example was when I asked a simple technical question I was referred to three different people, naturally it took about 7-10 minutes on hold each transfer, and the third person I spoke with referred me back to the original customer service number. After the second referral I asked to file a complaint and was laughed at! The girl I spoke with even admitted that Cingular customer service had a lot to be desired. I’ve had calls dropped within two miles of my home and the actual coverage I have when I’m on the road is less than was described on their “footprint.” My $29.99 monthly service is costing me over $38, yet I never go over my minutes. I have written emails and good old-fashioned letters to their corporate offices and have been completely ignored. You can’t have good customer service when you don’t respond to your customers. Since cell phones are a convenience and not a requirement for me, I’m going pre-paid. I didn’t ask for Cingular and was not afforded the option of dropping them when they took over AT&T, but now that my contract is expiring – SEE YA! And from what I’ve seen on theses reviews, the vast majority of people are also dissatisfied. If Cincular is paying attention, your service sucks rice through a straw. Hey, what do you know… I do feel better…
