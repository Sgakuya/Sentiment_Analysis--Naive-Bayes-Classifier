Suprisingly, a very nice state. Of course like any state, there are some little podunk towns that you wouldnt want to be caught dead in, but must of rural PA is really nice, with charming little towns. I think i would rather live in Rural PA or in one of the smaller cities like Erie or Allentown than in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, but those are both cool cities too. One thing that I have to question about the ENTIRE state of PA though; who designed their houses? Pennsylvania has some of the UGLIEST and wierdest houses I have ever seen. EVERYWHERE, in both the City proper of Philadelphia and of Pittsburgh, their suburbs, all of the small towns, all of the houses in rural areas. They have some of the ugliest houses I have ever seen. What gives?
