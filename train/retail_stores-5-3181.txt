I signed up for Netflix last night, and the process couldn't have been easier. You select three DVDs at a time for a flat fee of $19.95 per month, and the DVDs are sent to you in the mail. After you finish one, you send it back, and Netflix automatically sends you the next DVD on your list (which you create online). The selection was terrific, and I was pleased to see TV shows available, too. I find it very difficult to get to the video store with a two-year-old in tow, so this is a great option. Plus, there's no penalty if you watch 10 minutes of a movie and hate it- just send it back and get another one. Netflix offers a free two-week trial, so you can check out the service with no obligation. There are no late fees either. I'm curious to see how quickly the movies come in the mail and whether or not movies are generally available. But so far, so good!
