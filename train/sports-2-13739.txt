Although he shows great promise following his successful term as the Defensive Coordinator for the Ravens, he is still unproven. To give you an example, Chiefs Defensive Coordinator Gunther Cunningham helped to led one of the most consistently successful defenses in the 90s, but failed as a head coach before eventually returning to the Chiefs as D-Coordinator. Nolan has alot of the tools needed, but probably won't have the players he wants to make an immediate impact. Since he's unproven and doesn't have the player talent needed to succeed, I can't rate him higher than a 2 for right now. The future may change that, though.
