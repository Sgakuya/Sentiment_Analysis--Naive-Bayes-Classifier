has anyone noticed that basically every one of the people dissin' J.J. on this site are for NC?...well newsflash...look at duke this year... they are #1 and are undefeated...look at NC, they arent even rated ... J.J has recently made his 4ooth three-pointer and is only 13 away from bein the best shooter ever. he was national player of the year last year. so yea...HE WAS BETTER THAN MCCANTS...he will be national player of the year after he finishes this season also. oh...and he has a bad attitude?..i admit that he will get in someones face, BUT ONLY if they do it first. so damn, i really dont get how you all can diss him like that?
