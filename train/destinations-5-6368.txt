Oh give me a break, Daveo. If you haven't found a decent eatery it's beause you haven't looked. Regas, Chesapeake's, The Copper Cellar, Club LeConte are all fine upsacle places. Something more casual? Try Calhouns on the River or head west to Grady's...just to name a few. If you think Tennessee has the corner on redneck uneduated and overweight smokers who breathe bad air...head to LA. And besides, it sounds like your basing your entire opinion of this state on Knoxville itself...which is a very shortsided and narrowminded thing to do. Regardless of your opinion of the educational status, it rates much higher than what you give it credit for. And while we're at it, you must be an Eintein yourself to dish out such strong opinions regarding the intelligence quotient here..but then again, if that were the case, you would have done your homework and figured out our flaws before moving here. And no, The Smokey's are not the Rockies...but they have their own beauty...it's just different. And a broadminded thinker like yourself will certainly appreciate that, now won't you. A sidenote about the Tennessee Vols? To echo your thoughts in not understanding a place...you can't appreciate the spirit because you don't understand it.
