Went to Salt Lake last summer- first off, the mountain backdrop adjacent to the city is beautiful, with no haze or smog to obsure the view. However, many of the city's attractions are religious based...if you're offended by the mormon religion, I would suggest not visiting this city. The downtown is clean but antiseptic, and seemed to be dead at any time of day during the weekend. I found the nightlife to be severly lacking here, and the liquor laws are definitely a headache. My friends and I were walking around downtown at 10pm during Fourth of July and the only thing that was going on were the cars (all filled to the brim with people) driving by gawking at us. Maybe its illegal to walk around in Salt Lake after sundown. Maybe they think its funny to see stupid tourists attempting to find nightlife in a city that dosen't really have one. One thing I found interesting is that the 'perky mormon' stereotype didn't apply here, it appeared like everyone had a permanent frown on their face. In general, I didn't find the people here friendly. The Great Salt Lake to the west of the city is disgusting, unless you love the smell of brine shrimp and flies I suggest not going. Park City to the east is beautiful, charming little city with lots of people walking around (apparently unique in Utah)...kinda wished I stayed there instead of Salt Lake when I was on that trip. Salt Lake City does have a beautiful, recently completed highway system. However, People here drive just as aggressively as they do in LA. Not coming back to this place anytime soon.
