I learned to do web pages in 1995 - back when it was write your own html and these editing tools were either in their infancy or nonexistent. One day at work I was handed a box and told I needed to learn PageMill, which is why it became the first of these I ever used. Since I more or less taught myself how to use it I have retained a kind of fondness for it - well, maybe comfort level would be more accurate. Since then, I've seen several other editors that seem to have more to offer. This may be partly due to the fact that they are much newer than the version of PageMill I currently use. It may just be me, but it really seemed that the powers that be at Adobe kind of gave up improving on PageMill even before they decided to discontinue it. The good thing is that once you learn what one editor is supposed to do, you can translate that knowledge to another program fairly easily.
