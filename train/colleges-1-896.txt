The Devry I attended was the location in North Brunswick, NJ. Here are the facts: * Each year is divided into trimesters. * Each trimester will cost you about $5500 directly; $3000 with Financial Aid. - Books per semester are about $500 for the first semester - Followed by about $300 every semester for new books. * Devry has a strict absence policy. When the number of absences are exceeded, you are suspended without refund. - To enforce this policy Devry has a timecard system where every student must swipe into class. If your card doesn't work (or you've forgotten it) you must go to the admissions office and submit a form as a voucher with the instructor's signature. A real pain when you forget or your professor leaves early. * Devry has well equiped labs for projects, however, it is not uncommon for 2 or 3 students to share one PC/Lab space due to lack of available resources. The PC labs and project labs are 2 seperate labs. ---------------------------------- Personal Gripes about Devry: * For basic coarses (Algebra/Calc, English, etc.) the average instructor gets payed about $11,000 per year. If you plan to go to Devry, please complete your basics somewhere else, you'll save thousands. * Submitting and requesting transcripts (as well as most offical forms) from the North Brunswick location is very inefficiant. - Unlike other educational institutes, Devry does not print out, seal, and issue transcripts the same instance you request them. Rather, they insist on taking a $5 deposit via the registrar's office and telling you your transcript will arrive in 5 to 10 business days. From personal experience, I've been waiting 24 days and still haven't received my transcript. So glad I'm leaving. * In 2001 Devry cut 5% of the top paid teachers to reduce revenue costs. However, student admissions did not drop. (Devry is a business, not a school, the #1 goal is to make revanue) * Dean offices are not to responsive with student input.
