Kansas City is a great place to live, but not a good place to visit. On that note, my heart goes out to Kolby1973 - the load placed upon your primitive cerebrum as you found yourself trying to make sense of two adjacent cities of the same name must have been of biblical proportions. And yeah, we've got bums, and I must say, it really is a downer to know that I live in the only city in the UNIVERSE that has this problem. I wish someone would do something about that... Anyway, the cost of living here is among the lowest in the country, the people (again, Kolby1973 is patently wrong) are on average friendlier than those found in other parts of the nation (particularly the coasts), its central location makes it an excellent place to base a business or other such venture, and it is the proud home of the best barbecue in the world (exeunt Texans).
