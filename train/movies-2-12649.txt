CAUTION: This movie is really, REALLY tedious and slow-going at first. Like bang-your-head-on-the-seats-in-front-of-you tedious. But, to look on the bright side, it gets interesting somewhere in the middle. Honest. Anyway, synopsis: A man from the first Gulf War comes home after being capped in the head, with little memory. He can't remember the events fully that lead up to his arrest and imprisonment into a mental facility, but he's quite aware that they're locking him up in a straight jacket at night and keeping him in one of those lockers that they have at the morgue. There, he suffers from some severe and trippy hallucinations . . . or are they memories? Or something more? Somewhere in there, there's time travel, a gratuitious sex scene, and something that sort of resembles a plot. The whole thing, until about the middle, seems to be a jumbled, discombobulated mess of images flashed on the screen, which gets really annoying, really fast; if I were to rate it just based on the first half, it'd be a 1; the last half would be a 3, so I just averaged it to a 2 altogether.
