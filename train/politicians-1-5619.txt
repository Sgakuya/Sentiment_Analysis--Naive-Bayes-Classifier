Hillary is smart but amoral. She was a right-wing Goldwater girl until she realized that she could get further ahead by switching parties and getting votes from the rising voting bloc--the unfortunate and oppressed. She tries to keep them that way so that she can play up their victimization to get votes. She cares about minorities only for political purposes. She openly mocked Bush, rolling her eyes, when he gave his important speech right after 911 (she thereby mocked the memories of the 3000 who died). Shameful! And her husband had many opportunities to get rid of Osama (the Sudanese goverment even offered him up to Clinton twice), but Bill was too occupied with Monica. After all the philandering of her husband, Hillary accepts it (setting women's rights back a few decades) in exchange for a Senate seat (Bill, I won't cause a stir or divorce you if you help me win the New York Senate seat). She has no morals (Travelgate, making hundreds of thousands in a few days from the futures markets in a suspicious trade, Whitewater, the suspicious death of Vince Foster, etc.) But in her defense, Hillary is a good-looking woman, very pretty.
