Long ago, in the land of Middle Earth, home to Elves, Dwarves, Men, Wizards, and Hobbits, the Elven Smith Celebrimbor forged the Great Rings of Power. 3 for the Elven kings, 7 for the Dwarf lords, and 9 for mortal men. And then, Sauron, the Dark Lord, servant of old of the original Dark Lord-Melkor, had risen in power as great if not greater, and more terrible then Melkor's. He became jealous of Celebrimbor's rings, and because of his jealousy, he forged the Great Ring, the One Ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them. But the ring was lost to him, and by some strange force, the ring made its way to Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit. Bilbo passed the ring to his nephew, Frodo. Yet, all was not well, Sauron was searching for his ring, and Frodo was in grave danger, he journeyed far and wide, with 8 companions- Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Gandalf the Wizard, Boromir, and Aragorn, both men, and Frodo's Hobbit friends-Samwise, Meriadoc, and Peregrin, into Saurons Evil Realm itself to the only place the ring could be destroyed- Mount Doom, or Oroduin in the Elvish tongue to end the Realm of Sauron, forever. This masterpiece is fantasy in its greatest form and highest order. If you havent read The Lord of the rings, you couldnt call yourself a book lover, this is the best trilogy.
