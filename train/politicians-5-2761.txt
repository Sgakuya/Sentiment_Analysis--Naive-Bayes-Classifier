I really don't see why liberals continue to assail J.C. Watts as an 'Uncle Tom' or an 'Oreo'. What is so wrong about wanting to be judged by your merits and less by the color of your skin? If anything, he should be credited (and possibly acclaimed) for dismissing all stereotypes and doing what he feels is right or correct. As for being a candidate for President someday, who would not want this Sooner to be in the Oval Office? He is, in short, a role model for all minorities who believe in themselves. By the way, most people would rather have a leader who leads by what he feels is right (like Harry S Truman), rather than have a leader who is expected to tow the party line or follow a specific political philosophy and stereotype. Finally, to blueblitzkrieg who says, Fortuna[tely] all smart minority politicians are Democrats: does this mean that if a minority person happens to be a Republican, he/she is stupid? Are all minorities supposed to be Democrats? And if they happen to be Republicans, they are 'token minorites'? Though you have every right to say what you think and feel, what you said is utterly irresponsible and totally shameful. Moreover, it is insulting.
