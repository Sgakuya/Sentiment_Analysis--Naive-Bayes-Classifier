I've owned this game since 1998 and have played more hours of this game than all other computer games combined -BY FAR! Links LS was (and its sequels still are) the benchmark in PC golfing. The graphics are literally photorealistic (no other PC game -even as of 2003- has had photorealistic graphics) the ball in-flight and ball-surface physics are superb, and there are so many options that it's incredible. Even as of 2003, I STILL own LS 99 and have not found its equal (except for Links 2000 -its sequel). The Tiger Woods PGA Championship editions 2002 and 2003 come 'kind of' close, but definitely no cigar. Tiger Woods graphics engine compromise photorealism to look much more 'alive' than LS and more 3D (trees swaying, water ripples, etc.). But the physics aren't nearly as excellent as LS's. If 'realism' is what you look for in a golf game, Links LS 99 or 2000 is your 'cup of tea' but if you want something that looks more 'alive' and don't care as much for ultimate realism, go for Tiger Woods PGA Championship.
