So I never really bought anything at J. Crew because their clothes always seemed overpriced, plain, and a tad ugly. On top of that, their financial department works with my dad's company, and he claims they're terrible to deal with, always jerks, or trying to rip someone off. But...one sad day, I was bored and stuck at a lousy shopping complex with nothing better to do than look at J. Crew. Probably out of that boredom, I bought a skirt and some flip-flops. The flip-flops: I have many pairs of this type of shoe and like to believe I'm an expert in wearing them. This particular pair, however, always somehow seems to bend down on the front end causing my toes to scrape the concrete that I'm typically walking over. The skirt: I'm having to bust @ss to make to all my classes on time today, all the while pulling down the back of the skirt that was somehow not made right and has the tendency to bunch up and show my @ss to everyone. So thank-you J. Crew for letting me look like I'm digging every minute while hauling @ss across campus. I've learned my lesson.
