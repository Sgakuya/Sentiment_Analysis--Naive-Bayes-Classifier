 I have yet to see this man play more than one character. Each one seems to be played the same way. Sad and mad. He was out shined considerably by his co star Joaquin Phoenix, who was breath taking as the evil Ceasar. While Russel played once again the sad mad guy that he played in L.A. Confidential, Proof of Life, and The Insider. Russel is good at what he does even though I could do what he does and for much,much cheaper. He might be good looking but that does not constitute a great actor. I'd rather watch a great underrated actors movie like Joaquin Phoenix or Jared Leto than this guy. Please Russel, if you know this guy, tell him to find a new role! I am losing interest!
