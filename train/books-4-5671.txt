I have no doubt that this book was a lot more shocking when it came out in the 80's than it is now. That being said, Brett Easton Ellis is able to paint a chilling picture of the hollow lives of Los Angeles' young, drug-addicted elite - even when it is considered from today's numbed perspective. This book will leave you feeling empty and shallow - there is no resolution, development, no triumph, no dramatic failure... just a constant numbing sense that these people are lost, with no idea of how to find themselves. The descriptions of the lead character struggling unsuccessfully to feel empathy for the plights of his friends are especially haunting. Don't read this if you are looking for an entertaining novel, or if you have no sympathy for the self-induced problems of the rich. Do read this if you are in the mood for slighly less well-written, significantly more freaked out version of Catcher in the Rye.
