My boyhood idol and hands down the greatest all-around catcher in history. Might kill someone hitting this present day juiced up ball. I have heard numerous interviews with former ball players who saw all the great ones say Bench was hands down the best of all time. No one, not Piazza, Pudge, Yogi, Capanella, Dickey, or Fisk, caught a better all around game than Bench. All around, head and shoulders above the rest! Like Sparky Anderson said, don't embarrass someone by trying to compare them with Johnny Bench! . Look at the facts: 14 time all star. 2 time MVP. Rookie of the year. 10 consecutive Gold Glove Awards. Two World Series Rings. First Ballot Hall of Famer. Over 2000 career hits. Over 1300 career RBI. 389 career home runs. Caught 100 or more games 13 consecutive years. Voted greatest catcher in history by the Sporting News, 1998. Starting catcher on the All-Century team. That pretty much speaks for itself, don't ya think?
