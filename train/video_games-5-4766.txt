I first tried this game because of it's high praise. And it is a PHENOMENAL game. Most Star Wars games are mainly lightsaber and shooting action with little plot. But this changed it all. It has a story line filled with twists and turns at every corner. Throughout the game, your decisions impact on whether you serve the light or dark side. All the characters within the story develop and you uncover a history of your character that you never thought possible. And when you play it for the first time, it truly is a shocker. And the best part is that it has the action of the regular Star Wars plus the great plot. And sometimes it's so free (meaning you can do what you want) it's almost like GTA. And some of the dialouge is so funny and interesting that I had my parent listening to it (but not playing it). I haven't met someone who has played the game and turned it away and I'll have to look far and wide to find someone who will. This is a very original and excellent game. I highly recommend playing it because it is so AWESOME!!!
