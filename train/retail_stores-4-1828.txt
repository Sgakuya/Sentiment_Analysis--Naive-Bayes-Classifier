This store really isn't that bad. Most of the time, the prices are bargains (yep, this is one of those cheap stores people love to hate), and the Super Wal-mart has just about everything I'm looking for. Granted, there are problems, such as employees stocking shelves in the middle of the aisle when there are customers trying to get through those aisles trying to shop, but even that happens very seldom. About a year ago, I would have given Wal-Mart only two stars. There were always employees in the way, and, for the most part, they were rude to the customers (however, the door greeters have always been pleasant). Now that I have a Super Wal-Mart in my area, the store has improved tremendously, with helpful, friendly, cooperative employees and a clean shopping atmosphere. You can't get much better.
