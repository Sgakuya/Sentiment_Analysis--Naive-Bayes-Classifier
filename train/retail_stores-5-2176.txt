Prob the largest selection of home audio/video and computer products I have laid eyes on. Does have a warehouse feel to it with how product is laid out. Great helpers scattered all around makes it a technician's dream, not to mention the competitive pricing. Even can keep up with website prices on a lot of stuff. UPDATE: if you want to review specific items that Fry's sells, do so on the appropriate item listings, or make your own weblist of them. Do not blame the retailer for a manufacturer's real or perceived deficiencies. I would rather see your rating of the return policies and procedures, in this case. Speaking of returns, I had my first failure of an AMD processor that I purchased with a friend at Fry's, one the unlucky few to have a DOA. I took the processor back the next day, and they were happy nont only to swap out the processor, but the mainboard that I purchased as well. (was a combo set) They understood my concerns about a DOA processor damaging the mainboard and were quite helpful. Yet another reason I give Fry's a coveted 5-star rating.
