GREATEST and Strongest ARM of all time....Most durable of all time...If he played for the 49ers they would have gone to the superbowl every year..Only pro bowler on all those 80's broncos teams to go to superbowl(3 to be exact). Was a one man team until shanahan became coach. Winningest QB off all time.... No way montana would have been so good without the 49ers..Guess what? Elway was...Look at montana with the chiefs lol....Even Brett Favre Says I Quote Elway was the player I watched growing up and patterned my game around him, in my opinion he is the best quaterback of all time ...Enough said ...just give this man the credit he deserves
