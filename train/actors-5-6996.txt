i think that Wes is an amazing actor (not to metion a very sexy guy).In American Beauty Wes had an amazing part as ricky fitts,to me he was inspiring. Wes is an all around interesting man and i wish i had the chance to meet such a wonderful person and actor. After reading interviews with him i learn that he is much like his character as ricky fitts in American Beauty and thats what makes him such a great actor. the first time i saw him act was in American Beauty, i rented the movie and watched it over and over (until it had to be returned) just to see Wes.i plan to buy the movie now. I think that he is a very promising actor and a gorgeous man. I love his big blue eyes. they're the kind of eyes that you just want to stare into forever. i wish there were guys like Wes! I hope we see more of you in the near future and I hope you always stays the same! *i love you Wes!* -*amanda* xoxoxo
