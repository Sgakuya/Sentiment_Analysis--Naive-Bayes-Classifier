I don't know what all the hype is about over Krispy Kreme Donuts..It's NOT a big deal people...They are JUST donuts! I've been to a Krispy Kreme before...and I just wish I would have went to Dunkin Donuts instead. Every post here talks about there donuts being so fresh...so is Dunkin Donuts. It's called walking into any donut shop or bakery when they just finished banking and your going to get a fresh product. I've gone to Krispy Kreme and gotten stale donuts that had been on the shelf all day. When it comes to freshness of a donut, Krispy Kreme is no different then anywheres else...And if you think it is its just because the customer service around where you live prolly just sucks. And if thats the case..that does not say too much about the people where you live if you cant even get customer service and fresh food.
