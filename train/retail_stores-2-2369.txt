I couldn't believe that after waiting in a long line and getting ready to pay 167.82 with my bank card, I was told they didn't take bank cards, when I ask what the thing was for on the counter, I was told it was for food stamps and cash back on welfare cards. that I would have to go to an atm mech. across the store So when I left they added my grandsons food up and he also had a bamk card, so he also had to go to atm. This left a very long line of mad people. Why do they cater to welfare and not the working people. The working people are the ones who pay the taxes, so the poor can have something. why should I work all day then have to be inconvenient by a lack of service. ALL PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME. It was an inconvenient not only to me but everyone who had to stand in that long line while we went to a ATM. This is the only store chain that I know who has welfare only atms or whatever they want to call it.
