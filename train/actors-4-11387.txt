Ashley Judd is a very talented actress who hopefully soon will find herself starring in more leading roles. She's perfectly capable of leading a film. I've never been disappointed with any of her performances. Her performance as Marilyn Monroe's alter-ego in Norma Jean and Marilyn was an interesting performance to say the least, even if it was a bit whacky. She also gave good performances in her supportive roles in Where the Heart Is and Simon Burch . I also thought she did a wonderful job co-starring with Tommy Lee Jones in Double Jeopardy . That film proves that she is capable of embracing a leading role. Ashley Judd has the looks, the brains and the talent to make a big name for herself in Hollywood. She's EXTREMELY beautiful (don't let the picture on this page fool you).
