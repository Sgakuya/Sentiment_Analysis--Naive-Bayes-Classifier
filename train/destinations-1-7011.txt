The worst capital in Western Europe. Dirty, overpriced, hectic, rude people, too big but still cramped. I live in the UK and am at a loss to figure out why most tourists stay in London and rarely venture out except on day trips to see the usual cliches e.g Bath, Stratford etc. It's a stinking cesspit. Scarlet Feather - if you come to London it's best that you're aware of the sordid reality rather than be sorley disappointed. There are some nice areas like Richmond Park and Hampstead. But for each of these there are dozens of run down, crime infested hovels caked in litter and pollution such as Harlesden, Hackney, Tottenham, Stockwell, Brixton etc etc. Also i suggest you avoid tourist hotspots like Bath, Cambridge and Stratford on Avon. They're always heaving. Try less tourist heavy places like Shropshire, the Peak District, the Brecon Beacons and North Yorkshire.
