I am going to buy one and I love it!! great room, handles good and for the person advising about off roading IT WASN'T MEANT FOR THAT SO THAT IS IGNORANT.... for those that are commenting on fuel economy if you are looking for a car that doesn't use a lot of gas buy a compact or economy car don't buy and SUV and then complain that is your own problem. These vehicles have had vertually no problems. They do remind me of an aztek but the inside makes up for the outside and they are not that ugly. Buick has always had a higher standard so that is what people expect. Don't knock it based on complains from consumers some people exagerate drive it yourself ask the dealer to let you take it for a few days i did and I am going to buy it. I have had it since two days ago and till tomorrow then I may purchase it right on the spot.
