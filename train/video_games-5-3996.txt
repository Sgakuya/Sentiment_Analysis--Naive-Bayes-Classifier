I know this is the best game ever you Zelda or ff7 fans are gonna be amazed it is the best game that soft ever made ask them yourself. It is impossible to say it is boring unless you did not beat the game if you're just bad at it play an easier game like Zelda this game is for THE BEST! Graphics, battles, sound, music, character, story, gameplay is all GOOD AND STORY. Basically i'm saying try it out just play at least the whole first disk then you'll see the fist disk is the most boring but try the other 3 disk then you'll understand the meaning of rpg game. If you think this is boring then every other game must really suck.
