I've grown to respect McCain more as time passes on. He seems to take a thoughtful approach to the issues, and not just in a superficial way as well. He's also a very effective senator who has increased significantly in stature over the past few years, especially as a advocate of fiscal restraint in a government body which many times seems to forget the meaning of the concept. Despite his age, I think that he still remains the strongest Presidential candidate that Republicans can put up against the Democrats. If he doesn't step on any toes like he did in 2000, the GOP nomination could be his in '08. I don't agree with some of his stances, like campaign finance reform, but overall, I like his approach to the issues.
