I thought the sharpie pen thing last year was funny, by T.O., but this year I have seen what this man truly is. A punk in a man's body. He has so much talent, but is so damn selfish and he has brought this team down with him. Garcia has never been more than above-average, but he was in the right system for him and it worked. He is more courage and willpower than talent, but he makes the right throws when he has to, although he seriously lacks on the deep ball. His feet get him out of trouble, but he's gotten banged up this year. The defense is not that good at all. They've been torched by some big plays this year, and I expect them to finish around 6-10. Niners fans, don't get excited by the spanking of the Rams last week, it was more the Rams playing badly than the 49ers playing well.
