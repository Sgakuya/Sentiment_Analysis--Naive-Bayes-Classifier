I made a couple of trips to The Netherlands in the 1970's. Nice countryside, nice people (almost everyone I met spoke American English, including small schoolchildren), and people were pretty friendly for the most part. I'm sort of a sights and food person; sights were OK, but pretty much imited to canals, tulips, and windmills. Food was pretty good (the breakfasts were really great). Traffic was OK (better than Germany or Italy at the time - the police were driving Porsches at the time!). All in all, I'm glad I visited Holland and Amsterdam, but I think that there are other destinations in Europe that are more worthwhile.
