This is sort of a difficult band to discuss. While I'll maintain that they're one of my all time favorite bands, I also must say that they have steadily declined in quality with each album. 16 Stone, in my opinion, is fantastic, and Razorblade Suitcase is really good. Then after years of not doing much of anything The Science of Things came out and it's not that bad; a few pretty good songs, and a few useless ones. And their latest effort, Golden State, is just plain mediocre at best. I don't know if they just burned out early or if they're just no longer capable of utilizing their full potential or what, but they've really dropped. With that said, I still won't hesitate to pop in 16 Stone or Razorblade whenever I'm in the mood for some raw, creative music.
