From a starring role as a child actor in Empire of the Sun to an impressive leap to adult professional in American Psycho , Bale has proven he has lasting power. The conviction he puts into his work (whether in large roles or in character parts) does not set him apart from the rest of the cast, instead his performance is blended into the film. I don't see that as such a bad thing. It is the roles where we forget the actor is acting that deserve to be recognized. Bale doesn't need to be in the limelight to shine as is evident in the likes of Velvet Goldmine and even Little Women . True, he's no DeNiro or Hopkins, but he's also not as experienced as them either. I do believe he has quite a ways to go, but I'm giving him five stars, because his potential is outstanding, and based on the range of roles he's played in the past (He went from playing Jesus to playing a young man who was mildly retarded to a psychopath all within the space of two years), he has a VERY impressive resume. I, personally, can't wait to see what he does next.
