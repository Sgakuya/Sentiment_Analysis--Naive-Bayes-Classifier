Wow- can't believe the nerve a discussion about Halle Berry strikes. Just goes to show you how far America has to come about the black/white race issue. According to the accepted notions of this society H.B. is indeed Black cause she's got a black parent. What a dis to her white mom and a misrepresentation. If a child springs from the womb of a white woman- it's white (at least somehow!). Of course, she is black too- her father contributed 50% of her genes. The society deals with her as a black woman- or more recently maybe as a biracial woman, which in itself is a falsehood since black americans (her father) are super mixed people to begin with. Most of us (black americans) have at least 20% Euro- genes + an undetermined amount of native american and if you come from the caribbean you're likely to have East Indian, Chinese and possibly Middle Eastern genes to boot. In any case, I give Halle a lot of credit for standing with us (black people). She doesn't necessarily have to. She could go on and on about being biracial and not particuarly feel any allegiance to the black community such as a certain Golfer who shall remain unnamed. (You all know who I'm talkin' about!) I admit that I never thought very much of her. She looks like a girl next door- sort of non-descript and her acting isn't that remarkable. After seeing Monster's Ball I revised my opinion of her acting. She, along with all other Hollywood actresses black, white and other are constantly underchallenged in lame Hollywood flics that require little to no acting ability because the scripts are so stripped down.
