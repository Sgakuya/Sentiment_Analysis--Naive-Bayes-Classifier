Johns Hopkins is truly a world-class university. 15% of the current freshman class is comprised of international students, and the percentage of foreign graduate students is even higher. Hopkins' schools in Italy, Germany, China, Singapore and the School for Advanced International Studies in DC, seem to foster its international reputation. Though Hopkins is a major research university with impressive resourses, its undergraduate population is fairly small (about 725 freshman enrolled in Arts Sciences/280 in Engineering) which means students receive a lot of individual attention, especially in the humanities. JHU is unique in many ways. Hopkins is nationally ranked as one of the top 2 universities for creative writing (Writing Seminars department). Hopkins is tops in biomedical engineering and the School of Hygiene and Public Health is the best. Johns Hopkins is one of the leading universities for Genetics, 19th 20th Century American Literature, Neuroscience, U.S. Colonial History, German Romance Languages, Earth Science, European Art History, Near Eastern Studies and Political Theory. Hopkins students have the opportunity to study music (and receive credit) at JHU's prestigious Peabody Consevatory of Music, located in downtown Baltimore, a short shuttle ride from the university campus. Johns Hopkins students and faculty are extremely gifted and ambitious. 83% of JHU graduates receive an advanced degree within 10 years of graduation. This is the highest percentage in the nation. Famous Johns Hopkins alumni include former US President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Woodrow Wilson, former Secretary of State Madeline Albright and the self-made billionare, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.
