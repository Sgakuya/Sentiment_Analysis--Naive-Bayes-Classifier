Inferior insurance company in paying claims. I rate them as low as I would Mercury. They do not call within 24 hours after filing claim. I got hit by an uninsured motorist. I have legitimate information and witness. State Farm failed in reaching this uninsured motorist who hit us. Therefore, their position is that it is NOT an uninsured motorist. Aka, insiniuating that we are lieing. My position is that my husband is injured and State Farm does not want to have to pay for his damages. Under Uninsured, they would have to. They certainly didn't mind paying for fixing the car. Also lied on their paperwork. I have obtained an attorney. Unfortunate when insurance companies play these games. Off to purchase insurance from a Superior rated company.
