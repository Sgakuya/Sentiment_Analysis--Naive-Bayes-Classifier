To all you folks who think the pizza is frozen, I can assure you it's not. The dough is made fresh daily and the cheese is stored in a refridgerator as it's supposed to be. We make hundreds of pizzas every day, and the kitchen staff is usually no more than three people, usually two. They work hard to get your orders right, done fast and we do EVERYTHING we can to make everything the best we can. The DRA's, the game techs and party hosts work their tails off to help the guests with lost tokens, broken games, games that ran out of tickets, helping a child that can't find his mother, showing kids how to play games, cleaning the entire place and busing and cleaning tables so everything is sanitary. We spend time learning dances for the live shows (you don't think we just know those dances, do you? We spend time coming in before we open -seven in the morning usually- to learn these dances.), doing everything we can to make birthday parties the best they can be, and we are often ridiculed, and take the blunt end of a bad mood. We work hard, are underappreciated, but we are still pleasant and will do whatever we can to make your stay happy. We are paid minimum wage, and do all of this with a smile to make things a good as they can be. We don't cater to adults- our audience is that of children, pretty much from three to twelve. Our games are designed for this audience, as are our prizes and menu. The anamatronics in the show room were designed for entertainment purpouses when there isn't a live show. I wish people appreciated the work we did a little more. I used to be on the other end, complaining about bad service from place xyz, but you really don't know how much work goes into a place like CEC until you work there.
