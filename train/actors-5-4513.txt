Elijah was without a doubt the most talented child actor of his generation, and he has only gotten better. As a child he delibvered a broad range of performances, some lighthearted and others more intensely emotional driven. He carried Huck Finn with his playful, and enthusiastic porayal of the main character, and he stole The Good Son from Maacully Culkin (wow I can't spell), with his far more realistic and believable character depiction. North was perhaps his most impressive youth performance (although his acting couldn't save the script). His comic timing was very fine tuned, and he was able to confidently interact with all the adult stars who appeared on and off throughout the film. His two stand out performance for me however, are The Ice Storm and Lord of the Rings , where he was brilliantly moody and spacy as a troubled teen, and delivered a note-perfect performance as Hobbit Frodo Baggins.
