My wife and I are both coffee drinkers, and the only coffee we drink is Folgers. Believe me when I say that I have tried almost every brand available, but I always come back to Folgers. It's the coffee my parents drank many years ago, and my mother still drinks it. You might say it's a family tradition. The aroma of a fresh brewed pot is just about the best way to wake up. I like my coffee strong and black, and unlike other brands such as Hills Brothers or Maxwell House it doesn't have a bitter taste when made strong. My wife and I both appreciate that. We'll just continue with Folgers. like the saying goes If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
