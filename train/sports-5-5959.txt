I love DUKE and JJ..i watch everygame they play! Sorry about the maryland loss guys i know it was tough but we'll get'em in the tourney when it counts most. But anyways i just want to say to all you ppl who think jj is just a shooter you are so wrong..of course maybe his freshman year he might have been just that..but he has worked so hard to be more than that..hes lost weight, hes faster and he is a great on ball defender in the words of dick vitel and coach k..and his defenders are respecting his drive more because he is able to drive and get to the foul line now where he is the best in history..so he deserves credit and you know it.. plus i think he is extremlet cute..i love you jj!!!! GO DUKE!
