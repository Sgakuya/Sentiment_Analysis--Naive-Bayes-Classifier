Who cares whether or not it's a red state or blue state, you're supposed to rate the state, not the politics. Anyway, I give it a "Terrible" rating because I didn't find anything exciting to do here. I stayed here for 2-weeks with my cousin who moved here last summer for a job. People love to drink here and watch baseball. For entertainment, there are museums and historical sites. But if you are like me, I really don't get a kick out of that stuff so I found there to be a very limited amount of entertainment. Everyone talked about the "bars in boston." When I visited the bars, I encountered a bunch of watering holes full of people that are obsessed with sports and many of the girls are standoffish. I am from Colorado and I can say our girls are much nicer than anyone I encountered in this state and I am proud to have a Colorado girlfriend after engaging in some of the conversations. Most of the girls just want to know about your career and only care about money. The rent is very expensive here, and for what reason, I can't figure it out. When I was in the bar, people were asking me about politics on several occasions. It's like that's all they care about here is stupid politics. I was seriously asked three times about politics, and I don't even vote. In this city there are two topics -- Red Sox and Politics. Bottom line is people are way too serious here for my taste and too caught up in careers and sports teams. If you try to tell a joke around here people look at you funny. People have a very strange pride about being from here like I should give them a blue ribbon for being born here. Maybe next time I'll offer them some New England clam chowder and see what happens. If someone could name off some things to do here that doesn't involve putting on skis and freezing, I would like to know. Anyway, I was happy to get on the plane when I left here.
