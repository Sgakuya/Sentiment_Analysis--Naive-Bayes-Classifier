Close by to Cedar Point, so compared to taht it really stinks. But i found this park very enjoyable. Serial Thriller was pretty fun. But not really worth the wait. They have The Villain, which is my favorite wooden coaster... a MUST RIDE. Then they have Batman: Knight Flight a pretty fun floorless, Not as good as others though. and Superman: Ultimate Flight, an Impulse coaster. The best part is the hold in the back part so you are looking straight down. It's a U shaped coaster. They have X-Flight which is probably teh longest wait. And it's really fun, but if your in OHio, i'd recomend Cedar Point instead. I've never been to teh wildlife side though. I dunno, that might better for families.
