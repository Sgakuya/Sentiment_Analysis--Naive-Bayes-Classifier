This multi-talented man has a long and distinguished resume of which acting and standup comedy is just a part. He also has a long string of credits as a producer, director, writer and educator. As an actor he has a very subtle and naturally engaging style and is gifted with a very strong ability for giving you the feeling that you know him. From my own point of view, I believe that television has provided Mr. Cosby with the best showcase for his style of acting and comedy. His humor, unlike much of what is offered on TV today, always seems to take the high road and never leaves you with the feeling that you need to find some way to disinfect your brain.
