Well, I felt obligated to give the state where I currently live a 5, but that wouldn't be fair to those of you who are reading the reviews for an honest opinion. Anyway, I moved here from PA in 1997 (read my review on PA destinations) for my first job after college. I haven't been all over the state yet, but where I've gone is usually beautiful (unless it's in a city). To name a few parks to visit: Battery Park in New Castle, Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge (to the northeast of Dover), and Fox Point State Park in Bellefonte. There are tons of other parks, too. I personally haven't been to any of the Delaware beaches, but that's only because my parents had always taken me to Ocean City, MD (2.5 hours away), so I go there. I've heard nice things about Rehoboth, Dewey, and Bethany Beaches though. For Restaurants, there are too many to name. Every state or town has at least a few good ones. But if you're near Dewey Beach, head to the Rusty Rudder. It has a great view and great food. If you're up near the PA border on 202, stop in at Macaroni Grill. It's a nice Italian Restaurant w/ good food and a nice ambience. For a more complete list, you can go to http://www.visitdelaware.com/ and click on Dining Out. Also on that page, the Things to Do link might be more helpful, since I don't want to take up a lot of space here. Well, that's all for now (did I type a book?). If you want to email me and ask a question, feel free. dave_in_delaware@hotmail.com ... I'll try to help.
