Im surprised with the reactions of all the people towards Ateneo. There are either the fanatics or the incredibly jealous. Let me set the record straight as a 20 year practitioner in HR, and having interviewed over 8,000 candidates and observed them as they rise and fall within our organization (multinational energy.) Ateneans are almost always very eloquent and very studious. Naturally because the tuition alone guarantees that they come from a well to do family and will have certain standards of behavior and skill. Ateneans are commonly very in-the-box thinkers and zealots. But bright nonetheless. The impression we are under in the HR department is that the Jesuits train the students to believe that simply by going thru Ateneo their students know all the answers. Good for getting bright students with deep pockets. Poor preparation for real life with its twists and turns. We are not talking about exceptions, but the general flow of graduates from the school. Ateneans are generally regarded as arrogant, idealistic to a fault, and inflexible. I would rather send my children to U.P. (inexpensive high standard) or La Salle (good business acumen less fanatical)
