Larry Bird was the best ever. Could do anything and everything, but most importantly he would pass/give it to the "open man" -that is why I give him the edge over Jordan. As a shooter, he was unconscious. it was sick to watch him shoot the lights out,....and if the game was on the line: Watch out. He was going to win the game. Two Players: Michael Jordan vs. Larry Bird Down 2, seconds left. A 3 to win. -Who do you go with. My answer along with most others....Larry Bird. He could nail a three and tell he was going to do it. Besides, everyone else in the whole arena would know who was getting the ball. (the fans, the opposing coach, the opposing team) As I heard it said by Magic Johnson "Its one thing to know where its going, its another thing to stop it. -I fear no one but Larry Bird...because if you keep it close, and you give him a chance, he going to win the game." MJ -you are # 2 in that regard. You are the best besides Bird. Complete package, better athleticly, but Bird had a few more intangables. -that made him better.
