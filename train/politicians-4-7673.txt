Possibly our smartest President. Looses a point for sleeping with his slave, but at least it seems to have been consensual ;) Anyway, he was such a humble man, that he didn't even list President of the United States as one of his accomplishments on his epitaph. But I don't really know where people get the idea that he was some fundamentalist Christian. Run a Google search on founding father+religion and you'll find mounds of evidence showing that the guy was anything but. Several letters exist which show that he often distrusted religion, and leaned more toward Deism (as did Washington and most of the Founders, it seems).
