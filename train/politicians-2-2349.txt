I'll leave it to others to decide if being a black man in a very high position makes him a good or bad role model for black Americans. Leaving that aside, the man is a mediocre bureaucrat. Go look up his record in Vietnam in Four Hours in My Lai . Powell was a major in the Americal division, which included Lt. Calley's unit. When asked about charges that there had been gross violations of the Geneva Convention in that unit, Powell typed a reassuring reply saying that there might have been isolated incidents of mistreatment, but that was it. This was after the My Lai massacre, but before it had become public knowledge. Powell didn't exactly knock himself out trying to uncover the truth. Powell also lied during the Iran-Contra scandal, as pointed out in an article in the latest issue of the NATION.
