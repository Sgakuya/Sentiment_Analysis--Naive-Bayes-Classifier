First, Firefox is free, compact, small, does not take up much memory, and doesn't have the additional addons that the full Mozilla/Netscape suite has. If you want the email and web composing features, get the full Mozilla package and you will be happy. Second, Firefox has a look and feel very similar to Netscape/Mozilla -- because they are made by the same people! If you want IE look and feel, go for Opera. Third, extensions and tabbed browsing make this software rock. Themes, etc, are avaialble for download, and with it being open source, it is less vulnerable to hackers since people can examine the source. I have never had spyware install itself on my PC since using Firefox exclusively. Fourth, it has a built-in pop-up blocker. It gets most of them, but not all. Netscape has certain sites granted permission to do popups at the start -- Firefox does not have this. Bad points: As it gains popularity, hackers will start targeting it. While I love it, I ALWAYS update it when it tells me to. I also watch for things talking about new vulnerabilities that are found, and some do apply to Firefox. It's crashed a few times on me. There are some web pages that are not designed to be Firefox compatible, so naturally some scripts bite the dust when run on Firefox. I simply go kill the task in Task Manager, and start over. I can't seem to find an extension that will allow you to keep all the tabs you had open still open when you exit like Opera offers. But it's DEFINITELY much better than IE, and since I started surfing back in 1996 with Netcsape, I like it's look and feel
