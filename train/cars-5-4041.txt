I love my Santa Fe! I wanted a small SUV and didn't want to spend a lot. I test drove a bunch of vehicles and was very impressed with the Santa Fe. After comparing features, cargo space, comfort, ride, and price, the Santa Fe was the clear choice. After owning it for 7 months I am very satisfied. The car arrived with no defects and I haven't had a stitch of trouble. It's got a strong V6 and it handles well for an SUV. The interior has all the bells and whistles, although the radio is a bit weak (the antenna is in a rear side window and should have been placed in a better spot). The seats are comfortable and there's plenty of legroom and headroom (I'm 6 ft 200 lbs.). Great cargo area. Amazed at what I've gotten in there. By the way, I was a little concerned about reliability and longevity, but this SUV is made well and it comes with a terrific warranty.
