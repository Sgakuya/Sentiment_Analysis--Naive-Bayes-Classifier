A taut thriller with fine performances by Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer. Charles Boyer plays a man trying to convince his wife, Paula (Bergman) that she is crazy. Boyer is exceptional as the conniving husband, and Bergman perfectly portrays the besieged wife. Their relationship subtly hints at what happens within a domestic violence type situation, and makes the film highly relevant to current issues. In addition, the mood of the film is suffocating. The Victorian setting with the gaslights convey the closeness of the house. As the plot develops, the setting and mood of the picture makes the audience feel as if they are going mad along with Paula. A film well worth watching.
