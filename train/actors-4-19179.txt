I've always thought he was one of the stronger players on Friends . He is most definately the most appealing for me in terms of his character's personality. His talent seems natural and never forced giving you the feeling that you know him from somewhere. The fact is, I think we all know or knew a Matthew Perry at one time or another - he's that witty, wise-cracking guy you sat next to in your sophomore English class, your best friends brother, or the guy who makes a quick remark from the back of the classroom and cracks you up so much you're the one who gets yelled at - and you don't hold it against him because what he has to say is usually 10 times more interesting than whatever is going on in class at the time.
