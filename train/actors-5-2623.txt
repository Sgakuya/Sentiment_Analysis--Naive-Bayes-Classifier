The most flexible actor I've ever seen. First time I saw him was in Primal Fear (stupid name, pretty good movie) where his performance as the victimized choir boy blew me away. Then he really surprised me in American History X where his Hitler-lovin', black-hatin' ass really gets taught a hard lesson. His metamorphosis during this movie really impacted me and made me realize what a gifted actor he is. During the horrible scene where he commits the racist murder, the look on his face frightened me to the core - at that point, his performance conveyed to me the essence of pure evil, and the evil that each one of us is capable of. He was bad ass in that movie. Then, he switches over to a bored, frustrated yuppie in Fight Club . I'll continue to see every single movie he's in, because he's always changing his roles and tackling new and interesting characters. I have no idea who the real Edward Norton is, because his characters are all over the place.
