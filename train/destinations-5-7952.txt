My favorite place in Dallas' West End. Before you get to the aquarium, there's this huge jungle exhibit complete with howler monkeys, toucans, vampire bats, exotic insects, pirahnas, panthers, crocodiles, and loads of other animals. The aquarium itself has scores of fish, jellyfish, anemones, snakes, and the like organized into the oceans and seas they're found in. The very end of the aquarium brings you to the best part of all: a massive close-up tank of manatees! We had the good fortune of being there while volunteers were scuba-diving in the tank with the manatees, and it was incredible to see the manatees playfully nuzzle the diver, roll on their backs and swim around lazily, and nudge up against the glass. At the very end of it all is a penguin exhibit. We had a wonderful time, and as an added bonus I ended up winning a raffle prize (this was one of my dad's business excursions) of a betta complete with its own tank, gravel, cleaning kit, food, and an guide book! The little guy's still swimming around in his tank on the kitchen counter today!
