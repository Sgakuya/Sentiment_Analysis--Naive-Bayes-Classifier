This state has the positive of the research triangle- that is a prime innovator in nanotechnology and reaching new frontiers into such concepts as extending life and finding cures for many diseases. This part of the state is mainly newcomers with impressive credentials- the rest of state seems to fit the mold so many have talked about here- southern backwater, arch conservative and instead of taking a cue from the science being used at the research triangle- the majority of the states populace relies on highly subjective thinking .... 'moral values' and religion as a guide to living life. NC seems to fall mainly into the latter 'value meter' line of thought. So it my opinion it only deserves a rating of two.
