So many Great! ratings, and a strip like Calvin & Hobbes has certainly deserved such a prestigeous score. The wide appeal of the strip is amazing. Your snowball fight/dream sequence strip for the little kids, who can certainly relate to Calvin's desire to just incinerate the school with a laser beam, run wild on Saturdays, and have a stuffed animal for a best friend. And the dinosaur obsession. I've always felt that at one point or another in a child's life, they become fascinated by dinosaurs. I know I was. And then there's the deeper, intellectual insights, while Calvin drives his sled or wagon down the steepest, largest hill he can find while Hobbes hangs onto dear life. Theories about science, life, and all those great things that seem so complex, yet so simple when Calvin describes them as they go sailing into the air, reaching comical altitudes, and then falling for a crash landing in the snow/lake. There's something for everyone in Calvin & Hobbes, and the story about a boy and his tiger will probably remain forever immortal.
