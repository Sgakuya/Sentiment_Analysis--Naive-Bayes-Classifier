I have just recently discovered the secret treasure of gold that is Wendy's! We never went there when I was a kid because my mom didn't like it, but I decided to take a chance and try it. I was pleasantly surprised. The hamburgers are awesome- I love the fact the meat patties are square-shaped, so you get a little extra. Plus, the toppings are all fresh and delicious- juicy tomatoes, crisp lettuce, etc. The fries are really good and the Frosties are a wonderful treat, hard to pass up. I also like Wendy's variety and their prices are reasonable. I recently tried their taco salad- delicious and fresh. Wendy's is quickly replacing Mickey D's as my fave fast food place.
