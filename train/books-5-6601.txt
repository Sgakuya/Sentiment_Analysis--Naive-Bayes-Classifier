Originally published in 1955, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy has become the benchmark against which all other fantasy literature is measured. For the few that are uninitiated, the trilogy is an epic story which follows the trials and tribulations of heros fighting the forces of evil by destroying the force (ie the One Ring) that props up the evil powers. The Ring itself is evil incarnate so that it corrupts any who dares to use it, even to fight existing evil. In other words, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Tolkien uses very formal and flowery language as he describes the geography, history, language, religion, mythology and races of the fictional world (Middle Earth) that he has created for the major characters: Gandalf the Wizard who in many ways is a neo Christ figure, Aragorn the noble philosopher King in exile, elves who represent the lost potential of mankind, dwarves, hobbits, orcs, etc. Along with the main themes of good versus evil, the trilogy examines temptation, fall from grace, pride, humility, and the joys of simple pleasures. Moreover, as a linguist, Tolkien is able to create original languages for his world. Nevertheless, The Lord Of The Rings is not perfect. Some parts of the story seem slow and/or forced (eg the trip from the Shire to Bree and Tom Bombadil). Second, the story has few strong female characters though this might be expected from British literature largely written during the 1940's. Third, as other comments have noted, Tolkien injects too many songs in the text.
