Brilliant brilliant man. What a shame there are so many narrow minded people who blithely use their sexual hang-ups to rate this guy. The more popular he got, the louder and more belligerent his MINORITY opposition became. I know those people- they're absolutely perfect in every way. ALWAYS drive the speed limit, NEVER run red lights, and OF COURSE they always let the other guy merge in front of them in traffic. (yeah- right) We're going from the president who's always the smartest guy in the room to a president who's the dimmest bulb in town. Never fear, Mr President, a few years from now they'll recognise what a great president you were.
