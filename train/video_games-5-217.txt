Sure it's violent, pretty simplistic and not a little sick. It's also very entertaining, and actually pretty hilarious at times. This game really surprised me in its addictiveness, which is apparent mostly in its diabolical level design full of secrets, short cuts and spectacular stunts. The driving physics are pretty out of this world, but that only adds to the fun of it. I DON'T think that its viceral mayhem makes it right for parents to complain about it, because the whole thing is so obviously over-the-top. If your kid plays this game and then jumps into the old family woody-wagon and starts plowing down pedestrians, you've obviously failed in your duty as a parent to guide your child as to what is real and what is make-believe. In the end all you need to know is: it's a hoot to play.
