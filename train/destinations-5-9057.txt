wow this place is beautiful. i dont care for the prostitutes being a woman myself and not having a need for one, but damn ive never been anywhere in the world where bud was so easily aquired. the first time i went was at 16 and i was sold some dank KB at some random coffee shop and it blew my mind how easily it is aquired here. even if you dont like these liberal points of view, u should still come here for the expierence and open your mind a little i know my father brought me and hes not the typical old pothead hippie type. hes a successful business man and a republican. this is one of the most beautiful places on earth.
