It's a love hate thing with me and California...beaches don't flip me over, mountains make my vertigo kick in, Hollywood long ago lost it's sparkle. On top of that lots of places in this state stay way too hot for too much of the year, and, of course, you have earthquakes, smog and over population. Then again it's a big, very diverse state both geographically and culturally, freedom of thought which, if used in a positive way, can be a good thing and is generally embraced here, and great healthy produce can also be found in glorious abundance. Also, after years in colder climes I think I would rather dust my car off than scrape ice in the winter. I doubt I d ever move here but it IS a great spot for a vacation in fact, I m looking forward to a little California dreaming next month!
