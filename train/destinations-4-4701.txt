I currently stay in a Detroit suburb, and must admit that my visits to Detroit are sporadic since there's usually not too much going on in the area. During my last time, I actually ahd a good time. This may be hard for many of you to believe (and it was for me), but the city of Detroit is actually improving. Anyway, I visited the relatively new Compuware center, which is a very very nice place. The first couple of levels is somewhat of a mall. I ate at the hardrock cafe, which is located on the ground floor or the Compuware building. The new Grand Martius Park is an utterly gorgious located right infront of the Compuware building. The park has absolutely splendid waterfalls. Then, I went to Comerica Park for a Tigers game, and had a wonderful time. If you sit in the right place in the stadium, you will actually get an awesome veiw of the Detroit skyline. The streets were pretty clean. We were able to walk around the downtown area at night without any worries. There was a pretty strong police presence around the streets. I must admit that there are alot of abandoned stores and other venues with old signs and boarded up windows, but the buildings actually look nice. If you are an admirer of skyscrapers, you will enjoy the skyscrapers in Detroit. The Rennasssaince Center flows very nicely with the other buildings. The waterfront is amazing with a very nice view of Windsor directly across the river. I encourage all of you to visit Detroit. Greek Town and Mexican Town are very nice places. You should also check out Royal Oak, which is only a few minutes north of the Detroit Border and easily accessible from I-75 North. If you're willing to drive a half hour from the city, I would encourage you to check out Ann Arbor (Maize and Blue town), which is a pretty easy drive along I-94 West.
