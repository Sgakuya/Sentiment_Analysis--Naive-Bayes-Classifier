Will Ferrell is on a serious roll. He is making a strong pass to be the most prolific and successful SNL PT Player to move to the big screen. Typical Ferrell antics in this film that makes fun of kiddie soccer. Ferrell is funny as the meek father and soccer coach who turns the tables on his overly-ambitious father (played by Robert Duvall). Ferrell has the Belushi touch when it comes to physical comedy and he is funny to watch and listen to. Mike Ditka plays himself and is also pretty funny. The hackneyed losers to winners plot never fails to tug at my heart and it is done well here. Overall, very good family fare.
