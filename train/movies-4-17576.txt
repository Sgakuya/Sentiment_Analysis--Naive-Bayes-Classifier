A very nice movie from Japan. A middle aged Japenese man,who leads a rather mundane life gets interested in dance lessons when he watches the dance studio that is near the train station. He is a nice shy man who starts taking lessons. Since he would be embarrased for someone to find out about his lessons, he tells nobody including his wife. the man's wife gets suspicious why her husband is not coming home on time a couple times a week so she hires a detective{who traces him to the dance hall} the movie shows how he slowly learns how to dance along with the other men in the group. they end up in a dance competition. I liked this movie I found myself rooting for the lead character.
