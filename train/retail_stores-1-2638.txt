I am a current kroger employee in indiana ive only worked there a month but this store is awful the managers treat the employees like dogs my manager yells and complains there are no benefits to working there you get a 10 percent discount on kroger brand stuff only which the prices are so high anyway what kind of discount is that? you dont get insurance unless you worked there a year they say theres great oppurtunities there well there are none they dont hire enough employees and when they do they quit right away so they expect all the other employees in that department to work overtime to make up for it for all and then we have narcs that go into the break room and listen to what people say about management or if they complain then go and tell on them and of course they get high pay and get to slack off for being a narc people that live in indiana go to walmart meijer and dont even bother getting a krogerplus card
