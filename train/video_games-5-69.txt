Ssssh, this is a game of no shooting, hiding in dark corners and creeping about nickin' stuff. Another new gaming genre and this one got me hooked, actually, what got me hooked was the medieval look about it yet it has that Victorian Cyberpunk feel too - you know, like the Diamond Age....no? Anyway, the game blew me away. It was exciting to crouch in a dark corner and watch a soldier walk past, moaning about his empty stomach - then suddenly you make a noise and he doubles back and creeps towards you - I know you are around here somehwere - you close your eyes and before he treads on your toes he says Hmmm, must have been a rat - fantastic!!
