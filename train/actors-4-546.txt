I remember back in the mid 70's when they were trying to get Superman off the ground (pun intended), and no big star would sign up because they were all afraid the movie would bomb, and take their careers with it. Everyone was afraid it would be a cheap, cartoony movie with cheesy effects and no one took it seriously. Then, Mr. Brando signed on to play Jor-El (for a huge amount of money considering the small amount of screen time), and then suddenly everybody took the film seriously. Were it not for him the Superman movies might never have happened. Of course, Brando earned that kind of clout through years of solid work like Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront. He got a little eccentric in his later years, and lost a little respect the film industry used to have for him, but all in all, he will be remembered for his impressive body of film work.
