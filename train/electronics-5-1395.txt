I chose this over the IPod Mini. For the same price, you get better sound - I've compared the two with the same headphones (not surprising since these guys make speakers and sound cards!) Plus, 1 GB more memory, a user-replacable, longer-lasting battery, a built-in FM radio, and arguably a better look with the blue glow. Zen Micro is more flexible with software than IPod, which forces you to use ITunes and certain audio formats. If you're not a touch pad fan, you might want to give this a test drive before buying (though you can get a remote for this thing for only $20). The only other advantages I see the overrated Mini having over the Zen Micro, is that the Mini has far more accessories and is more of a trendy status symbol.
