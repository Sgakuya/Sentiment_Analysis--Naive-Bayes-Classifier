A Beautiful game, easily one of the best that Squaresoft has produced and that in itself is saying a lot. While the graphics are nothing to brag about by today's standards, they were visually stunning for when it was released, especially the beginning FMV, and of course the heartbreaking tragedy, no I won't spoil it for those who haven't played. The storyline is amazing and heart-wrenching, I found myself crying at certain points in the game. They made great use of scenery, because just after the great tragedy, you set about to a snowy wasteland, quite desolate while resonating upon the tragedy. The music is great, it is a shame that they didn't utilize the full potential of the playstation and only used SNES quality music, but it was absolutely stunning and touched with your emotions. This dark and serious plot has light spots tho, like the great number of minigames. BTW typeo, the tragedy and not being able to cast life is because when you are in random fights, they don't die, if you look at the screen it says somethingt like wounded not dead, it's just the fact that the spell is named life that causes people confusion.
