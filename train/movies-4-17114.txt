Well, this is a tough one..definitely STRANGE. I didn't see it until it came out on video, so by then, I had heard all of the hype about the length of time they spent filming this, Kubrik's last film. I had heard mostly bad reviews, so I wasn't expecting much. However, I liked it. I didn't love it, it isn't one of those life changing movies, but it is an eye opener into the world of the weird..Some pretty crazy behavior..All in all, a good film..with Kubrik's brilliant camera angles and musical choices. He had that gift of putting you right in the room..scared to death as everyone stared at you with their freaky masks on, waiting for you to undress..
