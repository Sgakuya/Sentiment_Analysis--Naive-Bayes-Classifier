I was enrolled at UOP for a single class and quickly realized it was a complete waste of time and money. The group projects were unbelievable, the subject matter completely useless, and the instructor was less than helpful, not to mention 2yrs later I am still getting spam mail from UOP. I ended up going to AIU Online, which has a 100% better format and layout. Unfortunately that completely useless class I took at UOP won't transfer to anything else. Also UOP had tacked on an extra yr to my degree due to missing Associates level courses, however AIU let me complete all of the missing credits using CLEP tests. Thanks to AIU I graduate with my BSIT in 5 more wks.
