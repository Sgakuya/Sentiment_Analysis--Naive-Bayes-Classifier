Morocco will probably become the first African country to join the European Union! When this will find place, I woun't dare in guessing, but with some luck, it can expect membership around 2020-25. I know it's a lot of years to go, but membership WILL certainly do miracles! Casablanca is a legendary city, famous from what IMDb says is the fifth best movie of all times! I loved it too, it's both romantic very funny! Moroccos strength is the close neighbourship to Spain, both iberian countries (is to say: Also Portugal) will press the EU to give Morocco status as an equal membership country as fast as possible... Viva Espa a! Actually Morocco was the first African country to join EuroSong, or the Eurovision Song Contest, and still is, although the country only has participated once... I'd love to go interrail in this interesting country! :-)
