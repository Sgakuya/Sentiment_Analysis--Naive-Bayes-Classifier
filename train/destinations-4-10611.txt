I have tried almost all of the Spirit flavors and like the menthols(dark green pack) the best. I was never big into menthols but the A.S. menthols are great. There is no menthol in the tobacco itself, but rather, it is in the filter. If you ever get a chance, feel the filter of a menthol spirit. It has a gap in the middle. Now shake the filter next to your ear, you will hear the eucalyptis crystals in there. The great thing about all spirits is the tabacco is the same in all of the flavors. The thing that makes them light or ultra light ect.. is the filter and paper are more porous depending on the strength you get. I will say, however, I do not like the A.S. with the white paper filters. They are too soft and make the taste a little different. The Organics(orange and red packs) are good if you have been a smoker for a long time and need a cleaner smoke. I personally don't care for them, but know people who can only smoke them. Here is how I rank the flavors I have tried: Full Flavor (Blue Pack): *** Medium (light green):* Lights (yellow pack):** Menthol (dk. green):***** Menthol Light(green/white pack):** Organics(red pack):** Organic Lights(orange pack):* Periques(black pack):**** Unfiltered(brown pack):*** Hope this helps all you smokers with taste!
