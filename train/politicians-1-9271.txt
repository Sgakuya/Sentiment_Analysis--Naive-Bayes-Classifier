The problem with this guy is that he played too much football back in the days when helmets were no more than leather caps. This showed later on. Ford not only pardoned Nixon, which was one of the biggest insults ever paid to the American People, the political process and our way of life, but he also was a prominent member of that criminal conspiracy and ultimate whitewash known as The Warren Commission. One of the most ineffectual Presidents ever as he and his people didn't have a clue about handling a most sluggish economy, which resulted in Jimmy Carter inheriting a slew of problems that Nixon and Ford made worse because of their incompetance. Ford also failed to heed the discord and anti-American sentiment that was brewing in the Arab nations, and the upshot of this was the beginning of the era of Islamic Terrorism. This guy had difficulty chewing gum and walking at the same time, and he was such a clumsy putz of misery that the voters turned him out after two years of lameness. He wasn't even a One-Term Wonder!!! Pathetic. They reported on the news in the past year that he suffered a stroke, but given his lack of mental acuity, I can't see how one could notice...
