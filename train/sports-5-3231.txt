If you want to count Aaron's longetivity against him, then you can also convieniently forget about all the Negro league pitchers the Babe didn't face. Don't worry that Aaron played the end of his career in a pitcher's era, when the mound had to be lowered to raise batting averages. Having Lou Gehrig at your back won't change how teams pitch to you. And surely, the juiced ball of the 30s didn't help Ruth establish the HR as the most popular stat in baseball. To me, the idea of rating a greatest player is silly... especially across such different eras of baseball. In his time, there was no one who could play like Ruth. But if you want to objectify greatness, then pursue objectivity. Otherwise, this discussion becomes nothing more than a popularity contest.
