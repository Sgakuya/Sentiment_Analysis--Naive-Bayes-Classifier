I have been playing billiards on Playstation 1 since Sep 2002. I acquired the game in Canada for less than $3.00 dollars. After considerable practice, I have become efficient. Most of the time, I can defeat the computer characters in sucession and get the congratulations screen. I found that in 9 ball you had better make the nine ball as a combination shot. If you don't, some of the computer opponents will run the table. My three grandsons learned to play billiards on Playstation 1. My one grandson at 9 years old won the championship at Wright-Patterson AF base on a regulation pool table. He received a very nice trophy. He has beaten his grandpa several times on Playstation.
