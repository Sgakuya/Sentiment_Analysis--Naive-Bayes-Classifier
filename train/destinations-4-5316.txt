After reading some of these comments i have a good response. I'm from NY, and i am pretty familiar wih PA as well. A lot of people on here are talking about how Pennsylvania is all hicks and little podunk towns and cowfields, surprised it votes democrat and the philly burbs saved it from the reds and all that stuff. In a sense, you are right, but you have to look at the whole picture. While most of the land area of Pennsylvania is sparsly populated by fairly uneducated people and dotted with little dumptowns, the vast majority of the PEOPLE in Pennsylvania live in and around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; Two large, modern, comfortable, educated cities, where the people won't shoot you for walking on their property lol. But even many of the small towns in PA resemble towns in New England more so than towns in say, West Virginia.
