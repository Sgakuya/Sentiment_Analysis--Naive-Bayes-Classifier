To me, this is the best regular smoke out there. I've actually been smoking more Turkish Royals lately, but to me, Camel Filters are like corn flakes, a classic that will never go away. The high nicotine content but smooth taste makes for an easy way to get your fix, and unlike light smokers, you won't be headed outside every 40 minutes. Staying power. I've also had the European Camels, grown in the Ukraine but bought in Moldova, and I find them to be a tad sweeter, regardless that it's the same tobacco species and blend. I think it might be the weather difference or the soil. I thought I'd mention that for our non-US pals.
