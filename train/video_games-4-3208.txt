(Also available on the Nintendo GameCube; both versions are good, the only difference that I remember, being as we got rid of the PS2 version, is that the GameCube version allows you to sell powerup items for gold. Heh. When it decides to work, that is.) Great multiplayer game (1-4 characters) with lots of characters to choose from (some secret characters you have to unlock in special areas), Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is a lot of fun if you're bored and broke and need to stay at home. Hours of gameplay (though repetitive), a variety of different worlds, and cool little special attacks make the game fun. I've had the game pretty much since it came out, and it's still fun to play. I admit, way back then I was a little skeptical about this 3D version, when I liked the old Nintendo version so much, but it's a good adaption. Plus, you gotta like a game that gives you oh-so helpful hints, like Food is good, and Avoid Dangerous Objects. P.S.: Also, requires absolutely no skill whatsoever to play. Honest. Anyone can pick this game up.
