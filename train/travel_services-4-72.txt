I used to hear about Southwest being zany and different, but they've been quiet in the media recently, as JetBlue has had the newest innovative presence. But I just flew Southwest and I enjoyed it. They went to leather seats to compete with JetBlue, and their flight attendants were my favorite yet. Young, spunky attendants who joke around with you. I hit on this on girl Jacqueline (sort of aggressively because I had been drinking), and she asked me if I was a member of the mile-high club. I said no, and she suggested I meet her in the back bathroom in 5 minutes. I said ok, expecting a joke but I went anyway, and there was a fat guy with his shirt off waiting for me. Anything for a laugh at my expense I guess.
