It took me a long time to recognize this guy's genius. The Godfather is one of my all-time favorite films, but I thought Al tended to play the same type of intense ethnic role over and over again until it got to seem like shtick. In the late 70's, his career seemed to go downhill as he starred in some truly awful movies. But he's redeemed himself since then, even though he's been in more that his fair share of crap and has a tendency to get hammy. But compare his roles in Godfather and Donnie Brasco if you doubt the extent of his versatility and range. In these films, he plays polar opposites in terms of personality and status within the underworld and he excells in both. Truly qualifies as one of America's great actors. If only he could find more films to star in that were worthy of his immense talent.
