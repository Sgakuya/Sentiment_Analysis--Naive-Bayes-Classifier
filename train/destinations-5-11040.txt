Six Flags in general are pretty hard to beat in terms of mind numbingly fast and thrilling rides. I've been to the one in Jersey a couple of times and not only have I never left disappointed but I didn't even have a chance to ride everything in one go around! The Free Fall ride, though only a few seconds in duration, still creeps me out just thinking about it. The last time I went I had a friend with me who had never been on the Free Fall before and I had assured her that it was no big deal. In my mind I truly rememebered it as not being so bad. Anyway we get strapped in and it's taking us up to top and suddenly it all came rushing back to me...the fear, the weightless feeling, the moment where you can't speak for about 3 seconds and you just feel like oh god please just let me get out of this, why oh why did I do this etc.etc. So I turn to her when we reach the top and the bells are going off (they sound three or four bells as it slides you to the edge just before a red launch light flashes with a final buzzer and releases you. I turn to her and I say oh my god Ruth I just remembered this actually is pretty scary! I, honestly, was nervous and not just saying it to freak her out but looking back I wish I could say I'd planned it because she just had this sudden dead pan look on her face and then BEEEEEEP we were gone. Gotta stop at Six Flags..just gotta.
