As a guy who likes his Republicans to act like Republicans, I say good riddance to Jim Jeffords. He's a moderate-to-liberal Democrat on the issues, so why bother kidding ourselves? But what irks me is how he's now celebrated as a man of great principle! Hmmm... let's see. The Republican Party under Reagan, and then during Newt's Speakership, was AOK to Jim Jeffords. Both men wanted to eliminate the Department of Education (good idea). Now Bush comes along and works with Ted Kennedy on some education reform that is such an incredible compromise (no school choice at all) that every conservative I know is aghast at this missed opportunity. But for Jeffords it's the straw that broke the camel's back. Or is it?? Could it be that Jefford's action of principle was actually him accepting Daschle's offer of a committee chairmanship -- something that he'd be sure to lose when Strom Thurmond finally dies (which would have given the Dems senate control anyway). Jefford's jump was a calculated move by a not-too-bright political power-seeker. The only thing that I've enjoyed about it is seeing how McCain get mad that someone else stole his shtick and did it better.
