Agree completely with Yorthan, I think on this list the we were supposed to rate our great USA on the basis of its TOURIST potential, not its geo-politico-socio-historical climate all rolled into one. ... well guess what, it still rates very HIGH !! Actually it is a huge country with a variety of destinations, including the mountain ski resorts of the Rockies and New England, the desert Landscapes of Arizona and Nevada, the Nightlife of Las Vegas and Atlantic city, the sheer Majestic presence and vibrancy of New York with its city life, the life of California with its beaches, and those of Florida, the mighty Niagara falls, and Grand Canyon..... etc.....etc...it goes on. Agreed, we may not have real Old monuments or the best public ground transport systems like Europe, but the air connections are probably the best, so is driving on your own. US is certainly cheaper (food, gas, lodgings), less crowded and more versatile. ...... and if all this doesn't qualify a country for 5 STARS on this rating list, I don't know what does.
