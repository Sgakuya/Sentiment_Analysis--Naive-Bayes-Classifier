The Brothers Gibb have returned to their roots and have done it in excellent fashion. They have combined rock, soul and classic balladry into a great collection that highlights their superb natural three part harmonies. Their early rock influences stand out on She Keeps On Coming , while their R B influences shine on Loose Talk Costs Lives and even incorporate current sounds on Deja Vu . There is also a great wedding standard called Wedding Day which EVERY bride groom should dance to. The CD closes out with Voice In The Wilderness which is a guitar fueled frenzy loaded with energy. A CD definetly worth getting!
