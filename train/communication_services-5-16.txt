We have had Excel Local since it became available in our area. We have had no problems, but have seen savings - my sis lives in Canada, and now we talk so much more often than before. 3000 mins is 50 hours, that means almost 2 hours of LD every day. Do people really spend that much time on the phone just to chat ? Even at 1c/min (an unheard of rate, especially to Canada) it would cost $30 plus you still have your local service, so $65 is not unreasonable, with all the extra features. Plus we can finally BUDGET our phone bill - no matter how much we talk, it's always the same!. I have heard of people having some minor issues, but Excel works hard to resolve them, and some times it is the local carrier that causes the problem (such as the bells..). Sorry not everyone shares our experience...
