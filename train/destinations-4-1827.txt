Nice country, nice people (for the most part), too cocky, too self-centered, but a real enjoyable place to be, unless you go to the wrong part of town, which is like a quarter of the country. But anyway, I really do enjoy the country, but I really hate their politics. One of my possible careers that I am thinking of right now is a pilot in the USNAF. Hell, even in a time of war, its safer to be in an American jet rather then a Canadian plane, with all the 'boo-boos' that have happened. But, anyway, like the country, like most of the people, hate the idiotic men you pick to run you country, especially this one, what the hell were you thinking, TWICE?
