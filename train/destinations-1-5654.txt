Massachusetts sucks, the first time I went there I had no idea they dont have summer there only freezing rain season. I left home in the middle of august it was 115 got to boston and it was raining and barely 54 degrees. The weather there sucks. Ran into people having sex in open public too many times there, keep it in the bedroom Massachusetts, I get dragged there for business a couple of times a year and I dont like it. When I am there I cant wait to get back to real life. The only thing good about Massachusetts is their transit system and some of the restaurants. Dirty, filthy, rude smelly people (Boston), some of the outlying areas are nice though. The cost of living is astronomical, ridiculous. Keep-Trying keep trying to suck up the loss by any means necessary through vacant correlations. LOL
