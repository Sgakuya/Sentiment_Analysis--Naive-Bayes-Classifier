I'd argue that Polk was probably one of the most successful and hard-working US Presidents of the 1800's. He had a very ambitious domestic agenda largely based on expanding US borders to the Pacific by incorporating British and Mexican territory. Britain wasn't willing to put up a fight against the United States for the Pacific Northwest, but Mexico didn't exactly go quietly into the night. The Mexican American war was fought largely because of the US annexation of Texas into the Union in late 1845 right before he got into office. Basically the border wasn't clearly established, and without a diplomatic or financial solution, war was all but inevitable. The war ended up lasting nearly all of Polk's entire term. However it was also highly successful with minimal US causalities. In the final peace agreement, Polk did manage to get much of what he wanted: Texas down to the Rio Grande along with the right to buy California and New Mexico. Manifest Destiny was his primary legacy, but he was also a very hard-working President who was an honest and able administrator. He reformed the post office and lowered tariffs. Like his political hero, Thomas Jefferson, he believed in a small, efficient government that met the needs of the people well. He only served one term, for the job literally had exhausted him to death. Polk believed in the final analysis that he had carried out everything he had wanted to accomplish, and he probably did. He died shortly after leaving office.
