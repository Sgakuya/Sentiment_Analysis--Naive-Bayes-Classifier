A bastard in both the literal and figurative senses of the word, William was the type of Monarch that traded his subjects freedom for security, the first totalitarian monarch. After all the Hero of the battle of Hastings (a minstrel who, whilst all the norman knights were too scared to charge the Saxon lines, rode alone up the the Saxon lines and started juggling his sword and lance before throwing his lance through an English soldier, giving the Normans the bravery to charge) was not even acknowledged in the Bayeux tapestry lest he undermine William's glory. He established the feudal system in England, replacing about 30 Saxon earls with about 20 Norman barons and demanded the very first English census, the Doomsday book which documented the possessions of every man in the land. This allowed William and his lords to work the English populace harder then ever before and when anyone disagreed with the harsh conditions, William would travel to said settlement and kill everyone, the women, the children, the animals and would even burn the crops for good measure. William's death was equally as humiliating as his birth, after leaping upon his horse, the horse collapsed under his considerable girth throwing him off. He never recovered and when he died, the coffin they tried to fit him in exploded. Undoubtedly a tyrant but also a superb soldier king (he foiled a Danish invasion, defeated the Scots and forced them to pay tribute, quelled some of his rebellious Norman underlings and conquered Maine) and a great modernizer who for better or worse brought order to the land. It was said that under his reign, for the first time, a man was able to travel from the bottom of England to the top with a bag of gold, without fearing for either his purse or his life.
