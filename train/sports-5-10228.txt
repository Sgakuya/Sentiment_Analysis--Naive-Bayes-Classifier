The comment below must be an upset texas fan. So, he's only got one national championship. He's only been a head coach for six years. He took a program with average talent and made them into a national championship team. Also, how many years before Bobby Bowden won one? As for the whining Stoops is a competitor. He doesn't like to lose, especially the way the Sooners did in the last two games. Going from one of the all time great college teams to losing the last two games in that fashion is upsetting. To say he hasn't really won anything is just plain dumb. He's beaten Texas five straight years. Twice Stoops hung half a hundred. How many times did Switzer accomplished that feat? And look at the coaches previous to Stoops. All fired because they couldn't handle the OU program. Since 1999, Stoops has lost 11 games. And finally, defense wins championships. You even said that Stoops produces stellar defenses. I'd rather have that than a great offense year in and year out. Look at Texas Tech for an example. AND, he's made assistant coaches into college head colleges. Leach, Mangino, and his younger brother are all head coaches in big conferences. Venables and Long will probably get coaching gigs too.
