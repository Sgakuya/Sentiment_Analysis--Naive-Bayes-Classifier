Pokemon Stadium 2 is the Nintendo 64 sequel to the hit Pokemon Stadium. Based in the universe of Pokemon(s) Gold and Silver, there are 251 Pokemon. Rendered spectacularly in 3D, the graphics now support the 4MB RAM expansion pack. Animations are smooth, textures are clean and the backgrounds are well done. Sound is great, too. While it is dissappointing that Pokemon speech (ie Pika! Pika!) was not included, there is commentary from a solo commentator. His comments are much expanded this time (thanks, in part, to Factor Five voice compression technology), with many humorous comments included as well. The music is much better this time around as well, with several jazzy tunes. The gameplay is basically the same, with some new modes such as Challenge Cup, where you must battle with a team of Pokemon randomly selected for you. The mini-games (ala Mario Party) are back as well, with a nice variety. All in all, this game is another great Pokemon title from the brilliant people at Nintendo!
