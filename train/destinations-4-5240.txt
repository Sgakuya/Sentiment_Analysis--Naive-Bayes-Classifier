I can't comment too much on the Bay Area, I did travel there back in the early 80's, but I was not even a teenager yet. I loved it though, it was quite cool and brisk eventhough it was June. San Diego is the best, beautiful, I always advise friends traveling to CA to go to LA first then San Diego (and Mexico -- watch your wallet -- and don't eat or drink ANYTHING). San Diego is sooo beautiful and equally expensive, I mean I wouldn't consider moving there if I hit the Mega Bucks Lotto. California is waaaay to expensive that's why folks are bailing to AZ, OR, NV, UT (you name it) and driving up property values in these other places. Coming from Cali any bloated price looks damn good. Oh my gosh, th smog in LA is unbelieveable and so is the price on a gallon of gas. A great place to visit (5 stars), a terrible place to live.
