Reese is one of the most talented actresses i've ever seen. She touched me in her acting in the movies Freeway, Pleasentville, Cruel Intentions and Legally Blonde by making me feel almost as she was those actual characters. It's that feeling where you think you absolutely know them but in this case of course you dont because their just characters. She made me feel like she was actually them, alot of actors/actresses do that but this was special because in all her work she shows that she plays her parts with incredible performances. After watching several works of hers I became to look into her personal life and she has came off as a beatiful, smart, talented, caring person. She's one of those people who make you feel good about life besides from her acting because as a person she's wonderful from all that is said and known about her. If opinions are all mutual then it's obiviously true. Reese and Ryan are one great couple with a romatic story. Thats just another plus in this whole story of her life. She is going to be really great some day, just need fate to bring her to her absolute fame.
