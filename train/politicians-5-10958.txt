I helped with Richard Shelby's campaign the first time he ran for political office back in 1970. He was elected to the Alabama Legislature at that time. He came across as a very honest, ethical, intelligent, and all around nice guy. His wife, Annette, is a brilliant college professor who was on the faculty of the University of Alabama and became a top faculty member at Georgetown when Dick was elected to Congress. The last time I saw Dick Shelby was a couple of years ago in the produce section of a Winn-Dixie store in Tuscaloosa near our home. He was by himself and purchasing salad ingredients. Can you imagine Ted Kennedy, Diane Finestein, John Kerry, or Nancy Pelosi doing that?
