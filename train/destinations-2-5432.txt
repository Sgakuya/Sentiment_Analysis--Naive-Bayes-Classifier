I'm rating Illinois only as a place for travelers. Every year during the month of June, it is necessary for me to make a business trip to Indiana, and I go through southern Illinois on the way. And every year, as soon as I cross into the state, I see cops everywhere, pulling over travelers and giving them tickets. As supportive as I am of police officers, it seems they could spend their time better by going after violent criminals instead of pulling over out-of-staters for revenue. They've never stopped me, but I always see them going after people, and it makes me feel unwelcome as a traveler in Illinois. During my last trip, a few days ago, I decided to return home by way of a different route, traveling through southern Indiana on slow country roads, then abruptly going west into Missouri, before heading south to my home state of Arkansas. Illinois may have some good people, but I'll avoid their highways all I can.
