When I lived in Taiwan every once in a while a Canadian friend and English guy and I would all get together, get a bottle of Chivas and get Scotched as they called it. Which brings me to my point about Glenfidich which is that it's better than Chivas, smoother easier to drink without that harsh Scotch burn that's so common. I first found this out when I was with my college girlfriend in England visiting her relatives etc. We stayed with her parents best friends and from the moment we walked in the door the dad is passing me pints. We walk around the corner in this sleepy little town to a little pub and have few more then back to the house where he decides to crack open a bottle of Glenfidich. So here's me - college kid, beer drinker, thinking he can hold his own (which I did but just barely) and here's him - fifty / fifty-five maybe, parent with two grown kids, car dealer, family man, wife sitting across the couch from us and he's drinking me under the table! I stayed awake but that's about it. It was good though
