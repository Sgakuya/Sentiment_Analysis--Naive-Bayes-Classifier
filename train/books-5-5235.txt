If you appreciate good writing, I highly recommend White Oleander . Throughout this book, I would stop to admire how Janet Fitch had described a detail or a scene. I would stop and reread portions because of how well she had written them. If you read typical romance, thriller, spy/intrigue, horror novels and don't care about good writing, I don't think you'll enjoy this book. If you've always liked to read, enjoyed books as a child, proudly called yourself a bookworm and did well in Language Arts with minimal effort during your school years, I think you'll enjoy White Oleander despite the sadness of the story itself. It's one of those books that lingers in your mind long after you've read it and stands out amongst all the forgotten ones.
