Hallelujah!!! For decades the shear absurdity of the National Capital not having the National Pasttime prevailed, all because of the manipulative and Devious Peter The District is a suburb of Baltimore Angelos (Living proof of the economic and sociologic ills that occurs when a monopoly takes place.) Though my town (Norfolk, VA) was in the running for the Expos franchise, it was always going to be D.C. with the possible fallback of Northern Virginia. Of course, the Expos won't flush as a name. So what do we call them? I like the traditional Senators (although, the Texas Rangers hold rights to that name). There is the Nationals, which was used off and on in their history. Then there is the Statesmen used in their 19th century incarnation. Here are some trendier nicknames: Washington Filibusters, Washington Monuments, Washington Loopholes, Washington Pentagons, Washington Gangstas, and Washington Jam (as in traffic jam). Maybe they could be unconventional and use something like Beltway Busters, Capital City Captains, District Diamonds or Capital Cap Busters. Whatever they are named, Major League baseball's malevolent benefactor treatment of the Expos has left this franchise in disarray. 20 years from now, they may be called Washington Losers.
