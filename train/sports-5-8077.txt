Allen Ivi is the second best player ever. Behind MJ. I remember when A.I. was in his second year in the league. Oh-Whee! He did a dirty cross-over on MJ. Then he looked at him and nailed a three. This in Phili. The croad went crazy, MJ fell on his knees, and the Bulls lost that game. That was the year Chi went 72-10. I love the Sixers jerseys. Especially the blue ones. If the Sixers trade AI, I would barely watch basketball anymore. Just the AI games. Also, Paul Tagliabu said that the country shouldn't be represented by a player with braids and tatoos. Bulls**t!! Its fake people like Tagliabu that the country shouldn't be represented by. Then they tell AI to change his lyrics for his new CD:40 Bars. I've already heard the origional and I live in Miami. Girls say I remind them of AI because of the way I look. I wear name brand clothes, have braids, have six tatoos, and hip-hoped to death. Amd I wear mostly what AI wears. His shoes,Jerseys, shorts, and when I see him on the tv with braids, I have my sister do the first raw design I see for the week. To last the whole week. The rest I have on tape. I watch every Sixer game on satellite. AI to me, is what Michael Vick is to Virginia Tech. Vick Tech. It's not all AI. But its 84 percent. All Ivi was doing with his CD was keppin' it real. Like me. And girls say I look like him in the face. I doubt it. But some guys say it too. Hay, basically he's the best ever. Other than MJ.
