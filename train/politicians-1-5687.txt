Wow, hasn t Hillary been making the most of her office? I mean she has really managed to get her mug on TV at every opportunity what so ever since 9/11! How many other Jr. senators from NY have you seen popping up like Waldo everywhere? But Hills is there for the media every chance she gets what a trooper! I think I'll just leave my little dedication to her on my post... O, well done! I commend your pains; And every one shall share i' the gains: And now about the cauldron sing, Like elves and fairies in a ring, Enchanting all that you put in. ... By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes... (MacBeth, Act IV, Scene 1) Nothing says Hillary to me quite like something from a Shakespearean Tragedy!
