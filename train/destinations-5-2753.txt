Its an excellent city to visit and live in, unfortunately the people that visit and have complained never venture beyond Waikiki which is a tourist area. If you'd like to experience the city first hand you've got to get out and meet the people, do research on where to go and what to see besides the usual attractions theres so much to do and see and its so rich in culture and history it would be foolish to stay in Waikiki and not experience it. Obviously Honolulu is very urban and its that way because its the center of government, education, trade, technology, military, etc for the entire state so it should be expected, that upon arrival its not gonna be some place with a bunch of hula skirts and mai tais and no people for miles. My suggestion to the first time visitor is that you do research and dont spend all your time in Waikiki, meet people ask questions, and for goodness sakes dont do your shopping in Waikiki they'll rob you blind, there are places that you can find bargains...again it takes research and you can experience a whole different city you never thought existed. Funny thing is people think the city is just a touristy filled place yet most of the cities that the people are coming from recieve way more tourist than Honolulu and they don't even realize it. Peace.
