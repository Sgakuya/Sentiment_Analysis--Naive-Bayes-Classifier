What an overrated player. He may provide the fantasy stats, but he's a total overblown egomaniac who has delusions of grandeur. The media has trumped him up since day one, and Garnett is frustrated trying to live up to their expectations. The truth is that Garnett isn't really that good, nor has he had the desire to improve his gameplay and learn. Garnett is still as raw as the day he was drafted out of high school, and does not play intelligently. The same can be said of Lebron, who is definitely following the same path to mediocrity. Jermaine O'Neal, on the other hand, is different. While he opted for the draft out of high school, Jermaine has learned how to play intelligently in the NBA. He chooses his shots wisely, has learned to post up well and play as a team. Garnett thinks he can just overpower everyone, and that's why his Timberwolves empire predictably collapsed when Cassell and Spreewell decided to take a break. Garnett likes to believe he works harder than everyone else and deserves to be a champion, but I think he's a whiny blowhard. Take your superstar money and go on a hike, until you learn how to play smart NBA ball and not carry on that high school bull, you can forget living up to your ESPN dreams.
