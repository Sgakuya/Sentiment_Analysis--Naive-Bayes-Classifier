Newtie-baby has certainly been one of the more colorful Speakers of the House to come along in a long time. However, his assiduous ego, coupled by his refusal to compromise and work with Democrats as well as Re-smug-licans, worked against him and his cohorts (Armey, Paxon, DeLay, McIntosh, etc.) and prevented him from really being effective in any significance. In a collective of 535 congressional egos, it was Newtie-baby's that stood out the loudest. To have even a remote chance of passing significant legislation, backs must be scratched, and compromise must be reached. Newtie-baby's firebrand, take-no-prisoners approach did gain him status as a talking head on political talk shows but did very little to advance his con-smirk-ative crusade. His caustic demeanor and his reprehensible personal life (namely, he divorced his first wife while she was ill with cancer so he could pursue a career in politics, after she had unswervingly supported him all through his Ph.D. schooling at Emory University!)only served to increase my contempt for him and his bastardizing of the political system. Notice how Newtie-baby dropped out of sight after his fellow Re-smug-licans turned on him when the aborted coup-de-t'at took place? Methinks the Beltway blowhards won't be missing him except to get his opinions very now and then. I sure won't miss him. He and his Re-smug-lican ilk amuse me, despite their professions of compassion for the downtrodden, the poor, the racial and religious minorities, and so forth. Excuse me while I go play my Stradivarius.
