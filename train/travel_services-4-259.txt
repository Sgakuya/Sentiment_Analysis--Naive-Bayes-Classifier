Let's put it this way. Everyone ELSE is worse..including Southwest!! PROS: Probably the most caring and professional {US based, not outsourced!} reservation staff in the industry. They speak English and are actually educated, and yes they can say something besides "no" to a justified exception to a rule. [Just try that with any other airline.] Although that may change if the company starts laying off experience in favor of cheeeep dumb labor!!!! PROS: They'll get you where you're going, which is all they are supposed to do according to the Conditions of Carriage, yet when I fly, people are continually bellyaching about the stupidest things that don't come with the ticket.. Methinks the travelling public has been spoiled rotten. CONS: Flight attendants are legendary for their laziness. 50-50 chance you'll get a pre-departure drink in First Class, even though it is a service requirement. Same goes for a second beverage service or refill in coach, even on 2.5 hr flights.
