What director Michael Mann set out to do within the modest means available to him in this 1986 movie, based on Thomas Harris' best-selling thriller 'Red Dragon', was every bit as accomplished as what Jonathan Demme achieved in 1991 with 'The Silence of the Lambs', based on the same book, with Demme's more considerable resources and, for that very reason, perhaps 'Manhunter' merits reconsideration and more recognition. Arguably, perhaps Jodie Foster's vivid portrayal of 'Clarisse' in 'Silence of the Lambs' (in contrast to William Petersen's rather more conventional male investigator in 'Manhunter') is the improvement that puts Demme's movie on a higher level of utter dread and intimidation. Other than Mann's limited budget in 'Manhunter', however, the supporting cast acquits itself handsomely, from Joan Allen's compelling performance as the blind photo lab technician, to Tom Noonan's characterization of a dangerous and ultimately desperate soul. While Anthony Hopkins' admittedly stunning turn becomes a vivid case of extreme dementia, Brian Cox's considerably less guignolesque portrayal as Hannibal Lecter in 'Manhunter' cannot be easily dismissed. Mann's version bears repeated viewings and continues to reveal subtleties unsuspected, particularly regarding the protagonist's personal demons, which cannot be said to be the case with Foster's character. Eventually, Michael Mann's credentials after 'The Last of the Mohicans' in 1992 might have enabled him to re-make his early opus 'L. A. Takedown' with, again, a cast of unknowns, into the 1995 movie 'Heat' and, here, both versions of the same subject in the hands of the same artist merit comparison.
