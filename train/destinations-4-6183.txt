I lived in Michigan for 11 years and have been up to visit at least 10 times since then. I would never want to live in the lower part of the state-most of it I found flat and boring. I did enjoy the U.P. however. It's open country and beautiful peaceful beaches are wonderful. Anyone who's been there knows however that the lakes are way to cold, we would swim in the smaller lakes but the Great Lakes-brrrr. One year it didn't get above 0 in the entire month of January! And every year we were there we had snow-not always sticking but still snow every month of the year. We were at Van Ripper (sp) state park for the Forth of July and had to go home because it was so cold and there were flakes flying. I lived areound the Marquette, Gwinn, K.I. Sawyer area and found the people very freindly and welcoming. Maybe it was because of the air base, a lot of transplanted people. The taxes were high while I was there but I think the schools are better there, they were financed by property taxes. From what I hear the health care is better than where I am now-Indiana.Because of the long winters one of the biggest past times is drinking, bar hopping is common-esp. on snowmobiles. That's probably why most of the U.P. is over weight too. It's a nice place to visit but...
