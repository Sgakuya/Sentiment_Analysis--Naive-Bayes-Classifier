Oh My Gosh... i have no clue where to begin, not only are all their albums better than any other music i have ever heard. Gavin is the sexiest thing to walk this earth. I dont know why he wastes his time with a bitch like Gwen! Ok but bac to the band, i dont think they sound at all like Nirvana or that they ripped anyones sound off. Nirvana is one of my other fav. bands so i should know and i live in Seattle so i know the sound and they have ripped nobody from here off. They are talented, wonderful, perfect, unique, and all around great. They are my favorite band ever and screw you to anyone who thinks differently.
