people don't know what its like to be a d-rays fan. Its actually great. The expectations are so unbeliveably low that we had a parade for a 70-win season. But i have a feeling this team will come into it's own very, VERY soon. Carl Crawford is gonig to be one of the top players for many years, and BJ Upton should devolp into one of the best players in MLB history. We've had a history of being screwed over (Todd Hamilton, Jose Canseco) but if we just increase our payroll (we can do it if the owners stop being do greedy) to 50 mil, we can beat the yanks and sox, no doubt. Our team has more raw talent than a lot of squads, and Lou is one of the great managers of our time.
