 I'd love to get this to Jane Fonda.... Just A Guy... That's Me Just a guy, one ordinary man I guess, that's me Standing at the water's edge and looking out to sea Remembering the nights we crawled ashore upon the sand Fighting someone's wars in somewhere's far off distant land. We'd hear the voices of unseen, unknown foes hiding there We'd hunker down and shoot our bullets high into the air. And wait for a return, so we could pinpoint where they were And murder them with bombs or shells or something similar. On many a quiet night we'd sit and total up the score Of enemies we'd killed or badly maimed the day before. It never worked to try and drive the numbers from our minds; For every battle found us leaving many friends behind. The shooting we could tolerate, the stench of death at night Was not so bad, just memories of unimportant fights. So why then are there nightmares that stay with us till we die? I cannot shake the pictures of dead buddies, though I try. They gave their lives, they tell me, for their country brave men all. It always true that only do the bravest warriors fall. So we came home our duty done, and no on seemed to care, Years later now they say that war in 'Nam just wasn't fair. But none of them can know what hides within a soldier's heart Who wept beside his closest friend whose head was blown apart. They're quick to judge, these stay at homes, and tell us what to do But they will never know what Vietnam has put us through. I wish that I could stand in the water looking out to the sea And only see the wondrous things life has to offer me. But it was on land such as this that all that war took place. The screams of death imprinting memories I can't erase. And now I stand at water's edge and look out at the sea, And wonder why, of all the men who came home God chose me.
