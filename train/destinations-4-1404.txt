a continental point of view. Hy cowboys! as a half french/ half english student living in france, i'm amazed by the poor arguments around this post, from the pro france who see france as a postcard that limits itself to paris and from the anti who've never set foot on french soil or spoke to a single frenchman, is that all the fuss about being an american patriot, getting in a mood because we france didn't believe the crap about MDW (hey we're they main supplier, we know about their stocks!), clearly xenophobic about any country speaking out(F u fellow british citizens, cowards!). wy is france cristalysing all the anger coming from popular american frustrations? now dont get me wrong france is far (very far) from being an idilic country but so is america so is any other country. come anytime to my country, its honestly not as bad as you think it is bon baisers de france... PS:french chicks are very disciplined about their shaving
