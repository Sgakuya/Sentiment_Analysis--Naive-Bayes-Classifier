Wal-Mart was great when it first started now they have grown so large that theyare to big for their own good, and I have and see where they are on the track to financial trouble and all this after hurting so many small town/cities home business. Just like in Norman, Oklahoma they only needed one big super center but put two in and thinks look bad in Norman but then the City Government is Blind and has very little common sence so that is to be expected. Oh and if you are of the Middle-low to Low income bracket Senior or other wise Norman social lites and the city government do not want you to move here they only want Millionaires here and they do not like kids thats apperent when they make laws and how some of the Police do they kids they talk a good talk but will stab you in the back and the City council members do not care about the low-income folks.
