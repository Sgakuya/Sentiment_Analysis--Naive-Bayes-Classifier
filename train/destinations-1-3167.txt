toronto is garbage. gloomy skies. no beaches. no ocean no mountains no nature. just large buildings and horrible weather and long winters and lots of snow.it amazes me that people like this city. you want a city that has beauty and fun try Vancouver. Toronto also has alot of homeless people around and squeege kids.... the worst homeless problem in all of canada.Plus its also dirty and trashy... compared to Vancouver. (note i'am comparing Toronto to Vancouver). Anybody with a brain in their head would know that Vancouver is 100X better than Toronto. I'am glad i live as far away possible from toronto. 2010 Olympics and Junior Hockey Championships. wooo hooooo bring home the bacon mamma. Westsiiiiiiiiide.
