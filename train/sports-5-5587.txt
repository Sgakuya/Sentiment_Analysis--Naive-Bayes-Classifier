One last rating: I don't need to say it. Everybody knows. In fact, everybody watches like a hawk, mesmerized. I , well - 7 out of 8 yesterday, 19 points, I think 23 minutes. I have nothing against any other player, but ponder this: what are his numbers if he plays Hodge or Reddick minutes?- enough said. You know, I know, and you can bet your ass that NBA scouts know what we know. Look, a fan likes who he/she likes, I understand that. Hodge, Reddick, and many others are great, but if you think they can F with McCants, you're in denial, or you don't watch basketball. Think about this haters: the words of the great coach K, McCants can do what he wants, whenever he wants. GONE!.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UPDATE: does whatever the hell he wants. He literally says, hmm, I think I'll score now. AWESOME. I find it hard to visualize how awesome he'll be in the NBA, when the coach gives him the greenlight. And he only takes perfect shots! When he decides to shoot it, you can bet your life it's going in. He'll have like 20 on 7 shot attempts. I LOVE IT! Plus, he had two of the most beautiful blocks I have ever seen in my life tonight. Again, you know you're awesome, when you can decide - LITERALLY DECIDE- to take over a game. And whatta ya know, he didn't even rape any old ladies this week, or worship the devil!

Don't rush it though. We'll be allright. You just focus on getting well.
