As a resident of Houston, I really can give you a detailed analysis on this complicated city. As everyone knows, the humidity in the summer is horrible, and the city floods very often due to its low sea level. The traffic is also horrendus due to the neverending road construction plagueing the city. However, anyone who doubts this city's uniqueness and charm is smoking something. For one, we have the NASA Space Center. Then, we have the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a city tradition which has been going on for 70+ years. The Houston Zoo and Museum of Natural Science is definately a place worth visiting. We also boast a firstclass aquarium. As Texas's largest city, we are very much the center of capitalism- its very economically convienient to live here- many people flock here from Upstate New York and New England in search of betterpaying jobs. Its definately a place worth visiting once or twice just to experience Houston-a mixture of southern tradition, western culture and new age style.
