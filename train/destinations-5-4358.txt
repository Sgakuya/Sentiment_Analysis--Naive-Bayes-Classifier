I love LA. It's an EXCITING place. Sure it's not the cleanest place in terms of air quality, but I just get over that and enjoy the place. Besides, it's not like all the big cities of the world aren't going to be as smoggy as LA in a couple of years anyway. The key to LA is knowing where to go. You can't just drive around on the freeway and visit one or two famous streets and think you've seen LA (which is what most visitors do). And please don't think everyone in LA is a rude rich snob. If you come to LA determined to believe that all LA people are rude snobs, then that's what you'll get. Right now I'm in San Diego-or as I like to call it, dulls-ville, for college. I can't wait to go back to LA. One thing I notice about LA, is that people either love it or hate it. To hell with all the people who hate it. Sorry if I come across as a prick-I'm just sick of all the people who like to bash LA just because it's LA. Get past the stereotypes and you'll most likely find it's a cool place.
