I know this song very well. I was in Franc that hot summer when the song had blown Europe out of it's traditional cliches.It was great feeling to see young artist,Ricky Martin,to have such a huge hit in his own language,which most people around Europe don't speak.It's different to reach the top of the music scene with the song which doesn't uses english language,it's more difficult,and as I now Ricky Martin is from the Puerto Rico,small island in the middle of nowhere,no background of the big market at home.So it must be something special in his music and in him to reach to the top of the top of world music scene. Maria is the great song of the great artist.
