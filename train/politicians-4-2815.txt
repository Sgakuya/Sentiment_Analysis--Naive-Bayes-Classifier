I find it amusing that many who champion j.c. watts as a dynamic African-American leader cannot answer the question why Mr. Watts cannot win an election above Congressman, even though most of the voters in Oklahoma share his views ? Despite the hooplah oven Ken Hamblin, Armstrong Williams, Alan Keyes, Ezola Foster and others, I doubt that now or in the near future that a Black Conservative will hold any significant elected office in the Republican party. The only spots they will hold are appointed positions where they can easily be disposed of if they outlive their usefulness, or become an embarrassment. Remember Gary Franks ? Remember Alan Keyes 2 runs for president ? When a Black Conservatives can get elected to statewide office in large numbers then a new day will come.
