Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (released in 1982) is clearly the best of the Star Trek films which star the cast from the original television series (eg William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley). While the film suffers from weak dialogue at times, for the most part the screenplay is tight and effective. One comment describes the plot as Shakespearean, and I think that is a fair assessment as the direction from Nicholas Meyer of Star Trek II relies more on plot and intrigue (ie more guns, speed and color) rather than grandiose concepts and extended scenes that were often used for the preceding Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) (ie Star Trek I unsuccessfully tried to recreate the feel of 2001: A Space Odyssey.) Moreover, the acting was improved and the tie-in with an episode of the original TV series provided an interesting twist (though the movie easily stands on its own). As others have also noted, Ricardo Montalban's portrayal of Kahn is the glue that holds all the pieces together and also serves to keep Shatner's excesses to a minimum. The bottom line is that Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is well written, cast, and enjoyable to both science fiction purists and the casual viewer.
