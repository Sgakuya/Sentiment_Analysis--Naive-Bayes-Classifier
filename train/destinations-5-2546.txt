If your not a native of Hawaii you probably don't know much about it. I figured that sometime in my life I would get over there but it was never a burning desire. I finally made it this last summer. I could go on and on about all the details but instead of draw you a picture, I'll plant a seed. Imagine a place that has never got below freezing and never above 100 degrees. That's Maui, 24/7, before you were born, while you're growing up, while you're getting old, and after you are dead. It is the closest thing outdoors to a greenhouse. So pick an ocean and move it inside your favorite greenhouse and place the sky above. I fed a sparrow by hand outdoors. I think that's enough to describe it until you get there. Next time I want to go to Kauai. First time you should probably go to Maui. If you don't live there, it would probably take million$ to have enough travel experience to truly rate the islands. The few big secrets are: It is 'cheap' to get there and so, very, very, expensive to stay there. I am thoroughly convinced that most of the residents on the island that were not born there are from Wisconsin or Minnesota.
