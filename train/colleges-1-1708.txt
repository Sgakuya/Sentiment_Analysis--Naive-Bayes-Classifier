I transferred from a state school to NYU a year ago. I'm orginally from the city, so that part really is not that exciting. As a chemistry major, I had the pleasure of dealing with mediocre lab equipment, 1 or 2 hour waiting for the computer labs, grad students that spoke 2 words of english, professors that could care less and whose lectures had almost NOTHING to do with the material in the exams, and exponential grade curves that allowed me to get a C in physics by guessing every single question on all 5 exams. All for the low, low price of 40K a year. I'm getting the hell out of here before I too jump from a tall building like 6 other people have already done in the past year. Yeah...NYU sucks.
