We are new to WinCo and think it is a very good shopping option, however, we regularly use low fat cheeses. We find that WinCo does not offer any, so we have to return to our regular market near our home to get what we need. We also found that WinCo does not have carpet cleaner on the shelf. As I look over the shopping list I used today, I found four products not available at WinCo. I tried to e-mail WinCo about these ommissions, but their website does not offer a place to submit comments. I will continue to drive across town to shop at WinCo, and see if it proves to be worth my while.......but I can see that I will have to make a stop at my usual market for those things WinCo does not have for sale.
