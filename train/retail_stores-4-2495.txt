Safeway is a pretty nice grocery store. I like it because it seems to be one of the cleanest grocery stores out there, and the aisles are much wider than those at other stores, making the shopping experience much more pleasant. The Safeway Club card is really convenient to use and provides significant savings. I've always received excellent service at my local Safeway, and it seems to be managed very well. On the down side, the selection is not as wide as it is at other grocery stores, and you have to unpack your own cart and load your groceries onto the belt yourself (I'm whining, I know). For everyday-type grocery shopping, Safeway is a good bet.
