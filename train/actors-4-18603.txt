He deserves all the acclaim and credit there is for creating Star Wars. A brilliant trilogy for its time, it took the world by storm using visual effects and a story everyone could relate to. A man of obvious intelligence, he marketed a film that was a complete original, before and since, and made it into a huge franchise. However as director, its clear that Star Wars was his passion since he's only ventured from that arena on a few occasions. Honestly the only bad thing I can say about Lucas is his writing, the scripts have become horrendous on his latest films. Flat and unoriginal, the Star Wars prequel is dragging the original, superb work of Star Wars through the mud.
