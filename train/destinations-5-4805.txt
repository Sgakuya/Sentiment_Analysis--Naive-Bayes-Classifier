Quito offers an excellent excuse to take a vacation to paradise and enjoy life. Ecuador itself is a photogenic peaceful country rich in diverse habitats from coast to mountain tundra. The environment simply is the best. Ecuador has good infrastructure: new roadways and bridges, communication, general services and good medical services, and excellent international and local airport access. The city of Quito (elevation 2,700 meters above sea level) is a cultural center with some of the most interesting historical destinations in all of Latin America, but without big city confusion. Scenic Quito, with it's perpetual spring time climate and the Andean ambiance, is nestled in a valley of snow capped volcanos. This habitat harbors countless species of colorful birds and wild flowers yet maintains its deep picturesque culture. Old Town in Quito and the new Quito Zoo are must see points as well. The Banco Central Centro de Cultura (Cultural Exhibition) and the adjoining museum full of Inca gold and relics from the past simply leaves one in awe.Moreover, Quito, with one of Ecuaodor's two internatonal airports, is easy to access and even to navigate on foot. Taxis and trolly cars are abundant, secure and not expensive. There are some fine hotels withing walking distance of the show. Moreover Quito has many hotels which are not expensive, have restaurants and even steam baths and gyms inside and are located in secure areas. Great choice!!!
