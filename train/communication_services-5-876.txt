This company is GREAT!!! The customer service is awsome! It started when I shopped around for a cell phone in my local mall, Square one. I visited Bell World and they had me pick a number. I picked no. 179 and they were serving no. 15. (very poor). Then I went to Fido but all the service reps where busy looking for jobs somewhere else. (rats abandon ships). As for Rogers, I had to walk till the end of the parking lot, meet a guy who try to sell me a phone out of the trunk of his car. ( he told me that there were some legal issues pending and he was not allowed in the mall. ???) As for Telus, I was greeted with a green herbal tea and got a basic taste of yoga. ( the wait was about 15 mins but it passed quickly). Then the rep explained to me all the details that I have to consider before buying a cell phone. She was very objective and even gave me a tissue for my running nose. When I did pick a handset, she had it activated under 7 minutes, which is very fast. Over all the service was superb and never will I ever cross over to anyone else.
