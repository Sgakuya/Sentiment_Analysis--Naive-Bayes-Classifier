I worked for Wal-Mart for 10 years and if shoppers even knew half of what I know they would think twice..Yes prices are reasonable but do you shoppers know that alot of the merchandise you are buying are seconds.. Alot of the merchandise coming in is just tososed off the trucks and hope it works when you buy it..Greed is the only thing this company is interested in..MONEY MONEY MONEY..Have you noticed how it started out matching prices and now changed that policy and then how the customer is always right to now no refund unless it the way they think it should be..GREED GREED GREED there onnly concern is what comes into there pocket..But don't feel bad they treat there workers the same way...All for them and the hell with you...I KNOW Oh and to let you know I do not work there anymore I quit..When Mr.Walton died that is when it went all down hill.
