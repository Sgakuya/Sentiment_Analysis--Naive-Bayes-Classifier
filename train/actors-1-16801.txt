Ok people, this guy totally sucks! He is a perfectly good example of a waste of camera time when the airtime should be used on more talented actors and actresses who make days interesting. The guy cant act, and i really wish he would have that eye opereated on b/c it drives me nuts. I hate him. get him off the show. he looks like a freak as well. Oh my! I am too mean. I could go on and on about how much i dislike this character but I am sure a great majority feel the same way. Get the man off the air and let him free. He is making a fool of himself. Whenever his part of days is own i either light a cigarette or call somebody. The guy is the poster model for BORING!
