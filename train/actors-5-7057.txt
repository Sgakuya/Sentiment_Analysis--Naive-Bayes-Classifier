Wow. What better word to sum up Owen Wilson? He is an extremely funny, outragous actor. I love personally how he hasn't gotten his nose fixed just so he can be 'prettier'. Which personally, I think he already is attractive enough. But refusing to fix his nose just shows that he doesn't care what other people think of him. He is also a well rounded actor. His roles have been mainly comedies, but he was able to switch over to action in 'Behind Enemy Lines' quite well. I noticed as I read through the comments on Owen also that one person mentioned how he roles were not 'challenging'. I would like them to actually watch 'Behind Enemy Lines' the next time they see it and see how the action sequences are. I would then love to have the honor of watching them attempt to do these scenes as well as he did. Actors put a hell of a lot of effort into what they do, and though I do agree that some actors should never have become actors, I believe that Owen Wilson is a very talented actor and deserves to get some credit for what he is doing.
