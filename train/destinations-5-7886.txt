I have since moved from Chicago to Atlanta and have grown to appreciate more what Chicago had to offer. Our family would go down to the children's museum at least once a month, which was a good motivator to get us out into the city. It's located in a beautiful area on the lake. The exhibits have the best interaction I have seen and the staff is great with the children. There are good kid's restaurants and if you prefer sports bars in the mall the museum is located in. It's reasonably priced if you become a member. From there you can get out to other Chicago attractions. Take advantage of it while the kids are young or they will grow up not being very friendly to the city and all of the great culture that it offers.
