I bought my 19 GE television/VCR combo in 1998, when I was in the Army. I lived in the barracks and couldn't afford much more as a Private (E-1). Since purchasing it, I have moved with the Army, taking this TV up and down stairs and across the country wrapped in a blanket in the back of a pickup truck. Extreme temperature changes- from 115 degrees in Saudi to subzero temps in a snowstorm in Maine- have not effected this TV one iota. Short of kicking this thing down the stairs, I can't think of any other way to abuse it, and still no problems. I have played at least 2,000 movies in the VCR and never had a problem. The sound is adequate- although with a 19 television you won't be seated more than 10-12 feet away unless you've got binoculars. The durability of this television amazes me, and it is still going after 5 years of extremely rugged use and abuse. The VCR still works fine, no problems at all with that portion of the unit either. Basically, this television is as good as the day I bought it, aside from minor wear and tear and scratches. If you're looking for a DURABLE, tough TV, GE can't be beat. Highest recommendation.
