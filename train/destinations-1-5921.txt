brrrrrrr!!!!! alaska is the coldest state in the nation. worse than minnesota, worse than maine. many weirdos live in alaska, especially the north side in the desolate, depressing tundra where it always snows in july, also snows in june, snows in august, snows all year round and absolutely no greenery will grow in the permanently frozen ground. in fact, average july highs are in the mid 40s, and basically the only crop you'd ever get in your back yard garden is ice and snow. not to mention, if you go north of the arctic circle, not only do december, january, and february highs average around 30 below zero, but there is ZERO sunlight. not a single ray of light; it is continuous night all 24 hours a day. How depressing it must be!!!
