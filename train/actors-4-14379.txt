I liek Janeane very, very much. She's gone into a business that is very difficult for women, especally, and that's comedy. It's what I have ben trying to do for some years, and I can say tht it ain't an easy business.And becasueshe isn't a supermoel type, chances are she gets turned down for soemthings because of that. But I say she's done very well for a female comedian, and I do look up to her. And I think it's great that she didn't have to make herself a platinum blonde or lose 50 pounds just to be happy. She judt goes out there and is a great comedian. Hey, she was on SNL- to me that's pretty good proof.
