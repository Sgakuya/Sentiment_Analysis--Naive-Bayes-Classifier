The food is good and the quality is not in question, the employees that Subway tend to hire is. Perhaps it is simply the town I live in and the demographics reflect this. Here is a typical order at Subway: Welcome to Subway, can I take your order? Sure, I'll have a large number 2, wheat bread, Swiss cheese And what kind of bread is that? Wheat And what kind of cheese would you like? 'Swiss' (sigh) Sir, the next person will put all your veggies on OK.........................................................................What would you like on your sandwich? Everything except jalapenos, cucumbers and pepperchini's Would you like Pickles on that? yes, everything except jalapenos, cucumbers and pepperchini's Olives? YES, Everything except jalapenos, cucumbers and pepperchini's ( then the person proceeds to put jalapenos on my sandwich) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, EVERYTHING EXCEPT THIS, THIS AND THIS (I'm pointing to the jalapenos, cucumbers and pepperchini's). The reverse of this however is some listless fat blob that walks in hoping to come out looking more anorexic. They get up to the counter and ask, Well, what have you got? (The menu up on the wall rivals most Bill Boards on freeways). They engage the Subway employee with some useless talk about what's going on in there day while the line resembles something at Disneyland or the DMV in SanJose, CA. The employee is thinking, Gee wiz, I didn't know they made pants that big, he must have grabbed those off the wall at the GAP. Subway needs to be more efficient, run it like the Soup Nazi would, get people moving through the line and hire people that break a three digit IQ... PLEASE!!!! John Wilson Longview, WA.
