Once again I have been amazed by Hemingway's direct prose and captivating story. This is an excellent novel, not just for the story, but also because it has that classic Hemingway style. The war is illustrated just as plainly as the alcohol consumed and the relationships are as complex as they are intriging. But I am just left with that feeling that all tragic endings provoke that Where is that happy ending? sentiment. Yet I would not change any word in that book. My favorite literary quote is from that book Sweetheart, cherie, prenda, and schatz. He would trade them all for Maria. There was a name. With phrases like that I understand why he could be the womanizer that he reputation claims him to be.
