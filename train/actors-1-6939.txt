Damn, why can't you have 0 stars on these things. I really do not see the fuss about Josh Hartnett, he's made out to be some amazing looking guy who's such an incredible actor and all this. I for one, and going by these ratings, I might not be the only one, think that he's highly overrated. The guy isn't attractive and he's an average actor at best. The best movie I've seen him in was probably 'Black Hawk Down' and he was tolerable there because he didn't have a huge part, the special effects and storyline was good and he didn't say much he just ran around shooting people. If that is all he has to do, then yeah, he's alright. Otherwise the guy's acting is cringe-worthy.
