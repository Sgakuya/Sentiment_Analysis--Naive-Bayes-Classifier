Call me biased, but Indiana in general seems like a mistake, an afterthought of downstate Illinois or Ohio. Indianapolis is an up-and-coming city, though very suburban and bland; the Colts are the best thing worth mentioning here. Other cities and towns look depressed, insular, and boring: Gary looks particularly noxious, but if industrial landscapes are your bag then you're in heaven. Indiana has quite possibly the most boring terrain this side of Illinois, and the people aren't any more reassuring. Most of the people I've met and dealt with from Indiana were rude and obnoxious. The state's religious right-wing reactionary atmosphere doesn't help matters, and the fact that there's too much of an obsession with high school/college basketball to be consistent with good mental health makes for some scary combos.
