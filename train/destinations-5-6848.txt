I was born in Fargo, North Dakota and lived in a little town about fifty miles outside of Fargo for a few years. North Dakota is really a peaceful state, nobody is in a rush to get anywhere. The land is beautiful, and the people are really down to earth. I've been back four times in the last four years. Although it is cold in the winter, the summers can be very hot and humid. Even the bigger cities like Fargo and Bismarck seem like small towns compared to other big cities. But the small towns are the best...everybody knows everybody, it's really like a trip to Pleasantville (not to mention the great Norweigian accents!). I go for vacation, to relax and just take it easy. Besides, how many other states have a movie named after a city?
