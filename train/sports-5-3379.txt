A hard one to figure out. Yes, he was a great player. But he is definitely second-tier great. Shoeless Joe does not compare to Ruth, Cobb, or even Tony Gwynn for that matter. He never won an MVP award or even a single gem of the Triple Crown. He probably missed 4 years of productive play after getting banned from baseball, thus could have ammassed even more impressive numbers. But Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio also lost that many years fighting for our country. Jackson would easily be a Hall of Famer, had he not taken his 30 pieces of silver to throw the 1919 World Series. While Jackson steadfastly insisted he played hard in that series, then what does that make him, a double-double crosser I guess. Maybe one day, they'll open the doors of the Hall Fame for Shoeless Joe and fellow cheater Pete Rose. We can all hold our noses when they do.
