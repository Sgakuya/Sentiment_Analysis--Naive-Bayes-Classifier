Winco foods. Where shall I start, first with the clutter of items in the aisles seeming to be in a constant state of stocking shelves. The lack of checkers even in busy times. Or how about the neglect of the fact that customers have other things to do. Among my friends this store is a joke if you happen to mention going there they will laugh and ask how long it took. The produce and meat is usually poor at best and I would be scared to trust anything from the deli. My last experience soured me so badly that I will never shop there again despite the low prices which are the sole reason for the second star in my rating. As a side note if you are a union member you may not want to shop there considering they are the only grocer who doesn't use union employees.
