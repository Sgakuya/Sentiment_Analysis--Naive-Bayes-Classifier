Released in 1998, There's Something About Mary is what one would expect from the Farrelly brothers and Ben Stiller. The plot is simple, namely Ted Stroehmann (Stiller) meets a girl in high school, Mary Jenson (Cameron Diaz), but she moves away after a disastrous prom date. A decade or so later, Ted still cannot get Mary off of his mind, so he hires seedy private investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) who finds her in Miami but falls for her as well. Eventually, most every man who meets Mary is dangerously infatuated with her including a pizza delivery guy (Lee Evans), Ted's best friend (Chris Elliott), and Brett Favre. The comedy and situations in this film are extreme and often crude, yet somehow it works primarily because Ben Stiller can pull off a modern day Job suffering constant harm and bad luck, Diaz plays it so real and perfect, and Matt Dillon comes across as so genuinely unethical. The bottom line is that There's Something About Mary is not for everyone and certainly has mature themes and situations; however, for those who can appreciate a rare good movie with bathroom type humor, this film is a must see.
