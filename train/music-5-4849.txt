I was really surprised at some of the material Martina chose to include on her Greatest Hits album: rather than just her chart-toppers, she also included tracks that are fan favorites but were not released as singles (like Strangers ). She also threw in 4 new songs, which really serves as an incentive to fork over the money for the CD even if you already have all her previous stuff. And on the new stuff, her voice still doesn't disappoint, especially in the luminous Where Would You Be? and the hilarious When God-fearing Women Get the Blues . An especially nice addition is that Martina offers up some commentary in the album notes on each song: she gives a history of the song, how she discovered it, what made her want to perform it, and she even openly admits when some of the songs aren't her favorites . This collection is a must-have for McBride fans.
