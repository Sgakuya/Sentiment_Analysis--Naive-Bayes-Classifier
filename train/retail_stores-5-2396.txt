I think that, even though the company apparently has financial problems, they still strive to service the customer. As the case of the store in South Lyon, Mi. I came in the store looking to buy a table and chair set for our new home. I saw a sign, but didn't see any in stock. I then approached the manager Ryan, and inquired about the set. He very enthusiastically stated that they had more in the back, and he would be more than happy to get it for me. I wasn't exactly sure if I was going to buy it, and when he brought it out, I asked if I could look at all the parts first, before purchasing it. He said it was no problem, and proceeded to open the large box and show me all the parts and pieces, which appeared to be in good shape. I stated that I would buy it, and he personally (didn't pawn it off on another employee) carted it up to the front service counter, where he had the clerk at the desk ring it up (didn't have to wait in line). He then took it out for me, loaded it up in my truck, and asked if there was anything else he could help me with. It was truly a great experience, knowing store management cares about its customers. Farmer Jack will always be my supermarket of choice. (By the way, the outdoor set is working great for our yard!)
