i would easily say the fallout series is the best rpg games of all time, but you must admit that black isle put tones of work in they'r games, so i wouldn't go that far, but indeed this is one of the best rpg games ever created. the atmosphere is great, the gameplay is good too.. people complained about the turn based fighting but i like it, it adds some sophistication to the game. the game world is one of the best i've seen, it's allways interesting and allows great in game events. unfortunatly sometimes the game doesn't update itself right, for exemple in junktown you meet a boxer who tell you about his girlfreind, when you help the police fight a gang that atack the pub in which she work as a waitress she usually dies, but when you talk to the boxer the conversation doesn't change, and he talk to you like she's still akive. but anyway things like that doesn't heppen every second, and it works both ways cus it allows you to do everything you can in the game.
