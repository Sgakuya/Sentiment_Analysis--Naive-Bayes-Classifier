I don't even know where to begin with this review. I am not even sure how to rate it. As far as American Psycho's ability to disturb me, it definitely gets a 5 star. If it's purpose was to be so incredibly graphic and violent to make me physically cringe and literally cover my eyes, it acheived that goal. I am shocked to read one of the reviews here that says the movie did NOT portray some of the MOST disturbing scenes from the novel. I can't imagine it getting much sicker and more demented than watching Bateman put on his raincoat and pick up his shiny axe while his unsuspecting victim sits in his living room, in a chair covered with sheets over the floor that is covered with newspaper (for easy clean up)..the whole time, Bateman is explaining the wizardry and intelligence of Huey Lewis' Hip to be Square ..this movie made my brain hurt..However, as sick as it is, I enjoy being terrified..therefore I guess I have to say it was good. Entering the mind of this American Psycho trapped in the shallow world of yuppiedum in the '80s was definitely an....interesting? journey.
