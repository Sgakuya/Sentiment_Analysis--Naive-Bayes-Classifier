ok, im a canadain, Canada has lots of problems, one is the so many canadians are racist agianst the americans, i for one dont like that, but the beatiful landscape is amazing, also, health care is free and there fixing up the "wait for 8 moths" healthcare thing, the accents are not true, people made that up as a steriotype when they saw that on canadian show that came out a while ago, but i dont know any canadian who says eh more then some of my friends that live out in the U.S. also, its not that cold, its colder than the u.s. but not that much, we have almost the exact same culture as any city in Manhattan, washington D.C., or st. loius, but, uno just by reading some of these bad comentss about canada, ive never heard any canadian talk like that about america, some people like that one person who wanted to find out about canada really complementeed and made me feel a little better, but ok, what is really with some of you who can only talk about drunks, beer and the weather, uno wat i say, maybe we can hnd the enviroment better!!!!! MAYBE WE ARE JUST READY TO ACCEPT THE WEATHER!!!!!!!!! (okay, a little carried away there)
