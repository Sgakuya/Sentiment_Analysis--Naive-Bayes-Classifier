Vancouver is a lovely looking city, however it's quite small and if your not into nightlife much or outdoor recreational type activities, then it can end up feeling a bit cold and empty. It's not the easiest place to make friends, as is with most sprawled out cities, but the majority of people are very friendly although I wish the two prominent cultures, Asian and Caucasion would mix a little more. The only real drawback to Vancouver if you decide to come and live here, is that it can be quite a challenge finding even the most mundane jobs as there is a large number of unemployed skilled people and not enough jobs. Story of the west coast I guess so be prepared to have a thick skin if you don't land a job straight away. Other highlights are the food and weather. Yes I said weather, despite what you hear about the constant rain, it's actually no worse than England's and at least it isn't glooomy here when it does rain. It's milder aswell in winter.
