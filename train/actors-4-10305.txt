Granted, Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful and she's a very good actress, but I never remember being blown away by any of her performances. She always seems to do a good, but never great, job. I probably first saw her in Ladyhawke, where she did as well as she could, given the fact that she had to act opposite Rutger Hauer. But she certainly didn't turn in a breakthrough performance. Same deal with Scarface, Tequila Sunrise, Russia House, Fabulous Baker Boys, Dangerous Minds, Batman Returns, etc. And let's not forget she was in Grease 2. As pretty as she is, nobody who stars in Grease 2 deserves to be rated a 5 .
