Holy cow. What the heck do you guys expect for $3.99? I have visited probably 50 CiCi's (I travel alot) and as a whole, it's almost always great. The people are very friendly and the variety is incredible. If you don't see what you want, they will make it for you and actually bring it to your table at no extra charge in ten minutes or less. If the TV is too loud, I ask them to turn it down, and they do (I can't believe someone actually complained about that!) If I ask them to change the channel for my kids, the manager actually bring the remote to the table and lets the kids pick what they want to watch. WOW. To me, the service and the atmosphere was all a bonus. For $3.99, they could call me names and just throw pizza into a big trough and I would still wonder how they did it so inexpensively and stay in business. To the reviewers leaving critical remarks: What the hell do you expect for $3.99? The service, quality and value you receive at CiCi's FAR exceeds the miniscule price. Get a grip. For less than the price of value meal at McDonald's, you actually eat what you want, and all you want of it, and actually get a smile and some real service. Try getting that at McDonalds. CiCi's is awesome.
