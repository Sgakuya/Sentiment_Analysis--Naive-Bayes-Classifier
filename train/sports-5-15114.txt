His heyday is legend, but what sets him apart from other sports legends is his unflappable sticktoitness . I m a Raiders fan, and I also participate in fantasy football. I drafted Tim Brown as my token Raider receiver in 02, because I thought Rice was too old. The magnificent bastard did it! In 01 he just kept running the slant, but was more of a distraction than a target. In 02 it was like Gannon found him. Their chemistry was at times stunning! I revered Rice and I let my inner sports analyst steer me from what my heart knew was the right choice. He taught me a lesson. And what about his infectious positive attitude! I love Jer! He is truly Great.
