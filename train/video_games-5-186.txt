It took me a while to get into Duke Nukem because by now I was a responsible adult earning money in the real world so had less time to indulge in the artificial world of PC gaming. DN3D borrowed the Doom engine to produce a more tongue in cheek hero (Duke) who had an extended arsenal and a few comical quipps. The cartoon like atmousphere had a more amusing take on the depressing loneliness of the Doom world and gave a much lighter hearted play. It wasn't until I discovered the delights of online gaming when this really took off, for the first time I was making friends I had never met, winning games I didn't need shorts for then going to bed bleary eyed at 3am taking with me flash backs of shotgun hugging pigs and scantily clad lap dancers Shake it Baby .
