OK listen. I have worked at Chuck E. Cheese for almost 2 years now. Im 18 now and CEC was one of my favorite memories as a kid. Parents who cant let thier kids run around for a couple hours acting like a kid are SELFISH. Also I cant believe that we serve alcohol. Who is this resteraunt targeted at??? The store is very clean and the cast members work thier buts off to serve you cranky parents who dont even leave a tip. We get paid minimum wage to $7 an hour to baby sit your kids and your the ones complaining??? Your kids dream is to play his games, eat some pizza, and get enough tickets to get a prize. If you cant chip in an extra dollar for the kid to get 100 extra tickets, you deserve to hear your kid scream till you get home. Yeah, the food costs to much, but FYI its NOT frozen, it IS made in the kitchen and I think its great! SO if you dont like CEC, DONT GO!!! Have deprived kids and dont make the workers have a crapy day because you couldnt find the kid in you!
