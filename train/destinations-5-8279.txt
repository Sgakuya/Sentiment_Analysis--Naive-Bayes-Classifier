If you do a little advance planning, you can avoid most of the popular complaints about Disneyland. Last summer, mid-July, our longest wait in any line was 15 minutes at Small World, of all places. Don't plan to see it all in a day. It won't work. spend at least three days, and enjoy the time in lines, meeting new people etc. Don't worry about little ones enjoying the park. My 14 month old granddaughter had the time of her life - just make sure that you provide plenty of liquids, food, and, most important, nap time. I have read some complaints about the price of Disneyland. It will cost you as much or more to attend ONE L.A. Lakers game, or ONE L.A. Dodgers game as it will cost you for 5 days in Disneyland, if you do a little shopping, and advance planning. It is still the happiest place on earth! I can't wait to take my granchildren again!
