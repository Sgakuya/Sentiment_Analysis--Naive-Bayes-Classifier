I don't think Jesse Jackson is all that terrific, but some of the comments here sicken me. You really think that his life's work is invalidated because he owes it all to racial problems? That somehow he should be grateful to rich white oppressors for giving his life a purpose? Did the British deserve all the credit for everything Gandhi did? Was Nelson Mandela so indebted to apartheid in any way? Should women bow down to men daily and THANK them for letting them have equal rights? The main problem with this country is that everyone's opinions have equal weight, no matter how misguided or ignorant they may be. You don't actually have to know anything about a subject to have an opinion on it, and think that your opinion is just as valid as a Harvard professor's. Screw all of you.
