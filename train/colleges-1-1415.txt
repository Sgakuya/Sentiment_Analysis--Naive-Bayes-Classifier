Even though I am attending Newberry College, I wish I could change schools instead I am forced to stay here because of my parents. Personally, the school shows favortism to to a particular group of people which is the football team. Why is it the school and the community could pay for thier uniforms but not pay for those education students who are taking the Praxis for the first time and also repeating it untill they are done. I also feel, there should be a course for Praxis math, reading and writing because as you know there are other colleges and universities that pay for students Praxis and also have courses for math, reading, and writing. I feel since the tuition is a estimation of $24,000 the school could at lest do something. Also the school could at least fix up the classrooms because it looks like a mess. I'm tired of seeing the same-old tired ass rooms because it seems it was refurnished in the 1900's. It is time for a change and another thing is the tuition are becoming too expensive. Please stop raising the prices on the school because if you keep on raising the prices of the school alot of students will transfer or better yet not applied to the school at all.
