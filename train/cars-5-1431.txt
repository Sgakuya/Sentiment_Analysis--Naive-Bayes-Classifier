I test drove this car and bought it immediately after. I think it's a headturner (although according to some comments here, a negative type of headturner) but its looks are deceiving. A lot of head room, and the car is higher than most other sedans out there. And talk about great gas mileage! Probably the best of the non-hybrid sedans. I've only had one problem with it, and luckily it happened under warranty: The cable connecting the engine with the stick shift (I prefer stick shifts to auto transmissions) snapped a few winters ago, due to a sudden extreme change in temperature. The part had to come from Japan and it took a month to repair. But parts and labor were both covered, although I had to pay for a rental car (I'm still a little sore at the service center for not giving me a loaner just because I didn't buy it from the dealership that serviced it). But no problems other than that. Warning to those thinking about getting a stick shift, however: It does not change gears very easily. You may find yourself grinding them from time to time.
