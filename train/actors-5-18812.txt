I always praise director's who write their own material as there are few directors in this business that fail to adapt a novel to film successfully. As depressing as this may sound, M. Night Shyamalan is one of those directors thats not going to be fully appreciated for his talent until he dies or even fifty years from now. He reminds me so much of Alfred Hitchcock whose work was also not fully appreciated during the time he was alive. Both directors work ethics are similar in terms of choice for the thriller movie genre and writing and directing their own material. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan doesn't write for the critics or anyone else but the ticket buying public. Shyamalans audiences are always divided, which to me shows someone whose aim is to entertain and question topics put forward. I may not like all his films, but I think hes a brilliant director whose movies are going to be remembered for many, many years.
