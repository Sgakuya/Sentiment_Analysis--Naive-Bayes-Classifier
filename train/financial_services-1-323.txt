I was a long time Capital One customer, and always held a balance on my card. I never been late on payments or went over the limit. Well anyway I just noticed my apr went from 9.9% to 12.2% 2 months back without any notice. Once I found out their was nothing they would be able to do to keep me as a customer. So I call them to close the account, and the sales rep tells me that I have a small balance and the increase isn't that much and to sit on it for a couple of month because it will go back down(YEAH RIGHT!). Then he proceeds to tell me how excellent of a customer I've been. (so excellent that they try to sneak a rate hike past me because I averaged a $1800 balance since I owned the card) Anyway I payed off and closed the account.. HAHA CAPITAL ONE WHO IS THS SUCKER NOW! Basicly what they do is scan the accounts of customers and based on research they raise the rates of customers who they think will most likly let it slide or have no other option then to take the hit.
