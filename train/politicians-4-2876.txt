Here's a guy with political guts and intelligence. I find it hysterical that the rightwing droolers place a high premium on Men of Principle, yet condemned this guy resoundingly when he had the audacity to exercise principle that was contrary to the knee-jerk Official Party Line. Finally, a Republican who placed the needs of the commonweal above the tainted and ill-advised ideology of his mentally retarded political party and did the right thing by bolting!!! Very refreshing and reassuring that there's at least one former Republican in that self-important yet impotent august body of the Senate who thinks pragmatically and is evidently more concerned with the problems of this country than protecting the political turf of that conspiracy against the people known as the GOP.
