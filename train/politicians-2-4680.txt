Cheney is intelligent,experienced and knowledgeable, but displays poor ethics and insults the intelligence of the American people. This business of refusing to disclose details of meetings with Enron because it would supposedly prevent future V.P.s from receivng unvarnished advice is disingenuous, spurious and just plain LAME! The government pays experts to give him advice on the record and there are outside experts who would line up to bend his ear. When Enron gives Cheney and his party over a million dollars, then gets an energy policy that looks like their wish list, and a V.P. who acts as their international collection agency, influence has been BOUGHT. When there is evidence of fraud, everyone involved needs to be accountable for the related actions they have taken.
