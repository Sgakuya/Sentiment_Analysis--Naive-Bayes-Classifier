Let's see; a city with clean, crisp air, very little crime, on the rise in every category used to measure the over-all growth and health of a city. What's it all mean? It's means that Anchorage is a great place to live, work, and raise a family. Good wages, great people and pristine scenery and economic well being too boot! The only down sides are the weather in the winter, although winters on the east coast and mid west can be just as bad, if not sometimes worse due to the moderating affects the ocean has on the cities weather, the distance you need to travel to go to other US destinations, it's s minimum 10 hour trip to get anywhere on the east coast and 5-8 hours for west coast destinations and lastly, no pro sports teams and no chance in he11 of ever getting one. Overall, I'd move back to Anchorage if the situation ever presented itself.
