The WRX STi is the best car out there for the money. $10.00 per horsepower is nothing to sneeze at, and the fact that an average Joe can purchase a street-legal rally car for 30 grand is stunning. For those of you who are a little slow at math, $10.00 per horsepower is 300 horsepower for $30,000. Like I said, nothing to sneeze at. With Mitsubishi's Evo VIII here in the states (finally) as well, there is a new pony-car war. There are some other cars in this comparo that are a lot better than this measly 4-banger 4-door, but those other cars are also A LOT more expensive than the WRX STi. This means that for half or a third of the price of a supercar, you can have your own limited quantity supercar that can hold its own and still seat 4 people comfortably.
