The best President of my life time as well as the 20th Century. Some people have the misconception that Reagan borrowed more money than anyother President. When adjusted for inflation, his borrowing was a about the same amount of the GDP as most other Presidents. Also, the claim that Reagan was only for the top 2% of our economic structure, that is a bunch of liberal lies. You want proof? More people became Millionaires (who were previously in the lower 50% of our economic structure) than under any other President. Maybe if you think that he was only for the rich because so many became rich during his Presidency, that would be so. And, finally, the liberals need to face the facts. Under Ronald Reagan and his tax CUTs, the amount of money flowing into the government doubled. That's right. Federal Revenues went from $580 billion under Carter's last year to over $1 TRILLION under Reagan!!! So, he doubled the amount of Federal Revenue and Congress raised spending $1.25 for ever $1 of new revenue and the deficit is Reagan's fault(?). I don't think so. Face facts. This is the best President in our lifetime.
