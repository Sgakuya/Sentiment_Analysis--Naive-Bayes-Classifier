One of the best ways to rate Reagan is to compare what this country was facing before he took office to when he left. Instead of being sheepish as we did under Carter, he made us proud to be an American. For those who care about our great nation, that is big stuff. Those who favor a view such as smileysmile - that he gave us the AIDS and the crack-cocaine epidemics, one can only hope that George W Bush can fix our education system. He put us back on track by fixing what was broke, and restoring our national strength. Forget about inflation - without his leadership we were back in another depression. God bless him.
