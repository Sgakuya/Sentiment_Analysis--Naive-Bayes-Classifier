A good movie. A true story about a man named Christy who has cerebal palsy. At first no one knows what Christy is capable of.he does not talk and cannot walk, he has to be carried everywhere. when he is around 7 or 8 he proves he is capable of a lot when he prints out mother with his left foot with some soot on the floor. from then on they get Christy all the help he needs. He goes on to be an artist drawing pictures with his left foot.Daniel Day Lewis does a nice job as Christy as an adult. also the little boy who plays Christy as a child does a very good job. This movie was better than I thought it would be.
