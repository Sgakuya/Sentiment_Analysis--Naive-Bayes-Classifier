I hired two small men from prince george to vancouver. they arrived on time, the movers worked swiftly and efficiently. when my boxes arrived, i noticed 1 box was missing. i called tom in prince george and he gave me to his secretary who promptly took my name and address. she called me the next day appologizing for the mistake and told me she had put the box on the bus that day. sure enough..my box arrived, prepaid, and in great condition. thank you so much for remembering that the customer is always right. i wish i knew that secretarys name....i would have liked to thank her for putting my needs on her priority list. thanks again!
