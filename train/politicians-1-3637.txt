George Bush has won the election and half of the american citizens are to blame. How a crooked politician like Bush Jr. could have won is beyond me but that was what the american people chose. Did they ever consider Bush's environmental record? no. Did they know that he has one of the worst environmental record of any politician in the usa? no. Because of Bush, Denver is now the smog capital of the world exceeding the levels of Los Angeles. The National Artic Refuge is now threatened because Bush wants to open it up for drilling. And u know what? He is using the current electricity crisis in the west as an excuse to open up one of the last pristine wilderness areas in the name of oil. But the fact to the matter is that this oil will not reach the consumer market for another ten years! And he has proven that he will always be on the side of the miners, oil drillers and loggers. And America is already the most pollutive country on earth. Now it is too late because George Bush has already won. This year the will of the people has produced what is almost certainly going to turn out to be one of the most un environmentally friendly governments in US history. Is that really something to be proud of?
