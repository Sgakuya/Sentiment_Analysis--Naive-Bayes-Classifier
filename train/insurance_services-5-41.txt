Hit a deer and had to file a comp. claim with Progressive. They totaled my car, which was a 3.5 year old Saturn SL1, but gave me a very fair settlement and didn't hike my premium at its renewal. A lot of people rating these insurance companies don't realize that they are essentially paying for protection from serious liability, not a few hundred dollars here-and-there. The moral of the story: Sh** happens - don't get pissed when you have to pay a couple hundred dollars out of your own pocket after totaling a car. Just be glad you're okay and don't owe $100,000 to someone. Progressive is a great company if you're a safe driver because their rates are low. If you drive like an idiot, you may be better off with some of the other insurance companies that subsidize policies for idiot drivers by hiking premiums for safe drivers. Actually, you are probably best off learning to drive, but that's another argument.
