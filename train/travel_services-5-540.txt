What a great airport!!! Reminds me of the ease of John Wayne Airport in Orange County. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful! Their security section guarantees 15 minutes or less because they are way overstaffed. After getting thru security, you take a monorail to the gate you need. I got to the airport 2 hours early because I am accustomed to the LX security hassle....here I ended up waiting 1 hr 45 minutes for my airline in front of the gate because the process was so fast and efficient, and the gate was so easy to find. Actually, I waited 3 hours 45 minutes, because my plane was 2 hours late...but that's a whole other rating for a bad airline. Better airport than LAX!!!
