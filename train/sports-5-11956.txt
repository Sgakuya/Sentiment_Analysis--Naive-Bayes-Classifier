Each of my first three years at the University of Michigan, we lost to the jackasses at Notre Dame. It was really, really frustrating. So by the time my senior year rolled around (1992), it was very important for me to see our team teach the Irish a lesson. The game turned out to be really close, and late in the 2nd half it still could have gone either way. We needed a touchdown, and Desmond answered the challenge. We were at Notre Dame's 20 or 30 yard line, and Elvis Grbac tossed a floater into the right corner of the end zone. I was sure Elvis overthrew it, but Desmond accelerated with an unbelievable burst of speed and layed himself out for a diving catch, basically sealing the win for us. Without Desmond, I'm convinced we would have lost that game, along with a couple others that season. He did what great players do: deliver big in big games. Desmond definitely deserved the Heisman that year, and he deserves to be ranked among the top college players ever.
