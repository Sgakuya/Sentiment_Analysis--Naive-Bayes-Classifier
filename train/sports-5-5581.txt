Ok now... I met carolina bball team and spent most of the day with them on tuesday... and i just want to say that if any one thinks that those guys are stuck on them selves then y'all need to think again.. I have never seen young guys that are as nice and respectful as they were. they took time out of there stressful finial four week to talk to us and take pics., eat lunch with us, and invite us to a live interview session. Even the Freshman Marvin and Quinton were so nice they were like pros with the whole fan thing.. and if ne one wants to say ne thing bad about McCants dont say it to me.. He has been through a lot with his mother and her having breast cancer.. and his sister she is going to be a unc next year playing for the girls bball team and she is just as good as he is if not better.. and i think that if he were to go pro next year then the tarheel team would not be as good as they are this year! Go heels win that national championship!
