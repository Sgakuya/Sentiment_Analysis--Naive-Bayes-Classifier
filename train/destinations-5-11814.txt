The best zoo/aquarium attraction I've ever been to, it is a HUGE zoo with beautiful exhibits for their animals. If you like zoos, this trip can be an all-day affair, there's just that much to see. Easy to get to (there's a nearby Metro stop, use the Red Line, though it takes a bit of walking to get to the zoo. But, since you're going to the zoo, I guess you'll be expecting to walk, anyway). They have their well-loved Giant Panda exhibit, currently housing Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, their female and male pandas. Their elephant house showcases their baby elephant Kandula (he's REALLY adorable); the small mammal house is mostly Golden Lion Tamarins (which is nice, but I was hoping they'd have a wider variety); The Reptile Discovery Center was probably my favorite indoor exhibit, with a GREAT variety of snakes, turtles, tortises and other creatures with a wealth of informative, interactive displays. The Think Tank was excellent, too, posing the question Do Animals Think? . I was looking forward to the Amazonia exhibit, located in the back of the zoo, but they were closed when I got there. The indoor/outdoor Bird House and flight exhibit were excellent as well, the exhibits were beautiful. The bat cave was pretty neat, too. The only gripe I had, which hopefully they'll remedy as they get more funding, is the Great Ape House, whose inhabitants looked overall terribly unhappy and quite aware of their status as a captive animal. Hopefully, the Smithsonian will improve their exhibit in the near future. Overall, I feel that this is the best zoo I've ever been to, and my favorite Smithsonian attraction in the DC area. Admission is free, Food is a bit on the expensive side (not unusual for a zoo, though), and be prepared for a LONG walk. http://natzoo.si.edu for more information.
