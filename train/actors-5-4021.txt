Ralph Fiennes is one of the greatest actors in this, or any generation! Not only does he excel in theater (which is where he started out), but he has proven himself a magnetic film presence. I first heard of him six years ago when I was a sophomore in high school. My English teacher at the time came into class GUSHING about this production of Hamlet she had seen the night before on Broadway, and of the actor who played the lead role - whose name, she said, was Rafe Fines . So I looked at the Playbill she handed me and said Well, if Rafe Fines played Hamlet, who's this Ralph Fi - en - es in the program? And the curiosity about him never stopped! :) I saw him first in the film Quiz Show and then in Schindler's List - both on video, and I was FLOORED. I was amazed both by his fabulous performance in both films, and by how DIFFERENT the characters were and how talented one has to be to pull off roles that different effectively. But THIS year was when I TRULY learned to appreciate Ralph Fiennes. I had the pleasure of seeing him in London in Richard II , and here in NY at the Brooklyn Academy of Music doing Coriolanus . Both performances were BREATHTAKING! His true home IS on the Shakespearean stage! He speaks the language as if that's the only way he can express himself, and he makes it so clear and natural in a way that few actors do. He is a gift to the stage! I've had the pleasure of meeting him twice, and he's also a really nice, and polite person. Even when he's visibly tired after a play or event, he talks to you with a smile and would never yell at you for coming up to him.
