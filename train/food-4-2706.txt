Sometimes, you just wanna put away all the flavor combinations and get back to basics, and the Symphony bar is a good place to start. As it's a Hershey product, expect a darker look and texture (the red-and-white wrapper Nestle's bar is milkier and has a quicker melt time), along with a sweeter aftertaste. Go with the standard-size offering (a Big Bar in one sitting is insulin-damaging even for the most devoted of chocoholics), and try not to drink anything carbonated with them (you'll end up with a muddy sludge that won't brush off your tongue). I enjoy the Symphony bars in place of the basic-black Hershey bar for its softer crumble and silky-smooth character. A change-of-pace treat that caters to the reserved side of indulgence.
