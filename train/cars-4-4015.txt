Trusty Trooper as I call it. 89 Trooper with pitifully small 4cyl barely makes it up to the mountains. Once it gets there its another story. Handles great off-road and often passes the fancier luxery SUVs on the mountain trails when the going gets tough. Then again, even I have had to pass on some of the more serious 4WD Jeep trails. Power more than adequate in low 4X4. Like riding in a wooden roller-coaster though as you feel every little rock. It rides like an old truck! Has too much windage and can be challenge driving in high cross-winds. Gets almost 20mpg on highway. 4 stars because little time in shop (excluding dealer mistakes), very reliable, simple, and a frame built to last. Boy, I would die for another 50hp and less windage(hence the missing 5th star).
