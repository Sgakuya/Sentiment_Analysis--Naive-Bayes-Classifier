Bonds has won 3 MVPs and should have won a 4th over Terry Pendleton(go compare the numbers that year). He has a shelf full of Gold Gloves. He's the only guy to hit 400 HR and steal 400 bases. He's about to reach 500/500. This late in his career he almost won another MVP in 2000. Stats verify that he was the best player of the 90's. Everyone faults him because of his image, which I'll admit was his own fault, but they're judging him from comments made early in his career. He hasn't said anything awful in several years. Just think, the Braves refused a trade offer by the Pirates at the beginning of his career. Why? They didn't want to part with SS Andres Thomas! Who? My point exactly. He will be looked upon as one of the 10 or 15 best in history once enough time has elapsed to where his arrogance isn't being evaluated.
