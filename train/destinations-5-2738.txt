Honolulu is a great place to visit...and I would not mind living here. In fact I plan on moving to Oahu in the near future! The beaches on Oahu are nice...not that nice as opposed to Tahiti, Western Samoa or some of the beaches on the Carribean Islands....but better than what I've seen in places like So. Calif. The locals here are very friendly...neighbors have parties with one another...just a "wow" factor for me! Crime rate here isn't as high as opposed to other big cities on the continental mainland. I guess the high cost of living in Hawaii prevents ghetto people from living here. Nevertheless, Honolulu has its problems when it comes to homeless people...bums...etc. I also heard the public school system here is a joke...but I could care less as I've already graduated from college and am in grad school right now. If you're looking for more of a "paradise" vacationing spot, you should check out Maui, Kauai or the Big Island...as those islands aren't as "urbanized" as Oahu.
