I am not from Montreal, but it is a baseball town, they outdrew the Yankees for several years even. The problems only started in 1994, the team was full of young talent and in first place. then the season ended due to the strike, same as it did last time the expos were in contention in 1981, but this time it was different, the fall classic was canceled for the first time in 90 years, the Expos lost so much money because of the strike they had to dump payroll, this would come back to haunt them later. Attendance was still at an acceptable leval at an abysmal stadium that turned out to be a $2 billion white elephant. When Jeff Loria bought the team in the late 90s he raised payroll, and begged the financially strapped city for a stadium. Montreal agreed to build a stadium and when it came to sign the papers Loria pushed back from the table citing the absence of a retractable roof, which the city could not afford to pay for,and the team didnt want to pay for. Loria then began cutting media contracts so you could no longer watch the Expos on local TV, many believe he was scuddleing the team in preperation to move them but never got the chance, he then sold the team to the league for contraction, still the Expos finished in the middle of the pack, then the league decided to have the team play some home games in Puerto Rico, this extended travel schedule burnt out the Expos players and forced them out of contension for the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The fact that the fate of the team has been in limbo for the past 3 seasons has driven off all the fans who didnt leave after the strike, loss of players, bad ownership, and threats of contraction. All in all the Expos fans were hosed, they were screwed over big and the Expos deserve another shot in Montreal.
