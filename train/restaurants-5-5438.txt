UPDATE!!!!!! I just went to the new Ryan's in south side of Parkersburg and they were much more impressive than the one in marietta! I like the fact they have steak every day! also they have a better concept so far as layout and design of the building. I found it kinda interesting! The only complaint I had was the dryness of the meat... it was a tad too dry but the steak tasted great but not as juicy as ponderosa's. My mom did not like the bread pudding as good as the one in marietta. it was too hard for her to even put on her plate.It was sure busy that day and they were good in keeping us refilled with our drinks... they could have had bus boys doing the table clearing and the more waitresses on the floor with orders and such.This one had more cold foods then warm foods and had more salady things. It also had more different selections then the one in marietta I love the vareity there and it's just under 9 buckaroos! not bad considering most of these places only give you a little meal for 10bucks or more. the atmo-sphere is ok, but could get crowded at times, espaccaily 'round the holidays and mother's and grand-parents day. one time we wated almost 2 hours to get seated and it was really crowded and I got sick from all the crowds so I went back in the car and listened to the radio.the next time we were there wasn't too bad, just the sunday dinner crowd, not too bad. and their food is good too. I like thier mashed potaoes and thier roast beef and turkey. Thier chicken is good too. I always get several plates of food thier because thier mega bar is all you can eat so I always fill myself to the brim. For my family (about 5-7 people) would top off to be around $45-60. I like eating there and it's a good value. Thier are second in this class topped by USA STEAKS. USA steaks does have the drinks included and they are about $10-15 cheaper. I'd say I'd give them 4.7 stars. Rating improves some!
