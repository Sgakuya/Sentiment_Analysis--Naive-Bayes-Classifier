Beautiful airport on the outside. Extremely confusing to navigate on the inside. Security is a little lacking, so be prepared to wait up to an hour sometimes. The subways are little confusing, and they hardly give you an opportunity to walk out the door to find your gate. At a stop, I once got smashed by a closing door, because I didn't sprint out of the door fast enough....beware senior citizens or disabled persons. You might keep riding the subway back and forth because it is almost impossible to get off the thing. Oh...one more thing....they practically strip search you here, so be prepared to be wearing a bathing suit and sandals when you go thru security. Every guy had to take off several pieces of clothing and their shoes to get through security....and they give you nothing to sit on when you need to get dressed in a hurry to catch your flight.
