This game has really good graphics, goes on a lot of computers, but is so **** hard. I am a very patient and non-tempered person, BUT THIS GAME's HARDNESS LEVELS ARE REDICULOUS. i cant tell you how many times ive screamed at the top of my lungs in frustrationand how many band-aids ive used up from punching stuff in frusteration. Sometimes it takes me 2 hours to beat 1 RACE. guah-makes me mad just thinking about it. If i could talk to the **** idiots that made the difficulty levels(which there are no diffenrences in them) i wouldnt talk to them, i would stomp their faces in. Why did they have to make a cool game So hard? this game would be da-bomb if it wasnt soooo hard and frusterating. i have given it a 5* rating because of the awesome graphics, cool music, and awesome cars and realism, BUT IT IS SOOO HARD!!!!!!!! 2 WEEKS LATER: I just finished snapping the CD for this game in half and stomping on it because it was so hard. I also changed my rating from good to bad. DONT BUY THIS EXTREMELY HARD *#@% game.
