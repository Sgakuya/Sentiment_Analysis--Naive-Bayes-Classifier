Very cunning General. Not trustworthy. Talks very sweet on the outside. He is certainly helping us because of fear/aid. But who knows what he is actually doing behind the doors. One day he says there are no terrorists in pakistan. Later he says Osama might be there. He was the one who helped Taliban and terrorists establish base in afghanistan. Fearing our backlash, he changed his support. VERY CUNNING MILITARY RULER. THE LATEST NEWS IS THAT HE PAID $16 in taxes while eating up public money. Not sure where our aid is spent on. If it is spent on guns/weapons, we need to have a strict mechanism to monitor about controls..
