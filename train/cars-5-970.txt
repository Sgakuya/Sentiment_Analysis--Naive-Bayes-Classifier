I have a 2001 Honda Accord EX Sedan that I picked up a few months ago. It handles well, has a smooth ride, and offers plenty of interior space for passengers. There are many reasons to buy an Accord, but economics is definitely one of the most compelling. In terms of value for the money, the Accord wins hands down. The total cost of ownership is one of the lowest (repairs, service, maintenance), it retains its value longer than other models (less depreciation over time), and it is fuel efficient. It may not be the flashiest car out there, but then you can always fork over $85,000 and get the Acura NSX if style is important to you.
