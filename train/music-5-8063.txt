I recently purchased Bjork's Volumen video collection on DVD because the few Bjork videos I had seen were some of the most creative pieces of work I had ever witnessed. And Spike Jonze is always up to the task of creating something unique and thought-provoking or just damn hilarious. Sometimes all of these. It's Oh So Quiet is no exception. Sure, it's a few years old, but I had not seen this until a few months ago, and my god, what a refreshing change from the horribly driven-into-the-ground, formulaic rap-pop aesthetic. You won't find a bunch of street trash bragging about their gold-plated Hummers while they smoke blunts wrapped in hundred dollar bills here. Now while there is a dance sequence in this video, which is something that would ordinarily irritate me to no end, it's done well and for dramatic purposes, something a little bit more meaningful than the typical choreographed eye candy requirement that is so commonplace in today's shallow, mass-produced sugar pop (crap).
