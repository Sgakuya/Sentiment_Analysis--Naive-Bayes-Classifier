Anyone who's ever been to Budapest will attest to its magnificent buildings and show-off atmosphere.. Sit atop the Fisherman's Bastillon (halaszbastya) with the graceful Danube (if polluted) far underneath and you feel yourself becoming one with history. It's hard to imagine that now such a small impoverished, used-and-abused, mistreated (ussr), betrayed (us) country was once a powerful menace ravaging Europe.. as well as one of the centers for the humanitie sin the middle ages. (kinsg Matthias) Hungary is also nothing like its neighbours. That is why the West (especially the french) has alway misread, misrepresented the country and its people. ALL Western accounts of H. have been superficial at best, and mostly wrong anyway. The language itself has unknown origins and does not resemble slavic nor any other neighbouring languages. If you take the time, and see for yourself, you will see, how we are. that is why, when you sit atop the Bastillon, you will feel as if you were visiting with friendly aliens.. (watch your belongings though--ukranian maffia rampant)
