St. Lucia has a lot of natural attractions. The beaches aren't anything out of this world, especially compared to some that you'll find in the Bahamas, Cuba and Hispaniola. But still it makes up for it in natural attractions. You've got to see the Piton's, two moutains which go straight from the sea up to 2,000 feet, the world's only drive in volcano, which smells a lot like sulfur to me, probably because it's still active. Interesting that you can drive straight into the active area. Maginot Bay is one of the nicest inlets in the Caribbean, got to see this. Lots of waterfalls and interesting hiking. The capital of Castries is nothing really special. See the countryside to get a vantage point of the island. If beaches are what you're looking for, go elsewhere.
