VCU is one of the countries top ranking academic public universities. The belief that VCU is nothing more than an arts school is just a plain lack of knowledge for the person who believes that. Among others you can obtain degrees in Criminal Justice, Forensic Science, Bioinformatics, all Sciences, Engineering as well as hundreds of other degrees ranging from BS to post doctorate. The bums mention by another poster are not ON campus because VCU houses its own police department and they do not allow panhandlers to roam the campus. There are of course a few homeless people on the outskirts of the campus which lies in the largest economic and financial spot in the entire state. VCU has wonderful professors, interested advisors and manages to give out one on one attention even with a standard 26,000 students per year (and rising). There is a huge array of volunteer opportunities that help the student learn as well as help younger children in local public schools that need help. VCU also has the largest student organization base of any school in the state. The basketball and soccer teams are championship level and the general attitude amoung all students is respect and kindness. Surrounded by beautiful architecture and history everywhere VCU is the only college or university in Virginia that boasts both a historical element and a huge grasp on the future.
