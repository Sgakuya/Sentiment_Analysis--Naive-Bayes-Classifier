This movie is worth watching for its extreme cheesiness and hilarious action moves alone. The show is one unbelievable scene after the next, with lots of really bad dialogue, terrible acting, and ridiculous action moves. Tom Cruise is constantly rolling over and over on the ground in an attempt to escape the bad guys and, so it appears, just for fun. There is only one woman in the entire movie, and she looks to be around 15 years old and so top heavy I'm surprised she didn't topple over on several occasions. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie because it made me laugh the whole way through. If you're in the mood for something totally mindless, silly and easy to ridicule, rent MI2.
