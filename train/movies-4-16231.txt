For better or for worse, Unbreakable is lacking in a couple of key elements of a Blockbuster. There are few explosions. There is no sex. There are no clever one liners. It does not have a feel good Hollywood ending. If these things are important to you, you are probably better off going to see Vertical Limit. What Unbreakable does offer however, is an ambitious story line, in which heroes are flawed and villains are likable. The director forces you to follow the uncomfortable storyline with intelligent conversation between the movies' excellent actors. Much is left to the audiences' imagination - despite numerous opportunities for graphic violence, the director shows restraint and encourages you to come to your own conclusions. While the movie does have its slow parts, it is intelligent and haunting. If you are not expecting an Armageddon type movie, I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this film.
