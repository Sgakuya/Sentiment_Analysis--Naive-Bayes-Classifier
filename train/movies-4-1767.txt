From Russia With Love was the second film in the James Bond series (released in 1963), and while the movie is enjoyable and introduces some additional elements that became staples for the franchise, Russia just is not as good as its predecessor Dr. No (1962), its immediate successor Goldfinger (1964), or many of the non-Bond films on this list. For starters, the music (ie the theme song) just does not hold up when compared to how the series developed. Call me sexist (of course the series is a bit sexist anyway), but the Bond theme songs work best with a female artist (with the notable exceptions of Thunderball, Live And Let Die, and A View To A Kill). Secondly, the film resurrects the same bad guys (SPECTRE) that was used in Dr. No. While I did not want Bond chasing the Russians every time out (during the Cold War), chasing SPECTRE agents for two consecutive films does not cut the mustard either. On the plus side, Q makes his first appearance, and Robert Shaw is one of the better talents to play a villain in the entire series. Unfortunately, Bond has little interaction with Shaw as the latter is mostly shadowing Bond throughout the film. Also on the plus side is Kerim Bey (Pedro Armendariz) who is Bond's contact in Istanbul. The part of Kerim was more animated and substantial than the role of Felix Leiter in any of the other films in the series.
