 The Core is your typical sci-fi thriller, and you get what you expect. A few shocks, and that's about it. The main problem here lies in the casting of oscar-winner Hilary Swank in the lead role, and her being surrounded by an all-around male cast. First off, the plot is somewhat similar to...well Austin Powers. Ther core in the middle of the earth will eventually detonate and cause world destruction. Sounds original doesn't it? The special effects are cheesy, but it's an ongoing gimmick you will soon find. In fact, The Core tries to parody itself far too many times during the film, classifying it as a sci-fi comedy. Swank is wasted as the main girl...she's no Sigourney Weaver, and she has terrible one-liners. The finale is overblown and unpleasant.
