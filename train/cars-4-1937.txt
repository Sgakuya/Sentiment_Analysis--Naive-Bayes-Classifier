Actually had a 1992 Sundance Duster, which was the Neon's ancestor. Bought used in 1998 for just $1500 with 100k miles. Had a V6 and 5 speed. Decent accleration. Burned a quart of oil every 400-500 miles and smoked a lot since day one. Mechanicals were very dependable but cosmetics fragile. Radio power button worked intermitently, door handle stopped working, driver door window crank stuck, rear view mirror falling off, a couple of speakers stopped working. The only work I had done were replaced tires ($400), brake pads and drum ($150), axle ($125), and fan ($50). Never had any engine, tranny, or AC work done on it. Got great gas mileage until about the 155k mile mark. Valves started making noise at 163k mile mark. Then I sold it to a neighbor. A couple of months later, saw him pushing the car. Overall though I spent little on this car and got a lot value out of it.
