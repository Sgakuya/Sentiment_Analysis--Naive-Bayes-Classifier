i remember watching this movie on many a saturday afternoon... the first 10 or so times i saw it, i loved it... at this point, it's lost all meaning for me. between this, the thing , and escape from new york you should be able to figure out that john carpenter, especially when teamed up with the over-the-top russell, will tell any story, no matter how bizarre, ludicrous, or disgusting, in order to deliver top-flight cheese entertainment to his loyal fans. as an action director he is a force to be reckoned with, but i think he may have attended one too many comic book conventions. this movie is exemplary of his ability to make cool weirdness work. brilliantly visual, oddly exotic, magically delicious. enjoy it some rainy night, feel like a kid again, alone or with friends, and be ready to apologize to your brain when it's over.
