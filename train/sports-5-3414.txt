Quite possibly the greatest pitcher of all time. The most glaring proof of that statement can be found when it is realized that the Washington Senators teams he played on for his entire career were usually at or near the bottom of the standings. Walter Johnson almost single handedly won 20 or more games for the Senators in 10 straight seasons and is second only to Cy Young in number of career victories. In addition, he is the all time leader in shutouts, with 110, and is all time leader in 1 run losses. It's interesting to consider the types of numbers he might have had had he played for a more accomplished team.
