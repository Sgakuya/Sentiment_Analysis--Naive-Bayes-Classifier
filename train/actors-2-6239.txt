As an actor, he rates maybe a three, although his technique doesn't really hold water in these more naturalistic times. He relies too much on his looks and his stentorian voice, and invests his characters with a generalized attitude and intensity rather than living truthfully in each moment as modern actors are trained to do. He's a product of a certain era, and not bad for that era, but his time is past. ---- As a public figure, he rates a one. His performance as head of the NRA has been shameful. I think anyone, even among thinking NRA members, who sees his dismal performance in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE would have to be at least a little embarrassed. He is of course entitled to his opinions, and to the free expression of same. But to bring his NRA circus to Littleton and to Flint Mich. in the immediate aftermath of gun-related calamities in those towns is at best insensitive, and in horrifically bad taste--an excellent example of the maxim, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. When asked about his rationale for such behavior, all he can do is spout platitudes. Clearly, he has not done the intellectual legwork to support his position--there are perfectly sound arguments to be made in favor of gun ownership and the second amendment, but he seems incapable of making them. He's all catchphrases and belligerence. Sad, really.
