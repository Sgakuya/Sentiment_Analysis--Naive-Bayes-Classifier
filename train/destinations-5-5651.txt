WE HAVE THE ACCENT RIGHT, YOU DONT!.as for home prices everywhere in the state is vertually 30 minutes away from Boston, the main city in all of New England, Common sense would tell you home prices would be Higher. And people dont say Taxachusetts, we have 5% sales tax. thats pretty good compaired to Rhode Island with 7% and NY eith like 8%..Basicly MASS has it right
