Wilt was, bar none, the greatest basketball player ever. We're talking about a guy who one season averaged 50 points a game, and in another season, averaged 27 rebounds a game. As for the ball hog rumors, I believe Wilt was the only center who ever led the league in assists for a whole season (not led centers in assists, mind you, but led EVERYBODY). And finally, people say But there were almost no good centers then! Folks, there are almost no good centers NOW. We've got Shaq (who's overrated), Yao, Tim Duncan, Brad Miller, and a bunch of role players. Yes, Jordan was a great player, but Wilt was the greatest.
