I think if T.R. were alive today, he would get along marvelously with the Vietnam War era politicians like John McCain, Chuck Hagel, & yes John Kerry. Like them, T,R, was somebody who was not afraid to take on anyone to defend his cause. I don't know that he would be a Democrat, today, although the Democratic Party would've benefitted immensely from him. T.R. was a 'real man' who had the foresight to keep national treasures like Yellowsone & the Grand Canyon off-limits to those who didn't give a damn. Also, any guy who has actually experienced war first-hand, and could have the 'teddy bear' named after him would definitly have my vote today. My only criticism of him was that he got a bit whack-O in his later years.
