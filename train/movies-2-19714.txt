Long, rambling, and graphically violent, From Hell was not an enjoyable movie for me. While there were some interesting aspects - the cinematography was pretty cool, and I thought Johnny Depp was good as the opium addicted inspector - as a whole, the movie did not quite come together. I thought the plot was unnecessarily complicated, and that other than Depp, the acting was mediocre. The most telling sign of this film's limited impact on me, was that as I watched the movie, I found myself worrying about my car (which was parked illegally), thinking how physically uncomfortable that I was, and trying to remember what time the Yankee / Mariners game started. Not a terrible movie, but not good either.
