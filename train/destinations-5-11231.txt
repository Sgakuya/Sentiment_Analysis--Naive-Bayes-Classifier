Such an excellent trip back to childhood no matter what your age. Went when I was 8 with my family, it was really magical..only bad thing, we all had to wear matching shirts so we wouldn't get lost..(although I didn't mind that much, if I was a teenager at the time I can only imagine the emotional scar it would have left) AMAZING PLACE, same feeling when I went back at 18..Can't wait to bring my kids. This has to be the ultimate family vacation..yeah it is pre-packaged commercialized fun, but for whatever reason, Walt Disney hit the nail on the head with this place, it really is magical and somehow feels like a different world where everyone can be a kid. You can also find some excellent packages for your vacation.
