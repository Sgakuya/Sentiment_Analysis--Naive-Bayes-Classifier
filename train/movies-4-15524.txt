This movie was definately better than I had expected it to be. I first saw it a few years after it came out, and to be truthful, judging from all the reviews, was no expecting much. I was surprised to see that not only was the movie good, but it was very good. I actually cried at the end (the only other movie that has gotten that out of me was The Green Mile ). I thought that everything about the movie was top notch: the script, the directing, the acting, the musical score, the atmosphere, everything. I thought that most of the actors did a fine job in their roles. I had only a few problems which most others have already mentioned here: While it was a great effort, the actors just were not the sort of people I'd expect to see in 1912. I highly doubt that someone in 1912 would be giving people the middle finger. But that's not to take anything away from the actors- they all did a fine job. I'm sure it's difficult to choose actors who will be able to recreate something that happened so long ago. I thought that Leonardo DiCaprio was at his best here- he has not done anything this good since. Kate Winslet was also very impressive as Rose. And props to Billy Zane, perhaps the only actor who was able to pull off making his character 1912ish . Perhaps the movie was stereotypical ( Half the people on this ship are going to die. . Not the better half. ), but rich bigwigs usually are that way. Obviously when the boats were being filled with all the rich people (not even to the maximum capacity), there is an implication that the rich are more important than the poor. I thought that the special effects were perfect. All of the camerawork during the final sinking was very well done, but what can we expect from James Cameron? So in the final analysis, I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is in the mood for a romance. This movie is ten times better than Pearl Harbor . The acting is great- everything about it is great. Highly reccomended!
