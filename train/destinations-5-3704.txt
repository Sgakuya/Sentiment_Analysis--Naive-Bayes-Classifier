Denver is not THE greatest city in the world, but it is pretty great, and I am happy to be living here, (especially at this moment in time as Denver is really an up-and-coming cultural hub). Probably the best keept secret in the states is the incredible music scene in Denver. Not only do we get the greatest bands/acts in the world playing here (often at smaller, more intimate clubs than they would play in a larger city)- because Denver is basically a convenient pit-stop between bigger cities - but we also have an incredibly versitile and talented local music scene. Along with that is unequivically the best indy music store in the U.S., Twist & Shout. If you are here to visit, make sure not to miss this treasure! Another personal favorite is the Larimer Lounge, a small intimate club that has featured the likes of then up-and-coming acts like The Rapture, The Killers, and The Libertines. Some of the most diverse, hippest, most well educated and in-the-know people reside in the city, making for an always interesteding Friday night!
