West, along with teammate Elgin Baylor, was one of the best players in NBA history pre-1980. If he played today, Jerry West would still have that killer jump shot, (although many of his shots would now be worth three points instead of two) he would still have those quick hands on defense, and he would still be the guy that you threw the ball to with the game on the line. Here in Los Angeles, (Although I was a transplanted Celtics fan) we were fortunate enough to have had the great Chick Hearn (the best announcer in the history of the game) giving the play by play for every Lakers game since they moved to L.A. from Minneapolis (Until his death a few years ago) and when Chick gave something or someone a nickname, you can bet that it was an appropriate one. It was Hearn who coined the phrase, "slam dunk." A player dribbling was, "yo-yoing up and down." A shot that circled the rim and came out was a, "heartbreaker." A player who took the pump-fake and came down as the shooter went up was, "put in the popcorn machine." And Jerry West was, "Mr. Clutch." When he finished his career player (After scoring over 27,000 points and playing in 14 Allstar games), he started building. Every championship ever won by the Los Angeles Lakers has Jerry West's fingerprints on it. His number hung up in the rafters of Fabulous Forum (It now hangs in the Staples Center) along with Baylor, Wilt, Kareem, Magic, James Worthy, and former backcourt teammate Gail Goodrich. As mentioned in earlier reviews, it is his silhouette that appears as the NBA logo. I hope that they never change it.
