The United States is built on the foundation of capitalism. Therefore, it was not suitable for Franklin Delano Roosevelt to bring the US nearer to communism. The New Deal was FDRs tyrant attempt to bring us out of the great depression. This insidious action went against everything America stood for. Roosevelts effort didnt succeed, and it brought us deeper into depression. The New Deal also wasnt fair to American citizens, it made things worse, and violated their rights. FDRs New Deal and other communist methods failed, not only did they fail, but they worsened the situation we were in. The Smoot-Hawley tariff, contributed to our problems by aggravating out trading partners. The Agricultural Adjustment Act led to the destruction of millions of acres of crops and millions of farm animals, this food was just thrown away while hundreds of Americans were staving.
