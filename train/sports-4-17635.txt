This is a hard team to figure out. They start 5-0, including a fairly impressive win over the Colts, and then go 1-2, and in their one win just barely beat the underachieving Saints in OT. Stephen Davis has made a huge difference, but Jake Delhomme is a weak starting quarterback. True, he has more upside than ancient Rodney Peete, but the guy is not going to win many games if he had to throw the ball thirty times. This team is all about keeping it simple, with ball control and defense. So far it has worked, and they have a relatively easy second half with Tampa Bay, Dallas, and maybe Philadelphia being the toughest matches coming up. If they lose to Tampa Bay, the Panthers may hit a wall and stumble. The NFC South was strong last year, but this year it sucks. 9-7 would be plenty good enough to make the playoffs. Look for Carolina to be in the 9-7 to 10-6 range and win the division as long as Tampa Bay doesn't suddenly turn into the team it was last year and snatch 6 or 7 wins out of their remaining 8 games to steal it from Carolina.
