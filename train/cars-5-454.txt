just got my 600 mile tune on my new '06 Triumph Speed Triple. i've never aspired to own a Triumph, and they've never been on my radar till i came into contact with the '06 S3. after wanting a muscle bike since the 80's but not wanting the style of the v-max (lamo harley look) i have found the perfect bike i've been looking for. the sitting position is perfect for my tastes as i come from 35 years of riding dirt. you sit on top of the bike instead of laying down on it like a cafe. the power is very respectable. it's hard to keep the front tire on the ground when accelerating and even when moderately acclerating, the front end gets so light you think the front is going to drift. just amazing bike. it handles very, very solid, no head shake, no speed wobble, it tracks perfectly. i highly rec' this bike. you can track stand stop signs becasue of it's amazing balance and the loos alone will have bike lovers crowding around it when your parked somehwere. it's the bike. -b
