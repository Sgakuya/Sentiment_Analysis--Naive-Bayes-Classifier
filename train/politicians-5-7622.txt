Born near Hodgenville, Kentucky, Feb. 12, 1809. Lost his mother and older sister before he was ten. No formal schooling---taught himself book l'arnin' in between his many responsibilities as a farmer, tradesman, saloon keeper, railsplitter, and riverboatman. A gentle giant whom many historians believe to have suffered from severe depression and Marfan's Syndrome (a genetic disorder found in very tall people---Lincoln was 6'4 ---that results in weakened arterial walls and poor circulation). Taught himself law and became a country lawyer in Springfield, Illinois. Married Mary Todd, a Mississippian with family links to the Southern belief system and the Confederate cause. All of his children (except his eldest, Robert) died young. Lost several local and statewide elections before finally winning a seat in the House of Representatives. Elected on an anti-slavery platform with John Fremont in 1860 with his foremost goal of preserving the Union. (Freeing the slaves was a consequence of his goal.) Had he not been assassinated April 15, 1865, it is likely he might have served two or more terms as President and may have altered the course of Reconstruction (and the future civil rights movement). Men such as Lincoln who possess innate moral turpitude during a time of real national crisis and pay the supreme price can only be seen as true leaders who hold themselves accountable for their actions. Lincoln is deserving of a place of honor in American (and world) history.
