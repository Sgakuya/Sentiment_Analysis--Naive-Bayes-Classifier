Second only to Larry Bird at the forward spot--ever!! One of the greatest clutch players and eloquent speakers, Rick not only scored from the outside and shot 90% plus at the f/t line, he was the only non-guard to rank in the top 5 for steals/assists per game year after year. As for leadership, Rick led a cast of unknowns to the NBA title. Lack of recognition likely due to resentment by those in power; for overly expressing his views, questioning authority (refs), jumping to the ABA--5 years (in his prime) and for being too cerebral, a prisoner of his own perfection. As for his intensity level, just look at the old-timers all-star game in which Rick participated, he played to win--always!
