I have to give Bacardi 151 five stars because with out it, I couldn't have Spanish Coffees! I read through some of the other comments, and see that some prefer 151 as a shot drink. But I have learned (by trial and error) that 151 is a mixing drink, not to do as a shot. When I tried the 151 shot I was completely sober, hadn't had one drink all day. I drank the shot, and it instantly came back up. That's not the worst part. The alcohol on the way back up actually did damage to my tonsil, I ended up with a tonsil infection. I also know someone who had a bottle of Bacardi 151 leak in his suitcase while on a trip, it ate the rubber lining out of the suitcase. I'm not sure if all alcohols would do this, but wow! Regardless, 151 is a great ingredient in Spanish Coffee.
