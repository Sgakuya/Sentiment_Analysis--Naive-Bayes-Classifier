This is easily Stephen King's best stand-alone book, by far, bar none. It is an epic tale, masterfully told in such a way that you want to know what happens next, and you truly care about the main characters. A short synopsis of the story goes something like this: An engineered bug escapes a government laboratory, quickly spreads and kills 99% of the people that come into contact with it. The people that are left start to reform into two groups (us vs. Them, Good vs. Evil) and start trying to rebuild the world. The escape and spread of the virus is masterfully and, amazingly for Stephen King, briefly told. He illustrates the ease with which such a virus would spread in today's world, without boring you to death. The best part of the book is when people start trying to get back together, the good guys in Boulder, the bad guys in Las Vegas, and try to rebuild civilization as we know it, and the struggles not to repeat the same mistakes that led up to the disaster in the first place. For those interested in the book, I STRONGLY recommend that you do NOT read the abridged version! While it's true that all that was taken out was backstory, the backstory is what makes the book such a fun read! If you don't read another King novel, you should read this one.
