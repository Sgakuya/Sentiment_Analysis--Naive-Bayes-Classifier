I am an avid Consumer Reports and J.D. Power reader when it comes to the car reports. When I started looking for an SUV, reliability and a carlike ride were important to me. The Highlander has a GREAT ride. You sit up high, can see clearly, and do not feel like you are in this massive truck. Yet, when all of the little features like leather and a 6 disc changer were added, it is priced the same as its cousin the Lexus RX300 also made by Toyota. In the end I bought an RX300 and don't regret it. It just has a little more style and luxury than the Highlander. If you're not looking for luxury, go for the Highlander. They are good cars and Toyota will treat you well.
