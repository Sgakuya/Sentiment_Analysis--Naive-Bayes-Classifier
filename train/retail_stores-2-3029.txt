My husband purchased my wedding band including insurance with Crescent Jewelers. A few months later all the stores in my area closed. Crescent Jewelers failed to inform their clients that our local stores would be closing or how they my compensate my insurance policy. When I called the telephone number on their website, the gentleman who attended to me was not able (due to company policy) to provide me with any answers or the telephone number to corporate office. I think Crescent Jewelers is very unprofessional and does not comply with their promises. I would never recommand anyone to purchase anything from their stores.
