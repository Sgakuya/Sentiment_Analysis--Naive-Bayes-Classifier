I am in my sixth class of the MBA program at UOP and have taken four of my classes on ground and two on flex net. My first three classes were difficult (COM 525, Economics and Organization Behavior. A great deal of work was required and I had to learn to write again and in APA style. I like the resources that to school offers to improve one's writing ability. I have really improved my writing skills in this school. I often wonder why teachers in my undergraduate school,Kennesaw State University, were not a lot tougher on the use of proper grammer and punctuation. Two of the teachers I have had in UOP have been very tough on correcting papers that did not follow the APA format. The last two classes were not difficult at all (Accounting and Legal Environment of Business). I hope this trend does not continue. I do like the school though and have collaborated with many bright students. I have had students in my team though who do not know how to write. They were jumped from the first class in the sequence to the fifth ( I guess to keep them in the program) which is not a good reflection on the school. I hope the school is not getting soft again on academic standards.
