I wish I could say this is going to be the store to kill Wally, but because so many under-educated people still love the Wally, I don't think it will be. The stores are cleaner, the stock is better quality, the shelves are more organized (probably because most of the riff-raff go to Wally), the employees are better educated and friendlier. What Wally inspired to be before they decided to take over the world one town at a time. And for those that claim their return policy is unfair, I say to you keep your reciept if you think you want to return it. Wally don't care if you have a reciept or not because they want you to come there regardless. Target wants to compete for business, not run themselves bankrupt by taking in Wally reject items at Target so theives can make money.
