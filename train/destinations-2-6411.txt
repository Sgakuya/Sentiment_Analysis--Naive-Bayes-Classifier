From Maine to Minnesota the rust belt economy sinks slowly into the sunset. Every year untold numbers of northerners who wish to maintain a semblance of a middle class lifestyle migrate south and west. Nowhere is this diaspora met with such howls of protest as in the south. In South Carolina they're going to fight like hell to retain a culture and lifestyle that they feel is threatened. They see how "Yankeeified" large parts of North Carolina, Georgia and Florida have become and they damn sure don't want to let it happen in their Palmetto State. So you could lure a company in the state that provided 10000 new jobs or you could find a cure for cancer, but if you're from the north you'll never really feel like you belong in South Carolina. Too bad. It's a pleasant state geographically. Not spectacular like the west, but the upstate has its Appalachian charm, and the Low Country is very appealing. Still old attitudes don't die hard, they seem to live on forever. The south seems to be the one part of the country with a permanent chip on its shoulder. That attitude rings loud and clear in South Carolina. I came down here offering my skills and the hand of friendship. Now I get the message, Oh do I ever get it. In the bad days of segregation many left the south just so they could survive. In the modern era many northerners came down here with skills and a work ethic that have transformed many parts of this state and others in the region out of an extended state of backwardness. Don't look for any thanks in South Carolina. They wish we'd all leave tomorrow. This Yankee can't wait to get the hell out.
