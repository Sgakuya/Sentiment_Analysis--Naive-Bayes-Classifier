I was the passenger when my dad drove his s40 volvo into another car at some traffic lights earlier today, and let me tell you, these cars are very very safe! After being in a similar accident only 3 weeks ago in a ford festiva, the difference in the amount of impact i felt between the two was huge. For some reason the volvos airbags didn't go off, I guess because the impact wasn't bad enough and neither of us hit our heads anyway. The front bonet was pushed up and in half, and the whole front including the lights and side panels were destroyed, but the engine was barely scratched. The impact felt when we hit the car was barely noticeable, just like we were going over a bump in the road, unlike when I was in the other accident in the ford where i felt every bit of the impact and had a very sore neck and back for days after, and was injured with whiplash and a knee through the dash. When I have enough money I will definately buy a volvo they are soo safe and after experiencing the difference of the safety of this car in a crash I will feel safe every time I drive my dads car (when it gets fixed up!).
