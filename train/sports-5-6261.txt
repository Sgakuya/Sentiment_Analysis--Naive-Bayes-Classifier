I love you boys, and I will remember you as long as I live. Nothing anybody says matters now. You shut 'em up, and you brought it on home to the Hill where it belongs. Not a team? No defense? - none of that matters now. You are the champions and you are legends. We knew you could do it all along. And make no mistake, none of us bought that not a team crap for a second. It was nothing but wishful thinking by haters. They will inevitably come up with something negative - doesn't matter - CHAMPS! and you earned it. Melvin, Jackie, Jawad, Dave, Rashad, Sean, Marvin, Raymond, Charlie, Quentin, Byron, Damion, CJ, Jesse, Reyshawn, Wes, Damien - all you boys - A TEAM TEAM TEAM! While I don't have the money to stay on the internet to defend you. I love you, and will remember you forever. You shut 'em up and proved 'em wrong boys. Now you know what being a Tarheel is all about. NOW GO MAKE SOME CASH, BABY BOYS! - you deserve it. You're rich biotch! TRULY rich. And WOW, you sure as hell deserve it! FYI- Patrick is the name, and I'll be a Tarheel until I die!
