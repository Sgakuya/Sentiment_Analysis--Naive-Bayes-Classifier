I find it funny how the refs always seem to give Duke a little help. I mean, the same foul will be on a Duke opponent, but when it could go agaist Duke, it doesn't seem to get called. JJ Redick is an awesome 3-pt shot, he just needs to get going a lil bit earlier in certain games. Sometimes I think JJ plays hero a bit too much, seeing as how they might have won the UNC game at the end of the season if they had given it to someone who had been shooting better. Next year, after Ewing leaves, someone is really gonna need to step up and become the second shooter. Nelson has potential, as does Melchioni, but they still could do with some experience.
