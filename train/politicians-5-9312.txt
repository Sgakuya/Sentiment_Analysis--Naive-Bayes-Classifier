Perhaps the most underrated President of all time, and certainly (along with Reagan) one of the 2 greatest Presidents of the 20th century. He was the last U.S. President to make government smaller, as he simultaneously cut taxes and paid down the national debt significantly (due to his cutting of government spending and the massive amount of economic growth that the U.S. experienced on his watch). A true principled conservative, perhaps the most principled of the 20th century (one of the 4 true conservative Presidents of the 20th century, along with McKinley - albeit most of his term was in the 19th century, Harding, and Reagan). Its too bad that Hoover and FDR both amplified the depression initially caused by bad monetary policy via raising taxes, that's something that Coolidge never would have done and the depression wouldn't have been as bad had he stayed President. He was also a man of great integrity. Coolidge's only 2 flaws: He supported Prohibition and was too much of a protectionist when it came to international trade. But hey, nobody's perfect!
