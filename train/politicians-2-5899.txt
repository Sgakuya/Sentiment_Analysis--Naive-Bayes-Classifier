I resently read a magazine cover describing Luis Gutierrez as one of the up and coming Hispanics in politics. I am very surprised to see his name here, considering that bigger names in the political scene are not here, but in case if no one knows, Luis Gutierrez is a U.S. Congressman from Chicago who was elected through a grass roots effort in 1992. He has made inroads by defining himself in Congress as one of the most progressive representatives in the Hispanic caucus. As a Cuban-American, I take insult at the fact that all Hispanics have to by self-interest identify with Democrats. They have done nothing but bribe immigrants for votes since the 1850's, when the New York Democratic political machine paid Irishmen and other new immigrants money for their votes. They don't do so outright today, now what they do is offer bribery in the form of entitlements that place immigrant families in a cycle of dependency. The true responsibility of government is to provide for an environment that is conducive for business activity. Streamlining the citizenship process may also be helpful for people who want to come to this country. Allowing for both private and publicly funded college scholarships will also be helpful for immigrant families. A good education is the quickest way to assimilate into the U.S. economic community. The greatest civil right for any minority, immigrant or not, is a proper education; this will open up more doors than any affirmative action legislation can ever do. More Hispanics like Congressman Gutierrez in this country have to wake up to this reality and elect representatives that will make their voices heard through helping enact REAL REFORM of the INS and REAL education reform.
