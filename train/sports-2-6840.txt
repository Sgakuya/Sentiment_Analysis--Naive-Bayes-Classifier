you cant blow a #2 pick on darko, that was the biggest bust of all time, you coulda had dwane (better pg than chauncy) and it doesnt matter if tay wouldnt be as good coz you would have melo who is much better if you woulda drafted him or you coulda had bosh who will be way better thank darko plus he shouldnt get credit for ben wallace or rip coz ben was a nobody and rip was there before also the reason the pistons won was larry brown not dumars if he can keep a team together long term the way the lakers did for 5 years or the way the spurs are he should and will recieve more credit, also you keep giving dumars credit for the way the team is playing thats not him thats larry brown, larry coaches the team
