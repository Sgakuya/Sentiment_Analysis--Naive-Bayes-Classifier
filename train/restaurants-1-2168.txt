What can i say...What a shame...Always Fresh...Ya right...Always Frozen...should be the new slogan...I work at Tim Hortons in Canada, ON and all i can say is that people come in now and get mad at us because the doghnuts are different...like i just work there to serve you...People would swear at me and bitch at me for no reason and i am just there to work...If you have any problem then go bitch somewhere else...I am not the one who told them to make the doghnuts frozen....geez!!!! Tim Hortons is getting stupid as they will get nailed by Krispy Kreme once it grows big time in Ontario...Doghnuts used to be the best and now they are the worest...and that roll up the rim to rim..they should call it Roll Up The Rimm To Lose...like geezzzzzz!!!! me and my family get tons of coffee and see if we can win but noooo we get please try again and again and AGAIN....stupid Timmies
