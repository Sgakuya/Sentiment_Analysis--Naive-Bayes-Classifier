I guess it's a good tourist destination if you go to see the religious sites. I, however, am an atheist so I would not have a reason to ever go there. Contrary to popular belief, Israel does NOT have a long history as they only became a country in 1948, unilaterally declaring independence before the UN had given them permission to. Also, I can not accept the legitimacy of this nation, because the only justification for its existence lies in scripture, and I happen to believe the scriptures to be fiction. It is a definite fact that the Hebrew people lived there at one time, but were evicted over eighteen centuries ago and have been wandering ever since. My ancestors came from Europe, and many of them were forcibly evicted, but that does not mean that I can go back to Ireland or Poland or the Netherlands and shoot the people living there and move into their house because it had at one time belonged to 'my people.' The violent terrorist acts of a select few Palestinians are indeed abhorrent, but what other choice do they have? The average Palestinian lives in no more than twenty square blocks of rubble, as they are not free to travel to other parts of the West Bank or Gaza. They live in these ghettos under the constant threat of having their house demolished as punishment for belonging to the same ethnic group as a terrorist. They have also been forced, at gunpoint, to live in these ghettos for over fifty years, so I don't blame them for feeling completely helpless and hopeless and bitter and filled with hate. They shouldn't kill innocent Israeli citizens, but I understand why they do. Whatever, I could rant for days about this annoying little country that seems to cause more than it's fair share of trouble around the world, but there are other forums. Maybe we should evacuate everyone, Israelis and Palestinians alike, and nuke the land into an unliveable radioactive glass parking lot.
