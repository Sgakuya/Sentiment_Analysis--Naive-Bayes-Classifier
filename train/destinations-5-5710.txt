Minnesota has a lot more going for it than it gets credit for. The lakes are a given... beautiful, pristine, excellent fishing and camping, great lake resorts and little resort towns. Duluth is an interesting city on Lake Superior which has the feeling of an ocean port town. Lake Itasca is one of my favorite state parks, home to the headwaters of the Mississippi River and located in a beautiful forest. The Iron Range in the northeast part of the state is all beautiful forested land. The Twin Cities are gorgeous in the summertime (and if you're the kind of person who enjoys snow, the St. Paul winter carnival is great) and have an excellent theater and music scene. If that isn't reason enough to love this state, Austin MN is Spamtown U.S.A. , the SPAM capital of the world. Definitely worth a visit.
