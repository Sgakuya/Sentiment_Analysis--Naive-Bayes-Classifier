Aren't all universities "for profit"? I mean the university of Notre Dame has a one BILLION DOLLAR endowment for Christ sake! Harvard, which is by far the richest university in the US has an endowment of over 25 BILLION! Studies showed that all univerisities with endowments over 1 BILLION, which are many, all earned a rate of return of at least 9% last year. Sounds like profit to me.Why do big time football universities compete so much to get in bowl games, why? Because they get millions for their universities from television contracts for making a BCS bowl game instead of a lesser known bowl. Do you think these universities are giving that money to charity? Hell no! All universities are for profit as I understand it. So unless I am ignorant to something about universities' mission with respect to revenues then all this talk about for profit is just wrong. I received my MBA from UOP on campus in Sept 05. I am planning on pursuing a PhD online in IT management at Capella. UOP is a fine school if you are looking to learn and get ahead in your profession, or change professions. However, if you are looking to make a million dollars while working on Wall Street then go apply to Harvard or Yale. That's just the reality of education in the United States.
