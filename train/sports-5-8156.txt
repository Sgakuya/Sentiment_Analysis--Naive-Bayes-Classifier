Vince Carter is a tremendously incredible basketball player. He does it all. He dazzles fans with his showstopping, gravity defying dunks. He is the king of showcasing imaginative dunks. He has contributed so much to the Toronto Raptors, that he will be dearly missed if he leaves. Vince Carter works extremely hard to be excellent in all areas of the game of basketball, and it is no wonder that in the near future he will answer any doubts of not being the greatest basketbal player to ever play the game.For thoughs of you who do not know how to appreciate a basketball player as talented as Vince, then you don't have passion for the game, your just full of trash talk, no action whatsoever, and besides vince doesn't have to be the next michael jordon, hes already the first carter, why go for mj. I'd like to also say if you have negative comments to say, keep them to yourself, and i know people have the freedom of speech and all but pple that really don't respect the game of basketabll shouldn't be rating Vince Carter at all, cause quite honestly and frankly whatever you write about vince is out of jealousy, i mean its obvious that you know nothing about basketball and how big of a heart and person it takes to be a great basketball player. Vince is determined and everything, not to mention damb good looking, so you know for those of you who dont even know the definition of basketball, go shove your face in a dictionary, and in the future you wont resist at looking at the encyclopedia and saying Vince Carter has made history. Vince is a true gentlemen and you know what, you can't always be modest, yet you can still do a dunk and fascinate fans and still being modest. Fascinating fans is a part of the game, so no it's not called showing off!!!!!
