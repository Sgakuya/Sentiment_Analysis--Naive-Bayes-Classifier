An OKAY movie worth getting on DVD. A lot funnier than Punch Drunk Love, Little Nicky, and a few other of Sandler's recent stinkers. The movie is kind of a melding of Groundhog Day and Memento, with Barrymore afflicted with a loss of short-term memory that makes each day with Sandler like the first day. Some aspects of the premise are a bit far-fetched. But Sandler and Barrymore always have good chemistry together (i.e., Wedding Singer). The cute penguin and walrus (Sandler portrays a Jewish Veterinarian who works on Marine Mammals) almost steal the movie from their human counterparts. My wife didn't dig it too much, she slept through large chunks of the movie.
