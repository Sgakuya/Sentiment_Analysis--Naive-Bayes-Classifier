Yeah, the cost of living here is enormous, the people are snotty and mean, and everyone loves to rip you off. I get the impression too that everyone does look down on you. Thankfully, I have visited NYC a lot, but not had to live there. I just watched a couple disgraceful episodes of Boiling Points on MTV. This is young New Yorkers at their worst. An MTV actor posing as a Pizza shop owner pisses off a couple teenage girls, who actually manage to throw the water and pizza back at him. There are quite a few other incidents on the show that convince me New Yorkers are just disgusting, classless people. I won't even mention the NYC kids I went to college with. Ugh, I wouldn't be caught dead here.
