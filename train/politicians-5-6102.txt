This maybe an unpopular opinion but I have to commend Ashcroft for his decision to postpone the McVeigh execution. I realize that many want this animal out of our society; I am one myself. However, what if these latest FBI documents really have some additional evidence that McVeigh had others helping him, others that are still out there and have not been brought to justice. He maybe the only key to unlocking that potential puzzle. McVeigh is not going anywhere and he will soon be dead and gone. In the mean time, if we can bring in any others that were his accomplices, lets bring them in to join him in his final fate. I am a supporter of the death penalty, but I am a bigger supporter of justice, lets get them all. More importantly, we must all live knowing he is the right man and we did all we could to capture everyone involved. I would hate to wake up 15 years from now to find out some document the Government bungled around with proved the real criminals were never brought to justice. I heard a lot of people especially Christians say Ashcroft should not have been criticized for his beliefs the way he was. I had a different view, I said bring on the attacks, lets see if he can stand the test of fire before he takes office not after. I am certainly glad to see that Ashcroft s beliefs and convictions were firm and unwavering during his trial by fire from liberal America. If he had made even the slightest shift to the left I would have said get him out of there. Instead, he stayed steadfast and firm, now I say bring on the attacks. His decision to postpone the execution was one made with head and heart knowledge. To have moved forward with the current arrangements with these new documents surfacing would have been one of vindication not logic and legal processing.
