Saint Leo's undergrad program through University Alliance offers an excellent alternative to campus education. Saint Leo is a brick and mortar college and credited. The professors are helpful and any questions are answered within 24 hours. The students are expected to work hard and are graded on their homeworks, papers, message board weekly participations, quizzes and exams. I've taken over 20 online courses with Saint Leo and they have all been challenging and informative. I have to say that I work my "butt" off just to stay on top. Taking online courses has forced me to read the book from cover to cover unlike campus learning. The point is that I have to take the time and teach myself because no one else will. I've learned so much compared to a campus education. I've taken statistics, accounting, financial management, etc. I have 4 classes remaining to obtain a BA in Business Administration, Management. My experience with Saint Leo University has been wonderful so far except for University Alliance. I used to have different representatives in every term, but I've corrected the problem and is only now working with the same rep on every term. University Alliance deals with the registration, tuition, IT support, and books/materials for the students. Saint Leo itself is responsible for the professors and the course. I highly recommend Saint Leo University to people who are looking at an alternative way of learning. In fact, I'm looking at their MBA Online program.
