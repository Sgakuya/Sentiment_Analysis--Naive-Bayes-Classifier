Yep. I knew Baraveheart needed a sequel. I love history and I know for a fact the British never put people in churches and burned them alive. That was WW2 and the German's did that. This movie was unnecesary and over done.I love my country and am very proud of my heritage, I just think it could have been done better and without such meaningless violence glorifying shots like the one of the guy getting his head blown off by a cannon ball. It is very run of the mill and childish in such a serious drama that this picture was supposed to be. It played like any Mel Gibson film,(take your pick-Lethal Weapon,Payback,Braveheart) put gibson in the good old American Revolution,kill some of his family and watch the results. Gibson needs something new. But as they say,if it ain't broke don't fix it. As long as people see these Gibson flicks he'll keep on making em. His daughter was a cuttie.
