Johnny is one of the most talented actors out there but because of his talent and passion for unique roles, he is often not given the credit he deserves. Having been rather underrated before Pirates of the Caribbean, he shines in many eccentric, unique characters but also has played roles where his talent is obvious without acting outlandish. A man who typically shies away from the public eye, he lacks much of the ego that is seen in most actors of his fame. He approaches every role fresh and delves so deep he becomes the character, and his screen presence cannot be denied. His acting is magnetic and truly one of a kind. Managing to fly under the radar and yet earn a tremendous following, he has become one of the most sought after actors even though he is now in his 40's. He has long been a mainstay in Hollywood and now he is finally getting the acclaim he deserves.
