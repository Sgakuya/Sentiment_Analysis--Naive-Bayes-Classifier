Whether he is reading poetry to Ellen Degeneres or saving the world from aliens, Bill Pullman is always believable. He maintains a character's integrity and gives them a soul through body language and facial expressions. While I have enjoyed Bill Pullman in every movie he has been in, I have not always enjoyed the movies themselves. I love him in noir films as I like to see him take risks as an actor. Handsome and charming istoo easy for this guy! There is just something about that man that comes across the screen...He just gets under your skin and sometimes you don't know whether to hug him or arm wrestle him OR just grab him and kiss him for about 4 hours! He is incredibly sexy and he can act. I guess a person can't escape their nature!
