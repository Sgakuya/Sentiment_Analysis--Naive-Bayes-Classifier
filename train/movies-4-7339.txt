About 50% of this movie seemed like a live-action Dilbert comic, but that's okay. The commentary on office life and how horribly annoying the 9 to 5 can be is PAINFULLY accurate, so much that it's funny. Plus, the thing on the restaurant life (the flair ) is also quite accurate. I'd love to go postal on a printer like that! I was surprised to find that the creator was Mike Judge ( Beavis Butt-head , King of the Hill ); and it was a pleasant surprise, considering that I didn't want to see the movie after thinking Oh, great, from the guy who made 'Beavis Butt-head'?). Not the best movie in the world, but it's worth renting on a Tuesday night in.
