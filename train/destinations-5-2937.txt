By far, the greatest urban experience one can have. Where else can you go, and all in one week, walk down Museum Mile to view some of the best art in the world, see an haute couture fashion show, participate in a political rally, dine in a 5 star restaurant at a table next to some celebrity, stroll through botanical gardens, peruse through street fairs, cheer on a parade (it seems like every group has their own parade), and experience the most diverse club and bar scene in the U.S.? To know what's going on in the Big Apple, be sure to read Time Out NY. I know that New Yorkers have a rep for being rude, but as long as you're not trying to scam them or keep them from getting to their destination, they're really pleasant and helpful.
