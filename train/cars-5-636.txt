The thing about Mr. Parker is that he's allowed his opinion, just like me. I happen to love the HD experience, even after riding Japanese scoots since 1973! From a Honda CB175 up to a Kawa 1100 Ninja with many in between, nothing, and I mean NOTHING compares to a big American motorcycle. I don't want to scream around the streets anymore, I want to enjoy the whole experience, the sound, feel and absolute joy of riding a work of art, a beautiful, dependable machine that gets me out riding in style, just for the fun of it. My Road King accomplishes that and much more! Mr. Parker would do well to open his mind up a bit and spend a day with a Harley between his legs.
