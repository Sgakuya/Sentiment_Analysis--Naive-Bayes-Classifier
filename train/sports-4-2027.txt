Great history. Have been around since 1901. Were known as the Philadelphia A's from 1901 to 1954. Hall of Famers like Jimmy Foxx, Al Simmons, Lefty Grove, Mickey Cochrane and Owner/Manager Connie Mack carried the team to 5 World Championships in those days. They moved to Kansas City and played there from 1955 to 1967 and did absolutely nothing. It's when they moved to Oakland in 1968 did the franchise renew it's winning ways with players like Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter, Joe Rudi, Bert Campaneris and Manager Dick Williams. They won three World Championships in a row.....1972,1973 and 1974. And they won one in 1989 with Dennis Eckersley, Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire, Rickey Henderson and Manager Tony LaRussa. But Nowadays....... Perenially, they're a good team. Always getting off to bad starts and then recovering to land a spot in the playoffs. Definitely a well run organization. But......whey they DO enter the postseason, they always find a way to lose. And this goes all the way back to 1990 when they were swept by the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. So considering that and other things that have happened to the A's in recent years has led me to nickname them the CHOKE-land Athletics. Because they seem to choke during October crunch time.
