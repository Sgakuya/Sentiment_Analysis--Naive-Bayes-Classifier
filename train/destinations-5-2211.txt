I visited Islamabad, Pakistan back in December 1999. Coming from a western country it was certainly an eye opener. Completely forgetting this was a muslim dominated country - they don't celebrate Christmas or New Years - it was strange seeing the streets empty and quiet with no visible celebrations. The rules concerning muslim women were a little too extreme for me - they were not allowed to walk the streets alone as this type of behaviour implemented they were prostitutes, not being allowed to sit on toilet seats in public places and not being allowed to wear short skirts in public. After overlooking these factors and realising this was a once in a lifetime experience I started to appreciate the country for what it really was and loved the gorgeous and beautifully designed buildings, was a little intrigued with MTV Asia showing various types of Bhangra music, admired the hand crafted furnishings at cheap prices and laughed at their black market entertainment and over-decorated buses that looked like ice-cream vans. I don't regret going to Pakistan and although there were certain things to admire about the country its one that I won't be rushing back to in a hurry.
