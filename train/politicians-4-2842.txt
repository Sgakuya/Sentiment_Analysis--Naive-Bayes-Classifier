Harry Browne is totally right. I hate not being allowed to pollute the air as I choose, or pay my workers less than minimum wage. I hate having to pay taxes just so that some poor janitor's daughter can learn to read; she should be working in my factory-but that is illegal too! And, what good, may I ask, do regulations that prevent my banks from risking all of the middle class's money in unsafe investments do? And who remembers the Great Depression anyway? The best thing about Harry Browne is that he gets alot of poor people to vote for him because he wants to legalize drugs, even though there are plenty of other parties that want to do that.
