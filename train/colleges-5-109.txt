The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is the leading state supported liberal arts university and business school (ie Kenan-Flagler) in the state. The academics and faculty are strong, the student body is diverse, the programs are nearly if not all-inclusive, and admission is highly competitive. Chapel Hill also offers several leading athletic programs (eg men's and women's basketball, women's soccer, and Olympic, non-revenue sports). The physical setting is essentially a dedicated college town with a well-developed commercial and entertainment infrastructure that provides the student enrollment with nearly unlimited social activities; moreover, the governmental, service and industrial center of Raleigh is within a thirty minute drive (including an international airport). Finally, the cost of tuition is unbeatable for citizens of North Carolina, especially when compared to the in-state competition (eg Duke and Wake Forest). The bottom line is that Kenan-Flagler is strong in academics, athletics and social activities, is recognized and respected nationwide if not globally, and is an excellent financial investment when compared to other schools.
