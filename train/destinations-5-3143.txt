Toronto Rocks!!!! Speaking as a Toronto native born and raised, I have to say that we are one of the most cosmopolitan cities on the planet!! I think Toronto is more culturally diverse than New York City and much cleaner!!! Our transit system is the best in the world with 5 different modes of transportation to get around the city-bus,subway,streetcar,Rapid-transit and GO train. Toronto is NOT a New York wannabee town!!!! Toronto is awesome enough it's own right not to try and be like New York. Every American I have talked to that's been to Toronto has nothing but great things to say about the city as far as cleanliness and great restaurants, shopping and night life. There is such an international feeling in the city with a large Asian, Indian, Middle East, Greek, Russian,etc...etc... you name the nationality and there are lots of people from whatever country you can think of!! Diversity rules here, it's a world class city that can rival any U.S. city ANYDAY!!!!!
