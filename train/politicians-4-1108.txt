Elected in 1994 as President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo faced a variety of economic problems at the very beginning of his term. He felt he was fit to take on the job being that he is a trained US economist. The Mexican economy was in a recession due to the devaluation of the peso, high inflation and interest rates. Despite pressure from his political party, he decided to take up free-market economic reforms that ultimately led to economic growth. He was an honest administrator of Mexico's executive office, unlike most of the leaders who have occupied the post. His greatest contribution was separating his power between the legislature and the judiciary, thus making the government more accountable and transparent. Usually Presidents in Mexico vest all power in themselves. Corruption is a major problem in Latin American countries, the cronyism and favoritism is the biggest drain on their resources and why there's such a big difference between the haves and have nots. He weakened the power of his own political party, the PRI, which had dominated Mexican politics for 80 years. The result was a legitimate multi-party system in that country. A lot of the graft was also rooted out of the operation as well. The result was that his party lost both the Congress and the Presidency in 2000. On the negative side, he couldn't really take care of crime under his watch and there were scandals under his administration. But at least he had the guts to reform the political system, laying the groundwork for more change later.
