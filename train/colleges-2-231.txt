A year ago, I would have rated the school completely differently-positive. I had a great experience attending the school. However, the school is currently undergoing a change in leadership which is not being handled correctly. In the meanwhile, they have had a great deal of turnover in career services and other key administrative areas. The school has struggled with primary rankings in recent years and will probably continue to do so. Also, their placement capabilities have not improved significantly outside a limited regional area. It has the potential to be a top school, because the faculty is great (for the most part), but the administration is in bad shape and it will probably get worse before it gets better.
