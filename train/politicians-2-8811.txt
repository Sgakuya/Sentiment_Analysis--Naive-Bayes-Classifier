A Rhoades scholar and brilliant man. A man that is responsible for a mediocre record as president. A man that takes credit for the great economic boom of the 90s yet has no real reason to claim credit because the republican congress and 12 years of republican administration. They are the ones we should have thanked. A man who is responsible for the terrorist attacks of 9-11. He did nothing after the attack on the trade center a few years before 9-11-01. 8 years of dismay for most americans. He should have been concentrating on eradicating bin laden instead of lying and deceiving the american people. A president I was truly embarrased to call my leader of the free world.
