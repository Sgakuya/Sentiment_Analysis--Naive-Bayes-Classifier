I don t know what it takes to impress some people, but this building, which has marvelously and maybe even miraculously survived since the 13th century is truly an architectural masterpiece. It is huge, lofty, gorgeous and awe inspiring both inside and out. Entering Westminster Abbey is like suddenly traveling back into times long gone by. It is a monument not only to English architecture but also to British wisdom in having the foresight to preserve the best their history has to offer. The only drawback (when I was there anyway) is that it was packed wall-to-wall with people to the point that you couldn t take it all in quite as well as you might like. That did kind of kill the dramatic effect just a bit and left me wondering just how really amazing it would be to walk around inside when nobody else was around.
