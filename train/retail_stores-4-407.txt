For the last three years I purchased a lot of clothes from Ann Taylor and AT loft. I agree with someone they are not friendly to busty women, you'll end up bying a size larger. The skirts there (except long one's) are awfull - badly cut, extremely short and fabric is not so good compare to pants. Pants are the best product here. Too bad you can't try long pants in the store because fit vary greatly. I love their shoes and they have size 11, sure, on-line only. But the quality is very decent and most of the shoes made in Italy. Jewelry repeat itself from year to year and season to season and I have some very nice pieces my friends are envy of. Sweaters vary greatly. The first problem with them - they shrink. I wear large and even after hand washing they become XS. My sister is extremely happy about this. If they don't shrink - they will peel. The only sweaters that don't peel are made from 100% cotton. And sweaters from AT don't last long (one two seasons if you wear them often), the same T-shirt - shrink badly (compare to Banana republic - their cotton T-shirt stay the same size after washing - I wash them together). I am not a big fan of Ann Taylor Loft, they have some decent sweaters made from rayon, but the colors!!! Items seems attractive only on the pages of the catalogs. I love their spring collection - it is usually very pastel, blue colors collection. I like some of their shoes and accessories (scarves, gloves). Two years ago I bought very nice dress from ATloft, but last year there were nothing to choose from. Overall I still like AT for offering shoes my size and decent pants and some nice dresses and jewelry.
