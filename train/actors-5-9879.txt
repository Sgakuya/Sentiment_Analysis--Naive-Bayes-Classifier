Her amazing ability to completely become the person she is portraying puts her in the company of other seasoned top acting talents of our day such as Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman. She was unforgettable in the film horror classic, Carrie and continued to astound audiences and critics alike in a numerous selection and variety of films throughout the 70's, 80's and 90's. Her roles have run the gamut from strangely disturbed teen (Badlands, 1973), to devoted wife and mother (The River, 1984) to her incredibly realistic portrayal of country music legend Loretta Lynn (Coal Miner's Daughter, 1980) in which she not only flawlessly captured the persona but also the sound and style of this well-known performer. As time marches on and, since her earlier success was based on her innate talent and not fleeting youth, big boobs or pouty lips, I would be willing to guess that age will do little to lessen her ability to act. If she opts to continue her career well into old age I am sure we can always expect the same very believable and high-level performance she has always provided her audiences.
