A nice change for anyone wanting a break from any action movie, murder mystery, mindless comedy etc. Lost in Translation is about a man and a woman who are strangers in Japan and don't understand the language and sometimes the culture. They aren't necessarily unhappy with their lives, they are stuck and looking for meaning. They meet and strike up a wonderful friendship which is both platonic and a bit romantic without crossing the line. They are two people at a time in their lives who need each other. It is a funny, poigant and meaningful film. It is Bill Murray's best performance ever and Scarlett Johansson is magnifcent.
