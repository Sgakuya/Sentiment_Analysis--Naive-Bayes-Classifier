Well I don't rate them a 1 just cause I use them all the time, because they're cheap. It's unfortunate most people have to settle for northwest and therefore settle for bad service. I think just about every one of their flights I've been on has been delayed, one time a malfuntion with the machinery crap told the pilots that the landing gear wasn't working! So they had everybody freakin out until they realized it was a mistake. At least half the flights I've taken with them have lost my luggage. The last one I was on had the worst attendants ever. They're so disorganized it's not even funny, from the flight-booking to their service right down to their playing cards. My sister got a deck that was missing a card, and an extra 2 of spades in it's place!
