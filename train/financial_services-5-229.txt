I have been a happy Bank of America customer for many many years. In fact I was part of Security Pacific and migrated into Bank of America post Merger. Even that was well orchestrated in my situation. I have although found that you need to go to the right people for the right things and not assume that a teller can fix any problems you are having. There is a seperate executive customer service line that you can request if you are unsatisfied with regular customer service for severe or excalating issues. Also, I have found it beneficial to make the bank aware when I travel since I leave the county at least once a year. Many consumers are on these blogs complaining about freezes or blocks due to unusual activity. But of course, how is the bank supposed to know you are travelling and that your cards/information is not stolen? I have found you can avoid this isssue by simply calling them when you are travelling or when a transaction is out of the ordinary. Many of these complaints are situations that are reasonably resolved when approached calmly and rationally. I am not saying that charges never happen, mine have almost always been my own fault, and the fees disclosed. I may not like it, but no other bank is going handle the situation any differently. Anyway, to each his own, I have never had an issue with the Bank of America and would recommend it to others.
