I work for old navy and i am overwhelmed that this many people are ignorant about a return policy! Have you ever heard the saying: you are only as strong as your weakest link. Well the reason the policy is in place is because the amount of theft... believe it or not there are dishonest people who shop there and under the old return policy you could got to the back, bring up a pair of jeans and say you bought them, then go exchange them for any clothes you want (does that seem fair?) Anyway, with the amount of loss at my store atleast a cart-full a day was being stolen from our store...which in turns RAISES prices, which may give the consumer something else to b*tch about. The return policy is clearly labeled by the cash register and on the back of the recipt. If you were able to change it how would you make it different?
