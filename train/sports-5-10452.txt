His record and longevity speak for themselves. I would add to that that his ability to adapt and change with the game is impressive. In the 60s through the 80s he built his success on an ultra-conservative, 3-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust playing style. As the game has become more aerial and acrobatic, he has adjusted, placing more importance on the quarterback and the wideouts, and adding the shotgun and a pretty fair repertoire of trick plays you never would have seen in a Penn State playbook in earlier decades. Most coaches his age would have been too set in their ways, and would have let the game pass them by. Factor in his commitment to running a clean program and to academics (how many schools name their library after the football coach? They did that because he was right there leading the fund-raising drive for it, and kicking in about $1M of his own). As for his recent whining as some call it, over the officiating --- yes, that is a little troubling as is it so unlike his previous conduct. But I've seen some of those games he protested -- and those calls were absolute, unequivocal howlers that would have been quickly overturned had there been an NFL-style review process. And in each case they cost Penn State the game. I can't blame him for being a little grumpy.
