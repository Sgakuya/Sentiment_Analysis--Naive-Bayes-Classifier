As a student at Wash U...i can attest that it is a great place to be. The dorms are awesome, the food is near the best in the nation and the academics are excellent. while surrounded by people who graduated near the top of their class, the school does not feel dorky in anyway. all the people here are authentically nice and the professors are wonderful. everyone here cares about getting their work done but also knows how to have fun and relax on the weekends. not to mention the campus is one of the most beautiful college campuses in the nation. so what if not everyone has heard of us? we're ranked in the top ten and get an education comprable to that of ivy leagues and employers are beginning to recogize the name.
