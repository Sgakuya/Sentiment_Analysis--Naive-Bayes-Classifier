In 1970, during the height of the GM muscle car era, Chevrolet introduced it s Monte Carlo to compete with the Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Riviera in the performance market. I recently sold my 1983 Monte Carlo, this car was my pet for over ten years. You could not beat the dependability, however, you could beat the gas mileage mine got with it s 350 4-bolt main engine and four barrel carb. Since 1983, I have heard that these cars which now aren t rear wheeled driven anymore, and don t have high powered V-8 or a four speed anymore, they do offer the buyer plenty of power, room and a base price at just over $20, 000 (get all the options and you re looking at around $30,000) I m giving this a high rating, mostly on the first hand experience I and others I know have had with the Monte Carlo s in the past.
