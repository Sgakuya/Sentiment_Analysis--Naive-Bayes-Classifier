Our '01 Sienna LE is powerful and loaded with goodies. I know some find 'em overpriced; but to test-drive across models is to know the difference. The Ford and GM products just didn't have enough weight or "solid-frame" feel. As a former Lincoln Town Car owner, I was a bit trepidatious about owning a minivan. The leather seats (with heat), JBL sound, temperature control and power everything really make for a nice package. We opted for a model with the trailer-tow package (HD rear-end, hi-torque differential, and oil cooler) -- the mileage is lower and the vehicle requires hi-test gas; but the power is awesome for a six. I have not had any trouble and the van has nearly 200,000 miles on it. I was shocked by some of the negative comments here -- we've had our vehicle dealer-serviced from the get-go and nothing's happened. There was one recall for an alternator pulley that was too small; but it was no skin off my back to have that taken care of during an oil change. We're planning to purchase a second Sienna LE soon; and use the old one as a work-truck.
