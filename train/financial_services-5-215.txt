I am a Bank of America Manager and would like everyone to know a few things.... 1. Yes, we hold checks for as long as we can so that we can charge you more overdrafts when we finally run them all through. (We do this by calling every single merchant that you wrote the check to and telling them they can't take their rightful money out of our bank until we can get more money in fees from you the customer). 2. Yes, we love blocking your credit or debit cards. (The last thing the bank wants to do is make money from the merchant running your card. We also love it when you come into the bank yelling at us for blocking your card). Of course, had we let a suspicious transaction go through... like a big purchase in El Salvador, I am quite certain you would come in fumming and asking how in the hell we allowed a transaction so far out of the norm go through. 3. Yes, we all feel for you, the non-customer who has to pay for using our Tellers and facility (both of which cost money)to cash a check. (This is not counting the fact that most of our customers don't realize that YOU are the largest contributer to the long lines. Let me clue you in on a little sercret...99% of all fraudulent activites are commited by the non-BofA customer. Because of this we have to take extreme measures to validate the authenticity of the checks. We have to have faxes of the signature cards sent to us and go through that person or business's history and compare checks so that we don't allow our BofA customer from being dupped out of their hard earned money with fake checks.
