allen is one of my biggest insparations, and everytime i play basketball i play hard because i have always seen him do it. even when he has a bad game its still inspiring to watch him. the attitude and the thug image is just an image. hes not like that in real life. he doesnt showboat, its just that the crossover looks cool so everyone says hes showboating, but actually hes just trying to win the game. larry brown put it best heres a kid that was so competitive, wanted to play one against five every possesion, and now hes learning how to play the game. selfish players only think about themselves and there scoring averages. not about winning. and nobody wants to win more than allen. from 1996 to now, thats all hes been trying to do. and people say he shoots to much. well putting up one shot when your 5 11 is not easy. its not like he goes into the game saying i have to put up 30 points. he goes into the game saying i have to win this thing. hes a good person, never harmed anybody, and is the reason i love the game of basketball. and i really hope he gets that championship because he deserves it. and allen, thanks.
