The United Nations ranked Norway #1 four years running in its Quality of life index. Hooray. Also mentioned is the fact Norway has a VERY small population and one of the factors average income is weighted due to the excessive number of wealthy people there. Norway is also one of the most expensive countries in the world to live. Norway has a population of 4.5 million. These are the other top 10 nations on the list 2) Sweden 8.8 million, 3) Australia 19.5 million, 4) Canada 31.9 milllion, 5) Netherlands 16 million, 6) Belgium 10 million, 7) Iceland 279 THOUSAND, 8) United States 280.5 million, 9) Japan 126.9 million, and 10) Ireland 3.8 million. WOW. I am so impressed that 7 nations in the world are viewed as having a higher quality of life than the US. Too bad most of them are so small. The US leads all of the larger nations including Japan. I'd say being ranked 8th on the index with a population almost double the rest of the top 10 combined is impressive. Not to mention that France, England, Germany, Spain and many other big EU nations are no where to be seen in the top 10. It seems pretty obvious that the big boys such as the US, Australia, Japan and even Canada should be very proud. I have already shown elsewhere the US ranks FIRST in freedoms. Both England and France averaged out to a 1,2 when the US was a solid 1,1 on the freedom index. At least the UN was fair and ranked the US 8th overall. Only beaten by other fine larger nations such as Canada and Australia. And of course several much smaller ones who are like one US state or even one US city. Norway is a nice country it appears but it is no US.
