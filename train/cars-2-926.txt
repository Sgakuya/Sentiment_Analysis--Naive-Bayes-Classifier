I have now owned 2 honda accords in the last 7 years. In my many years of cars ownership and experience, I can offer the follwing comments. On the plus side, Honda cars generally do not experience major breakdowns and can run for many miles (200-300K) providing recommended maintenance is religously carried out. That's about all I can say that is positive about this make. On the down side, these cars are overly expensive to purchase and even more costly to maintain. When a breakdown does occur, be prepared to shell out major bucks for repair parts. Typical Honda parts will set you back about 3 times the cost of American car parts. Body styling is not particularily eye-catching. Most of the color schemes (body/interior) offered are anything but attractive. Exterior, interior and drivetrain parts seem to be under engineered (cheaply built) and it is very easy to get dents, breakage on interiors parts, etc. When activating the ABS system on a sudden stop, it feels as though damage is being done to the front end components as a result of the cars weight being thrust forward against the flimsy front end. The car is boring to drive. Gas mileage on all models (except manual trans ULEV) is not good for a small car. Does not drive well on snow or ice. Very uncomfortable on long trips. The automatic transmission does not seem to be 'optimized' and shifts at the wrong times. The Michelin tires supplied with it give a hard ride. I have tried 2 other brands and got a much smoother ride. There are better deals out there on cars that will give you more value.
