This is one of the up and coming universities in the Florida state system. Of course, the quality depends on the department. Generally speaking, the School of the Arts and Sciences can be better in terms of course offerings, but it does have an excellent faculty for the most part, very willing to actively engage students. It has an excellent business school, one of the best accounting departments in the country; very challenging as well. Business curriculum is geared toward IT foundations. Solid engineering school as well. We just got a new law school that has recruited some of the best faculty in the country. The schools is Latin American affairs, being that the school is in Miami. The only negative about this school is the lack of any campus life. The school is located in the suburbs of Miami, so it's largely a commuter college. Students are in and out, they don't have a tendency of sticking around. But still, we're working on developing it a bit, and at any rate, this is Miami, there's tons of stuff to do here. The campus is well organized and located in a park. It's not like most urban schools in that the buildings are scattered along city blocks. The place is like a nature preserve, a good thing, but there's too much wildlife all over the place. It has a nice library, one of the largest in the Southeast. Also the education here is one of the best buys in the country. It's 4000 dollars for out-of-state students. Very good considering that you get good professors with a solid curriculum for the price. Plus you get to go to school in Miami.
