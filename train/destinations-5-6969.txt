Rome is truly a city that will make you feel both glorious and right at home. Forget the tourist attractions - there is so much more to see and do. The food is the best you will ever taste and the people are very friendly. Hang around the Campo Di Fiore and Piazza Navonna - the neighborhoods are wonderful. Visit San Clemente, the Capuchin Cemetery, and Quatro Coronati for some real treats. Stop in every church that you pass, one is more magnificent than the other. Gelati, coffee, panini and pizza that cannot be beat! Great jewelry stores in the Jewish ghetto - all 18k - stop by Shelly Ginto and tell Arturo that Donald sent you. Also, eat a fine meal at Dante Taberna dei Gracchhi in the Prati section - the food is out of this world - ask for Tommaso. If you know any priest that belong to an order- see if they have any friends stationed in Rome - they can really show you the city.
