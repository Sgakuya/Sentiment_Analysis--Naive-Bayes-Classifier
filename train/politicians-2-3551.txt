I don't hate George Bush as a man he seems to be a loving devoted family man with a deep conviction in God. However these seem to be his only traits. Some people might say that intelligence (of which W. has demonstrated little) and an attitude of stewardship towards this beautiful country and ALL of its citizens (not just his rich cronies)are good qualities for a President to have. The only sector of the economy he seems to be really aiding are the publishers of his collected malapropisms. I swear to God, if i hear him offer up the reasoning well, the man gassed his own people as ratonale to invade Iraq one more time, i'm going to flip out, move to Iraq and ask Saddam to gas me so i don't have to hear it anymore.
