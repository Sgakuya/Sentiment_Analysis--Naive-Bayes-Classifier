First of all, there's no way of judging how one SUV is better than another until you evaluate your needs. You can only compare SUV's side by side if they're in the same class (mini-SUVs, luxury SUVs, midsize SUVs, large SUVs, etc.). With that said, if you're looking for a mini-SUV and your top priorities are maximum quality and longevity with a minimum of repair, maximum fuel mileage, and a versatile interior, it's hard to beat the newly-designed 2001 RAV4!!! I would not recommend the new RAV if you need to haul more than 4 avg. to large-sized adults and their luggage, or if you have to tow a decent-sized trailer. The new RAV's 2.0L 4-cyl motor is the only option, and at 148hp, it does a good job of transporting the vehicle around efficiently. If you want maximum performance out of your RAV, get the manual transmission like we did. If you can't drive a manual or if you will use it in lots of stop-n-go traffic, then get the automatic. Many of the automatic owners are satisfied with their choice. The new RAV's rear bench is split 50/50, and each side can tumble forward and lock, or they can be removed completely. Very nice feature for hauling cargo. Taking the seats out (takes about 20 seconds for both of them, literally) turns the RAV into a mini cargo van. The one-piece rear door is hinged on one side (passenger's side), so when you open it you have total access to the cargo area. The load-in height is low so back strain is minimal. Great design!! The vehicle has a great-looking interior and fit and finish is typical Toyota high-quality. Very comfortable driving position, even for me at 6'1 240 lbs. There's plenty of interior room despite the smallish-looking exterior dimensions. You'd have to be a huge cow to not fit comfortably in this vehicle. The exterior looks are a major plus, it's a head-turner. If you shop, you can find one and you can get a deal. We paid $300 over invoice at $19,400 total for a loaded 2wd 5-spd. with L-package.
