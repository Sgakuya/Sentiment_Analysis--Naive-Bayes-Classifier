President Bushed had fooled me. I am 73 and a life long Democrat. In the beginning I thought President Bush was a moderate but his southern roots, his Fundamentalist Religion, his class affilliation have become clear. His tax cuts for the upper classes and his support for big business,his flagrant support for the religious right....his desire to remove Roe vs.Wade from our Constitution, to support Religion with nationalfunds diminishing a clear cut separation of church and state. All these have become clear in the last 6 months. We need to arouse the public to be aware and take action. Now, President Bush is willing to go the war. There are ways to isolate Iraq and pressure them without war....That isolation is growing and the people of Iraq will be able to force is abdication with pressure, not war. We must assure the people of Iraq that they will have our support and we help in their recovery. Let us flood this administration with letters and join the anti movement now growing. June Eagleton
