A surprisingly enjoyable movie. I would agree with Trinityk that Matt Damon did a great job in the action-hero role, and Franka Potente was just as good in an english speaking role as she was speaking German in Run Lola Run. The story is cool - Matt Damon is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea with a gun shot wound, some high tech gear, and absolutely no memory of who he is. The rest of the movie deals with Damon's quest to figure out who he is, why he has so many odd skills, and why there are people trying to kill him. In addition to good acting and a good storyline, the movie is pretty well made.... I recommend it.
