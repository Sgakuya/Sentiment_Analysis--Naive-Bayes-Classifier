The first book in the Christoper Snow series. I liked this novel alot more than it's sequel, and found myself halfway though the book before coming up for air. It's written so sharp that the pages turn quickly. Snow's character has a rare disease which makes him hypersensitive to light. He spends his entire life in the dark with little more than candlelight for illumination. Neat stuff and a neat idea, but I think the idea is a bit too comic booky to be used in a novel. I liked the way the story worked itself out in Fear Nothing but the parallels to Koontz's Midnight are too many. There are plenty of other Koontz novels out there so readers can skip these Snow books in favor of his other novels.
