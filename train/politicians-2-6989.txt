Normally, I am a forgiving person who tries to understand where people are coming from. In defense of the good reverend, he has done much to unite disparate groups of people who have been historically downtrodden, much like Dr. MLK and Cesar Chavez have done. He has been a strong voice of compassion and outreach in a world that seems to have forgotten the everyday little person and he is always hitting at a complacent white America's collective conscience, which is to assume responsibility towards your neighbor(s) in need. HOWEVER!!!!! The good reverend, for all the good he has done (or, at least, has talked much about), has been prone to think with Mr. Happy, especially in light of the fact that he fathered a child out of wedlock with one of his assistants. He has shown lapses in common sense and judgment, what with his reference to New York City and its Jewish population as Hymietown, and his support for Minister Louis Farrakhan. It is during these moments of sheer stupidity and ignorance that I feel sorry for the man. It shows me that JJ is all too human and struggles with his failings and faults, but because he occupies a position of prominence in the black community, his mishaps and dalliances are magnified to the Nth degree. Perhaps this is fair, or maybe it isn't. Reverend Jackson has many good ideas for this nation, but it seems that he suffers chronically from foot-in-mouth disease. That's a shame.
