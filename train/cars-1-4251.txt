i bought a 1997 brand new it was junk in the first 6000 miles it was towed away 3 times would not start. doors rattled. dash rattled. gaps in door fits as big as 3/8 in. this was top of the line touring model leather/awd/everything/ and let me tell you it was junk. I called Chevrolet and they asked me what I wanted to do . I wanted my $ back or another van, they laughed and me relly did! They said you will have to live with it. I ws in a rental car most of the time i owned it in 6000 miles I put on it it was in warranty shop 16 times !! piece of CRAP!!! PROBABLY WHY THEY CLOSED THE PLANT DOWN WHERE THEY ARE MADE !
