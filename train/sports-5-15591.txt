Here are some stats to consider with just a few weeks to go in the 2004 season: 29 TDs / 6 Ints. QB Rating: 107.2 Completion Percentage: 64%. This is the stuff of legends here. Beyond the numbers, he is a leader, a good guy, and worshipped by his teammates. Why hasn't TO been a distraction this year? Because the cult of personality of Donovan keeps him in line. Anybody who still thinks that McNabb is overrated is clearly from the Rush Limbaugh they should move him to wide receiver school of thinking. And that's a pretty ugly, outdated school if you catch my drift. **Original Comment** 5 Stars ** The total package. Beyond his speed, his strength, his arm - McNabb is a true leader with an even keeled temperament that makes him ideally suited to play in front of the rough Philly fans. I have never heard veteran players speak so highly of a virtual rookie. After recent Eagles' wins, a common theme has been Donovan would not let us lose, or I knew with Number 7 in there that we would pull it out. And if you want results, consider this. McNabb is the Eagles' ONLY offensive weapon. With Staley out, their running backs are awful. Their wide-outs rarely get open, and when they do, they consistently drop balls. Chad Lewis, though competent, is hardly a top tier tight end. Everyone on the field knows that the Eagles' offense consists of McNabb trying to make something happen, yet no one can stop him. This guy will no doubt go down as a Philadelphia hero, and if he improves his accuracy, one of the all time great QBs to play the game.
