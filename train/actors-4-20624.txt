Yeahhhh Wilmington, De!!! :=8D The MooCow is a big fan of Elizabeth Shue, and not only because she was born in the same place as he. She first came to the MooCow's attention in Adventures in Babysiting, a far-fatched comedy/fantasy that was all but held afloat by Ms. Shue's presence. Udder good performances since include Heart and Souls, Leaving Las Vegas, Deconstructing Harry, Palmetto, and Cousin Bette. Ms. Shue cowbines sweetness, a perky girl-next-door prettiness, and intense emotional skills. She is cownted among the premier lead actresses of her generation - lets hope she finds a role that showcases her extraordinary talents soon! :=8D
