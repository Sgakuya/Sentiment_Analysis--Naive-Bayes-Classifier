overall, i love this guy. He's has good handles, and even though he's 3rd in the league for turnovers, most of the time he can finish, and thats something that the magic really needed. He CAN shoot, dribble, take it in, and occasionally shoot a three, and is a MASSIVE threat on the fast break. A good stealer as well, and solid stats, 21 ppg, 5 rebs, and 7 assists pg. T-Mac is a good player, but u dont really find that many explosive point guards like steve-o, except ai, nash, and some others. I would actually have taken him over T. Magic won 15 more games this year than last year, and yes, we had the worst record last year, but guess what? we won 15 more games this year WITH all those injuries. So, yeah. Steve is good!
