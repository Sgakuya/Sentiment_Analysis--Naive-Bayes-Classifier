An absolutely amazing place and I can't wait to go back. Fortunately we have a friend who lives over there so we don't have to worry about accommodation - although the apartment that we rented was very affordable, gorgeous and in a central location. If you are planning to go, I'd say go in winter as there are hardly any tourists around and you'll get to see Prague properly and it really does look amazing covered in snow. But do make sure that you have a warm coat, a hat and decent gloves otherwise you won't want to go outside! If you are planning to go to pubs, pick the smaller ones as they won't be the ones targeted at tourists, therefore the prices won't be bumped up and its just nicer. If you are planning to drink a lot then I do advise you have the local food as its very hearty, filling, yummy and cheap. They really do put a lot onto your plate as well. Places to see - well, there's obviously the castle which is beautiful. The Charles Bridge is amazing and is adorned with statues all the way along and you really do get a great view of the city. There's lots more, but I advise you go go over there and see for yourself.
