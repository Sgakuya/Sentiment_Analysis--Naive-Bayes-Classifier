This is an excellentlive CD of guitar legend Ted Nugent. Nuge is a little bit high strung for most people's taste poltically. However, he is an amazing guitarist and decent singer. Part of his problem is that he is a better live performer than studio musician. He was amazing opening for KISS on their farewell tour. He blew them off the stage. I tip my hat to the man and this cd
