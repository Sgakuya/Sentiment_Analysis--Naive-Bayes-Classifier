For three years I walked around with Graceland in my CD player. This CD is abssolutely amazing. Devoted to letting the world know about the terror and misery that was being caused by apartheid in South Africa, this CD touched my heart, especially with the song The Boy in the Bubble . As told perfectly by ellajedlicka21, All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints is an amazing song, my favorite on the whole album. Especially the line, He says there's no doubt about it; it was the myth of fingerprints, I've seen 'em all and man they're all the same. I think that song has much more meaning than it appears to. Under African Skies is my second favorite. Paul Simon AND Linda Ronstadt were terrific. In Homeless , Joseph Shabalala and the rest of the African gang---their perfomance cannot be described by mere words. If I remember enough of my South African, the words zio yami mean something along the lines of help us . So touching! You Can Call Me Al is a great use of South African voices, with those lines at the end, If you'll be my bodyguard... and I can call you Betty... . I got this CD for my eleventh birthday, and now it's in pretty poor condition. Having been played continously for three years isn't the healthiest thing for a CD. But that shows how much I love the thing, doesn't it? Though my Graceland-obsession phase is a thing of the past, I now and again play the songs from this album. And I will never forget this album. Take care, everyone!
