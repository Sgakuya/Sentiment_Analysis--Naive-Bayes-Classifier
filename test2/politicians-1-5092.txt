Al Gore finally did the right thing...concession. I suppose old Al should have concentrated more on the Electoral College vote than the popular vote. But hey..he can always run again in four years...He will loose again..but he can run again. Maybe he should take a course on how the election process works in this country...I am glad he lost...by several recounts in fact. The US Supreme Court has several Judges that are heros and should be given medals. Thank God he lost....
