I have never really been a country music lover, however, my boyfriend listens to only country music. Thus, I have been forced to listen to it as well... I would never admit it to him but I really love some of the newer country music that is out today. When I first saw Billy Gilman's One Voice video on tv I cried... tonight I saw Oklahoma ... and again I cried... this boy is amazing! I can't wait to hear more of his music, he is a very talented young singer! I love music that moves me and there are few songs out today that could make me cry. Keep up the great work Billy!
