Great album, there is not a bad song on here. This is a great introduction for someone who is not familiar with her work. I will say that she is nothing less than this generation's Patsy Cline. Her voice is pure power. All the expected hits are on here: Independence Day, A Broken Wing, My Baby Loves Me, Life #9, Wrong Again, Whatever You Say, Happy Girl, and I Love You. There are four new songs on the album and they are all good--When God Fearing Women Get the Blues, Blessed, Where Would You Be, and the beautiful but heartbreaking Concrete Angel . My only gripe is that there were three excellent songs from her first album--The Time Has Come, Cheap Whiskey, and That's Me--that didn't make the album. Any true fan of Martina's will go pick up a copy of her first album The Time Has Come . It is excellent as well.
