I also bought the Dazzle 150 package with the Pinnacle 9 software. The hardware portion worked fairly well, but the colors did not come in well from my digital camcorder (Sony). The same tape burned good DVD's on my Phillips DVD player/burner. Many of the same problems listed in other reviews. I liked the editing software, but could NOT burn a DVD. Most of the time it would fail to render a complete video. Finally took the entire package back for a refund.
