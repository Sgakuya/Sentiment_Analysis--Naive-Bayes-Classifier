I think Britney Spears worries to much about putting on a great show than singing, I'd rather sing the songs and not dance as much than dance and not sing..if she doesnt want to sing on stage why doent she persue a career in dancing instead of singing, because apperently she cant do both at the same time...i think the cd is the same as the first and that it is all studio magic..the only thing that would change my mind is if i saw her sing her song LIVE!!!!
