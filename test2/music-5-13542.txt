Eminem may talk trash about people, but sometimes you have to go past the cover of the book! I think that Eminem is extremely talented and it's not because he's a white boy who can rap! He isn't scared to speak his mind and be honest about how he feels! That takes guts even if it makes everyone else sick! I know everyone else has opinions too, and I'm not trashin anyone who disagrees, I'm open for comments! (tripchick@juno.com)
