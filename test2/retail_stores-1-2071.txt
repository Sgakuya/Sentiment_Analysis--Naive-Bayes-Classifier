We were shopping for 50 LCD projection TV, so we got estimate in Bernies(elcetronic store) and told the sales rep that we also want to check the price in Circuit City near by. When we got to Circuit City, we were told that sales rep from bernies is Circuit's ex-employee, he called the manager and told the price he gave us. So we were told that we are not going to get better price. Circuit's sales rep was very rude to us, like we were doing something unfair. We did get better price in Best Buy and will never, ever go to Circuit City or Bernies again! I'd rather pay $1000 more in other store than treated like that again.
