The commercial aired in Los Angeles, channel 13 by Circuit City in which a father with a British accent tells his children that he has dual citizenship makes Circuit City appear ignorant or dishonorable and unabiding of U.S. laws. The United States does NOT recognize or acknowledge dual citizenship - from Britain, Iraq or Mexico. Those who make Circuit City advertisements should focus on creativity instead of political propoganda.
