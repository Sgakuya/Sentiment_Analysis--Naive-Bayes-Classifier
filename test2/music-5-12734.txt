After Lauryn Hill went solo, after being a member of the Fugees, she came out with this soulful and reflective album. It's a nice mix of Hip Hop, Soul, Gospel, Rap and R B. Most of her songs reflect her life now and looking back at her past experiences. One of her songs, 'Zion' is dedicated to her first child, son, Zion. It's very touching and sincere.
