Our forty-third quasi-president came into Washington with an agenda to rid the White House of anything that smacked of Clinton. Just because Clinton's politics and progressive political thought ranked up there with FDR was all the Re-smug-licans needed to turn the socio-economic clock back three decades. Dubya was NOT the popular choice for president. He's a leader with an asterisk next to his name, not unlike that of Rutherford Birchard Hayes. It has been shown through independent investigators that Florida's black and Hispanic vote in Dade, Broward and Volusia counties were either intimidated into not voting by Re-smug-lican hacks or were discarded without so much as a chad glanced at. Florida's 25 electoral votes were a political pawn used by Governor Jeb Whatever you want, Bro, I'll get for ya Bush and the Re-smug-lican majority in Tallahassee. You can't tell me that the Supreme Court of the United States wasn't politically motivated as per the outcome of the elections: a conservative Supreme Court stands a better chance of gaining another conservative Justice if a conservative President is elected! Hmmm, let's see...Scalia, O'Connor, Thomas, Kennedy, Rehnquist....that's 5 out of 9 reliable conservative, literal interpreters of the Constitution. And even if Kennedy and O'Connor waver, Rehnquist and Scalia are there to twist arms and have them cry out You won! Uncle! UUUUUUN-CLLLE!!! Hey, with a set-up like this, how can con-stupor-tives and Re-smug-licans not like what they see? So, Dubya is indeed my president, but I will always look at him and say two words: Jim Jeffords. Not only that, he reminds me of a cross between Mikey, the kid who tries Life cereal, and Alfred E. Neumann. Bush will still pander to the right-wing wackos and will only further polarize the political atmosphere in this country. Lotsa' luck, Georgie.
