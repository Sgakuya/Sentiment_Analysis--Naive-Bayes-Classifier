At the crossroads of the 20th century stands Woodrow Wilson: under his administration, the US became acclimated to intervening in Europe's wars, WW1 was ended in a way that would sustain communism in Russia and produce Hitler in Germany. We also got the IRS and a central bank that would (later) create the Great Depression. And Wilson was a KKK apologist to boot! As a Princetonian, I'm embarrassed that our university unleashed this elitist onto our systems of governance.
