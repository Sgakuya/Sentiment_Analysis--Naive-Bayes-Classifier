My first question is why is Jesse Jackson even on this list, he is not a politician he is a reverend and an activist. The same goes for Donald Trump, Al Sharpton, and others who have never been elected or nominated to hold a public office. Self-perpetuating support organizations do not count in my opinion. Maybe it would be more fitting to put these people under the 15 minutes of fame category. Secondly, what does race have to do with Presidential candidates? I do not care what color their skin is; I only care if they can do the job. I do not dislike Jackson himself, I dislike his actions. The only time you see him is when there is a racial stirring. You only see him when he can pound his fist and preach on slavery, injustice, and unbalance. If I saw him working quietly to make improvements on a regular basis, if I saw him working without standing on a soapbox, or if I saw the media struggle for interviews, I might think differently. There is usually a real clear indication of a persons principals and what others think of them, whether leaders are knocking on your door asking for help or whether you are always having to kick a door in to get attention. Doors are usually open to those with honor and principal. Any one can be loud and draw public attention, but loud does not always mean helpful, this site is evidence of that.
