If it were possible to give zero stars I would do so. My wife and I were shocked by the level of unprofessional behaviour of this company. They arrived late (appearing to have forgotten us), extorted additional money from us on delivery, insulted my wife when she called to find out where our posessions were, and never responded to our letter of complaint. This level of quality extends all the way to the owner of the Ontario bramch and head office in Vancouver as neither owner saw fit to respond. After reading other ratings we felt that we were lucky as, at least, our posessions arrived and were relatively unharmed (not perfect). It amazes me that such a bad company can be in bussiness for so long. I wonder whether there is a mob connection as a front to transport drugs around the country.
