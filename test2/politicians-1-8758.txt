I have to say pretty terrible, except for a few good things. He reduced the budget for the military, and also the morale was not good during this time. Also Hillary does'nt like the military, I read that she would have high ranking aides carry her bags onto the plane for her, she treated them like bell hops. A close aide of Clinton's has written a book about him and said at one time he and several other officers got together and considered resigning.
