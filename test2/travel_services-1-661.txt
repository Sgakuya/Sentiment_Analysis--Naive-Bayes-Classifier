The WORST airport I have ever had the misfortune to visit. I have been through LA airport at least 10 times, and each time has been a drama and full of stress. Long, long queues, you have to pay for a trolley, and have to wait around for ages to get a bus to take you to a different terminal. A nightmare to be avoided at all costs!
