This is the best album the chili peppers have done. The songs are sublime and amazing. They are the best band ever. This album shows that they can do rock anthyms as well as melodious guitar riffs. This album is the best you'll ever buy, though it is a bit expensive! 'Scar Tissue' is the best song ever!
