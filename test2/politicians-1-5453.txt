What can I say? In more ways than one, he's a big LOSER!!!!!!!! John! John! John! Thought you'd use the Hollyweird influence to get the vote. Well, it backfired, didn't it, Sad Sack? You should be ashamed of yourself. You ran a dirty, unfair, foul playing campaign and you know it. And hey! I guess Nice Guys don't ALWAYS finish last now do they, because hallelujah, we have President Bush for four more years!!! To sum it all up, thank God we were spared of the travesty of having this joker as President. I can sleep in peace knowing that W is watching out for all of us. Even you.
