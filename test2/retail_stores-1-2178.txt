I bought a Fujitsu Laptop from Fry's. I got the full-extended warranty. It has never worked right. Many hardware problems they have never fixed. On my Fourth time brining it in to be repaired after holding it another 4 months they did nothing to fix it. Instead they tried to charge me 100 bucks just to get my broken computer back. On top of that they want another 500 to allegedly fix it. It is well under there warrantee period. They made a false clam of water damage. I guess they just made it up. They clamed they have pictures. Most of the time this computer has been in their possession or with me not working. I will be filing a lawsuit. Over the years I have heard many bad things about this Frys. I though buying a name brand computer I would be safe. I was wrong! DONT BUY ANYTHING AT FRYS!!! I bought a Triton file server that never worked. I several friends who have bought different things there all have been defective in some way. DONT BUY ANYTHING AT FRYS!!! You have been warned.
