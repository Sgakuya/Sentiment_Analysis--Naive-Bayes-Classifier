I work at ruby tuesdays, and I would NEVER EVER eat there. I only give it one star because it won't let me give none. Aside from the working conditions being questionable the food is disgusting, comes frozen, premade and nothing is ever cooked fresh. Its a poor version of TGIFriday's, which is no fine dinning experience in and of itself!
