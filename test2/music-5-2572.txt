Damn this is a great record. I am not sure if I am into a Beach Boys phase right now or what, but it is the first time I have ever really given them a serious chance and I am now finding that so much of their music is genius. 'Pet Sounds' has to be one of their best records (next to some greatest hits one that you can find anywhere). Listen to it, sing along to it and wonder about it, it is an all-around terrific record. What was Brian Wilson thinking about when he wrote this magic? God only knows.... get it? Pick it up from your local record store or on-line dealer and wish you lived in Califronia for a while.
