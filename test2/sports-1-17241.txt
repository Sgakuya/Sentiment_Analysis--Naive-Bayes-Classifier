Always hated the Cowboys. Used to respect them prior to Jerry Jones, though. I love Troy Aikman and Emmit Smith as players, but can't bring myself to root for them. PLUS, the Boys broke the Steelers record of 4 Super bowl wins... AND, they and the Braves in baseball call themselves America's team. What a farce. America's team is the Yankees. Period.
