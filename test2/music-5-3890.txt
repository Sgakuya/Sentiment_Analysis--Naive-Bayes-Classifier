This was one of his best albums, period. Too bad this guy became the Truman Capote of the rock world. A swishy, limp-wristed imitation of his former self, more into his celebrity and long-distant positive track record to bother himself with generating any work product during his more mature years. Honestly, how much mileage does this once musically promising sodomite figure he's gonna get out of "Candle In The Wind?" As long as the cultural droolers continue to drool, I guess...
