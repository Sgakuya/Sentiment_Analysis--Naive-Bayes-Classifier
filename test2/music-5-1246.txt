People that haven't already bought Nasty Little Thoughts...you have no idea what you're missing! I feel sorry for you actually. I hate when I buy a cd because I like one song. Then it turns out the rest of the cd sucks. I promise that you won't be wasting your money at all if you buy it. In fact, they're in the process of creating a new album. So don't miss it. I could go on and on, but I can't 'cause I don't have that much time. So check out www.stroke9.com ....Keep Strokin'! Rock on.
