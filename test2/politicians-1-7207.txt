Jesse Jackson sets a bad example for a so-called minister of gospel. He sows seeds of discord rather than seeds of peace and love. He needs to practice what he preaches. A hypocrite of the highest order. He makes merchandise of many simple-minded black people. As one black man to another,I have a brain and I know how to use it.
