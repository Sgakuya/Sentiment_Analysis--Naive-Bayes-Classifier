John McCain is the single most disingenuous, traitor to the Republican party I have ever had the misfortune to experience. What a disgusting egotist. Not only is he an immature little worm, but he is also as big a hypocrite as Jesse Jackson. Change parties John, the Ass is much more appropriate for you.
