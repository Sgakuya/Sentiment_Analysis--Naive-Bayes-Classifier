I will never shop at Circuit City again for as long as I live...I recieved a DVD player for my car for Christmas which was purchased from Circuit City. It took the Road Shop people 8 hours to discover they couldn't install it and when I went back to get me car, I found that they left all my equipment in my car which was parked in the darkest part of the parking lot, my window was smashed and everything was stolen...Now they are refusing to take responsibility. Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired!
