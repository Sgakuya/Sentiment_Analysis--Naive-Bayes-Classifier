Tom Ridge's so-called homeland security treats New York City like a neglected stepchild. New York is top target for terrorists. Yet this city receives $5-a-head for security and rank 49th in aid. Non-risk states like Wyoming get more-anti-terror funding. $38-a person. What are they going to bomb there? Cows. I have to agree with Moosekarloff. Tom is a worthless piece of crap!!!!
