I wish I could rate Wal-mart worse than Terrible. My husband used to go there and he would cash his pay check there while we did our grocery shopping. Knowing how poorly trained their employees are, we should have known better. The other day, he cashed his check there. He thought the cashier had counted it back correctly. He did not realize that any money was missing untill he got to work, and it was obvious that he was at least 100 dollars short. He called the store and they said they would check to see if the register was over, but made no promises. He came home and found the receipt and was able to determine that the cashier had shorted him 130 dollars. He called again and they told him to come on up, and refunded only 100 dollars. Apparantly they felt the need to keep our thirty bucks. I realise that i'm lucky to have gotten the 100 back, but 30 dollars is a lot of money. That's diapers and milk for my baby right there. I will pray for Wal-mart to spontaneously combust.
