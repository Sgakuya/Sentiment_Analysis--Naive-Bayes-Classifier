counting crows are beyond words to me. their songs are like poetry set to music. you put on any of their songs and drift away, whatever mood you may be in. the songs take you back to just being. simply being. being mad, happy, sad, hopeful, lost, content, anxious, impatient, whatever, adam's got a song for you.
