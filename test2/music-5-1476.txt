Phenomonal album. The best tracks are the lesser played tracks...Tiny Daggers, Calling All Nations and Kick. However, Need You Tonight/Mediate is definitely a standout. Michael Hutchence was the quintesential frontman and is seriously missed in rock music. You don't find many frontmen with that kind of charisma anymore...regardless of what the critics say.
