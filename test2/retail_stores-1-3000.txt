On June 24th 1985 my husband and I were married. I wore my wedding ring for eight years only to take it off to have it checked. This July I broke a prong off. Where else would I take but to the store were it was boght? My husband designed my ring It is the only material thing that I treasured. Because of someone being carless my ring is gone forever. Three days later I was told my wedding ring was destroyed. It's done and over get over it is what I was told. My husband got to pick another ring but it will never be the same. NEVER have I been told sorry or been treated so badly. NEVER will I deal with these people again.
