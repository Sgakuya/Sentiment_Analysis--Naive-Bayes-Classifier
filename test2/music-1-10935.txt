N'SYNC sucks. Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit, and Korn rock. That's all I have to say about that. I'm tired of seeing these fake people winning all the awards and getting #1 on TRL. Yeah, they can sing but can they write some really good lyrics? No. I'd only advise crazy teenyboppers to get this cd. Everyone else, well just stay away from it.
