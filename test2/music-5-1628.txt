Just a great CD. There are so many styles to it, so many emotions. There's regret, happiness, anger, Coldplay has just outdone themselves with this one. I love Clocks, In My Place, and God Put a Smile on My Face. But the best song had to be The Scientist. It is a slower song with a great beat, and just excellent lyrics. If you see this CD just grab it right off the shelf. Believe me, you won't be disappointed.
