Seven years of heartbreak, seven years of seeing a mediocre team on the field, seven years of uncommitted playoff pushes. Mistake after mistake, poor evaluation after poor evaluation, it has to come to an end. The Phillies will again be in the hunt coming down the stretch this season, and this will be Ed's last chance to blow it. And believe me, He'll trade Howard for a bag of peanuts at the trade deadline and this team will falter at the end by 3 games.
