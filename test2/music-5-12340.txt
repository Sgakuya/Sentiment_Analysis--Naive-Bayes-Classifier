Kelly Price's style is superb. Her music touches several aspects of the emotions. She offers her fans a chance to relax and yet, while listening to the same CD, you find yourself up rocking to the beat. I have both CD's and will add her next CD to my collection when it comes out. Kelly, keep up the GOOD work.
