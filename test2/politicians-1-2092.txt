RECALL GRAY DAVIS - www.RecallGrayDavis.com - Gray Davis is a horribly corrupted and incompetent Governor for California. Under his watch California saw a devastating Energy Crisis that sent the utility bills of the poor and elderly skyrocketing. Hundreds of thousands of jobs left the state as businesses could not cope with the exorbitant electricity rates. Then Davis mismanaged the state's fiscal matters so atrociously that California racked up the largest budget deficit for any state in the nation's history. A $34.6 BILLION budget deficit. Gray Davis has been corrupted by moneyed special interests who he pimped for the largest amount of money raised (extorted) in a campaign for any candidate for Governor in history. Do the math: + Davis sends California into a massive budget deficit through giant Big Government spending and no fiscal restraint or accountability. + But when it comes to his political account Gray Davis is careful with the money and raises more through unethical means than any other candidate for Governor in history. RECALL GRAY DAVIS!!
