Mr. Day's incompetence is matched only by the Canadian Alliance members' stupidity for voting him leader in the first place. Syrupy words and a pretty face might get politicians elected in the U.S. but up here the electorate (usually) sees through it like wet t-shirt. The key to CA success (God help us if it ever happens) will be a moderation of policy, not a flashy leader. Sorry boys.
