Oh hell naw....what we have here is an establishmemt that sells stokes with a side of heart attacks. I have never in my life seen chicken more greasier than this s*** here. I mean really, it's almost like they fry the chicken and then pour grease over it after it was done....ugh. Go to Popeye's or for that matter buy chicken from the supermarket and fry it up yourself.
