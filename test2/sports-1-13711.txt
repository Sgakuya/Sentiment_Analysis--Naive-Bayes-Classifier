Easily the worst coach I have ever seen!! His main contribution was supposed to be an offensive mind, and Raven's offense has stunk every year he has been there, it is terrible. He has no defense experience, all of that success was due to Marvin Lewis, Jack Del Rio and Mike Nolan. Billick is a terrible coach and makes horrible personnel decisions (ie: Grback over Dilfer after Dilfer wins the Super Bowl). How Billick has a job still is beyone my understanding.
