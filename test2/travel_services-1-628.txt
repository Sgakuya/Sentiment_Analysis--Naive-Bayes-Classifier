Hate it. Hope I never have to go there again. Brought a rental car back there and the first sign for rentals was just before you exit to turn. The place was way too crowded and congested and just hard to figure out for a newcomer. It's friggin' hot enough in ATL but to be frustrated in a screwy airport sucks. Long lines and the tram system sucks as well. Trams leave you in the middle of the terminal with people everywhere going all over the place. They also have a Smoking Room, where all the smoking addicts can cram themselves into to smoke. The worst thing you'll ever see.
