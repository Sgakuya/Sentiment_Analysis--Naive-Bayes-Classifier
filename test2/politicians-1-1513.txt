I'm flabbergasted by the positive reviews and BS claims about Saddam Hussein and the reasoning for his brutal actions. There is way too much indisputable evidence that this man is a lunatic murderer, and much of it was aired by liberal network shows before they decided to, by virtue of agenda and political ideology, turn against the war. Americans really need to read the goddamn newspaper more and study their history, and foreigners should inform themselves on the whole Iraq situation before making ignorant comments about how America is imperialist, which we aren't. I just came back from Canada and I've had to put up with so many ignorant comments from my relatives and acquaintances about America, and I'm tired. The same happened to me in Australia, Trinidad and Barbados. To many people, the idea that Bush and America are like Darth Vader and the Evil Empire is too irresistable to pass up. Sorry to ruin the party, but Iraq was long overdue to be toppled. I can't imagine how anyone could read up on the history of Saddam's regime on Wikipedia or anywhere else and not feel utter contempt for the man.
