This...is possibly the best recorded album ever made in the history of rock and roll. So full of heart, straying from the typical non-political style of Queen, and it's enough to make the coldest of human beings melt. Is this truly the highest rating I can give? The title song of the album, The Miracle , is one of the only songs I have ever heard that expresses cynicism and hope at the same time...showing that Jerry Falwell, to use an example, and other bigots have a funny idea of what miracles are, and at the same time expressing hope for a better future with a little less hate and violence. The slightly more lighthearted Invisible Man seems to be a play on George Orwell's Thought Police ( John Deacon, I'm in your room, I'm in your bed, I'm in your life, and I'm in your head, like the CIA, or the FBI... so on and so forth). And then we have my other personal faves on the album, I Want It All , and Was It All Worth It? . The second mentioned is sort of a symbolic autobiography told in the form of excellent song, and I Want It All is simply a powerful anthem about freedom. By far the most political Queen album ever done, this is a godlike piece of work that no other band will ever be able to duplicate. Take carel, everyone!
