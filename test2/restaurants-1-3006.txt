I used to love their rainbow sherbet when I was young, but oh how easily pleased I was. About 5 years ago I got a job at a new frozen custard place that was opening in our town. Up until then all we had was a TCBY and a Baskin Robbins. During training, my boss pretty much forbade us to eat any of that other junk ever again. He also explained that once we tried the frozen custard, that we wouldn't even want to eat any of the other stuff. He was so right. It was and is so good. It's made fresh every day and it is so creamy. Even though I only worked there for one summer, it has stuck with me. Now I go about once a week for my fix. Ever since that fateful summer, I have not even considered choosing any of the other so called ice cream places. They just pale in comparison.
