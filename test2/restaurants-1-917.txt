Pretty disappointed with he lack of taste in the subs. All you can taste is the bread, which is at best decent, aside from that all of their processed meats and cheeses taste exactly the same. Most of their veggies have no taste either. I guess the only good thing about them is their soups and the fact that their subs are consistently garbage. I prefer Jimmy Johns any day over subway
