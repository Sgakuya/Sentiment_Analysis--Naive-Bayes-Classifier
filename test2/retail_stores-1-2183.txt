i shopped at fry's for years even though our local store was painted like a cow and mooed at you, with several bad experiences. the last time i went there was just stupid. the day before i was discharged from the army after a couple years in afghanistan, i had scruffy hair and still had my beard(required by my military service) i had just woken up and threw an adidas jumpsuit on--i looked like a criminal according to fry's. I need to reitterate that i am not a big strong guy, or particularly violent, or generally in a bad mood, but today was a bad day. i just needed one $35 item and waited in their obnoxious line until it was my turn. i walked to the register that the girl told me to go to and made my purchase. as I was putting my wallet in my back pocket i felt the distinct feeling of being frisked, without thinking i threw an elbow and backed it up turning my body, arm, and wrist, grabbing around a neck. next thing i know there is 16 year old girl lying on the floor with a bloody nose. her manager had told her to forcebly retrieve what he told her i stole, of course i didn't, i feel terrible about what happened, but old reflexes die hard. the manager yelled at me that i was a thief, and was also going to jail for assault, but i put him in a choke hold till he passed out and noone else tried to stop me from leaving but i was pulled over 2 blocks away. the dallas police laughed and let me go saying that they had had previous problems with severel different magagers at fry's. I will never shop at fry's or outpost.com again. i just can't get over the way people were looking at me as i was leaving. ps i have not stolen since i stole a pack of gum when i was in the 3rd grade.
