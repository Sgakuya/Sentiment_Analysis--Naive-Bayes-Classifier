Nelly is candy-pop rap at it's worst; worse than Will Smith, b/c he tries to be a gangsta through his recycled rhymes and pointless garbage. When Nelly first came out, I thought he was fairly decent. Then the overplay of videos and songs on the radio bombarded me. I saw his goofy face on the cover of magazines. His rhyming skills aren't impressive at all. He's in the same category of rap crap that 80% of Cash Money and 95% of No Limit titles fall under. If you want true hip-hop, pick up some 2pac, Dead Prez, Mos Def, The Roots, Xzibit, Outkast, and even Dr. Dre. Not this 'juvenile' b.s.
