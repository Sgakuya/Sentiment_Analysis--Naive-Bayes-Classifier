My personal favourite Led Zep album. From the first song right to the last it explodes with energy. Rootsy, rocky, bluesy, metal - who cares what you want to call it.Its none of these but all of them at the same time. The sleazy rock of Dazed and Confused to the bluesy you shook me to the beautifull guitar and vocals of Babe i'm gonna leave you and the storming Communication Breakdown this album can not be beatan by any other Zep album - or many other albums for that matter.
