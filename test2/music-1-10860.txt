.5 out of 5.0 Stars: Horrible Honestly, Pink, how do you suspect that ANYONE will believe your notion that you are punk when you release an album entitled M!ssundaztood and write a song called Get This Party Started . Don't encourage this trainwreck, people. She is untalented and seemingly possesses an identity crisis problem. She is not vocally or musically talented, and must have others to write her songs for her, therefore inferring that she possesses no songwriting ability. Don't buy this. Please. It is virtually identical to every single other artist that are self-manifestated divas (whatever that means anymore). She's untalented and is an abomination to mankind.
