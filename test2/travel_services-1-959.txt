The worst ever! First, they did not honor my reservation, then after hours of trying to get a new truck which I had paid for in advance, truck broke down on highway, and u-haul had me pay out of pocket for repairs and tow!!!!! BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY. There are a lot of alternatives (Ryder, Penske, Budget).
