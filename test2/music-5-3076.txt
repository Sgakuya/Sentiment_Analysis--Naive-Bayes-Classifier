Neil's 3rd solo album, and one of his best, best known for "Southern Man," the title track, and the hit "Only Love Can Break Your Heart." There's other great songs on this though, such as "Tell Me Why," and "I Believe in You," to name just two. The lyrics and guitars are impressive, and Neil is able to effectively explore country, bluesy stuff, hard rock, and plaintive singer/songwriter ballads with equal ease.
