About 5 years ago, after hearing how influential Robert Johnson has been on modern musicians, I bought his two-CD Complete Recordings. My level of music sophistication is not all that advanced, but even I could appreciate the intensity and skill of this pioneering blues guitarist. Don't expect slick music, though - these are old, scratchy recordings.
