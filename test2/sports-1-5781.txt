Carolina is State's biggest rival, right? Okay, shouldn't the best show up against his rival? When it comes to UNC, Hodge has never done anything but run his mouth! He talks like they are the Braves and we are the Mets, yet, State can't touch us!- AND NEVER HAS! We'll see who the NBA scouts think is the best in the conf., won't we Rashad? By the way, didn't any of you who call Hodge the best, see McCants dominate him last year? What, are you blind? You have actually seen what 'Hodge vs. McCants' looks like, haven't you?
