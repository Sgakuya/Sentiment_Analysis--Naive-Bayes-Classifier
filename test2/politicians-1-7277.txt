Jesse Jackson is one of the reasons racism is still alive. He makes sure that the races are still divided. Now, he is helping to make a mess of our country. A reverend? What a joke. Jackson is useless. Always has to cry racism when he is one of the biggest racists there is. Maybe if we ignore him, he'll go away
