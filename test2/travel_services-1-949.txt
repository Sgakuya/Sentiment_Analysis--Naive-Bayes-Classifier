I moved from Chicago to Phoneix using two Bekins agencies, Boyer Rosene in Chicago and Olympic in Phoneix. Packing was terrible, there was a lot of damage and the delivery was pathetic. They lost over six of our cartons, damaged thousands of dollars of my personal goods and refused at both ends to take ANY responsibility. DO NOT USE BEKINS IF YOU VALUE YOUR POSSESIONS.
