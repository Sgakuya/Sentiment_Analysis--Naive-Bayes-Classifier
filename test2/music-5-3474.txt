One of the top handful of rock and roll albums ever recorded. An extremely advanced and mature concept of very solid heft. Proof positive of Townshend's excellence as a composer, going well beyond the ditty-craft of rock and roll songwriting. The album is excllently played, first note to last. Great tracks: "5:15," "The Dirty Jobs," "I'm One," "Bell Boy," etc. This album marked the peak of classic rock and roll, the swan song of the counter culture, the last artifact of the lingering 1960s ethos.
