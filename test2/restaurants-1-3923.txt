I have recieved horrible service from the fairfax location of Pizza Bolis. They brought the wrong pizza to us and did not offer any compensation. The manger is not apologetic in any way shape or form. The new pizzas took over 2 hours to get to our office. This branch is a huge disgrace to the pizza bolis name and the manager should not have a job.
