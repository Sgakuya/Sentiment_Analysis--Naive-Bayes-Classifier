I dont think these guys have even been to Chicago to taste their pizza. Safeway frozen pizza is better! Our Salad was hot, the salad plated just came out of the dishwasher sot they were 180 degrees. MMM!good! We never got our beer cards. All around bad! If you dont know real chicago pizza you might like this stuff! Support you local pizza joint and take a trip to chicago for the real stuff. These guys just to deliver!
