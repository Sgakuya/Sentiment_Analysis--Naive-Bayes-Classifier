I can't believe anyone would want to shop at this store. One of my friends and I went in there to buy a shirt we saw in one of their window displays. The size in the display was my friends size and there weren't anymore on the floor. When we asked an employee to get it out of the window she gave us a blank stare like we were scum of the earth. She told us they can't take anything out of the window. Being a former employee of Gap, Inc I knew they could sell the display (all the policies are the same for Banana, Gap, and Old Navy). After fighting with the employee and resorting to speak with the manager (who wasn't happy with her employee) we finally got the shirt out of the window. When the original girl went to ring us up she almost had a heart attack when my friend pulled out her employee discount card. Needless to say I will never EVER shop at Banana Republic again.
