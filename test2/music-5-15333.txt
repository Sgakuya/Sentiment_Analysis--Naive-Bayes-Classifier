Moby is a great artist and has definatly made his presence known both on MTV, in dance clubs, on the radio and at raves. Porcelain is, in my opinion, my favorite song and I love how it sounds. I bought Moby's CD as soon as it came out that week and i still listen to it all the time. Also, Body Rock is a very popular song and I hear it all over the place. His music is suitable for all ages and this album is a definite 5 stars with me because you can get into the music very easily and it's appealing.
