It was supposed to be geared toward young kids and it is geared too much for older. My little ones are 5 and 3. We went today for a birthday party and it was packed. It seemed like the parents were worse than the kids. My little girls each won 7 tickets playing games for their age. There would be adults that would have 300-400 tickets cashing them in the receipt machine and when we FINALLY got our turn to put 7 tickets through the machine, my girls were so sad to see that they could not afford to buy anything. The lady at the counter let them pick from a 15 ticket shelf and they got a pack of Smarties candy. My heart broke for them. This may be something that cannot be easliy solved. When I was young, we would go to Show Biz Pizza, which was the same idea and it was all for the young kids. The parents did not hord the games and tickets because there were only things for the little ones. The parents can go to an arcade for the older games. I know that with a family it is hard to make all of the ages happy, but I think that it would be okay to have a place just for the younger ones. Maybe a separate prize counter for the 8 and under where their tickets counted for more. My girls get so excited for Chuckie Cheese and it is so sad to see them when we leave. The other children did not seem to be supervised so they would not share rides or take turns and the parents that were present were not much better. We stood in line for the drawing picture game (where you watch your picture being sketched) while a family of 5 took 15 different poses with each combination (dad and kid, dad and mom, mom and kid) My 1 year old was crying and they did not even consider that it was a busy day and there were others waiting for a turn. Some of these problems may be hard to fix. Maybe a sign saying that there is a 1 picture limit and then you have to get back into line. Your concept for a restaurant is great, I just think that you forgot the reason for the restaurant.
