I love this soundtrack. I think this is one of the greatest soundtracks of all time because of the brilliant songwriting and beautiful singing. I especially enjoy the song by Whitney Houston, I Will Always Love You. because it means no matter where a person is, someone who loves that person will always be in the other person's heart. I love this soundtrack because it makes me think of my loved ones.
