I have to initially admit i've never tasted nor ever seen a Sonic drive-in, but never in my life do i ever want to walk or drive into one solely because of that new commercial with the two women. One mistakes a broch on the other's shirt for lettuce and they start doing these annoying facial gestures. Oh!!! I want to puke! I despise the commercials. Just because of them, I can't eat there.
