This album rocks! I hated Hanson for years. I heard they were coming back and I was like...oh great. But you know what? I heard their song This Time Around and just loved it! It had such a new and mature sound! I went out and bought the single. Later, I bought the album. All the songs are awesome. They have meaning and Hanson is wise beyond their years. They have really matured and deserve to be called a great ROCK band. Just listen to Dying to be Alive or This Time Around When you hear that one part do you know why I died? your heart melts. This is one great album and EVERYONE should get it.
