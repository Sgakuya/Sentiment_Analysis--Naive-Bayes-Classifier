Can't stand this guy. He is a horrible president. You notice how Bin Laden waited to get us until after Clinton was out of office? Because he knew what an idiot Bush is, so now would be a great time to target America. Hardly anything bad happened when Clinton was president. I don't personally like Clinton because he's a liar, but he was still a very good president. Bush is ridiculous. He's so incredibly homophobic and I take serious offense to that. LOL and did you hear he tried to ban gay sex? What the hell is that? Gay people have the same rights as everyone else. If heterosexuals are allowed to fornicate, so are homosexuals. Gays are people too and have the same rights as everyone else. And we had no business coming after Iraq. Bush ordered to go to war just because that's what he wanted. He just wanted to carry out his father's plan. But really, we had no business coming after them. And yet he still won't admit he was wrong. I can't wait till his term is up. He needs to get the hell out of office before he blows up the country. If not, we're doomed.
