Although they have made improvements this airport is simply manic and stressful. The layout is bizarre, no main terminal, rather 5 seperated concourse terminals. When your decending into Boston you may notice that your jet is circleing around the metro area about 2 or 3 times before you land because it's so crowded. As reccommended below try Manchester NH or Providence RI. They are both small, easy, short lines and both airports are only and hour from the Boston area.
