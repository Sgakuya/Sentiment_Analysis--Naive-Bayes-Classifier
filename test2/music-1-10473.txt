As a classicly trained singer, I am offended at the success this album has achieved. People often claim this album makes them like opera, but I have news for you. This is not in any way opera. This cd follows the horrible popera tradition popularized by Andrea Bocelli and Charlotte Church. This is a disc of lame, synth-heavy arrangements of bad songs in Italian to make them sound classical. If you want to hear a real male singer, get a early (pre-three tenors) Pavarotti or any of the Bryn Terfel cds.
