Fuddrucker's in the Northern Virginia area (Herndon, Reston, Fairfax) are places NOT to take young children to eat at. Food handling at these three locations have made my children very sick - poor handling standards for the raw hamburger meat - that nearly put my youngest in the hospital due to foodborne illness. We're not talking about bad service or long waits but an establishment that does not follow proper food handling practices, in turn, making people sick.
