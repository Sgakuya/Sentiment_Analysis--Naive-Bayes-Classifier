Seattle U-haul on 15th Northwest did not have 12' trailer as arranged 5 days in advance.. refered us to a U-Haul facility 12 miles away (165th and Aurora). Tho the 165th and Aurora dealer had the requested trailer, their trailer's electrical connection did not work with our vehicle's factory supplied trailer connection so we opted to rent a a U-haul truck. Big mistake!!! Drove truck 12 miles back to loading site. Loaded truck. Engine failed to start. Unloaded truck and called 800 number for service (rental office does not service their trucks). Three hours later the truck is repaired (new starter motor). Too late to load and transfer materials so returned truck to U-haul dealer. We were charged for truck rental and mileage (at $1.00/mile) for a total cost of $80. U-Haul's unwrited policy is that they do not take responsiblity for the serviceability of their equipment. You rent it, you risk it. If it doesn't work its your problem, not theirs. This is blatant, intentional fraud!!!
