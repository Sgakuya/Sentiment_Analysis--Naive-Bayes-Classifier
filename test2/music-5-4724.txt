I rank it this high not for last year's Ozzfest, but for the other Ozzfests. The ones that featured Pantera, Fear Factory, Type O' Negative, Rob Zombie, System of A Down, Tool, Megadeth, Motorhead, Godsmack, and so on. Nowhere else will you'll hear such a great lineup of actual hard rock/metal acts. Then of course, what would Ozzfest be without The great and all powerful OZZ! himself and Black Sabbath. The men who made Heavy Metal possible For this, we salute you guys.
