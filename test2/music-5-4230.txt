One of the best studio Phish CDs ever!!! This CD demonstrates Phish's growth and maturity musically. In particular, Bliss into Billy Breathes will pull you into a more peaceful and beautiful world. A note to people that aren't familiar with Phish however, this is not your typical Phish CD. I believe, to really appreciate the artistry of it's arrangements, you have to be familiar with the earlier work of Phish. I also believe, to really appreciate Phish as a band, you have to be familiar with (and comfortable with) listening to complex jazz progressions and blending musical styles (and you have to see them live). This is not a CD you put on for background music at a party, it's serious art for the serious listener.
