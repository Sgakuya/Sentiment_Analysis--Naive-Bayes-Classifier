Pretty irresponsible quote from this guy making the rounds. At best, it's nonsensical. (the recent attacks on judges have been by criminals). At worst, he's saying that US judges DESERVE the recent spate of violence. Here's the quote for those that haven't seen it: I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. Certainly nothing new, but we seem to have run through a spate of courthouse violence recently that's been on the news and I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in - engage in violence.
