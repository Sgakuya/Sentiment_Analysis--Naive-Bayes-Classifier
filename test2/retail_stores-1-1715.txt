35 checkout lanes, 3 checkers. 50 people in line with full baskets. and forget about asking for help finding anything. if you do manage to find an employee, be prepared for a 'what the fu-- do you want?' attitude. even the managers, none of them know how to do anything outside of their department. i recently got my oil changed there. it took the managers over an hour to figure out where the key was to get my paper work, then they took another half hour to figure out which barcode they were supposed to scan. i guess you get what you pay for. I'm changing my own oil from now on.
