I am a current Employee and I think that cracker barrel sucks. They treat you like a theif if your till is off, and of all things they make you carry a clear purse to work. If you take a lunch box they check it before you leave, and worst of all you have to have a manager walk you out of the building. How paranoid can they be. I have worked at several restarunts and I have never been treated this badly as an employee. And to think I used to think this place was cool untill I worked here.
