I loved it. Different from the Newsboys' previous CDs, of course--it's their first worship album. However I thought it was very well done. A good mix of traditional songs and newer ones. I personally like It is You and the title track best, but it's hard to pick--they're all great. All the songs are worship, but they don't all sound the same at all.
