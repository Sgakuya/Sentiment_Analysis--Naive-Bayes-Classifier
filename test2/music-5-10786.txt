This is the best CD of the year! Pink is GREAT! I love the style of her music - Love is such a crazy thing is a beautiful song. She has a great voice - talented - writes alot of her own music. I see a long, successful career for her. I look forward to hearing more from her. I listen to her CD at home and in the car. Buy the CD - you'll love it!
