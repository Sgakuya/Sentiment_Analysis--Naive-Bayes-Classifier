I think that not only is Billy immensely enjoyable to listen to (I'm a professiol 30 something mother with teens and preteens) but he's also a lot of fun to watch on TV. My 9 and 11 year old daughters like to listen to him but so does my 14 year old son and myself. His O Holy Night was the BEST I have EVER heard. I hope he keep cultivating his voice and only do that because he enjoys it.
