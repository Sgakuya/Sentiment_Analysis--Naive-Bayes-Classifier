Just when I thought that I couldn't despise this man anymore, he goes and starts all this election mess. Didn't he say after before the first recount that he would concede it the reults failed to favor him fore the sake of the country? WOW! another Gore lie, what a surprise. George Bush has won all three of the reconts and it is time to say enough is enough. Gore reminds me of a spoiled little boy who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He cares nothing for this country and only wants to keep a potion of power. I can't stand to see how he and his lawyers are teaching our children to disregard rules and argue until you get what you want. My four year old niece does the same thing. Florida has certain election laws that must be followed and he has chosen to challenge all of them. If rules and laws are not followed then what is the point of having them? He should have conceded when he had the chance. At least then he would have gained some dignity and class. This country is rocking to its foundation all because he won't stop moaning about what he lost. How selfish and undignified! But I guess thats what makes him a true product of the clinton administration.
