Unbelievable band!! They brought blues-based stripped down rock n' roll to the forefront in a time of glam bands. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for the 80's music, but G n R came ripping thru with rockin' music that had soulfoul meaning. The talent level was great as well. It is every rock fans dream for the Gunners to reunite and kick our asses!! Oh yeah, Axl - let you're ego deflate a bit, kick the Bucket(head) and get with original band.
