George W. Bush will never have the distinguised honor of saying he was elected president. Thank God for that. Dumbya who has been quoted as saying that he trust US the people lied. He trusted the courts because that's what gave him the keys to the White House. He got what he deserved though, a divided nation that he and he alone separated. God help our country.
