I am the mother of a 20 month old and have another on the way. I think it is sad what this AWFUL man is doing to our country. I am trying to teach my child to be non discrimatory and to be a loving Christian. This is something that Jesse Jacskon IS DEFINITELY NOT!! He should NOT call himself a Reverend and I really feel that he is a disgrace to his race. He has successfully segregated the black community from the others in our community by speaking out about things he THINKS have substance, but do not. They simply create turmoil and frustration for the people who would otherwise ALL (black, white, etc.) be willing to come together as a nation. He is truly a disgrace to our America. I pray for him that God will talk to his heart and make him realize the damage he has done and is doing to all of our people.
