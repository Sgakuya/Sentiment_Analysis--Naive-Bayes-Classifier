George W. Bush is the worst President in American history. During this entire (and excruciatingly long) term, I have been ashamed to call myself an American citizen. I for one, will do my best to make certain that next year we have a ELECTED President, who isn't a functionally illiterate right-wing fascist. SO LONG BUSH AND DICK - don't let the door hit you in the a** on the way out.
