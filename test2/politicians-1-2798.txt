A shill for the right-wing wackos. This guy represents the family-values-get-married-before-you-have-children crowd and he fathers a child out of wedlock? Watts is acceptable to the Re-smug-licans because he does not threaten their white world and their socio-eco-political hegemony. Watts goes along to get along and doesn't make waves because he wants to present a united front so he can ascend the GOP hierarchy. Good luck, Watts. Even you, as a black man, would realize that the pablum-puking GOP would never truly accept you.
