Does anyone read history any more or are we just following the rough draft in the New York Times? Gorbachev is recognized in his homeland as an ineffectual, corrupt tyrant who didn't have the iron to crush the popular risings in Russia or Eastern Europe or the moral courage and desire to lead in real democratic reform. He was constantly appealing to the communist sympathetic left in the west to save him and apparently they did their job too well because the only people who still appreciate him are western democrats. Ironic and very stupid.
