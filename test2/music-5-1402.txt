Joshua Tree is easily one of U2's best CDs (along with War, Unforgettable Fire, and Achtung Baby). U2 has really impressed me with its longevity and musical evolution - Joshua Tree, for example, sounds very different than both Boy (recorded in the early 80s) and Zooropa (mid 90s), but all three CDs are good. And Joshua Tree is one of those rare CDs that doesn't have a bad song - I can't think of a single one I don't like. The song Running to Stand Still, which you never hear on the radio, is probably my favorite, but the entire CD is great.
