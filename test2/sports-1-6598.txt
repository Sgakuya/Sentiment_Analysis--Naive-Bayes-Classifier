psh.. what is there to say about state? not much... hodge is a joke, i don't see what he is so cocky about ' i can still hate on illian even tho vasco played at carolina, which is the only thing interesting about illian! carolina plays state for the 2nd time in about 10 minutes and they aint ready! UPDATE: once again... CAROLINA swept STATE!!! when we can be you without our best player, thats pretty pathetic...
