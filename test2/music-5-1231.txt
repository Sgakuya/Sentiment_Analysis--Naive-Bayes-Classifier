What can I say, Green Day rules. Hayley, I think that all the songs are unique in their own way. I have heard albums that sound exactly the same the whole way through. Nimrod is definatly not one of them. It has slow, fast, loud and just great songs. A wide variety of sounds for your listening pleasure.
