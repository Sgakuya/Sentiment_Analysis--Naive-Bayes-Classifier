My favorite SRV cd, although his major debut effort, Texas Flood, and even the hard-to-find In the Beginning give it a run (the latter for very different reasons than the first -- it won;t be for every SRV fan). Rises to the top because of strength of its title song - my favcorite SRV single - but also includes Voodoo Chile (slight return), Tin Pan Alley, Cold Shot and some SRV in conversation.
