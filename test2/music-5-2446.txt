I was around when Revolver was first released in 1966. I thought at the time that it was a groundbreaking album, the like of which I had never heard. I still listen to it my feelings are still the same. The Beatles were the most influential rock roll bands of all time historically, that is beyond dispute. The fact that this discussion is going on, nearly 40 years later, proves that. Is the same thing happening about the Monkees??
