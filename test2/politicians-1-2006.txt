here's my feeling on the state of ny......i posted it under 'new york' but i think it has a lot of revalence to the great job pataki is doing.....sorry it's long....... From the 1990-2000 census, the city of Rochester lost 11,099 people, Syracuse lost 16,549, Buffalo lost 35,283 (source is:www.ersys.com/usa/36/3663000/growth.htm Want additional proof check out this link from the Ithaca Journal, which talks about population loss from 1990-2000: the 53 counties of Upstate New York grew by a modest 1 percent and the largest Upstate cities suffered population drains: Buffalo lost 10.8 percent, Rochester 5.1 percent, Syracuse 10.1 percent, Albany 5.4 percent and Schenectady 5.7 percent. source is http://www.theithacajournal.com/communities/census2000/20010604/640912.html.....the cities are dying dude. Kodak is practically gone in Rochester, Carrier is gone from Syracuse.....There is nothing here but snow. Also, Syracuse has lost the largest amount of young people leaving the area for any place in the country. New York does have the highest taxes too; check it out http://www.taxfoundation.org/statelocal03.html .....but just a few more things....as Upstaters, you realize a heck of a lot of our tax dollars don't go here.....they go to the pretensious bastards in nyc. we can never get a budget passed on time; we have the worst governor and two sorry senators who only care about downstate. Original Post below: I live here and I am just about ready to move out. First, upstate is very nice as I live in Syracuse. However, the economy sucks all over upstate. Buffalo, Albany, Rochester, and Syracuse are losing population and jobs like crazy. Additionally, New York is probably the poorest run state, it can never pass a budget on time....plus the state is ruled by opportunists like Pataki and Clinton who could care less about regular people. The only success one can probably find here is if one wants to live and work in NYC; it's not my cup of tea but if you like disparity then there ya go. Don't get me wrong, I love big cities like Boston and Chicago but NYC is full of pretensious bastards. New York also has the highest taxes of any state in the country and the 2nd highest auto insurance rates. For the life of me, I cannot understand why NY is #4 on this list. has done nothing for upstate new york has he has been slowly watching it die........since we can't recall him, just be sure to kick him in the you know where next time you see him. i'm done w/ny and i'm moving out soon.....we have the highest taxes.
