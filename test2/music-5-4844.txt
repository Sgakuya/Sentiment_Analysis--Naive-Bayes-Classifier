This is definately a CD worth purchasing- Martina McBride is one of the best female singers in country music today. I'm glad that Concrete Angels finally made it onto the radio. It's such a beautiful song, but it is also very heartbreaking. It is a shame that the events depicted in that song so often occur in the real world. I also like When God Fearin' Women Get the Blues , I love you , and Where Would You Be? . However, my favorte song, espescially in light of the recent divisions that are emerging in our country, is Independence Day . I will never forget when she performed that in the days following September 11th. This definately belongs at the top of the list- the greatest hits from the greatest singers!
