very expensive for cheap stuff. can get the same stuff at walmart for many $$$ less. I worked at walmart and would hear many people say they almost bought it at k mart untill they looked here. nothing beats walmarts prices, and if they do they will compare, k mart will not compare unless you have a add. and thats sad if you have to take ads to a store to get them to mark down their prices. wouldn't it be nice to just walk into a place knowing their the cheapiest in town?
