I am sorry to say that this soundtrack did not live up to my expectations. Seriously people, can you be more redundant? The music is OK, until about the second or third track in which you see a pattern of repetitiveness. I don't know what's worse: the putrid sound of this soundtrack or the $14.00 I had to waste on buying this (P.S.- I returned it).
