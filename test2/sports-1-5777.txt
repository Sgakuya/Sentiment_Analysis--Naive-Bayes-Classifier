Just when I thought he couldn't possibly get any dumber. I just read your comments in the Raleigh News and Observer, Julius. Congratulations, you have once again lit a fire under the ass of McCants! Some people never learn their lesson I guess. Anyway, thanks. And HEE'LL see ya soon.***************** **************************************** **************************************** ****************UPDATE: Originally made this comment on OCT. 25th, but since Hodge's embarrassment is now less than a week away, I felt the need to update it . You ready to back up those preseason words, Jules? Well, you better get ready, boy, here he comes. Didn't your momma tell you to be careful what you wish for? And make no mistake, Roy will make sure the whole team (not just McCants)remembers.******* **************************************** **************************************** *************UPDATE- Hi there. Who's the p*ssy now? Did those words taste good? You ate an awful lot of them,huh? How was YOUR post game shower at the Dean Dome, bitch? I guess the good news is you're a senior - only one more painful month.
