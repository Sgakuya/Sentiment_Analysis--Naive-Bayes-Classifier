Just One More Update: Don't want to get into a tit-for-tat thing here, Eschew. I do enjoy reading your opinions and you're certainly passionate on the subject. Just one or 2 points, and then enough, at least so far as I'm concerned, since I doubt we'll ever change the opinion of the other. I think any objective examination of the history of the Soviet Union will quite clearly demonstrate how moribund it was by the 70's and 80's, if not earlier. It's not exactly a subtle thing. As for Lech Walesa, I'll accept your statement that attributed credit to Reagan (I think he also felt the influence of the Pope was beneficial). Also, I'm unabashedly a liberal, and my apologies if I sometimes come across as too doctrinaire, but I could also say that the majority of your opinions, Eschew, sound as if they come from the Conservative Playbook, or any episode of O'Reilly or Hannity, with the provocative language intact. Your opinions are nothing more than that, the same as mine are; they are empirical evidence of nothing. Brainwashed diatribe? A mind to reason with? Come now...that's a little insulting, no? I tend to respect conservatives from an older generation more simply because their opinions are not nearly so predictable or uniform as those of the neo-cons and ditto-heads out there now. They also seemed less angry and shrill as a general rule. I don't mean disrespect for you; like I said, I think you articulate the current conservative by-line very well, even entertainingly. I also don't claim to be a scholar, but I do try to keep myself informed about what is currently going on, as well as what happened in the past, since history has a tendency to repeat itself. I think far too many people in this country today, liberals as well as conservatives, know depressingly little of their own or anybody else's history. So, let's agree to disagree, which I guess is the whole point of this website.// Update: To Eschew Obfuscation...Dear Lord, eyes to see...how about a mind to reason? Five minutes of CNN? How about 10 minutes of Fox? No offense, Eschew, but you need to open a friggin' history book that covers international events before the Carter Presidency. The Soviet Union was moribund long before Reagan appeared on the international scene. It toppled over, in part, because of a decades-long process that included its own cumbersome weight and narrowness; its murderous history that went back to the days of Lenin and Trotsky, not to mention Stalin; its decades-old intolerance; the prescience and foresight of Gorbachev, not Reagan; its decades-long stifling of independent critical thought among its own citizens; its ill-advised meddling in the affairs of Africa, the Middle East, South America, and Asia...this process was going on long before Reagan, and long before Carter. Of course, a more pointed and troubling question would be...are the citizens of the former Soviet Union really that much better off now that they can enjoy the advantages of American-style capitalism? Ethnic rivalries that were quiescent under the Soviet Union have now broken out in prolonged, bloody violence. Moscow now brings to mind stories of the Wild West, or Capone's Chicago. The bulk of the people still live in dire poverty. American businessmen are being shot down in the streets. Organized crime elements are selling off nuclear components to the highest bidders. Prostitution, drugs, pornography...all are rampant. As for Lech Walesa, he started his anti-government activities in 1976 when (gasp!) Carter was president. And Reagan restored America's pride in itself by doing what exactly? Invading Grenada? The Iran-Contra scandal? Starting the process of virtually eliminating the middle-class and introducing a new class to American society- the working poor? The hordes of mentally-ill homeless on the city streets? By helping to transform our presumably secular society into a theocracy of Born Again zealots and bigots? Is military superiority really the criterion you use to judge the merits of a particular society? I don't hate Reagan. He was what he was...a terrible, callous President.// Before Bush, Reagan was the greatest idiot to ever grace the Oval Office. The figurehead for American greed and rapaciousness during the 80's and beyond. Unlike Bush, this B-movie actor at least knew how to make a speech. His vaunted charisma was lost on me, but I guess it existed, since so many people have commented on it. It always bothered me that so many otherwise intelligent people were and are so slavishly devoted to the memory of this fool. A horrible president.
