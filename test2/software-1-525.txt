Make the bad paperclip go away! And stop formatting and correcting every word I type! Maybe I LIKE not capitalizing the first word of every line. What do you think about that, eh? And who cares if my sentence is passive? I don't! This program uses more RAM than a database server, and that's a lot! Microsoft Word needs to die.
