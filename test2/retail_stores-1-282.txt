V.S. sucks because they charge your credit card to redeem gift cards or store credits. Thanks for nothing! I tell all my friends (for our group's future brides) that those gift cards make for a hassle of a gift. Better to go with Fredrick's...unless their policy is the same. :( Also, who are these people who are overweight or obese, and get angry when lingerie looks bad on them? It's lingerie, people! It's not a intended to perform miracles on your bod! Eat less (or better yet, NO) meat, dairy (cheese - you heard me!), and exercise...then go shopping for garters and g-strings, sillies! It's not made for 20-year-olds, it's made for sexy bodies. Or you can cram yourself into their ample sizes. Your choice. Blaming them is not going to distract us from whom is truly to blame - yourself.
