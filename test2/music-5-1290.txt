What more could you want from an album?! From the first track (hanging on the telephone) we are given an indication of the sheer fun contained within the album's 12 tracks. 'One Way Or Another' , 'Pretty Baby' and 'Picture This' are some of the finest post-punk songs you will find and I am just sorry that I cannot award Parallel Lines 6 stars!
