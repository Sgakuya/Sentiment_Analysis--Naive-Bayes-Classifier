Mary J. Blige is a constant work in progress. Her previous work has taken her musical fans on an emotional journey of life on the urban tip. Mary has told us What's the 411 on being young, full of life, and seeking Real Love . She took Love to the Limit and remixed the hell out of it. My Life is the real life urban drama being played out in much of Young America. She was not ashamed to Share Her World and give us an intimate portrait of what it s like to be a woman of independent means and to rely on her own strength. Mary then took us on The Tour to further squash the rumors that she was a strictly studio voice. Mary the new work by Mary J. Blige is a Passionate Masterpiece. Her voice sounds strong and confidante. There is a certain self-assurance that seeps into every song I have heard. With Deep Inside Mary revisits the Michael Jackson can t people just leave-me-alone attitude that has defined her career. Benny and the Jets serves as the sample that brings this song to life. My personal favorite is the disco classic Let No Man Put Asunder this First Choice remake is outstanding and a surprising choice by Mary J. I can t wait to hear the extended remixes on this one. Lauryn Hill lends her magic to the in your face anthem All that I can say . Don t waste your time blends perfectly the voices of The Queen of Soul (Aretha Franklin) and The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul (Mary J. Blige). Mary J. Blige only gets better and leaves in her wake a list of songs that are considered today s classics. Her new set promises to add to that ever-growing list. So sit back, pop in Mary s Joint (New CD), relax and let Ms. Blige take you on her emotional testimony of life.
