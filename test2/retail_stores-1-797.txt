I will rate Guess Customer service as TERRIBLE. I bought some jeans that shrank incredibly, and when I went to exchange (not return mind you, just exchange) I was accused of having the jeans for years (even though I had the sales receipt showing 2 weeks). When I went to report this to the corporate customer service, their automated phone system repeatedly disconnected me. Guess where I am not shopping anymore?
