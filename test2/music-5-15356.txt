EIFFEL 65 RULES THIS ENTIRE WORLD!!! My favorite song was Your Clown. It is beautiful. I also like the song My Console because its about Playstation. Its like the bomb ya'll. Take my advice. If you like dance hits you'll love Eiffel 65's Europop. I for one, am one of many that want to know what happened to Eiffel 65. Please e-mail me if you know about anything they have done since Blue was big @ MG.Austin@Prodigy.net thanx
