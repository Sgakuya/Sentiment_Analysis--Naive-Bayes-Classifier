I agree that the arrangements on Josh Groban's are more pop oriented than opera oriented. I think that Josh Groban's voice more than the arrangements conjure up the image of an opera singer. I believe that Josh could sing opera and I hope that he does. Right now David Foster is basically in charge of Josh's career and Foster is a pop music arranger. Josh will also gain recognition and fame, not to mention financial security by selling pop releases. I'd much rather listen to Josh's brand of pop music than to listen to a singer like Bruce Springsteen who cannot really sing. Josh has a fabulous voice!!! Although I could do without the electric guitars in Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, Josh's singing is top notch. He does not break the line (as so many singers would do), but connects the notes with an gorgeous legato sound. I will definitely buy any CD Josh Groban releases whether it be pop or classical.
