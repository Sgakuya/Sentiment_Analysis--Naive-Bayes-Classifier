This man, while being a vicious enemy of democracy, is an absurd fossil from our low brow political past (1980s). His Congressional record is telling enough, he voted against a ban on cop killer bullets, against creating a Department of Education, against Civil Rights. His own daughter is gay, but he is firmly against gay rights. What kind of man is this? Be gone and stay gone.
