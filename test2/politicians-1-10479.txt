The man is a warmonger and quite possibly a psychopath. I don't believe that he is dumb. I believe that he will *play* dumb to achieve power, while the majority of people don't think twice about what he is really thinking. Let alone the fact that he gives little concern to women, minorities, and education, while proselytizing and moralizing. (*My* personal belief system will never be dictated by my government!) He is turning the U.S. into a police state and I am embarrassed to call him my President.
