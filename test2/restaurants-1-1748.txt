I once interviewed a kid for a job that worked at Taco Bell. I asked him what was the worst thing about working there. He said, "cleaning the garbage cans, the oil stains them yellow and we could never get rid of it, no matter what we tried". I can't stand the smell that comes from these places and a lot of the food is worst for you then any burger. I can say that they still use it but they used coconut oil which contains more fat then most other oils.
