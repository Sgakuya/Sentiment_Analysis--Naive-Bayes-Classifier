callitdowntheline75, well said, except that almost every president of the 20th century had an affair, though he was one of the only ones to have a child (maybe the only one; I don't study presidential affiars). I see yet again people have added points because he could have done well. You cannot rate a president on what they could have done had they not died. And for the people giving him a 4 and a lot of 5s, stop that. Don't rate him higher because you think he is better than Bush. You are changing a fair poll of peoples opinions because you want someone last. Vote them last and rate the others with knowledge, not with emotions regarding Dubya. Trust me, I would give Kennedy a 1 and everyone else a 5 (other than Bush) if I was doing it your way, but Kennedy was not terrible, he was only bad. Vote truthfully.
