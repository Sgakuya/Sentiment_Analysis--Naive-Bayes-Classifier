The great thing about this two CD set (and the accompanying TV special that was on HBO) is that it provides a glimpse of what we Springsteen fans have been talking about for all these years. The Boss is one of the greatest live rock performers in music history and this CD does a fine job of capturing the emotion and electricity of the concert. From hits like Born to Run and Jungleland to lesser known gems like Land of Hope and Dreams and If I Should Fall Behind (the latter of which closed most of the shows on the tour and stayed with you for weeks), the set list is a great cross section of his work. Without question, the ten minute or so version of Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out is the high point. Even if you aren't a Bruce fan, have a listen. Then, you'll understand...
