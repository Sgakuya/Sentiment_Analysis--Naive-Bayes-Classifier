One of the best studio albums from a band that could never be truely experienced from a studio album. I love this album because it gets back to the roots of real American music, Grateful Dead style. The songs are classics, elegently composed and layered with interwoven melodies (even the bass lines). The lyrics are some of Hunter's best. But, as it is with any of the Dead's studio albums, this recording doesn't even begin to communicate the true genius of the Dead's playing. Their albums are like starting points, a way to lay a foundation for a song and create familiarity with the structure and changes involved. Then, when you heard the boys jam it out live, for 20 minutes longer than the studio version, stretching and bending and revolving the melodies and rhythms back around themselves, you had some foundation to hold on to... some way to see just how far the live jam had taken off from the ordinary. And that's really what the Dead were all about. So, while I think this album deserves a 5 for listening to at home, it deserves a 10 because of the music it inspired live and because of it's basis in classic American folk music.
