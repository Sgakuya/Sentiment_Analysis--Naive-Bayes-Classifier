Outside of recruiting this guy is a joke. He was a loser at Wake, took a playoff team in the NFL and made them mediocre, and then took Virginia and had them win less than 7 for the first time in over a decade. The real talent behind last year's success was the offensive coordinator, and now that he has bailed, Amway Al is going to find the ACC to be a whole lot tougher this year.
