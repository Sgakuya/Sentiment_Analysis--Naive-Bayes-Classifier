Tiffany Arbuckle has a beautiful voice and candycoatedwaterdrops confirms this. Good song choices include 'Stranded', 'Here With Me', 'Drugstore Jesus', and 'Phobic'. A few songs don't work so well, such as the title track and a couple others near the album's end. But the first 2/3rd's of the cd justifies its purchase and cements Plumb's status as a top-notch Christian artist.
