Controlling people through fear is not what a good leader should do. Nor appeal to the masses through his spirtuality, despite the fact that he's an dope-smoking DUI offender. The rich love him, a lot of other people voted for him just because he found the big man in the clouds. Who cares how bad the economy is, as long as you have Jesus in your heart.
