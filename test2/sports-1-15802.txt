Worthless as a human being. Nearly just as worthless on the field the last couple years. Overrated because he's a mouthy bastard. Even back in his days at Tampa Bay, I'd say Anthony McFarland was the better DT. McFarland is just as fast as Sapp, stronger, and is more sound in his playing technique, specifically wrapping up when tackling. On top of that, McFarland won't make a complete ass out of himself on the mic. Too bad Sapp's punk ass sells jerseys for some reason.
