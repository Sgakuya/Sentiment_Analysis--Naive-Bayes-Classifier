I had a trip to Seattle for business. I decided to go a couple days early for fun. I reserved a car using Priceline and got Alamo. I reserved a midsize but they gave me a Chevy Monte Carlo. Although, others may like that I did not feel comfortable driving that big of a car. Since I had accidently made the rental for only 2 days I decided to try it out. I didn't like it so I went to Orbitz and reserved a car at Advantage for $21.50/day for a compact. I decided I'd feel safer driving that. Some other companies were around $22 or so but I thought Advantage was smaller and would be eager to please. Hah! I confirmed my rental the morning of it. I returned my Alamo car. As I was waiting for the Advantage shuttle, I called to make sure they still had my rental. They assured me they did and said the shuttle should be there any minute. Over 20 minutes later the shuttle finally arrived. I gave them all my info. THEN, at THAT time, they finally told me all they had were vans! Okay, I know they can substitute but a van is way different than a compact car. I asked if they had anything else and they said just a Jeep Liberty (smaller than the van for sure) but that would be $49.99/day. They said there was NO WAY they could give the Jeep for the same price. They then called Dollar and had them agree to give me there $52.99 Subaru for the $21.50 rate I made with them. So, they can make another company honor their price but they can't? The shuttle driver said I should try Thrifty and dropped me off there. They quoted me $57.99. I had to take Thrifty's shuttle back to the airport, beg all the rental placed for a car but they quoted me rates like $50 for an economy. I then got the Dollar shuttle to their offsite location. It was like a 3 hour ordeal thanks to Advantage! This after a night of 3 hours sleep and I had lots of work to do. They had me in tears!
