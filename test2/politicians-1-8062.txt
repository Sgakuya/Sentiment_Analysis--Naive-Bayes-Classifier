my dad's a life-long Republican and union member(go figure),I was a teen ager in the '50's,and even according to his accounts today,the 1950's were about as hard of times as any this country's ever seen,that being said, why would anyone trust a republikan to hold office?and the reason republicans don't like pickles,is 'cause they can't get their head in the jar.
