I've played this so much, I've flattened the pits and divots in the CD! THE best release of 1990 that (nearly) no one heard. Right from the rising vocal intro of "Divine Intervention", you know you've got hold of something special. Sweet is a unique talent (not only writes, sings, and produces, but plays bass, electric, and acoustic rhythm guitars) who comes across with earnest sincerity, letting you into his world of requited love (and the toll it takes) one great song at a time. Best known for the anime videos "I've Been Waiting" and "Girlfriend", this one's also got the downbeat marvel "Looking At The Sun", the bluesy "Day For Night", the radio-friendly finger-snappers "Evangeline" and "I Wanted To Tell You", and "Winona" (an almost-country-mellow, pedal steel guitar ballad that's the gem of the bunch, in my opinion). Get this CD any way you can (look for the winsome sunrise shot of Tuesday Weld on the cover), you won't be disappointed.
