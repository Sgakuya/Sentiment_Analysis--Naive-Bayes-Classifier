Jesse Jackson needs to keep his nose out of the election process...George W Bush won this election fair and square....every vote was counted...at least twice...once by machine and once by hand...what Jackson really means is...keep counting until we get the results we want...no other possiblility is acceptable other than a Gore whitehouse...get real Jesse....Gore lost...fair and square....
