Big Springsteen fan, and I love this album. The way that the songs are ordered on the album, it is almost like a time line that a lot of relationships fall into. You start of with songs like 'Ain't Got You' and 'Tougher Then the Rest' which are about being attracted to someone and trying to start a relationship with them. Then you have 'All That Heaven Will Allow' about when the relationship is at is peak, both people are so hapy it seems like nothing could go wrong. Then you have 'Spare Parts' and 'Cautious Man' which is basically about doubts people may have as to how strong their love really is. Followed by 'Walk Like A Man', about the wedding. 'Tunnele Of Love' is about the uncertainty that may follow after a couple gets married and trying to ride out whatever problems may arrise. This is followed by 'Brilliant Disguise' 'Two Faces', 'One Step Up' about desention and lost trust, basically the fall of love. Then 'When You're Alone' which is about separation. Finally, we have 'Valentines Day' which is about a second chance, an attempt to fall in love again.
