This is quite possibly the greatest Springsteen Record ever! Although now that I say it, I really love so many of the other ones just as much! Anyway, this one (despite not including Jungleland!) captured my heart from the very first second, and erased any doubt that the Boss was not the best in the world! I can't quite describe what happens to me when I listen to it, but I get really sentimental, ready to rock, and filled with every feeling in between. This album captures almost every human emotion, and I love every song for it's unique characteristics. Bruce is the very greatest in the world, and although he's very underrated, just one listen to this collection, will show you that! I can't think of anything else to say about it that won't just reiterate what I've already said. The boss is the BEST! The lyric book is a treat just on it's own, and I can't count for the life of me how many times I've listened to this! And I make sure I have it near enough to play in my walkman before drifting off every night! Sandy Thunder Road Born to Run Because the Night Backstreets Jersey Girl so many many great songs to love! It is the greatest in the universe!!!!
