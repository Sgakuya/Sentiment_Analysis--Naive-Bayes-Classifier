My shopping experiences with nordstrom.com were horrible!!! When they say it usually takes up to 8 business days for delivery, it takes way more than that!!! My last order took almost 1/2 month to deliver and I recently placed an order on Nov 18 which I still have not yet received the order today (Dec 7). However, their customer service online chat and email with prompt reply which they deserve a credit for that.
