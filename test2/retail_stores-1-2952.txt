I bought a white gold onyx/diamond ring for my father about 4 months ago and was going to pay for it with cash on the spot but the sales rep wouldnt leave me alone about the kay credit card which i told him over and over again that i wasnt interested in, but he kept at it till i finally agreed. That was issue #1. When my father tried on the ring it was about a half a size to big and i brought it back to be resized and was told that because of the placement of the onyx that resizing it would cause the onyx to pop out, so he said he would order the size i needed. A week later he calls me in and tells me that he is just gonna resize it. I said "WHAT!". "After you just told me last week it would ruin the ring?". Thats when he started with his minipulation tactics, he started trying to tell me that he only wanted to reorder it cause it would be quicker and made up several other excuses. I told him to take the damn ring back and hand me over my down payment. *WARNING* they do whatever it takes to get a sale. They will ruin your jewelry, replace priceless diamonds with cheap ones (happened to my aunt). DONT SHOP THERE! (Location: Fort myers florida)
