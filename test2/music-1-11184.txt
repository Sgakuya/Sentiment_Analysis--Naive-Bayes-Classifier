O.k. I am bored so I'll do this. First off he is talentless. Second off he is trying to be Michael Jackson. Whatever! I honestly don't see why so many people like him! Ugh! Besides what is so special about his looks?? I've seen tons of guys pull off that look so why does he get the special treatment?? Find something new and fresh, geez Justin can't ya come up with your own ideas and style??
