Too many opinions on here, so let's list some facts: Economics - US unemployment never fell below 15% during peacetime under FDR, GDP growth was terrible, private industry was decimated, the dollar went off the gold standard, banks were closed down in 1933, and he introduced the same massive government spending and intervention programs as Japan in the 1990s-present day, with similar effect. The worst economic record of any president, only disguised by his clever Wag the Dog -style entry into WWII. Honesty Integrity - told the public he would maintain the value of the dollar, then devalued in 1933 after forcing people to hand over their gold savings; repeatedly told America he would not lead them into WWII whilst knowingly provoking the Japs into an attack and promising Churchill that he would get America into the war; made his sons wife into millionaires with corrupt bribe-taking back room pork barrel deals; tried to blackball journalists who investigated his dealings or criticise his policies. Upholding the constitution - every president takes an oath to do this, but FDR time after time violated the constitution and went directly against its principles. The Supreme Court (which FDR eventually packed with his own hand-picked stooges) overturned more FDR legislation (over 50%) as unconstitutional/illegal than any other president. Had no respect for the separation of powers, as he tried to concentrate dictatorial power in the hands of the executive branch. Foreign policy - deliberately provoked Japan into attacking, deliberately left Pearl Harbour undefended (he knew about the attack hours in advance but held the warning back), thus knowingly causing the death of thousands of US troops and dragging America into WWII; made repeated craven concessions to Stalin at Yalta, thus handing over Eastern Europe to 50 years of communist tyranny. Had many known communist spies agents in his administration. Stood by as Jews were barred from entering the US, thus condemning them to death in Nazi death chambers. Domestic policies: Interred hundreds of thousands of American *citizens* (mostly of Japanese origin) in Nazi-style concentration camps during WWII. Launched massive assault on private property and business; made holding gold illegal thus confiscating private savings; ordered troops to burn and destroy farmers crops throughout the midwest thus condemning them to poverty; effectively nationalised many industries, creating price-raising cartels or monopolies. Tax rates hiked to extortionate levels (top rate over 70% compared to 7% in early 1900s); launched massive public works programs that created white elephant projects and began the pattern of huge government deficits and debt levels that still plague us today. Roosevelt was probably the most dishonest lying President apart from Nixon; he was a corrupt conniving unprincipled demagogue who destroyed the economy for a decade; he trampled over the constitution, freedom, and private property rights; he deliberately sacrificed the men at Pearl Harbour so he could Wag the Dog and get re-elected by stirring up war fever, then conducted the war half-heartedly (pathetic compared to Churchill) before capitulating to history's worst dictator at Yalta and condeming 100 million Eastern Europeans to half a century of tyranny, plunging the west into a terrifying Cold War with the constant spectre of nuclear destruction. To get the facts on Roosevelt, read The Roosevelt Myth by John T. Flynn, a journalist at the time who backs up all his claims with excellent research based on impartial iron-clad sources. Forget the myths you read at high school or in the papers - read the facts and make up your own mind.
