Headed GW VP search commitee and surprise picked himself even though he has health issues and was not the best candidate. Is a fascist, will not tolerate dissent or even a healthy debate on policy. Lets politics decide issues, not what is best for the country. Won't even support his gay daughter on gay issues. Will bash anyone that disagrees with him call them unamerican, not supporting the troops , weak on terrorism..the usual republican fearmongering. They don't have anything positive so they just use fear and intimidation and tell you things would be worse with someone else. same thing that got mussolini, hitler, franco and stalin to power. George Soros who was a persecuted child in eastern europe during Hitler's reign was so reminded of that time that he has pledged his millions to fight this administration.
