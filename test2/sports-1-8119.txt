This guy is one of the biggest babies in the NBA. All he seems to care about is looking cool. When asked what his top goals in life were he said, making it to the NBA and having his own shoe. Notice there is nothing about winning a championship or even anything team related. This idiot actually had the gull to request Dr J to be hired as the GM. Who on earth would hire a man with no coaching experience and a man who has no clue how to run and manage a club. He doesn't seem to care that his team would be run into the ground. He lacks the heart and determination to win. The man seems content on jacking up jump shot after jump shot, even if he is missing them all. He is most certainly not a team player. Carter hogs the ball and doesn't care about the team. He is always injured and is always whining about this or that. He has a bloated ego even though he has not accomplished anything noteworthy in the NBA. His big claim to fame is that he won the 2000 Dunk Competition and he didn't want to give up his 2003 All-Star spot to Michael Jordan. Someone needs to tell him looking cool during a dunk doesn't mean squat when it comes to winning games. How can a man who was injured for 30 games not want to give up his starting spot to the greatest player ever? Talk about selfish. If things don't go his way, he starts crying like a 3 year old that has his bottle taken away. Charles Oakley was right about this man. He lacks the balls to do anything great in the NBA. Hopefully his career will end prematurely with the likes of Larry Johnson, Isiah Rider and Shawn Kemp. UPDATE Nov 23 2004: RAPTORS' CARTER NOT DUNKING ANYMORE. Enough said. Carter is pathetic. At this point I'd trade him for a cardboard cut out of Lebron James.
