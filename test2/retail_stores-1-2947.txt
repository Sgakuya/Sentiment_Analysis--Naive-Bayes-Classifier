My fiance just bought my ring from Kay Jewelers in July 2005. It was a solitare princess cut diamond. When I went in to have it sized, my measurements came to be 5 3/4. The manager explained to me that they dont size like that (which is a complete lie) then after I complained and they finally did it, I got my ring back and it was a mess from there. First off the tag that states14K was gone, the head was crooked, stone was loose, and the sides where not even with the stone and was all jagged. I brought it back and explained all of this too them. The manager was very rude to me and said that because of the size I got that the ring is suppose to look like this. Lets just say my fiance paid $5500 for this and I dont believe that it should look like that. They took it in for a week and when I got it back the stamp was back on, but stone was still loose, head was crooked and jagged edges. I was very upset because I wanted to show my family so I took it with me to another town. I went to the mall to get my ring cleaned at Kays and the manager there said my stone was loose and that she needed to send it off. So I lost my ring for another week. After the week was over I went to pick up my ring and the jeweler that fixes ring said that my stone had three chips in underneath and that he could not even fix it because it was in such bad shape. They made be get another ring of equal value and I had to have it sized again. This was a horrible experience not only for me but for my poor fiance. I would never by anthing from them again, not even get my ring cleaned. I hope that nobody has to go through this ecperience.
