Their donuts always sucked, now they are freezing the dough and they are even worse if possible...it's fat Canadians buying the coffee that keeps that place going. By the by, I drink my coffee black and Timmie's is only average joe. It's all you blobs out their with the double cream. Next time you go in, ask for your cream on the side and have a look at it. It's been mixed with so much sugar and still has so much fat in it that it's like lumpy yogurt. People that by Timmie's coffeee don't want to drink coffee, they want cocoa
