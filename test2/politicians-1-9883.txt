POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES: Herbert Hoover was an honest, well-intentioned man who was a firm believer in volunteerism and a public-private partnership between the people and the government. He was a firm believer in rights ofr Native Americans and planned on initiating many more Social Programs such as federal aid to education than his predacessor did. NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES: Herbert Hoover's biggest problem wasn't that he did not stop the Depression, but in turn, he refused to acknowledge that any such Depression existed. At a time when over 10 Million were unemployed and dozens of people were homeless and poverty-stricken in 1930, he had the audacity to make the statement that no one in this country is actually starving . He was naiive enough to believe that the local governments would be able to turn the economy around with next to no federal governmental aid. Only when time for re-election came around did he create the Reconstruction Finance Board which granted federally funded loans to states to deal with the economic Depression. He also asked Congress for numerous funds for Social programs to stimulate the growing tide of unemployment, but by the time he came to his senses, it was too little too late. FINAL ANALYSIS: Had Herbert Hoover presided over the country at a different time, a time when prosperity was rampid, then he may have faired much better as President. However, his failure to acknowledge that a Depression was looming in the American economy eventually led to not only the downfall of the American economy but his own downfall.
