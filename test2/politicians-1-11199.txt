The pride of the Democratic Party- former Klu Klux Klansmen. The only Senator with the dubious distinction of voting against Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas and Condi Rice. He thinks we talk about race too much and he's known many white nig*ers in his time. Meaning of course there still are black ones. The proclaimed conscience of the Democratic party fits right in with its members and reveals what the party truly is: a collection of interest groups competing for power to advance their agendas. Subsequently they will get in bed with anyone who will do so as the agenda being advanced what is valued not the character of the actual leader. Every wonder why liberals can't get a grip on the values issue? It's because they more aptly discuss valuables. This disgrace- Byrd, is a perfect fit in the Democratic Party.
