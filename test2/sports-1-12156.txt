Is there such thing as a -1.. Does anyone even watch football. Chris Rix is the worst quarterback ever to be in a Seminole uniform.... FSU is insane, and for all you college kids, taking Intro. to Psych... The definition of insanity, is to continue to do something, unbeneficial, with the same result.... Get rid of Rix, and the problem would be solved.
