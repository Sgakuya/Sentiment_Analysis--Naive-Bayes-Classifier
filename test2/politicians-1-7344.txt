Jesse Jackson is turning the democratic party away from him! I applaud him for this. I refuse to acknowledge this man as a reverend considering he just completed seminary this year. Someday people will get tired of Jesse Jackson acting as if the African American community can not speak without his input. When will the African American community realize that Jesse Jackson is responsible for the oppression of their community. No government agency wants his help nor have they asked for it, however he continues to force himself in political situations that do not concern him! I for one hope that people stand up and take notice of the damage that he is creating for his people . Jesse Jackson you should be ashamed of your behavior. Lift your people up and stop bringing them back down. I am a caucasion female that has never seen color boundries. I look at African Americans as I look at everyone- equal. Jesse Jackson needs to do the same.
