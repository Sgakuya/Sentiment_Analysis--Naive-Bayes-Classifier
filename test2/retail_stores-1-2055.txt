I purchased a new HP computer on Monday 11/21/05 and went home to connect my new computer. Once connected, I discovered there is a problem with the sound card. When I called to ask if I could exchange the item, I was given the runaround by customer service (too long to describe). Finally, after speaking with management, they exchanged the computer. When I hooked up this computer, the same problem occurred. Upon futher inspection, I discovered the problem was with the sound card. HP installs very cheap sound cards on their computers. So bad in fact that even when I played back a store-bought CD, it popped and cracked the whole time. Upon returning the item on 11/25/05, I was informed that I would have to pay a $127.00 restocking fee. Of course I refused. They insisted that I must exchange the item for the same model or pay the restocking fee. Needless to say, many words were exchanged. After walking away $127.00 poorer, I called the corporate office upon which I was greeted on the phone 30 minutes after being placed on hold. I explained the situation to the operator and she told me she would have to call the store and "investigate". She said she would call me back and a few moments. It is now 4 hours later and I am still waiting. I am considering legal action. For all of you out there, please do not shop at Circuit City. They do not care about the customer and SERVICE IS NOT STATE OF THE ART at Circuit City.
