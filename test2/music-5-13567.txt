I really loved this CD. If u ask me to many people take what he says to seriously. If u don't take what he says like, OOOh my god he said he killed his wife! then u can enjoy what it's saying and even laugh at times. If u didn't like this CD because it's not the kind if style u listen to, fine, but if u don't like it becouse of what he says, lighten up.
