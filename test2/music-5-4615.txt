Caught the U2 tour in Washington DC on 6/14. It was pretty excellent. It's funny how - because the new U2 record is so great - you'd never think of this as an oldies/nostalgia show. But that's what it is, in the best way possible. They pull out a lot of the anthemic stuff from War and Unforgettable Fire that translates so well to a big arena. The new record sounded great as well -- Elevation and Kite especially. There was none of the multimedia extravaganza from their 90s tours, but it sure wasn't missed.
