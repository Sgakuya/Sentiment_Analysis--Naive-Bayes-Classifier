Guys, guys, guys! Please! We're talking about Madison's PRESIDENCY, not his role in the Constitutional Convention or anything else! The PRESIDENCY! Forget what else he did; that's for another page. As for being a president, Madison was a pretty rotten one. He led us into a rather pointless war and worked his darndest to crush Henry Clay's proposals for the American System --a masterful national economic plan to help America. Henry Clay wanted the gov't to finance the building of roads and canals and railways, create a united national bank like Hamilton's of old, and have a high tariff. This would ennable American industrialists (protected from European goods by the high tariff) to sell their wears to other Americans via the new transportation routes, protected and secured and backed by a sound financial system wrought by the bank, and thereby further unite a warring and torn America that would later split over slavery. What could have solved a great crisis wasn't given a try. Thanks, James. I'm sorry, but the only good thing you gave to the presidency was your wife.
