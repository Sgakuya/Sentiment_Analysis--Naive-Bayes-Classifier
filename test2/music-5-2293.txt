The best singer i have heard in a long time!! VERY powerful voice and she has the ability to bring tears to your eyes. I'm not a fan of live albums but That is where she shines because of her range. Between tracks you can listen to her speak to the audience. SHe's very inspirational and a good sense of humour. Her kids and father appear in concert too. DEFINATLEY check her out if you havent!! And even better if u have a chance to see her in concert, GO!! She has something for everyone. You'll be praising the Lord right along with her.
