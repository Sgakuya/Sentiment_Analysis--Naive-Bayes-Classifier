how come noone has brought up the issue that this guy gained about 40 lbs of solid muscle after the age of 35 .... not only is it hard to gain that much muscle but, over a three-year span and at his age when your body is in decline .... I give the man credit for being able to his a ball that is coming in at 90 mph but, he either took/is taking steroids .... my guess is it's growth hormone .... it has almost the same effects as steroids except look at the size of his head .... it has also grown with his muscle and this is a side effect of growth hormone .... anyway, he's good but, I don't think he's that great for reasons previously stated by other people ....
