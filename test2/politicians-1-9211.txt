Can only be a 1 star due to his craven nepotism, the despicable ethnic cleansing/slaughter of Native Americans, his founding of the party machine system that subverted true town hall democracy as envisaged by the founding fathers, and his belief that secession was an act of treason (cf South Carolina). On the plus side, Jackson fought an epic battle to abolish Nicolas Biddle's corrupt inflationary money machine source of political bribes known as the 2nd bank of the United States (which was actually the 3rd US central bank). Central banking creates inflation, which is effectively a stealth tax on financially unsophisticated people, and greatly exacerbates business cycles by distorting market interest rates. Read The creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin for an excellent account of Jackson's principled sound money campaign.
