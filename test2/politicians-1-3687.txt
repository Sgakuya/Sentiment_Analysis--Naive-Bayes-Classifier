It is appauling our country is so ignorant that almost half the people that voted voted for George W. Bush. I can't say Gore is great, because he isn't, but he would do much more for this country and has real experience while Bush will follow in his father's footsteps and do nothing for this country. I really wish we had Clinton for another 4 years but Gore was the next best thing and it's too bad that the REAL WINNER of the election, Al Gore, isn't the 43rd president of the United States.
