I honestly wouldn't purchase an actual Stones CD because of this awesome compilation. It covers all of the greats from the height of their career: Time is on My Side, Satisfaction, Street Fighting Man, Sympathy for the Devil, Gimme Shelter, Brown Sugar, Jumpin Jack Flash, Honky Tonk Women, it just is amazing!
