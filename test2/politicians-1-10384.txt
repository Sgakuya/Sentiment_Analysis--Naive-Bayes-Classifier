This man has done nothing but see to his own interests since setting foot in the White House. He left Rudy Gulliani to do his job for him when Sept. 11th happened. He hopped Air Force one in a rush and was busy making tracks to Barksdale AFB in La to escape any possible attack instead of trying to pull the country together in a time of crisis. When questioned by reporters why he did not take command when his country needed him most, he let Ari Fleischer answer for him--- There was the possibility that the White House (and Air Force One---a moving target, LOL!) was going to be attacked, so we took him to a safe location. Apparently VP Cheney was not so important to the country, as they left him scratching his backside at the White House. From the economy, to medicare issues, to foreign affairs, Bush Jr. has done nothing but put on a great farse of a show. How will cuts to dividend and estate taxes help those making 30k a year? How will it help the needy and the homeless? Mr. Bush simply cares very little about the problems facing the average American. If he truly believes that the economy is strong amd recovering and that there are plenty of good job opportunities out there, why not take away his Presidential and turn it into a $6.00 a hour job with no benefits like the majority of Americans must deal with, then let's see just what he thinks of trickle down economics and his bone-head tax plans.
