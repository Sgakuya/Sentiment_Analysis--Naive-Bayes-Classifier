This is the best CD I have ever bought and listened to. He has the most amazing voice and every song is worth listening to again and again. On most CDs I listen to, there's at most half of the CD that I really like and then there's half that isn't that great and I just skip over, and that's at most half of the CD is good. But this whole CD is amazing and you can listen to the whole thing through without skipping ANY of it. It is truly amazing and it is something you need to go buy RIGHT NOW if you haven't already! Once you hear his voice, you will be hooked!
