Enema of crap is more like it. Bubble gum punk has a bad reputation for lukewarm music as it is. Now it sank to an even new low with blink 182. The album before this was allright. Not really something to get all worked up about. Then 'What's my Age Again' came out. It was cute and funny. ......then, the bad singles came out. Say it ain't so had to be one of the worst songs to hit the charts that year. An ass effort. Then it was 'Adam's Song.' Suicide song or not, it was a basic beat that sat on it's tucus the entire time. Mark REALLY puts the EMPHASIS in emmotional in this song.....yeah right. Let's not even get into the horrible details of the disc. Run! Run far away from these nimrods as fast as you can!!!!!
