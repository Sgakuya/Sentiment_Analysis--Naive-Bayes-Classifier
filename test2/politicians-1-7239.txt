Jesse Jackson says he is out for equal rights, he is not out for all americans, he is only out for 1/4 of americans, and to hell with the rest. His harsh language, and name calling only proves one thing in my eyes, he himself is also racist. When he calls a candiate nazi tactic's he is stating that I am one to. I find him to be compared as evil and they get, he is not a Rev, a true man of god would not represent such behavior problems in the public, and resort to name calling. i think them kind of protest's should be outlawed. EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS, NOT 1/3 OF THE AMERICANS.....
