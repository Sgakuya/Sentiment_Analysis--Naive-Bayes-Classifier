It is the best debut album, period. Most classic Hendrix in his short career is right on Are You Experienced. The greatest guitarist to ever live is shown in his element here, with Purple Haze, Foxy Lady, and most of his other great work. If you are a true fan of rock and roll, you need to hear the material on this album. It is music, power, dazing, at its best.
