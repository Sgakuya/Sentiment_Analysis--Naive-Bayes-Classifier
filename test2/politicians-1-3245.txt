What is his legacy of accomplishments? Not much. People that give Clinton credit for the economy don't understand that a President doens't control this. Interest rates, foreign domestic markets, employement, etc. control the economy, which is cyclical. Tell an auto worker that the economy is good and they will laugh in your face. Their job is now in Mexico because of NAFTA. Thanks a lot, Willy!
