Rick Lazio has never written any of the laws he has taken credit for. He is just a puppet of the Republican political machine in New York, a smiling face. Just like many of the Republicans in New York he has catered to the wealthy whenever possible, and has cut benefits to the poor whenever possible. The people of New York deserve better.
