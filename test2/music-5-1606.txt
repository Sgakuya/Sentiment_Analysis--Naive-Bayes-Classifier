I love ths band. Amy's voice is incredible. The only problem I have with this band is that once they got kicked out from the Christian Music Industry they changed their image to seem more satanic. If u don't believe me, check the magazine covers(there was one with devil horns around their head). They gave up so quickly, and its a shame that just cause of that, they think they can rebel by completely reversing their image. Don't get me wrong, they are still awsome and they one of my favorite bands.
