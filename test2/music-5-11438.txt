An amazing album. Definitely up there in terms of all time albums. The first 12 tracks are amazing, and the last seven are damn good. I first got into this album in high school, and now, 12 years later, I still listen to it all the time. I can't think of another album that has stood the test of time so well... I remember buying this song for Train in Vain, and then coming to the pleasant realization that there are a number of lesser known, but superior tracks on this CD. A classic blend of rock, pop, ska, and punk that should be in everyone's collection.
