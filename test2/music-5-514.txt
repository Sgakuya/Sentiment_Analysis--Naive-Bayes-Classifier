I believe from listening to all sorts of music, from classical and slow out, fast paced musical time zone, to a more fast going rythm. Hearing Californication being played non-stop for 3-4 weeks, every day and every night, after awhile it seems to be at the same flowing pace as some of the light classic musicals. To me it feels almost peaceful to listen to something so pure, so into the tune of things. Californication has a sense to the fact of the flow... of things. That's why I pick this flawless band at a 5, because it makes me feel so good to hear it.
