I never understood why 'nevermind' got all the critical plaudits. '10' is far superior in terms of musicality, musicianship and feel/atmosphere. I can think of few albums that have better opening tracks than this. Mike McCready is an underrated lead player and Jeff Ament is also one of the better rock bassists out there. Still their best album and definitely one of the very few 90s releases that has a classic quality.
