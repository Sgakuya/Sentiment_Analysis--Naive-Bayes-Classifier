Everytime you go to the Oswego Kansas Sonic Drive In they never get your order right. I had chicken strips that were so old or burnt they didn't have any edible chicken in them and my tater tots looked like they had set in grease for days they were soggy! You can't get a toaster because they don't toast anything. Make sure you also don't ask for honey mustard because you will never get it. Oswego Sonic is terrible in everyway they need a new manager.
