The problem with this bookstore is that there are far too few people doing far too many things. Also, I have noticed a severe decline in the amount of useful books that they carry. Shelves are often only half-filled now, with the kind of dreck I can find at any halfway decent B&N. And the less said about the decline of their used and remaindered sections, the better.
