I love this album. I first heard this album when my next door neighbor was playing it not long after it came out. It was different from everything else going on in music in 1978, yet it sounded familiar at the same time. I guess that's what it takes for an album to stand the test of time. If someting is too different, it tends to not age well. I like every song on this album.
