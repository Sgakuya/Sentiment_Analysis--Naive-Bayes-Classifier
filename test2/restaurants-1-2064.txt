for those of you who wish to avoid similar experiences, do not leave the drive-thru lane and enjoy the bliss if ignorant, fast food dinning. i thought i would save time and run in to pick up lunch while trying a new eatery:BIG MISTAKE. there is a process at harvey's that has your burger handled far too much by too many hands. 1. the grill person -ok someone has to handle 2.the bun person 3. the condiment person 4. the wrapper-they don't really wrap but place it on the wrapper for 5. the CASHIER(MONEY HANDLER!!) to grab finnished buger and wrap it up to place in the bag. i say again too many hands, too many unclean hands!
