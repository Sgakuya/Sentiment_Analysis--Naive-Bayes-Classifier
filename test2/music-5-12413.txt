Just when rap seemed to be destined for misery with the likes of Vanilla Ice and other bubblegum rap as their leaders, these hoods show up and change everything. Gangsta before it was even a word, they set the standard for all others. Not the first rap album, but maybe the most important. The irony being that I bet the mass majority of their albums lived their lives in the album collection of every Wonder bread white Wally Cleaver wannabe gangsta in every white suburb of every city of America.
