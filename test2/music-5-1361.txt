The Joshua Tree suffers from an overly uniform sound, but this 1987 release is what made U2 superstars. There is not a weak track on this release, including the immortal singles Where The Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, and With Or Without You. The release also contains Bullet The Blue Sky, Running To Stand Still, and In God's Country. With The Joshua Tree, the band took full advantage of the American influences on their music (eg county and blues). This is clearly the first U2 release to acquire.
