Although I got way over U2 with Achtung Baby and all the midlife crisis crap that fllowed (sorry Bono) but Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree hold strong as worthy 80's poetry and sound. You can listen to the whole album through if you're in the mood without stopping to criticize because there are no filler songs.
