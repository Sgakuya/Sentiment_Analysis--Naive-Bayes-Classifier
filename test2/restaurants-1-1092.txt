MY WITH AND I WENT OUT TO EAT AT POPEYE'S IN LAKELAND, FLORIDA BECAUSE WE HEARD THAT IT WAS GOOD, HOWEVER WE WERE TURNED AWAY BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T TAKE CREDIT CARDS. IS THIS THE AGGENTA OF ALL THE POPEYE' EVERYWHERE OR IS THIS ONE ISOLATED STORE. IF THIS IS THE WAY IT IS WITH ALL STORE'S YOU ARE LOOSING A LOT OF MONEY. I WON'T BE GOING BACK TO POPEYE'S AGAIN
