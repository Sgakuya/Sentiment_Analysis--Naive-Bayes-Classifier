I totally agree that Quizno's has the worst commercial on television at the moment. What are those horrible little creatures that are attempting to sing? They are so ugly and make me never want to eat at their establishment. (their food isn't that great to begin with.) If you go to their website to complain about the commericials...all you are given is a snail mail address and NO email address. So I won't even bother wasting my time sending them a note. I just won't eat there. (not that they care I am sure..I am just one little person.) Atrocious !
