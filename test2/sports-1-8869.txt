 Waah waah waah. I don't want to play for Minnesota because KG is the man not me. How are things in NJ Steph? Better? Since losing means nothing to you, and money everything, I hope so. Have fun watching the Wolves go to the conference semis this year while sitting on your couch in Brooklyn. One man a team does not make.
