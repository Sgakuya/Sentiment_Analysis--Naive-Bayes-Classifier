A weak-kneed politican who has multiple genocides on his watch. Not only did he oppose the liberation of Iraq (in the operation formerly known by the awesome title of Operation Infinite Justice), he has done nothing about the brutal slaughters in Somalia and in Sudan. I also have a feeling he was involved with the corrupt Oil-For-Food program that convinced France, Germany, and Russia not to support the just cause of the Coalition in freeing a repressed people and stopping a dangerous madman. Annan should be given the boot.
