Im a huge detroit fan, barry was my very favorite and I loved watching him. He was going to crush walter paytons record. He COULD of, he SHOULD of, HE WOULD OF!!!! I was shocked and disgusted when i heard was going to retire. Now when I think of barry sanders i think of a bum who has no love for the game, a guy sitting in a chair eating chips and watching matlock! Cmon! You WERE the best barry. No love for the game. Barry Sanders is PATHETIC!!! (and this is from a huge detroit fan!)
