0.5 Stars out of 5 Stars: Terrible! I'm sure you are all acquainted with the sound of Disturbed by now (unfortunately). Ooh-Ahh, Uhh-Ahh, growl, etc. Believe (2003) is the second release from the inhabitants of the current flavor-of-the-month genres rap/rock and nu-metal , and is just as horrible as the music of fellow, current untalented bands such as Linkin Park, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Evanescence, and the like. Unless you are a female monkey in desperate need of a mating call (ooh-ahh-h-h), a fan of the aforementioned rock/metal music of today, or somehow enjoyed their first album, The Sickness (2001), do not consider purhasing this album .
