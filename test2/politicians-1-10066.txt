Yes - he finally stood up to Europe and the UN. For what reason? Were these people enemies? Who spun that? What was there to stand up to? A bunch of people with different opinions to him? Germany said at the time that the US was a friend and friends can have differences of opinion. And now that it has been proven that there were no WMDs, are we perhaps feeling embarrassed? Hell no. Pass the freedom fries and isn't John Kerry looking French today. Sent a nation to war for WMDs that did not exist, attended how many fund-raising luncheons last year as compared to how many soldier funerals - anyone have the exact number there??, but I guess he was not an adulterer. I bet he doesn't use cuss words either.
