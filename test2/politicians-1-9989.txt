History will not look favorable upon the Dubya's presidency. It was a time of unprecedented abuse of power, corrupt foreign policy and imperialistic hubris which will have not only bankrupt a once great nation, but also signal the end of a superpower's hold on the world. Fortunately for George Jr, he was away from the White House enough to be well rested for whatever he plans to mess up next. God Bless America... somebody has to.
