Hillary Clinton, who dropped the Rodham since she won New York is smart in ways I would never want to be. She has leached off the government (us) eversince she got out of Yale. She has no idea what the real world is like as she has lived the political life most of her life. Their is something really wierd about her. Why doesnt she ever say she is half Mexican? You never see her Mother who is full blooded Mexican. Is she ashamed of it or something?
