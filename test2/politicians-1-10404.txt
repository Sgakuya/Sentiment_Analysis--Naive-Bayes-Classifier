This President has single handedly caused more problems for the U.S.A both internally and internationally than I would have thought possible in less than a term of office. He was not the elected President of this country and with good reason. It will take decades to repair the damage he has caused both to the deficit and international relations let alone the desecration of Iraq. He has made the American rich richer, the American poor poorer under the pretence of National Security concerns. He has destabilized the world, made Americans less safe everywhere and has certainly done little domestically, except burden states with huge deficits for homeland security, organized a color coded alert system for internal security threat levels (whoopee!!!) burden future generations with huge deficits (thanks to his tax handouts to the wealthy) and robbed our children of a decent education. How much longer will we have to put up with this ??????
