i ate at a waffle house here in tulsa oklahoma. (we got three of them) nastest stuff ever! it was dirty and the cooks smoked cigarettes while cooking the food. I threw up in thery're bathroom twice that night. nothing like a guy smoking a maroborow, talking to me about hookers and CIA conspircies to make me preety unconfortable. I never eaten trash from a trash can but the 11st Waffle house in Tulsa, Oklahoma is preety close!
