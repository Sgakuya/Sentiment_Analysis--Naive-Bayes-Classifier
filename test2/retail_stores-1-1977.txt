Someone got me a gift certificate for Best Buy, but you can't use gift certificates online, so I had to go in to find what I wanted. They didn't have what I wanted in the store, so I made a request online for them to ship the product to a store so that I could pay with the gift card and their comments section wasn't working. This is annoying!!!!!!!
