No other band took punk/new wave as far, with as much style as these guys. London Calling is one of the top five albums of all time, hands down. Social commentary without being in your face, punky but still accessable. Just tight enough to be amazing but just sloppy enough to be cool. Still amazes me that bands like Rancid and Green Day even bothered. This is the one that counts.
