This is one of two CDs I ever thought were worth buying. I thought it was great! It is filled with original tunes that stick in your head for a while. It is completely clean, with no inappropriate language or references. Some of their tracks remind me of Phil Collin's band Genesis. In a world of fake, untalented musicians, it is nice to see a band like this that stands out. The only problem with it is that it only has 11 tracks! My favorite tracks were We Are, You're A God, Everything You Want, Best I Ever Had, and Finding Me. A fresh pack of tracks in the currently bland world of rock music.
