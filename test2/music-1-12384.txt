I'm sorry, DC3 just ain't the same since LeToya and Latavia were forced to leave and the latest album proves it. In 'Survivor', its clear that they're taking shots at LeToya and Latavia which shows poor character on DC3's behalf. Oh, and it's nice to see Beyonce finally letting the other member's sing 'stead of hoggin' the mic. Anyway, I'm looking forward to Letoya and Latavia's Angel project comin' soon. I hear it's gonna be da bomb!
