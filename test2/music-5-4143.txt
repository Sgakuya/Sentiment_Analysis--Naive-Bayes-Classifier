I knew about the Indigo Girls years ago and feel like since I knew them from start that I have some right to say that this is their best stuff. It is so sad that as they have gotten more popular their music has slowly gotten worse. This album has great songs that tell these great stories. There are some great instruments like bongo drums in the background in a couple of songs too.
