Hello, I am from hobart Oklahoma and sonic drive in is one of the few places to eat... They have been so terrible for along time... I had bought a # 4 breaded chicken sandwhich and the middle was raw and the bread was burnt and so i sent it back and then they just put it back in the frier and cut it in half slaped it on the same buns and sent it back out the also didn't know how do use the credit card machine and it took av\bout 15 min to get it to work so after sitting there for 30 mins i was a little upset so i just through my sandwhich away and left.. If you bother them too much the people around say they will spit in your food or do something nasty of the sort with body hairs so i really perfer not to complain to them ... I have been tring to complain to the Headquaters about this but i can't seem to find out how to get in tough with them.... Thanks
