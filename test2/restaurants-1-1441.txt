Roblissa03... I think you just proved a point. You said, these girls bring your food out in the heat in the summer and also bring it to you in the Cold winters... Who wants to eat food in there car in the hot summer? and who wants to eat food in there car in the winter? exactly. Oh yeah that is right in the Summer I can just leave my car run, and run the A/C and in the Winter I can run my heat. This is true, but why would I want to just sit and leave my car running while eating. I would rather go inside somewhere and sit down and be comfortable and not waste gasoline, which it is expensive these days, and plus I drive a really nice car why would I want to eat in it? or have my friends eat in it? You are about stupid as hell lady. The food at Sonic isn't all that good either.
