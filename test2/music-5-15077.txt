My favourite album of all time by my favourite band of all time. Every single song on this album is sonically perfect. From the dazzling brain blowingly cool techno-rock at Block rockin' beats to the amazing dreamy end of the private psychadelic reel this is less an album and more an experience. I must have listened to this Album (seriously) more times then I've heard my own name mentioned
