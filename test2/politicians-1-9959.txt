UPDATE: 11/27/05 Pyccku7's comments on this board are by far the most troubling I've seen yet. Nothing but stats and gloating about W's victory over Kerry---no info on what W has done, and no information on what Clinton did. Clinton was a diplomat. Contrary to what the Neo-Cons believe, the United Nations was created for a reason. We have alienated the rest of the world. India and China will soon be the world powers if this keeps up. Clinton created more jobs that W or "Senior" combined. He cared about what was going on in our country, vs. a country on the other side of the world that has an ideology that cannot be changed simply because of an invasion. Our troops are not dying to remove a madman. That's already been done--but this madman posed no threat to the U.S. And why are we STILL there, when he's already been removed? And what about whats-his-face Bin Laden? Remember him? Our troops are dying for oil. And that's what Neo-Cons don't want to hear. Why else is W so dead set on establishing a democracy there? What if Iraq stood in the middle of the Pacific Ocean? Do you think we would have invaded, all other things being equal (including Sadaam?) Nope. And speaking of the UN, what ever happened to that bully W sent to the UN several months ago? Bolton? Out of sight, out of mind. Or so we think. God only knows what this guy has up his sleeve. BULLIES. The entire Bush administration is made up of them. While Clinton was not a perfect President, I'd take 100 years of him over 2 more years of W. And W's accomplishments? Tax breaks for the rich. Refusal to sign the Kyoto Treaty to study global warming (which, despite the repeated stupid statements of the Neo-Cons, IS causing these hurricanes and bizarre weather--tornadoes in November, no fall, no spring, just cold to hot and hot to cold. Icebergs breaking off Antarctica? That's just a pattern. Reindeer dying off in northern Norway and Sweden because of lack of snowfall in the Arctic Circle? That's just a pattern.) What a crock. Whats scary to me is that people I work with, who are ardent Bush supporters, are having difficulty making ends meeta 64-year old woman has to take a part-time job because as a bookkeeper, shes not making enough to get by. Another friend is a Bush supporterhes an engineer whos been unemployed for nearly a year because his last two jobs have been outsourced to India. But they blindly support W and thats a shame. And the biggest accomplishment of W: Declaring a war on a country that never attacked us and has no WMDs. Some of these comments by the Neo-Cons on this website smack of Fascism: You're either with us, or against us. What a horrible time for our country. And my family wonders why I wont bring a child into this country and world were in. A few more years under W and they (and possibly we) WILL be seeing the end of the world. ************************ Approval rate 39% and dropping----when are the neo cons on this website who are giving this guy five stars gonna wake up and smell the coffee? There was a lack of response to Katrina because Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama National Guardsmen were in Iraq, fighting for.....would someone please tell me? A terrorist-free world? Give me a break. If anything an attack against this country is more likely because we declared a war on one country that had no ties to 9/11. Why are we not going after Osama/Usama Bin Laden? Remember him? Democracy in Iraq? Does this country really want it? I don't see any WMDs. Hussein was a dictator but there are plenty of others in the world like him. Did we declare war on Uganda in the '70s because of Amin? It's OIL. Instead of concentrating on hybrid technology (why would he do that anyway--his rich buddies are Texaco, Exxon, Shell). The only good thing (and I mean only) that came out of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is it finally seems to be showing the idealists who really feel this man cares about our country his true colors. Putting a man with experience in HORSES (not people and certainly not a natural disaster) in charge of rescue and recovery experts. What's he gonna say to him now? Brownie, you coulda handled this a bit smoother. Slap him on the wrist and send him back to his mansion in the VA or MD suburbs. The man should really be put in jail. I could go on.....but 39% is pathetic. He should be impeached with a rating that low. Also funny how most of the positive comments about Bush on this board are coming from Texas. These people will seemingly jump off the Empire State building if Bush tells them to than listen to reason.
