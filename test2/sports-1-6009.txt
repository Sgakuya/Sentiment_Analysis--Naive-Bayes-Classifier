I respect JJ..............he is a hell of a shooter. Buuuuuut, I'm not hoops ignorant. Lots of white dorks are good shooters, like Loretta says, lets see him take Jackie Manuel off the dribble before we call him a good player. For example, in the olympics, all the euros could shoot as well as Reddick, but none of them were as good as McCants. See what I mean? In other words, he can shoot, but can he play? Plus, how annoying is it that he scores his first points of the game with 5 minutes left, and carries on like Terrel Owens after a touchdown?
