I believe that the man needs to learn when to give up!!!!Apparently his mother did not teach him how to be a good loser.....or how to lose with dignity..... And obviously he does not care about this country as by keeping this losing battle up he is hurting all of us .... for example look at the economy he is part of the reason that the dow has taken a nose dive in november.... I am not a bush supporter nor was I a suporter of Gore....I simply am tired of hearing nothing but what court this thing is in now....GIVE IT UP GORE
