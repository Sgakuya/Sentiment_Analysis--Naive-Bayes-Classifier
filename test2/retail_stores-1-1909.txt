In the Auburn Marshalls (Supermall store) The manager Mike Corby, is the most unprofessional person I've ever seen. In one incident, one of the eployees appeared to be following store code, and I believe that she was attemping to let a customer now that they could not leave the fitting rooms with unpurchased clothing while the customer was wearing them. the customer and the customers friend became hostile and then began to yell profanitys at the marshalls eployee she stayed calm, but I remember she had a look of fear in her eyes, She did do the right thing and call managment, this is when I realized the massacre the call management came to save the day mean- while these customers still harassing her, management (mike Coby) approched them hearing the confrontation, look at the employee and then turned to the customers and said what do you want me to do about it nothing i can do about it . At that, I stopped shopping and left the store. I will never return to that store .
