Yet another dreadful and ineffectual conservative who did little or nothing to improve the common good of her country, yet, like those of her political stripe, lined the pockets of her already well-heeled greedhead supporters. Saw nothing wrong with totalitarian governments (i.e., Pinochet) and insisted on that totally unncessary Falklands war, which was her version of Ronnie Rectum's grandstanding/bullying of Grenada and Libya, and a precursor to W's similiar insult to mankind called the Iraqi war. Social programs in her country suffered gravely due to her simplistic, reductive and retarded tough love approach to national finances, which served as yet another impetus for the U.K. to continue to sink into third world status. The modest economic response to her draconian, society-damaging iniatives hardly justified the means. A post-menopausal old biddy suffering from severe penis envy who toadied up to that other wrong-minded relic, The Great Fornicator, for support, as her own people came to increasingly despise and resent her reign of error. Posters here admire her, and all moronic conservatives it seems, for knowing right where they stand: I don't know how valuable a quality this is if the unwavering, crystal-clear positions of a political figure are relentlessly ill-advised and damaging to the people. As the droolers feel mere honesty takes precedence over wisdom, pragmatism and achievement, it's no wonder these clueless dolts are a continuing drain on the social, economic, political and cultural vitality of this country.
