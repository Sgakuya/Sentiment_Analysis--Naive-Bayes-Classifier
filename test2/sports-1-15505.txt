most overrated player in football. tomlinson would get like 2500 yards with that line. hes at most an average back. hes slow, got the best line in football, he doesn't break tackles, he has no jukes or fakes. he runs foward until he gets tackled. look at larry johnson he got like 500 yards n 6 tds in like 4 games, n hes horrible. derrick blaylock got 4 tds in a half..n tied the record, u can't b serious calling him the best. u can stick anyone back therre n they'll get 1000 yards.
