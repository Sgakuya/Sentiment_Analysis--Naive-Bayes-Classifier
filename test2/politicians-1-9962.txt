Umm, post 9/11 excuse is all he can give us for his war in Iraq. He's exploited the attacks for political gain. Claiming false intelligence for the reason for Iraq--based on foreign intelligence, which as a Int. Studies and Poli. Sci. grad know that many of the intelligence of other countries can be as low as a rumor that started. Then a govt. official gets it and spins it into official intelligence. And our CIA even admits that their intelligence didn't support Bush's claims. He is not patriotic by sending troops to war in Iraq for political capital. After all, no president has been defeated during wartime. The economy sucks b/c he doesn't know how to create jobs, nor develop a fair tax system. Which he gives the rich the tax cuts, unearned income as well such as any capital gains, and runs the biggest deficit--which was a surplus for once in a long time under Clinton--in the nation's history, and which part of pro-life is he? The before your born, while your alive, or when your in pain and suffering. Because, he doesn't care for life if you alive and healthy, just sent them to war, or let the poverty level increase, and the disparity of the rich and poor grow. Spreading democracy is not the answer to peace...after all the US is a democracy and we are constantly at war, and lead the world in gun crimes. Bush is awful, and my voice of dissent is what democracy is about...and for him to bash the critics of the Iraq war on Veteran's day is an all time low for a president.
