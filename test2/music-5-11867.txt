From its famous opening track to the ghostly ending of Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler), this record has you grabbed by the soul. I didn't actually enjoy the album all that much when I first bought it. What first amazed me were the funky bass parts, string arrangements, and all of the well-organized instrumental work. Marvin's angelic voice often intertwines with itself throughout the songs. The sound grew on me, and soon enough I understood its beauty. Three hits were released from it; What's Going On, Mercy Mercy Me and Inner City Blues. It's worth it to buy this record, whoever you are. It does deserve to be a top pop albums of all time, though I don't know about the real rock and roll list- sorry VH1. Anyway, I'm living proof that a 13-year old Caucasian enjoys and understands this masterpiece. Marvin sings for all of the times. Even today, we wonder- what is going on?
