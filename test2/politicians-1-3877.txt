DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS NEED TO MERGE INTO ONE SINGLE PARTY! That is my topic today, oh blinded America. If I recall, we had the Republican rule in the 80's, Clinton ran for pres in 92', we all voted for him because we couldn't stand Republicans anymore. The lesser of two evils theory. Now everyone is sick of the Democrats. We're all voting Republican because, well at least it's not another Dem! The only difference between Gore and Bush is, well, NOTHING! So whaddya' say we stop this pointless pendulum of our current two-party duopoly. Pay attention voters! Our primary choices are both full of crap! Both are just saying whatever they can to get votes. Not just Gore, Bush as well. Each candidate has MANY consultants, advisors, scriptwriters, producers (for thier TV ads) poll takers. The person you see is not really that person. And any of you who has voted in the past and heard the flat out lies and empty promises from prior candidates, AND ACTUALLY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME, I just sigh for your ignorance. So you wanna know the solution.....VOTE FOR A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE. No they're not going to win, but that's not the point. Every mighty oak begins with a single seed, and you all must sow your votes wisely. If you don't, you plant your oak on spoiled soil. The momentum must start. It begins with all of us. Stop being fooled. You all live in the greatest country on earth....take advantage of your strength. Everyone makes a difference.
