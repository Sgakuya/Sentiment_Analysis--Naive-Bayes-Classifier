It amazes me that Americans voted this guy into office. In most countries the blank stare and inability to get out a grammmatically proper sentence would be a death sentence to a political career, but no. Let me quote a line that stuck with me from his recent news address in the Azores. Over the last few weeks I've been doing alot of phone talking. Talking to world leaders you know. (ALOT OF PHONE TALKING!!!) I now there were problems with the election that got him into the whitehouse but still nearly half the voters elected him. Is the Yankee education so poor that this guy sounds succinct and educated. Many other people in this forum have noted his shoddy past so I won't get into it. If not for the unfortunate events of September Eleventh GWB wouldn't have been more then a footnote in American history. Now history has given him the importance he doesn't deserve and let us all hope he doesn't destroy the whole world in his dimwitted endeavor to rid the world of terrorism.
