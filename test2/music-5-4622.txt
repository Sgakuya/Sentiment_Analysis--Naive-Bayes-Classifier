First concert I ever went to at the United Center in 1996. I had never heard much Rush aside from Tom Sawyer on the radio and Bob and Doug out-takes. I was blown away and made a believer. Geddy Lee is an amazing lyricist and I have never heard drums like Neil Peart. Not many women like Rush, but they have to see them live. I've been to three more Rush concerts and continue to believe that was the best 50 dollars I could ever spend. Up there with Pink Floyd and the Allman Brothers in sheer brilliance.
