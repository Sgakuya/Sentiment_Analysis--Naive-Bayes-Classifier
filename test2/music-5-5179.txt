Another great CD from one of country music's all-time greats. I enjoyed listening to this CD from start to finish. A whole lot of good songs: She'll Leave You With a Smile , Run , Stars on the Water , and Living and Living Well . George is a country music legend who has proven that his talent cannot be diminished by age.
