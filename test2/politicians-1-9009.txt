This Man caused the U.S. to become the laughing stock of the world. His sexual escapades and his subsequent perjury denegrated the Office of the Presidency. His cruise missle attacks in the midst of Monica-Gate were a thinly veiled re-enactment of Wag the Dog. His foreign policy was a travesty. Thank God that Mr. Bush is in Office in these tough times; times I believe could have been headed off with a good President for the prior 8 years.
