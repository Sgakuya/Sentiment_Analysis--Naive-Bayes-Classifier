One of the worst human pieces of debris ever to talk the Earth, yet alone the football field. One time he just up and outright yanked a teammate's helmet of and punched him in the face so hard it crushed the ocular area of his skull and caused brain damage. That would easily classify as assault and damn near classified as murder. As far as I'm concerned, he should be doing time for the childish, ignorant, unethical, inhumane garbage he's done. What a goddamned evil bastard...
