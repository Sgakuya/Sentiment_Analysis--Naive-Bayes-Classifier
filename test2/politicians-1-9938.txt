Hands down the worst immitation of a president this country could ever have. The only other that comes to mind is ronald raygun (thats the way i spell it). I'm not a government-hating, anti-american, cynical Democrat as some would think. I vote for a man with real idea's and not a party with an agenda. Haters will always hate him and lovers will always love him. I have not seen a single thing this guy has done right and i do follow politics. What he has done is make this country more hated and less secure than it has ever been. Hope we can recover from him but it will take alot of work. Good Luck America!!!
