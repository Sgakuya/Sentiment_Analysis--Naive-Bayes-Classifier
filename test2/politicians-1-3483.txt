Everyone knows about Bush's failed economic and foreign affairs policies, but what has he done for the environment? Giving initiatives Orwellian names such as Clear Skies or Healthy Forests is an insult to every educated environmental professional who can think for themselves. I work hard to find the equilibrium between industry and the environment and have grow more and more angry when my president makes my hard work worthless by selling out to his campaign donating oil/energy buddies. He has tipped the scale to the industry side too far. Remember what Eisenhower said. Beware the military/industrial complex. Today that mantra should read Beware the sellout puppet in the White House. There is a reason Texas has the worst air, water and soil quality in the US.
