I'm so completely addicted to this CD that my other disks are planning an intervention. I bought A Rush of Blood to the Head in advance through Amazon before I'd heard any of the tracks based on my love for Parachutes. Amazon offered the entire album digitally if you ordered in advance so I was thrilled to be able to listen to it for a month before release. I fell in love with the album immediatly. Rush of Blood has a different feel, a different mood than Parachutes. If I had to put my finger on it I would say that it has more of a range of styles and more of a psychidelic influence on some of the tracks. There is a definite Beatles feel to a wonderful track called Daylight . My two favorite tracks (though I find my favorite changes almost daily) is a soul stirring song called Warning Sign . Beautiful and intense you can feel his regret. I also love what I think will become the single from this album God put a Smile on My Face , great lyrical poetry. This CD swirls in your head, you'll find yourself dancing to it all day in your mind.
