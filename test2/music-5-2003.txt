Beautiful, soft melodies combined with heart-felt lyrics make this CD a must-buy. Maynard has the strongest voice I have ever heard. So deep and such a great range of vocals. And I'm going to agree with Dorkavitch Charnalsky on the religion thing. People shouldn't say they don't like someone or something because of the whole religion issue. I am atheist as well, and I couldn't care less what you believe in. APC kicks ass, and thats that
