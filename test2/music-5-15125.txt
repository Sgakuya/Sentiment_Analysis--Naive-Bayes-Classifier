Prodigy's Fat of the Land is an energetic, full-force techno album with excellent production. This is the kind of music you should blare from your speakers along with a subwoofer booming. Better than Prodigy's all too happy Experience album, and at least as good as Music for the Jilted Generation . Diesel Power , the album's rap track, is excellent; boasting tremendous mic skills from rap genius Kool Keith and powerful beats. Other tracks worth hearing repeatedly are: Breathe , Serial Thrilla , and the incendiary single Firestarter .
