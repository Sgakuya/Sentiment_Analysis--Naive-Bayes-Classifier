listen to a few times...anyone who can't relate to the lyrics has lived a much more blessed life than I have and I think mine is pretty good. How can you beat a line like god have mercy on a man who doubts what he's sure of or I try so hard baby but I just don't see what a woman like you is doing with me ? He's not trusting himself after Born in the USA. An icon stripping himself bare. Add this to 41 shots and his recent rants against Bush. He may be rich and he may be famous but he goes through the same travails we all do. This is his most personal album and my favorite.
