One of the three best REM CDs (along with Automatic for the People and Life's Rich Pageant ). I don't understand a word Michael Stipe is singing, but it's great music. This is early REM, when the only airplay they got was on college radio, so don't expect the more mature sound you hear on CDs like Out of Time.
