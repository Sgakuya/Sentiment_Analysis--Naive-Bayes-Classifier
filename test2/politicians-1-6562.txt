The people of SD need to see that T. Daschle does not represent them. He repersents only himself and the special interests of those in the democratic party. He is the little Ted Kennedy of SD. We need to remove him from the honorable position that he has, because he has NO honor. He is out of touch with SD. Time to bring him back to earth, by throwing him out of Washington. Along with his clone Tim Johnson. Both deserve ratings in the negative numbers.
