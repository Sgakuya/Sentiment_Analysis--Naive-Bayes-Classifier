This team blows. It humors me how the people don't get "current" in the listing. They currently suck, no matter how many Superbowls they won. UPDATE: Wow, they looked like ass against the Cards. I'm gonna have to take them all the way down. There is no excuse in the world for getting beat down by Josh McCown. UPDATE: Put down the crack! They lost to the Cardinals. THE CARDINALS! UPDATE: Well, they set their fate by dealing Rattay and eliminating any competition Smith has for the starting job. Those expecting him to be Montana or Young will have to wait awhile.
