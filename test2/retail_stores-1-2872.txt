Several years ago I gave my daughter a diamond ring that I always cherished and figured I will buy me another ring just like it in the near future. Well I took my daughter's ring to Whitehall and asked the manager if she could reset my diamond on a wide gold band like my daughter's. The manager said no problem and measured my daughter's band width and measured my ring finger. To make a long story short, they messed up several times. They made it too small, didn't fit. They sized it alright but failed to center the diamond. I paid close to $700.00 for just the band and the ring doesn't look anything like I had asked for. Please don't ever shop at Whitehall. It took them two weeks on something that should've taken a few days.
