I am a 37 year old, African American woman. I am very disappointed about this so called election. I am also disappointed in so called American's. My family heritage consist of men and women who were brought to this country, not by choice or election, but by force. We were beaten, starved, raped, and told to do whatever the master said to do. We accepted our plight, and fought long and hard to do such things as vote. We fought hard to not have to ride in the back of the bus. We endured our children being bombed in churches, being mimicked in blackface, and our young men being lynched because of the color of their skin. Now when I sit back and think of what has ocurred in this nation, I am appalled. This country was supposed to be, of the people, for the people, by the people. Apparently that meant only if the Supreme Court (most appointed by GW's daddy)said so. I voted. I'm wondering why I even bothered. Had I known that all it took was votes cast by non-elected officials, I would've stayed home. I don't feel the need to cast another ballot. The electoral college decides, the Supreme Court decides, the people apparently don't. I'll ignore this next four years. This isn't a government that cares what I think.
