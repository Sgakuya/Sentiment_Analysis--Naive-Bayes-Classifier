DEAN SMITH IS A JOKE..HE IS NOT THE BEST COLLEGE COACH, NEVER WAS AND NEVER WILL BE. HE IS OVER-RATED AND IT'S A GOOD THING THAT HE 'RETIRED' WHEN HE DID SO COACH K WOULDN'T EMBARASS HIM TOO BAD. ONLY A MORON LIKE DEANO COULD RESIDE AT SUCH A PATHETIC DUMP LIKE CRAPOLINA. HIS COACHING ABILITY WAS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE AND SO WERE HIS RECRUITING ABILITIES. WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO SEE HOW UNETHICAL AND ILLEGAL HIS SCOUTS OPERATED BACK 20 YEARS AGO??? THEN AGAIN, HE IS TYPICAL TARHOLE MATERIAL. COACH K IS 100 TIMES THE COACH (AND MAN) THAT DEANO OR ANY OTHER TARHOLE WAS OR COULD EVER BE. YOU CLOWNS NEED MATT DOH-ERTY BACK (HE HE). AFTER ALL, IT'S THE IMAGE OF HIS ANTICS AND STUPIDITY AND PLAYERS LIKE WILL JOHNSON AND THOSE BALD HEADED SMURFS THAT WILL LINGER IN EVERYONES MINDS FOR YEARS TO COME. DEAN THE BEST?? THAT'S FUNNY. HE IS THE BEST, THE BEST AT SCARFING DOWN PORK RINDS AND GREASY CHICKEN LIVERS...DUKE RULES!!
