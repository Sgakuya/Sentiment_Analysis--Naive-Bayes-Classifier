We have all waited a long time for this new studio cd, and it is well worth the wait. All bands have room for improvement, and this is a great example of improvement. It is somewhat different than the band's other cd's- the songs aren't as long, but the quality is still amazing. Each member shows a talent not amplified in the past albums. It is a wonderful showcase of music.
