TOOO much click fraud. As an advertiser , you really get very little "real" traffic from sites showing their ads. Adbrite.com or Viral-Ads.com offer a much better system of giving you different options ( ie time based rather than click based ) so fraud can be eliminated . Adsense is just abused too much and Google dont really care as they make money from this abuse.
