What the hell is the superball? Anyways, this broke dick, old, tired, team is getting what was coming to them. I feel sorry for a talented guy like Charles Woodson having to play for a clueless and non-caring coach like Bill Callahan. That guy should be coaching YMCA pee wee softball, not NFL football. He sucks. Gannon sucks now, and Jerry Rice should be playing bingo or something. What a disgrace this team is this year. They are just awful. They lost to the LIONS for god's sake. Then the moron Callahan said Detroit was a good team. Oakland might be the worst team in football right now.
