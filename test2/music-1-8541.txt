Oh my god were these guys just a bad idea. What in the world could they be doing now? I've always had this theory that these guys were brought together solely because each of them looked very similar to another popular artist of that time. If you still have an image of them in your head concentrate for a moment and try to picture this: One guy looked amazingly like George Michael, (same 5 O'clock shadow and everything), another looked like Terence Trent D'arby, another looked like Kenny G, and the last guy looked like.. well I can't remember who he looked like but anyway you slice it it was creepy. Oh and their music really sucked.
