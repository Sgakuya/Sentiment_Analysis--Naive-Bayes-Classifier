Since there are no comments left by the people who called this album terrible, it's obvious they have not heard the album. No one could possibly call it terrible, sorry. This is a great album, full of soulful, passionate songs that only U2 could write. Highlights include Walk On, Kite, In A Little While, Wild Honey and Elevation. Sample lyrics: you could have flown away/a singing bird in an open cage/who will only fly, only fly for freedom/WALK ON! My favorite line, from Wild Honey: I'm still standing, I'm still standing where you left me/Are you still growing wild With everything tame around you? It's a GREAT album, whether it's as good as Achtung Baby or Joshua Tree, ask me in a year or so. For now, it's too early to say.
