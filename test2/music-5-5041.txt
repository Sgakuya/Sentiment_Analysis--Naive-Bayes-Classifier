This belongs right up there on the shelf with his first three greatest hits albums. This one has several #1 hits: Blue Clear Sky, One Night At a Time, Carrying Your Love With Me, The Best Day, Carried Away, and Round About Way; several more top tens: Today My World Slipped Away, True, We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This, and I Can Still Make Cheyenne; and a great duet with Alan Jackson called Murder On Music Row. There is not a bad song on this cd. It's well worth the price.
