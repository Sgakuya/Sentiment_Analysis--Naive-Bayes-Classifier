I liked the guy who liked Pink, you know Pink Floyd. Considering the impact of the boys on R&R you can't have a good collection without this album. Since I've been listening to this album I've hardly listened to Dark Side though you can hear D.S. on the radio, and like the Eagles why buy it when you can hear it a thousand times a day. (Of course you get a fair helping of Machine and Shine On and WYWH. What I highly recommend is Roger Water's Live in the Flesh. A lot of his own stuff as well as Floyd stuff is on there and so it, I believe, the real spirit of Floyd. Doyle Bramhall II (Stevie Ray Vaughn) and Snowy White, one on Fender one on Les Paul are just unbelievable. Cannot recommend it and the DVD any higher. The song Amused Itself to Death is the equal to any Floyd song and should probably be in the Top 11 of all time.
