They don't carry a very good selection, and I've only had bad experiences with their employees as far as customer service goes. One time I was with my boyfriend and the lady that worked there came storming up to us because we were looking at sexuality books and said she needed to see our IDs. We are both in our twenties and did not appreciate her attitude at all, especially since we visit adult themed stores all the time and never recieve this kind of treatment. When I tried to contact Waldenbooks' customer service about her rude behavior, I was ignored.
