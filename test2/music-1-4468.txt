i always like when Josh starts his concerts by acting as though he were committing suicide.....er, wait. that was Alice Cooper. sorry. JOsh is the muppet-looking goon who comes out and sings bad pop w/an operatic voice high enough to make your average SUV driving suburban mom wet herself, as her 12 year old daughter cries.
