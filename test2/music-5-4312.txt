There has never been and will never be anyone who could hope to hold a candle to this man. Thise that don't like him, should at least respect what the man did for music. Because whoever you like, it was him that started it all. He's still #1 on the charts and no matter who you are, age, sex, color, religion or race, we all know him. That says it all. ELVIS! Wherever you are, you are the KING!!!
