F Mcnamara. All I heard was what a great shooter he was, and all I saw him do was miss. He'd be like 2 for 11 from 3 and throw one up, and the commentator would be like, McNamara for 3! all excited as if it was going in. I'm sick of this thinking how every white dude that hits a 3 every once in a while is a great shooter. F him. He couldn't hit Christina Aguilera. Check my new weblist about REAL shooters.
