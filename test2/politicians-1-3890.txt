In some ways, I do find myself agreeing with this man and that terrifies me. However, I do not think he would make a good president. I think he is riding his daddy's name as far as he can. I do not trust him. He has become too wishy-washy on some major issues. And, oh yeah... if I hear a uniter, not a divider one more time, I think I'll scream!
