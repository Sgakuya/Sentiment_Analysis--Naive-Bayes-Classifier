Peyton Manning is a HACK!!! This guy drinks his own pee!!! He is the worst QB to ever grace the field. Whenever this doodiehead gets perfect pass rating games against rated 32 defenses in games that count for absolute **** you treat him like as if he is a god. He lost the first game of the playoffs 3 times in a row for a reason, that being he chokes under pressure. Then when he did do good in the playoffs he looked like a newb against the Patriots, throwing more balls to CB Ty Law then to his leading receiver Marvin Harrison!!! sounds like a great decision making QB to me my ass. He has Edgerrin James an EXCELLENT RB to support his throwing game of Harrison who makes Manning look like he is worth something. Manning is over rated, and I bet we would of never heard of him if it wasn't for his dad who was also a hack. I hate Manning with an ever lasting passion.
