Has anybody remembered that basketball is a team sport? It's morons like Lebron James, Allen Iverson and Steve Francis that are killing the NBA. Franchise is a ballhog that only intends to make highlights instead of trying to win games. Houston was correct to eject him to Orlando. They got one heck of a deal. Now Orlando has to try and figure out how to dump this guy. They'd better, Grant Hill only has a few more years of his NBA career in him, and Dwight Howard is up and coming. If Orlando wants to break out of its bad luck, a good start would be to dump Steve-O.
