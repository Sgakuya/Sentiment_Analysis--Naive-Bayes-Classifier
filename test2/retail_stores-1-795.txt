I remember Guess were the jeans to wear in highschool. Well, I had several but none of them lasted and they shrunk when I got them home and washed them. I had to buy a little bit bigger size then what I normally was (god, to get those days back) so that they would fit me. At that time, I could care less if they fell apart cause mommy and daddy would buy me more!
