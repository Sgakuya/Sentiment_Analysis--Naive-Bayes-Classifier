This guy is the most useless, worthless piece of human flesh to walk the earth. There is only one thing on his mind - reaquisition of power. He's done nothing but accuse our president of everything under the sun that's gone wrong. Columbia disaster - Bush's fault! Economic downturn of 2000 - Bush's fault! (despite the fact that he didn't take office until 2001. Remember Black Thursday? Clinton was president then.) Sept. 11 attacks - Bush's fault! I thought politicians were suppost to support their leaders during times of crisis. I guess Tom and his liberal left live by a different set of rules.
