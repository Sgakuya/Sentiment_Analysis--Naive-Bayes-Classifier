I used to love Aero's clothes untill I worked there for over a year. As an employee I got 30% off of everything but even then I couldn't see the point on spending my money on their cheap crap. Yes, they do have some cute clothes but be careful when you wash them because they will shrink like 3 sizes. I'm not even kidding, I would by my shirts in a large just so they would still fit after the wash and I'm a samll. Also could they please rip off hollister a little more? When ripped jeans were the big thing like 3 months after hollister got them, Aero got them too. Only they were really ugly and poorly made. Also that company has more DRAMA then a freaking highschool. I've never seen so much rudeness and backstabing in my life. And we would all get in trouble if people didn't buy at least 3 things. What are we gonna do? Hold a gun to their head? Anyway just don't shop there, pay the extra 20 bucks for the good jeans at AE because they have a lifetime garuntee.
