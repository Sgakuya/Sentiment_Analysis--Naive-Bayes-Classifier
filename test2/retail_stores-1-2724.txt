I thought an easy project to help a senior citizen friend of mine...remodel the interior of his studio apartment for his caregiver. That was a "thought from hell". Store Managers never responded to paging from consultants, Store managers never answered any phonecalls, Store managers refusing to try to help out when HD is totally at fault. I ordered EVERYTHING (off the shelf for ease of project). Starting with shipping, wrong merchandise shipped, defects and missing pieces in the box, management would not acknowledge me!! Then, I tried to email them @home depot "contact us". An "error" message appears......another words, we get too many complaints so, we don't take email anymore????? Too bad they don't take care of these issues, it would be so easy to win customer's opinions!! We have to go on our own website to publish our distaste of their horrible customer service.
