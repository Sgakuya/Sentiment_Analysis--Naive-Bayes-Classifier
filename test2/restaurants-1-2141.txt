I love Tim Hortons products but these people MUST, and I repeat MUST get new lids!!!!!I have lost count on how many times I have had to change clothes because a slight bump to my arm causes Tim Hortons coffee to come sloshing out of the cup!!!! There are lids that have been developed to stop that....WHY DON'T THEY USE THEM?!?!?!?! Oh I know...It will reduce their profit margin to only a FEW BILLION A YEAR!!!!!
