The main reason that African Americans are disenfranchised socio-economically is the lack of fathers. Mr. Jackson, notwithstanding those who would defend him if he were a murderer, is now nothing but an exposed hypocrite. The man points his finger away from the lack-of-fatherhood issue to the white elite, calling Whity or Hymie the source of the problem. As far as his statement on 1/18/01 that he would stay out of the media to heal his family; I guess his family said, you ain't healing sh**--now get out of the house!
