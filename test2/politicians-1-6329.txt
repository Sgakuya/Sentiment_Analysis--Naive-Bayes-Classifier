Ross Perot is a real nut. His performance on Larry King was hysterical! His defense of the Bush clan is suspect considering all his hateful words and accusations of them in the past. I am so thankful he didn't endorse my man Ralph Nader....Ralph would have lost credibility! What ever happened to Perot's stance against NAFTA? I guess he ruined that fight when Al Gore destroyed him during that Larry King debate. Well, what do you expect from a Texan?....not much! Perot web site: www.loneybins.com
