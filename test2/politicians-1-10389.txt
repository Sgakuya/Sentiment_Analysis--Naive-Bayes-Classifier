This country took a nose dive after George Bush became president. His economic policies have lined the pockets of the rich, and the surplus during the Clinton years is now a big deficit. He has mislead the public with his reasons for war with Iraq. The Iraqi people don't have water or utilities, and we are now pumping oil out of their ground. Paul Wolfowitz and The Project for the New American Century is the Bush's mastermind plan to take over all the oil countries based on lies and asumptions. What they are too heartless to be honest about is that it will take American lives to fulfill their plan. America doesn't stomach spilling blood over selfish interests.
