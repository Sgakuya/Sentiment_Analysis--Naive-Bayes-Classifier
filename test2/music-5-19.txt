Put quite simply, Atchung Baby is the greatest album ever, in my opinion, of course. One of two highly regarded, career defining albums released by U2, the other being The Joshua Tree . While opinions of The Joshua Tree all seem to be in agreement on it being one of the greatest albums ever, many people unjustifiably look at Atchung Baby as the Album were U2 went downhill, went towards electronic, synthed-up POP music. I see it as the absolute pinnacle of U2's illustrious career, where they reached a point that few bands or artists even come close to. After The Joshua Tree and subsiquent tour, there was BIG pressure to follow up. They said the needed to dream it all up again , and delivered. Songs are diversive yet cohisive, and the album soars and falls on an emotional rollercoaster of great lyrics, outstanding melodies and tight yet loose musicianship. To the casual fan of U2 it may sound different or strange compared to the radio friendy, anthematic songs of past (and future). But when you sit down and listen to Atchung Baby without all these preconceived notions of what it should sound like, anyone who truly apprieciates music can't deny it is a GREAT album.
