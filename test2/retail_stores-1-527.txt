Ok so after working at Express since May I can say that this is a bad company to work for.I once thought this was a great clothing store. My opinion has definately changed.First off we (the employees) are forced to basically attack the customers when they come throught the door.If a customer does not leave the store with at least three purchased items then I get repremanded at the end of my shift. I cannot exactly put a gun to someones head and make them buy stuff. Another point to make Express wants to sell stuff to everyone even if it does not fit right or is ugly just try to get the customer to buy it anyway. This company is driven by greed and money and that is all that matters at the sacrifice of customers and employees. Because the employees are brainwashed to sell stuff to people even when they do not want it a person could go into the store and be attacked by three or more workers all desperate for a sell. The clothes are crap. Poorly made and way overpriced. The only time that I would recommend any of you buy these cheap ass clothes is during sales when instead of paying 78 dollars for jeans you could pay just 15 or 20 dollars. Besides the fact that each garment is backstocked with up to 100 additional pairs in the backroom. So who wants to pay $78 dollars for some jeans and walk out of the store and see 50 other people wearing those exact jeans. And usually the clothes are pretty ugly expecially all the neon colored crap they are trying to pass off as fashionable in the women's section. And now my final point, express takes themselves too damn seriously. The managers and the higher-ups actually believe that Express clothing is the American equivalent of Gucci or other high end designer brands. Sorry Express you are no where near Gucci or Armani, Express is just a mall store with cheaply made and overpriced clothing. Please avoid it at all costs!
