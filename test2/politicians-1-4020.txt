Such a phony piece of terd. He didn't answer any of the questions presented to him during his debate with Cheney. Edwards is very unrealistic. Here's a guy that will promise everything to everyone. Taking chances, taking a stand, and being honest with the public are not traits of Sen. Edwards. Beating around the bush, political correctness, and lying are, however.
