The leader of the UN, Annan or anyone else, acts as a mouthpiece for dictatorships. The UN has one criteria for becoming a member: you must be a nation. Period. Not a free nation, not a non-socialist, not non-communist, not non-dictatorship, simply a nation . This means that criminal states like Iraq, Syria, Lybia, and North Korea have equal say in human rights, individual rights, and world policies. The UN wants to form their own militray and collect taxes the world over. I want no part of them and neither should the freedom loving nations of this world. Sorry, Lybia as the director of the UN human rights council is a crime. If you remember your history, never has the US asked for UN approval of their military actions until Bush Sr. changed protocol and asked the UN for advice on the Kuwait situation. His actions were unprecedented; the US has no need to ask anyone's permission to defend themselves.
