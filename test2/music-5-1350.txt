A powerful and hard-hitting record that has stood the test of time. "New Year's Day" and "Sunday Bloody Sunday" are classics and some of the deeper tracks such as "Like A Song" and "Surrender" are outstanding as well. Even as a kid listening to this when it came out, I sort of knew this was something special. Still gets a listen from time to time, and I consider to "War" to be one of U2's three best albums along with Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.
