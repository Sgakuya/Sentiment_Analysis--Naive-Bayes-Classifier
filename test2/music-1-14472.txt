I HATE LYRICS BY STEPHEN SONDHEIM. He himself has laughed self-effacingly at Maria. And guess what--he uses a rhyming dictionary when he writes. It's a fact. And he STILL cannot come up with anything better than Got a rocket in your pocket, keep cooly-cool boy. That is the DUMBEST song lyric I have EVER heard!!!
