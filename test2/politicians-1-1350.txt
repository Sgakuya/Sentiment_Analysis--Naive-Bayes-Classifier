This man is a fool, but an unfortunate byproduct of a corrupt system. Latin America is a country of thievery. The rich people absolutely steal everything from the poor, all in the interests of maintaining their ungodly status. None of them are concerned with investing in their country's future. Miami Airport is a horrible example of how corrupt America's Southern neighbor is. Walking through the airport, it's hard to miss the Latin Americans in their garish, expensive designer clothes, nose high up in the air and completely devoid of manners. Is it really any surprise Communists THRIVE in Latin America? Anyway, Central and South America will continue to be the rathole it presently is until it wises up and learns to control the elitist bastards that dominate those countries. What Chavez needs to do, if he truly cares about reform, is do the right thing and go moderate. It's time for the corruption to end, but Communism is NOT the answer! **Not changing my rating, but for anyone that has the Discovery/Times channel, watch this special and see how outright socialist/COMMUNIST Chavez is. It's the one about his recall election. Everything at his rallies are red, his tie is red, his bodyguard wears a red beret, hammer and sickle flags fly around him, he talks about revolution, he's buying 50 fighter jets and 100K small arms. People call Bush a warmonger? Get ready for when this nutter becomes the South American Stalinpolean. Think all those anti-war crackpots are for real? No they're not, they're instantly for war when it comes to spreading their agenda.
