1. George W. Bush has no backbone. He said that America should root out all terrorists If that is that case, he should support their friend, Israel in getting rid of the suicide bombers. But his administration has not actively done that. Instead he is kowtowing to the Palestine. If I can recall, they are the same jerks who celebrated when the WTC was hit. 2. He said that New York City will get their money. I think New York City will have to wait in line for the Military defense programs, Black colleges, and Mexico. 3. Like many conservatives, Bush has the Blame Clinton mentality. Bush Boy needs to concentrate on his own problems and not think about that horny pig. It is a shame that conservatives are mindless sheep. They support this fraud.
