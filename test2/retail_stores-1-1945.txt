I am in Pa and the 2 pharmasists at this store are very rude and short with the customers. Further more they tell you 20 minutes and they are behind the counter eating and cleaning up only to tell you 10 min later that they don't have your drug. I have been going there for years and now I have switched all my perscriptions to another pharmacy. I hope CVS is better and hires more courteous people in their store. They lost my business forever.
