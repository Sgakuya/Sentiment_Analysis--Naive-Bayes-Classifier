This country is so lucky this guy lost. A terrible disgrace to America, a traitor who gave aid and comfort to the enemy during Vietnam. Aside from all that, an inept politician. I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it. And to hear his excuses for his flip-flops...lol. It's hard to believe that people actually voted for this guy. If anyone deserves 0 stars, he does.
