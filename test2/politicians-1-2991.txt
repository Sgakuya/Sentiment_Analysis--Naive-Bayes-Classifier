I don't think that Rhonda has any idea what she is talking about!!!! This is a statement basically replying to the things she has said! She bitches about having to support people on welfare....well get ready because Jesse is going to send thousands more on the program!!!! So quit your bitchin' and do something about it instead of relying on the womanizing, freakish, insane, half-ass governer that by some miricle got elected. Were you aware of how he wants to screw over the education system? Who do you rely on to teach your children about everything? Who is one of the main people in your child's life that is going to make a difference? Where would your children be without their TEACHER?????? Not with you obviously....because you're too busy working your ass off!!! With Dumbasses proposals, teachers will get majorly screwed over. We will be damn close to the poverty line! What does that mean??? Oh yeah, more people on welfare! How can we call him a representation of our state? What kind of man....any man....stands up for playboy models and focuses way too much of his time on the media? Just because he was a major public figure doesn't give him the right to take his job as a joke. He is in no way professional and if we had any other governor or a president for that matter do anything like he does, they would catch royal hell for it! I just hope in the future, Minnesotans will be a little on the smarter side and get him out of office!!!!
