Not much to go on here. UAB has only been at the top level for 7 seasons(since 1996) and the results are mixed. The team doesn't strike me as bad as the actual record but in the end the record earns them a rating of terrible. They have faced MANY good to strong teams since joining the big boys and played almost all on the road. Auburn, Nebraska, Virginia Tech, USM. They have even managed to beat a few of the lesser programs they have faced and had several close losses to strong teams. The past 4 seasons just haven't been good.
