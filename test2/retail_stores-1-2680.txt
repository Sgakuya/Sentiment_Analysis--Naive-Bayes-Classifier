Kroger Sucks! I cut my Kroger card up. I am Boycotting Kroger and giving all my business to the little guys. I am sick of going through their large crowded, monopolistic grocery stores.I trip over countless employees stocking shelves,idly talking loudly to one another about their personal business, the overhead music or sports, unable to assist me locating a product. Finally, I reach the 1 open checkout line (unless I UScan)... I always bag my own groceries because the bagger is either not there at all or is in some mental fantasy world slowly reading and pondering the labels on my groceries while I and the long line of customers behind me wait and wait. I am infuriated that Kroger is abandoning its current location to become the anchor store to our long awaited Beechmont mall. I refuse to buy any Kroger Groceries or Gas EVER AGAIN!!!
