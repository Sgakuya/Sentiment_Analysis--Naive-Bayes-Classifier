This album is very different from most of the Boss's other albums, but it is every bit as great! From the optimistic and lovely All that Heaven will Allow, Tunnel of Love, and Valentine's Day, to the bittersweet Brilliant Disguise, One Step up, and When You're alone, this albun shows that middle age has taken no negative toll on the number one guy of all time!!
