I really don't like N'Sync that much, but my friend bought me this CD for my birthday and I liked it... I was really suprised that some manufactured group could be that good. I went to their concert in June and it really rocked... If they were actually singing it is beyond me, but their CD kicks ass and I really am an N'Sync fan now. Thanks Michelle!
