I know I shouldn't say this, because the bar always get lowered, but I can't believe there could ever be a worse president than George W. His handlers dictate his policy, and then prop him up in front of the microphone so he can stammer and stutter his way through another dreary, incomprehensible speech. And the drones who are loyal to whatever ideals he ostensibly represents clap at the appropriate moments like trained seals. I've always been a cynic, but I've never dreaded the future like I do now.
