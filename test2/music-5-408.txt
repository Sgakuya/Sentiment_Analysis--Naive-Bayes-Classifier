Version 2.0 serves as a springboard, launching them into a more experimental and beautiful playing field. Shirley Manson's voice crosses old boundaries, and the lyrics are cold and icy, yet introspective, haunting, and vulnerable. The band itself gives a laudable effort to do what no other band has ever tried, much less accomplished with astonishing public appeal, and that is to make studio 'garbage' into music. This is perhaps one of the downright best albums I have ever listened to. Each song is so complex yet sounds so polished and effortless. This is understated genius. It really is.
