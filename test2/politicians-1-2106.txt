Um, does anyone else have a problem with Gray Davis's insane idea that we, the taxpayers, should pay for illegals to go to college? I owe $20,000 in school loans and I have a BIG problem with struggling to make ends meet to pay for my own education while handing over my tax dollars to finance a common criminal's education. It's bad enough that I help put food on their tables and educate their children. I agree with the poster who said that this is all a plot to grow big government and what better way to do it than to have the majority of the population dependent on them? (The poster used slightly different words). Also, why isn't there more outrage over the ball park situation in San Diego? How is it constitutional to make citizens pay for an enterprise that will line the pockets of the already rich? If I want to start a business, can I get the taxpayers to pay my start up costs while I collect the revenue? Who is going to get the money from the naming rights for the stadium? Why should we pay money to see games when we paid for the stadium?
