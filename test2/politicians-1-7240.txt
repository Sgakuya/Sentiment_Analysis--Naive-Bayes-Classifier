im only 13 but i do watch the news alot with my dad, and everytime something happens old jessie is there just to get his name in the spotlight, i heard today that he thinks alot of the black voters that were going to vote for al gore were turned away, well they werent turned away gore just didnt win, maybe gore and jessie need to get together and work at a klennex factory so they cry all day long maybe gore would have had such a hard time but remember the kid they sent back to cuba????
