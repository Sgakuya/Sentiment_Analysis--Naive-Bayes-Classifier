Jesse Jackson is purports to be a man of the cloth: One who teaches love, compassion, and respect for fellow man; yet he spends his time and effort preaching divisiveness and racist claims in order to gain notoriety. This is the lowest form of self engrandisement. He sould seriously evaluate the effect that he has on ALL people, especially blacks.
