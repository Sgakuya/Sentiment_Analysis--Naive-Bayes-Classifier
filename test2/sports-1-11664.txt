The first coach in over a decade at UNC to lose to Dook. Really has alot of love and passion for the university and the game of football. Really wasn't qualified to coach college football and his record shows. Lacks the ability to relate to 17 to 23 year olds. Probably would make a better NFL assistant than college football coach. I expect to see him replaced at the end of the season.
