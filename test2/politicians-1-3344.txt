Hear his speech yesterday? All of the succsess he talked about was because of Clinton and Gore. The President has mismanaged everything from the war in Iraq to the enviornment. Gas prices have gone up. While the Republican media supports him and gets their facts mixed up, he is sitting there in Washington D.C. in Al Gores chair in Al Gore's home laughing at the 51% of Americans who voted for the President in the year 2004 instead of Democrat John Kerry. Bush has ignored just about everything. The Republicans good on defense, theres a laugh while Republicans constinly mismanage our millitary and ignore our troops it's Democrats who stand up for a stronger America. Bush is the worst.
