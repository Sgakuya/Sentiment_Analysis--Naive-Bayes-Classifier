This album to me is Our Lady Peace's best album to date. It has incredible depth and meaning. The lyrics are amazing and leave much to be interpreted by yourself. These songs are for everyone and can be taken very much to heart. The mix of intsruments is also unbelievable well done. I can listen to this cd(as well as their others) on repeat for ever without ever getting tired of it. My personal fav's from this cd are Middle of Yesterday and If you believe. An amazing cd by an amazing band. Also the book this cd is based on is very intriguing and a great read.
