We decided to eat BK for lunch.We ordered a chicken sandwhich and a order of onion rings.Well the chicken sandwhich tasted like fish and even looked like fish,and the onion rings did not even look right.The onion in the onion ring looked like some dough it was WIERD.So when we left my Mom went complained to the Manager about it,all she said was yeah, allright i tell them to make it better.Its like she did not even care.''''She did not even bother giving our money back.''''
