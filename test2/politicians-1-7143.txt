This baby out of wedlock thing is no surprise to me. I have never had any admiration for him. He turns real problems into a circus and does not represent black America as he fronts himself as some sort of self annoited mouth piece. He is a fake minister preaching a religion that is not his nor one that benefits his followers. He talks independence but by nature of being a minister is actually teaching dependence and sheep like thinking. Get out of public life and get a job, stop hurting us and our issues with you clownish rhyming and amateur poetry.
