This is my favourite album of all time. It is a double album and both CDs are full of great songs. I've found that even though there are two CDs full of songs, each song is still different from every other song which is one reason why I love this album so much. Certainly there are some songs which are better than others, that is true with everything. Some of the best tracks on this album are Tonight Tonight , Zero , Bullet With Butterfly Wings and 1979 . But that is definitely not the full list of good songs on this album. Certainly there are 2 or 3 songs on the album I don't like so much, but that's not unusual for me. If there's one CD I'd definitely recommend that you go out and buy though, it is definitely this one.
