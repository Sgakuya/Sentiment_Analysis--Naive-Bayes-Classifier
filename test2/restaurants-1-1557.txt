Airdrie Alberta, Canada I am sick and tired of the lousy service at your Airdrie Alberta KFC location. This location has a reputation in the city for poor service. Service is extremely slow! People are served out of line. The dumb ass clerks behind the counter are obviously not trained properly, can't get orders right. In a town this size where word gets around very quickly I do not understand why when sooo many have brought this issue to your attention, you still cannot resolve it. This location has a poor reputation and I am adding my name to the boycott list because of crappy service. This evening I decided to pick something up at this location as a treat for my family. Of course when I mentioned picking something up there my family objected stating. It'll take forever, then they screw it up. Against my better judgement I went over there anyways, only once again to stand in line for about 20 minutes while the stupid, dumb ass clerk behind the counter tried to figure out which way was up! After waiting 20 minutes the little shit head decided to serve someone who just walked in the door completely ignored me. The little dumbass could see me standing there however for whatever reason I guess he decided I wasn't important. I then decided at that point that was simply the last time I or any one in my neighbourhood would be stepping foot into that store. As to others in the area whom have voiced their displeasure with this location I myself have also voiced my displeasure with your corporation. As with several other household in Airdrie we are Boycotting this location, and will voice our displeasure and the poor service experiences we have had over the past year. My neighbour has informed that she has placed her complaint on a website which records complaints. Apparently KFC has a long list of complaints on the internet. Just key in KFC service on a search engine and see what comes up. Our complaint is now listed also. If you wish to continue to do business in the community you must get off your asses and clean up the incompetance at this location. Why not drop by yourself on an evening or weekend and see just how slow the service is. Better pack a lunch, it'll take awhile. To your benefit there a few other very good restaurants in the area you can go and get something to eat while your waiting for the a holes at your location to get there asses in gear. All we have received from you people is alot of aggrevation and time wasted. Old man Sanders would be ashamed of you guys.
