Going back over my comments and after reviewing my previous satements about Ms. Clinton, it became clear that I was wasting valuable brain power. I was trying to fashion a position that would portray my negative opinion her record and her history. Giving her some time in office I thought would allow me to perhaps see another side of the former first lady. Alas there is no other side. She is a politician in the classic sense(and that's sad) and her supporters would vote for her under any circumstance. I hope she stays contained.
