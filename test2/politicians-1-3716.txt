I am extremely disappointed in what we call government, and frankly, I am ashamed to be an American. I am someone who Did Not vote for George W. Bush, and I join in ranks with many others. If you talk to people pushing GWB, there is not one moment where his accomplishments are highlighted. Integrity is what we were told he offered. Well, someone who is a law breaking, cocaine snorting, attempted rapist is no where near integrity. The fact that the man was not able to correctly identify the 3 branches of government in a speech filled with whining about the election results is utterly PATHETIC. Have pride in this country-I am sorry, I can not. We have allowed ourselves to move into a phase where the interest of the people does not matter any more. Poor people, hang on to your pocketbooks, because we are in for a rough 4 years. Daddy's Jackass (GWB) will make sure of that!!
