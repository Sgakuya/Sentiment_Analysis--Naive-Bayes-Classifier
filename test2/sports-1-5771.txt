You know what? Even though I don't like UNC, i do agree with them here. Julius Hodge is the cockiest ass hole in the ACC. He is soooo annoying. And the worst thing is, he can't actually back up any of his talk. He doesn't even deserve a one star rating. Go Chris Paul! Somebody had to show this kid who's boss. ACC player of the year huh? Guess Redick showed ya up on that one. What now BIOTCH!!!!
