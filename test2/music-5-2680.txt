The Beatles making sound paintings. There must be something here for everyone. I feel sad for the cynics who profess to be haters of Beatles music. Hatred for a group the offered nothing but love and left us with such a powerful and never ending legacy. Fear not seers of the bright side, this is truly the musical masterpiece that it is reputed to be. Crawl out of your deep, dark holes you who hate the fine things of this good life. The Blues Meanies couldn't kill off the Beatles music and neither can you.
