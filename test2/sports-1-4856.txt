I had hoped to find a 0-stars category...Year after year, I've waited for NCSU's learning-disabled administration to fire Herb Sendek, and hire a REAL coach. I can't see that it's advantageous to keep Sendek when his teams regularly blow 20-point leads, and whose teams occasionally get invited to the NCAA tournament but get eliminated in 1st or 2nd round. Have any of his players gone to the NBA? 1 1/2 decades--15 years--of mediocrity after 9 Sendek years; and the 6, miserable, Les Robinson years. It took UNC-Ch only 3 years to realize that Matt Doherty wasn't championship material. How much longer do we have to endure this beans & rice coaching? It's time for filet mignon. After 15 years of NCSU's basketball slop, I don't even get excited anymore when NCSU plays a rival because I know they'll lose.
