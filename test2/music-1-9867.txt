Are you serious? How can Christina Aguilera be listed as a musical artist? I guess you don't have to have any talent to be in the music business today (just look at our choices...everything from N'Stink to Backdoor Boys). The only way I would listen to Christina sing is if Dr. Jack Kevorkian was standing over my bed he used her music as assisted suicide.
