It seems like every time I go into a Radioshack, I quickly get frustrated and end up leaving. There products are massively confusing and not laid out well at all. The people working there are too helpful- they were talking so fast I couldn't even understand what the guy was saying. They confuse you; he showed me like 16 different brands. I think he was going to show me more when I decided to go down the street to Best Buy. I found and paid for what I was looking for in 5 minutes.
