What an awesome cd, really shows off how olp can manipulate the mood in a song and raine's inspiring voice and lyrics add flavour to the already brilliant music. it's a great cd, stand out tracks like, 'life', 'middle of yesterday' and 'all my friends' really impact on you, makes you think about the future and 'right behind you' has a depth to it, it's hard to really understand it, therefor the more you listen, the better you form an opinion. 'in repair' is hauntly beautiful, amazing music(go Jeremy!) wonderful lyrics and a uplifting voice, the way it's put together, it's just well done. 'The wonderful future' impacts on you in a very different way then the other songs, much more mystical and airy, very lightheaded so to speak. 'Made to heal' is kind of a fun, party type song. it's a unique sound for olp, and personally i like it. 'Everyone's a junkie' has an amazing meaning toit if you really listen to what raine maida is saying and you've read the book(and understood it) you kind of catch the drift of what he's saying. 'Are you sad?' is just beautiful;that's all i have to say, teary, gorgeous, deep, beautiful...'If you believe' is also beautiful, in a slightly different way though. An uplifting, pretty, inspiring, beautiful! hopefully i didn't miss anything, great cd!
