Badu sucks. Now, her first album was pretty good b/c it was different and appealed to a wide range of individuals. But, she fooled us. She has no talent. Every song sounds alike, and they make absolutely no sense. She is frontin' with all this deep, rainbow dressing, basket-head crap. She just writes the first words that come in her head, gets a few beats, and calls it a song. Erykah, you need to keep trippin' and sing for real. You might actually have a good voice, but we can't tell b/c you talk through your songs, not sing through them. Badu sucks.
