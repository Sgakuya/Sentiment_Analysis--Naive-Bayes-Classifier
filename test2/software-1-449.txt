I have to agree with Averagejoe54, MsVJP, Ninja_Squirrel, Ablazed Fallen, and vetteman03. This O/S sucks!!!!. If you have a 98 machine and want to upgrade, you would not go wrong with 2000. Or stay with 98. If you want to go with new hardware maybe look at XP Pro. But at any rate steer clear of this one....
