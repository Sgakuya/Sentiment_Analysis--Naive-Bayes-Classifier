JJ Redick has talent. He is a good range shooter, but many go to the pros and are dropped and do awful. I think we just need to wait to see him in the pros. To many people are already talking about what his pro career is gonna bring. Slow down. I am a Carolina fan and many did that w/ Marvin Williams and he hasn't proven much. Come on Dukies. If I can admit that JJ Redick has talent why can't you ever admit we have some talent! Go heels!
