i believe he is second only to bird, thus i have to give him a low one. But jordan is a player who can score just like bird, the only difference between them in an average game is that bird will mix in about 5 more rebounds, assists, steals and blocks than jordan, and jordan will score about 20 more points than bird, who would you pick???
