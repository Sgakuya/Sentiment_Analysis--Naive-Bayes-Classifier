Too bad you don't have a 0 rating. This monkey deserves to bring up the bottom of this list. As a matter of fact, he should not even be listed on the same page as the others. He was appointed by his buddies on the court to hold this office and not elected like the rest on the list. I would rather have Clinton back anyday. At least the country was in good shape! Clinton made better decisions on the phone while receiving a bl*w job, then George Dubya has made in the last 3, count'em 3 years! Reading the comments from some of the republican sheep on here is really amusing. So here is an amusing one for them. MR\MRS\MS Sheep- Before your shirt gets wet from the drool and foam from your mouth, just remember the majority of Americans won't re-elect this moron. The only way he'll be around 4 more years is if he finds a way to cheat like he did the first time around. If that happens, you can sit around admiring the deerhead on the wall, guzzling beer and scratching your a** while the country goes to Hell in a handbasket.
