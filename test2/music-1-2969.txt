Give me a break. How could anyone say this album is satisfying? First of all, how could any group release a double album with so much crap on it? One after another, the songs get worse and worse - which is the norm for this group. By the time Martha My Dear comes on I'm ready to smash the record into 1 million pieces, like all the other Beatle records should be!!
