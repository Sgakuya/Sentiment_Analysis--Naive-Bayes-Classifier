This is the Rosetta Stone of blues music. The recordings of Robert Johnson contain the raw kernels that became rock, country and gospel. And this is the raw, uncut real music everyone in the sixties was trying to make, but failed. If you can listen to Led Zeppelin without laughing after you listen to Robert Johnson you JUST DON'T GET IT!!! If you are a blues fan, or just interested in learning about the genre, this is the set to buy.
