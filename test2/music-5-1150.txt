Let me explain my five-star rating by first saying that I'm not a huge Chili Peppers fan. I thought Blood Sugar Sex Magic was catchy but ultimately did not pass the test of time (the song Under the Bridge, for instance, now causes me to change the radio station whenever it comes on). But I really liked One Hot Minute. Maybe it s the influence of Dave Navarro (who is no longer with the band) that did it for me on this CD with great songs like Deep Kick and Aeroplane. Overall One Hot Minute is a little darker and more intense than the Chili Pepper s other stuff, which is probably why I think it s better.
