A man that exudes poor sportsmanship and he's fine with that. Although he occassionally comes up a good call at the right time, he's still a 4 to 5 loss coach every year. He's never had less than 4 anywhere that he's coached. That tells me that he has certain qualities to work with, but he's very limited in what he can offer......except misplaced arrogance.
