I have patronized several large electronics retailers, and Best Buy is the Last one I would ever shop at again. Their extended warranty is an absolute sham! I purchased a PDA and was told that the extended warranty ensured that it would work to my satisfaction, or they would repair or replace it. Furthermore, if I had to bring it in for repair more than 3 times, they would exchange it for a new, comparable PDA under their lemon policy, no questions asked. Well it did develop some annoying quirks (battery would not hold a charge, search function generated fatal errors) and brought in in six times. The tech staff in the store would not pass on accurate info to the repair staff, and repair staff claimed it worked for them. This made no difference to store staff, including the manager, when I demonstrated the failure at the counter immediateley after getting it back from the repair facility. They blamed it on their contract with the manufacturer and repair facility. In over 40 years as a consumer, I have never felt as shabbily treated by any other commercial entity as I have by Best Buy.
