This record is a perfect example of incredible talent on all levels. The music styles vary in each song, the poetry and plain fun in some cases, of his lyrics touch on issues from God, to love, to the right to get high, to fighting for beliefs in what's right. His voice is always pleasing and holds. Such a quality that each listener feels as though he's singing just for them.
