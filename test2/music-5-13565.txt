Eminem is absolutly the bomb. I think it's great that there's a white rapper out there representin', and he's making it. His raps are hot, and so is he. Alot of his lyrics are harsh, but once you listen, I mean really listen to them they really do have a meaning to them, it's real life stuff, that goes on all the time. I love his song Stan, it's the best, and I hope one day to meet Eminem, and maybe become his next wife!!
