Janet Reno was an atrocious Attorney General. She didn't do anything of real consequence on the job. I believe that got too much fire concerning the Waco incident though. She didn't realize that it would have turned out that way. Still, she should have known that 1. there were women and children in that building, some who were being held hostage against their own will and 2. that David Koresh had a huge arsenal in there that he indicated he would use if he had to. Reno used way too much force in breaking into the Waco compound. More than likely, it would have all turned out fine if she hadn't resorted to such tactics. Same thing with the Elian case. This women is a brute! To top it off she was a political hack as well. Reno refused to investigate the Clinton-Gore 1996 campaign funding irregularity primarily because her job was on the line. Clinton told her explicitly that she would be fired if she let the investigation go on. She was one of Bubba's best enablers, one of the many actually! Clinton claimed that he was coming to Washington to form the most ethical adminstration in history. Lesson: Those with the best intentions or who claim to have the best intentions turn out to be the biggest snakes out there. Clinton and his most of his crew managed to give us a new scandal every week. Hillary was right, there was a right wing conspiracy, but here's the kicker, the Clintons gave them all the ammunition they needed to go up against them. Reno was just a part of the whole mess.
