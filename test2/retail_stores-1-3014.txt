i worked also for this co and we were at threat if we did not sell the life disability and theif insurance we were told to add it in to purchace and give monthly payments to customers with the insurance already added in and then explain what coverage you would get, we also were told to look at their credit information kept on card when they opened account and if they had purchased the insurance before add it to this purchance. this is very much illegal and i am surprised someone in the co has not followed up on this better yet i am surprised the court involved in the bankrupt situation has not taken legal action, this co has seen its last days .
