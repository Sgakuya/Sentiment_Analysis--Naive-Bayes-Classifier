I like some of Ricky's CD's more than others but there are several songs on this CD that I really like! I couldn't wait for this to be released, my copies of the first English language CD were plum wore out. I don't understand why people who don't like him feel it necessary to leave such horrid comments. Find an artist you like and vote to support them. I don't like Eminem's music but I don't feel it necessary to bash him or his fans. I like all kinds of music including Bruce Springsteen, the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, and Ricky Martin. Like Ricky himself says, NEXT!
