One stat will tell you that Mike Davis cannot coach. Indiana had been out scored by over 100 points in the second half this year. Why? because at half time, other coaches make what I like to call adjustments. Mike Davis obviously doesn't know what those are. I am a die hard IU fan since I can remember and that will never change. But I hope we don't even make it to the N.I.T. so IU will get off their asses and fire Mike Davis. I like him as a person and a recruiter. But he is not an effective leader of men.
