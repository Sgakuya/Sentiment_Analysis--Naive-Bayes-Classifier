Another incredible record by an incredible band. Collectively the album won 7 Grammys for this album. First four tracks are really great Beautiful Day, Stuck in a Moment..., Elevation, and Walk On are classics. Wild Honey also a good tune. Well worth the money if you like meaningful lyrics and appreciate guitar this album is for you.
