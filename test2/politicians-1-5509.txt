This man is against all that I believe in, he's a liberal, abortionist, scumbag. With lot's of money from his wives and state. He lied about his Vietnam Story (probably shot babies the whole time.) He votes to higher taxes more then any other pres under Bill Clinton of course and is for gay marriage. It's Al Gore, Arnold, and JFK combined with just their bad ideas and plans. He is also against most of the ideas our past presidents came up with including Reagan, Clinton and many more. Plus he uses Botox, thats just stupid. He probably got one too many head wounds in Vietnam, not to mention he wrote an essay in college that said he wants to take all US army and people to attack the U.K. and never gave good reasoning. This is making democrats look bad, of course I don't care, I'm republican cause I actually have plans for the future.
