This may be an older Bruce, but you'd never tell it by just listening! He brings rock and roll back to life on this album in his own supreme style! I really love this cd! It is full of life, spirit, exhuberance and everything else that rock n Roll stands for! Bruce is, no matter HOW old he gets, always superb!!!!
