Hey, Rate it All, take this guy off of the Governors list. He's not our governor anymore! Thank god Arnold won. It makes me sick how these hypocritical liberals are. They blame Bush for the economy, but they don't blame anything on Davis, even though he ruined our state's economy. Well, at least liberals are losing power in CA, yesterday's election was a perfect example.
