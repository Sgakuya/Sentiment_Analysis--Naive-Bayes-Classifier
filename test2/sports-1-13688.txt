 Talk about a smart move. Leave a winning but declining franchise in a bitterly cold part of the world to take over an immensely talented but underachieving team in one of the best places to live in the country. You have to give credit to this guy's sense of timing. Does it still look like a smart move? Packers are 5-1 this year and coming off of a good season last year. Do you think Holmgren wishes he had a Brett Favre now? I think Green Bay is better off without Holmgren. He got greedy, and now he's put in his place.
