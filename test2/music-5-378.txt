This band is one of my ultimate favorite bands(besides Portishead). They actually sound somewhat like Portishead. I've been listening to Radiohead for seven years and they are still my all time favorite. I have all the Radiohead albums including the imported Creep single from Germany. Radiohead can often make me either laugh or cry. I feel I can totally relate to their music.
