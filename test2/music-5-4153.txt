Zenyatta Mondatta (1980) was the third full-length effort by the Police, and it was the band's best in my opinion. While I have never been that impressed with the more popular singles from this release (Don't Stand So Close to Me and De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da, though the former eventually grew on me), the lesser singles remain excellent: Driven To Tears, Canary In A Coalmine, When The World Is Running Down, You Make The Best Of What's Still Around, Bombs Away, and Man In A Suitcase. Zenyatta Mondatta also contains the Grammy winning instrumental Behind My Camel. This release remains a winner through every track.
