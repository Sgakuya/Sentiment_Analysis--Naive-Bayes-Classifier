Finally a singer who you can understand and care about. I had given up on caring about the music until I heard Clay Aiken on American Idol. I have followed his career and am proud to call myself a Clay Fan. Not only can this man sing, he is a consumate showman, hard working, beautiful, and then there is his foundation that he works hard for. This man is a wonderful role model and I am so proud of him. Happy Birthday Clay. Marilan
