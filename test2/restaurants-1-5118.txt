I was going to give this place 2 stars, but the tv commercials bring it down to 1. Anyone who is influenced by their commercials deserves the wretched food that awaits them here. I would rather eat at a chinese buffet at the risk of getting food poisoning than to eat here. I would rather chew on a dog toy shaped like a sirloin steak than to eat anything this place's menu labels as steak.
