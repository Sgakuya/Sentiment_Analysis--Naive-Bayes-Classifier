Easily one of the best albums from one of the best musicians working today. While it does not have some of the fire and strangeness of her earlier releases, this is a mature, polished, masterful offering from one of the msot potent songwriters of the last decade. She's still got some of the best piano chops in popular music, her voice sounds better than ever (and less harsh for those who might have been turned off her earlier works), and her lyrics are less loopy/insane and more pointed and focused. Amazing!
