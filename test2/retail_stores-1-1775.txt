Shopping here is average for some products, but when it comes to electronics and media, terrible. Nobody who works there knows anything about the products they sell. Sure, they tout that they have the lowest price on games and movies, but usually by no more than 25 cents. Go to Best Buy for electronics and the like, and Target for everything else. At least Target's employees shower.
