I love this country CD. It contains a huge variety of songs, ranging from the up-beat I Like it, I Love it, to the slow, My Next 30 Years. Most country music CDs have the same tone and beat through all their songs (sometimes I have difficulty distinguishing one from another) but these songs were all different. Although the lyrics were a bit stereotypical coutry, the happy and slow beats definitely made up for it!
