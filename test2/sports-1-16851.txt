Even with Favre the Packers can't catch a walking camel. In 1996, the Packers-wonder of wonders- won the Super Bowl. It may sound like I am congratulating them, but no. That year they stunk also. In week 10 or 11, around there, the Packers played the winless Indianapolis Colts. They went into the RCA Dome and lost, by a FG. The Packers were the best team in the league, but they can't win the games they were supposed to. I would never give a team a 5 that can't win games, or beat themselves in the process. As far as Favre goes- OH NO I'M GETTING SACKED, Interception,darn.
