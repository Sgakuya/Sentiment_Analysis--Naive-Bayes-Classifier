They are my favorite group! They dont sample everything like other artist. Plus them niggas can flow with knowledge. I like every album that the put out and I will continue buying Outtie until they retire. The CD even gives you a lil something that sounds like Prince from back in the day. Who can ever think of that? But Outtie!
