If you want to talk about cheating, look in the mirror Mr. Lieberman. The ballots were counted, recounted and recounted. Should we keep extending the time to allow the loser to win. It's like playing a game, when the game is over the game is over. In football, once the clock has run out, the coaches don't get to go back and ask for instant replays on questionable calls. The clock has run out, the game is over!!!
