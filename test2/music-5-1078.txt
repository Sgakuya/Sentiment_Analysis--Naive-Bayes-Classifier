This CD just grows on you the more you listen to it. I suggest hearing it at least a dozen times before you form an honest opinion. By that time you probably won't be able to stop listening to it, because the full emotion connected with each song, along with the superb lyrics will have you singing like you never have before. Having just seen Creed live in concert twice performing several of the songs from this CD, I can truly say they are headed for superstardom. This is music from the heart.
