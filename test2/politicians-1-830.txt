It's not important for me it a democracy function good or less good, it doesn't legitimize a military coup d' tat any more, being in Pakistan or the States! The coup makers in Chile, with Pinochet in front, used the same arguments when they removed Salvador Allende from the president chair. And what did we see as the result? Thousands of innocent human beings being tortured killed, a horrifying regime that didn't allow people with different views opinions! Up till these day Chile has been one of the main action countries for Amnesty, of this same reason. :-(
