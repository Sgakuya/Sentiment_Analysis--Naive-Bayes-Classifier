I'm ashamed to have cast my vote for him, which I did only to prevent the election of George W. Bush. Florida's Republican Mafia and the U.S. Supreme Court managed to arrange a coronation anyway. It's hard to believe that the Vice President was unable to twist even one Democratic senatorial arm to validate the Congressional Black Caucus's challenge to Florida's electors. The Democratic Party has repeatedly stabbed in the back its most loyal and hardworking constituency. In all truth, it has been Jesse Jackson, and not President Clinton or Al Gore, who has been the true standardbearer for justice and democracy.
