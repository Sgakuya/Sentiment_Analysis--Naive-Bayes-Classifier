3rd world goods, outrageous prices, they prey on the mindless youth, selling sweatshop garments. Abercrombie should tatoo sucker on the purchaser's forehead with every sale! One would have to be a mindless dolt to overpay for this trash, and then walk around advertising that you have been ripped off by having A F all over your clothing! You can buy the same flip flops for .99, that Ambercrome sells for $17! Their clothes Scream, LOOK AT ME I'M STUPID, ABCROMBIE MARKETEERS SCAMED ME If you are ruled by TV,and have a herd mentality and more money than brains, Abercromie is the store for you! INDIVIDUALS AVOID ABERCORMBIE AT ALL COSTS, NOTHING THERE FOR YOU!! KID ROCK DOESN'T SHOP HERE!! Any one that wears this clothing line says to the world I am easily manipulated and very insecure just makes them look stupid not cool!
