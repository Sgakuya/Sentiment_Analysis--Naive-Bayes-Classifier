Recorded when The Who were at their peak - Townshend at his most creative peak, Moon playing with the enthusiasm of a teenager but the skill of a veteran rock legend, Entwhistle playing the bass like a lead instrument, and leather-lungs Daltrey belting out some of the greatest rock songs and ballads in history. This was the second rock opera from The Who that didn't become the pop culture hit that Tommy did, but in so many ways is the superior album in both storyline and music.
