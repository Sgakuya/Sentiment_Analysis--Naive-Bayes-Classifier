Thanks for leading us into an unnecessary war, diminishing our surplus, ignoring Osama Bin Laden, doing nothing to protect our envirnoment, doing nothing to protect woman's right to choose, doing nothing to renew the ban on assualt weapons, isolating is from the world, using gays as a political tool, dividing our country worse than it has been since Vietnam...
