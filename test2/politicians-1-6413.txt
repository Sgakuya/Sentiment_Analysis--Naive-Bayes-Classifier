I didn't think he was still a U.S. politician. It is reaches the point of offensive to realize how stupid, oblivious, ignorant, and out-of-touch Quayle was. He was just sort of a gimmick of a Vice President. I own a book of the 1,000 dumbest things ever said by politicians and (surprise, surprise) they have an entire chapter devoted to J. Danforth Quayle. It is comical to actually look at some of the things that came out of this guy's mouth. When you read them, you won't believe your eyes.
