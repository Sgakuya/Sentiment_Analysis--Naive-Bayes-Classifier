Jesse Jackson is the biggest racists of all. He lies to African-Americans. The government is not the end all for everyone. And cannot be everything to everyone. Individuals have unlimited opportunity in the USA regardless of the ethnicity. That is what Jesse should be saying. Martin Luther King, Jr. would be ashamed of Jesse Jackson. He is a divider, inciter and race baiter.
