If VH1 new anything about music, they would've ranked this CD as number one on their greatest albums of the century list. I totally agree with everyone who gave this album five stars. It is so awsome and everytime you listen to it you feel better. Green Day is my favorite and should be yours too. Go and buy yourself a copy.
