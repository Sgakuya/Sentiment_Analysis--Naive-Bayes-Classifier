Absolute horrible coach. He never could win anything with the Knicks and he is underachieving with the Rockets. He has Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady and can't get out of the first round with them. His offenses are dry and uncreative. His defenses are above average. His coaching strategies with substitutions and plays are absolutely horrible. This guy probably would be someone's annoying boss on Wallstreet if he wasn't lucky enough to be Pat Riley's friend to get into the NBA coaching network and make millions for a horrible job. His biggest achievement is taking an underachieving Knicks team in the then-weak Eastern Conference to the Finals to quickly get rubbed out by the Spurs in the moxy shortened-season of 1999.
