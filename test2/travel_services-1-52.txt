I fly about 50k miles per year... Continental typically has the type of customer service that is so pervasive today - BAD. From the You're-Bothering-Me-By-Being-Here attitudes to the desperation to push back just in order to make the flight go off on-time . With the smaller leg room in coach, constant delay problems, bad attitudes - they're about at the bottom of my totempole.
