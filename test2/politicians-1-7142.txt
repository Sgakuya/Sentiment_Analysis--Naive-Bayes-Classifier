It is amazing that the great Rev Jackson has had this happen to him. Especially since he was counseling President Clinton on the very same issue-how to cheat and get by with it with as little pain as possible. Do not admire this man for his admission, he only admitted it after he found that a article was being published on it. Shame on you Rev Jackson for your hypocrisy and shame on you for your WEAK body that cannot resist temptation but can speak of others errors. What does the bible state do not worry about the speck in anothers eyes and ignore that very plank of wood that is in your own eye.
