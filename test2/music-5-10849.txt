This is one CD that I can listen to straight through without skipping any tracks. Lifehouse's thought-provoking, sometimes spiritual lyrics are one of the best things about this band. Musically, they are reminiscent of Creed and Matchbox 20, with their own special spin, of course. If you like music that makes you think, I definitely recommend that you check out Lifehouse!
