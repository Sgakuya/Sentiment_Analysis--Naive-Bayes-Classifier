I worked for the company some years back and I'm telling you, you’re getting gypped. Their flagship store is a dysfunctional lot run by women who should not even run a taco stand! The clothing gets damaged in the back rooms of the 60th street branch and nobody cares, dust, filth and even leaky pipes soil the clothing that you try on. I don't know what you are looking for but bargains aren’t it when you shop on Madison and 60th!
