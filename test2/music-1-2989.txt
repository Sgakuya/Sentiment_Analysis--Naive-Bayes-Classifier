The perfect album for an aging hippie who is stuck in the 60's. But for the rest of the world, this record has no true landmark songs and has some really stupid songs i.e. Honey Pie , Rocky Racoon and Savoy Truffle . Maybe, and I emphasize MAYBE, if they released it as a single album it would be a little better.
