Much, MUCH better than the debut. Nash's songs, while certainly not bad, are a little cutesy and lightweight, but it's still a 5 star record."Helpless" is a truly beautiful , amazing achievement by Young, one of his greatest songs ever. The title track is mesmerizing, "Country Girl" is dramatic and heartfelt, "Everybody I love You" is an exciting yet brief rock track, and the hits mentioned in the previous review hold up better to repeated listenings than most other overplayed classic rock chestnuts.
