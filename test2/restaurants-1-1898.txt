I used to enjoy Burger King until I realized the people running the establishment must be a bunch of perverted creeps. As if naming their nasty King mascot Flicky wasn't bad enough and totally gross sounding, now they introduce the world to a nasty looking bunch of weirdos called Coq Roq which is just a supposedly more polite way of saying Cock Rock. And please tell me what a nasty looking king waking up in bed with a man has to do with eating burgers and fries or throwing BD parties for kids. Burger King is gross and i pride myself on not eating there.
