I worked in the store as well 2 holiday seasons ago. On my last day of work I placed a special order. My last day of work was Feb 20, 2004 it took until mid July for the order to come in. (And that was leaving on good terms!!) I can also attest to the so called "sale." Any time you see a "One Day Sale" come back the next day. You will see that the signs are still up. Do not expect any thing on time especially during the Holiday season. I actually ruined someone's wedding day because the rings did not come in on time and I took the heat from the bride because my manager didn't want to be "the bad guy."
