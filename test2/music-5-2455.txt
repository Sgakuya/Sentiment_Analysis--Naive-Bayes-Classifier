Personally-Revolver is one of my favorite Beatle albums-each Beatle totally shines on this masterpiece. It's a CD that you can listen to over, and over, and over, and still adore! A complete and utter masterpiece. And why must we have some Led Zeppelin album in order to rate a BEATLES album?-who cares about Led Zep-this is a rating of Revolver-an album by the Beatles-definitley NOT Led Zepellin-they could never make a masterpiece like Revolver.
