What other people have said is crap. They make their songs have meaning and show that people can change their lives for the better. They give hope to kids and have great lyrics. It's better that you can understand and interpret the lyrics for yourself. Most punk songs don't give you that it's just meaningless sh** that someone writes when their high or pay someone to write it for them. Their actualy changed their lives and are teaching kids to do the same, i mean your a bi**h if you think there posers when their trying to help kids, i mean are u completely heartless.
