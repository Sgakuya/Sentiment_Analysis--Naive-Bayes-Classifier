FACE IT AL! You lost! Stop being a poor loser! I honestly think the man is slipping in votes. They are only recounting the Democrate counties, therefore Florida is not getting a fair recount. Plus...the man probably knows that he will win this election either by slipping in votes or whatever means possible. Bush won! I think we need have a new election! Let's all vote again and decide this over again. This is the most pitiful election I have ever heard of! Al needs to be investigated! The man doesn't need to be in office. He's too sneaky! Bush won...leave it at that for heaven's sake!
