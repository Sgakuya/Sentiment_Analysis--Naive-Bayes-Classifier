I was at a game last night... fell asleep during the 3rd quarter... these guys looked like a high school team... orlando looked just as bad... quite frankly, if you are paid to be a professional athlete, shouldn't you at least TRY to play like one? I wanna REFUND plus compensation for pain and suffering!
