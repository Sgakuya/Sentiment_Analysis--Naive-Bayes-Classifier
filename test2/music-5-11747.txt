Good Charlotte is one of my favorite fuc*king bands in the world and i dont give a sh*it what anyone says they kick as*s! and i total disagree with these people - axlrod2003,/- GODisRIGHT2,/- Jsulli8040,/- Rules0409 (fu*ck u man get a life),/- warmTape,/- MeatLamp,/-Dentonpunk,/- and who ever else has put them down! The Good Charlotte CD The Young The Hopeless is a fuc*king kick as*s cd and i love all the songs! GO OUT AND GET IT IF YOU HAVENT YET!
