Bush couldn't play a better Reagan if he tried. Yes, he outspent communists, but it was later known that they only kept their country in business because they invested into their own military expenditure. This containment theory was a great way of saying, lets take over the world and become the next Rome. Oh by the way, lets invade other countries overseas, import cocaine through government funded agencies, raise the stakes for drug dealers so that we can put millions of people in prison in the future. Let prison become a business so that I can invest my money in prison stocks. Let the rich get richer, and let the poor starve. Reaganomics baby.. Yeah yeah i shot Reagan!
