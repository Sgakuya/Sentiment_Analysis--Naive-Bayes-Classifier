I watched Jesse on C-Span last night. Grace. Character. Poise. None of these can possibly be used to describe the Rev. Jackson. He is an absolute divider of the most cancerous kind. Granted, the election has revealed weaknesses in the process. They need to be fixed. However, do not try to pretend that these were aimed at disenfranchising certain populations. To proclaim such is to divide people. This however is not out of character for Jesse. As long as he sees a podium that he can use to complain, he will be happy. Take a lesson from both of the candidates and understand that the nation as a whole is more important that you.
