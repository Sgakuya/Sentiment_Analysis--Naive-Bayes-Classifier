This is a horrible company. I recently moved from NE to VA. Wheaton said an average deliver was between 7 - 11 days, but since it was the slow season it should be there close to 7. 16 days later my belongings finally arrived. I constantly had to call the company to get updates as to where my belongings were and the could never give me a straight answer. After calling customer service to get a better idea of why this was happening, I was told there was nothing they could do for me and I would just have to sit and wait. After everything did finally show up, I come to find out from the driver that my belongings sat on the trunk from the city I moved from for two weeks before they decided to deliver. It was great to hear that I was being lied to the entire time by a corporation that survives on customer service. I would defiantly recommend paying a few extra dollars to go with a different mover. Hopefully that one won't flat out lie.
