Nader's run for president is a productive way of drawing attention to and organizing support for his causes. Now a good record of pre-election polls has been gathered, which can be used to demonstrate national support for his arguements. The right thing to do at this point is to withdraw from the presidential race. He knows that he has no chance of winning, and that's okay since winning was not his objective. His refusal to leave the race will skew election results. I approve of many of Nader's objectives, especially when it comes to the environment, but his continued involvement could split liberal votes and result in a false positive for Bush. In that case, Nader will make an enemy of this potential supporter, and I would then use my skills and contacts as an activist to make others aware of Nader's callous self-interest.
