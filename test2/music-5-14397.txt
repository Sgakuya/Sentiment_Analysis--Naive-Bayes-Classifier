Both of these soundtracks are great. The first (original) is great to listen to if you're upset about something. The instruments convey emotions in a way that words cannot. The second soundtrack is great because you get to hear the music from the very beginning of the movie and other parts that were not included on the first, but that are beautiful peices. James Horner is my favorite modern composer and I am never dissapointed by his works.
