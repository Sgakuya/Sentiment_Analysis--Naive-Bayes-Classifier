 AL Camera Hog Sharpton has done nothing for NYC. Lets look at the future presidental candaitate's record. 1. Tawana Brawley nuff said. 2. In 1995, seven people were killed at Freddy's Fashion Mart on 125th Street...Sharpton and his National Action Network turned a dispute between a Jewish tenant who rented the space for his store (Freddy's) from a black church into a racial riot. They shoted racial slurs like Jew Bastards. or Blood sucking Jews. These proesters also threaten to burn the Jew store down. One of them did. A man with a long criminal record, Abubunde Mulocko shot three whites and a Pakistani in cold blood (he had mistaken the light-skinned Pakistani for a Jew) and then set the fire that killed five Hispanics, one Guyanese and one black, the security guard who the protesters had taunted as a cracker lover. He was one of Al Sharpton's followers. 3. AL Sharpton threatens a NY Post reporter, Rod Dreher. Rod wrote that Aaliyah's death was a tragedy, but nobody knew who she was. The so-called presidential candidate called Rod a racist and said We will bring down anybody who tells us how to mourn our own. Does a reverend talk like that? I would expert a Mafia boss to say those things. 4. He uses the police brutality issue to further his own career. 5. Sentenced to 90 days in jail for violating federal ground in Puerto Rico. Suddenly, he announced that he wants to become president. It show that he is doing it for the media attention not to help the poor citizens in Puerto Rico. 6. The recent mayor's election. Al would launch a hate campaign against any politician who refused to kiss his ass. He has the nerve to call Mark Green a racists. If everyone got along, Al Sharpton would be out of a job. BTW, I am a Democrat.
