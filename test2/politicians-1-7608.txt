Lincoln was an early communist and a tyrant. He started the war between the states on a personal whim. The war was not about slavery it was about states rights. The emancipation proclimation was merely a political move to gain support. The north was losing the war(The history books are wrong kiddies)and northern moral was low. What better way to gain support than by freeing the SOUTHERN SLAVES! Read betwen the lines the emancipation proclimation only freed the slaves south of the mason dixon line! All in all he was one of the worst presidents with the exception of Clinton! Beside he bathed in tapioca pudding and thats just sick!
