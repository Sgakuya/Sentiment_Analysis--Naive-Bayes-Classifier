I am really concerned with the quality of the presidental candidates lately. It's either Bush who does nothing but kiss Israels ass, or you have Kerry in which is one of the most liberal candidates. Any normal human being can see that both Bush and Kerry are nothing but political pawns to their affiliate party. It seens to me all that Kerry does is attack Bush, retreat, and attack some more. All he wants is power, not justice.
