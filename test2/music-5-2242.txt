I really like Blues music and don't know much about it. I went to this local record shop and was talking to this old guy who owns the shop. He knows so much about all kinds of music. Anyways, I told him that I like Blues music and want to get some but I don't know what would be a good album to start with. He recommended this one. I really like it and have bought more Muddy Waters albums because of the introduction.
