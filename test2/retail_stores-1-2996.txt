I would have rated it a 0 if it were an option. Kay is a terrible company to work for or to shop from. I have received word that I owe them money from an account that was supposedly closed 7 years ago. This issue was brought to our attemtion over 12 years ago. This is the kind of commitment they have as a company towards there employees and/or customers. They have continued to drop the ball on this and have spent countless hours on following up on an issue that was closed 7 years ago. Please do not shop at their stores or find yourselves in a position in which you may or may not owe them anything!
