I have to admit that the first time I watched this video, I thought she was a 30-old woman with a desperate desire to behave like a teenager. I mean, the silly outfits, horrible dancemoves, raspy, sandpaper voice. When my friend told me she was infact 16 years old, my eyes popped out of their sockets. Not only is this song not good, but the video sets a new standard in crappiness.
