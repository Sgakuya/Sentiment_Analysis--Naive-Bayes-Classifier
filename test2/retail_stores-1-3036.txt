I am in complete agreement with everyone elses comments on this site. So far I have been lucky compared to the other problems I have heard of. But in an attempt to build out credit my husband and I financed my engagement ring there. Luckily we only have one more payment. We could have bought the same thing elsewhere for half the price. All their associates are clueless, their management changes like the weather. They are not reputable at all and have absolutely no idea of what customer service is. Why they are in business I will never know. My horror story is this: We purchased a Platinum ring and for it to be one of the strongest metals-we keep having to return it and have them redo it because it keeps bending. Before we make that last payment I am going to take it to another jeweler and see if they can evaluate it in any way. Please don't shop there and if you decide to.........BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!!
