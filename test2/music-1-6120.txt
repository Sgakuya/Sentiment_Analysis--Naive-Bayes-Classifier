I haven't bought a Metallica album since the Black album. This one was a Christmas gift from my brother. I forgive him. I heard the No Leaf Clover song on the radio when this CD first came out, but even though it was surprisingly decent, I think the rest of this is just plain bad. Laziness abounds here, and the track selection is pitiful. You'd think the band and/or the orchestra would be embarrassed to play some of these songs; they simply do not fit the format. Fuel ? Devil's Dance ? Memory Remains ?!? These songs are all poor examples of Metallica's music to begin with, and completely unfit to have an orchestra embellishing them. This band could have pulled this off before the Black record, when they still WROTE songs in an orchestrated manner. Anything written after Justice would not and does not fit with an orchestra. The older songs appearing here are executed in a very unconvincing manner as well. The band seems to have spent very little time incorporating the symphony into their songs, and it shows. It's possible that the muddy sound has something to do with it. Hetfield's voice sounds like a hick most of the time, and when he's not having the audience sing lyrics, he sounds bored singing them himself (this is noted very early on in the show, see Fuel ). I have a Deep Purple album called The Gemini Suite (live version) which completely blows this away. The band plays live with an orchestra on this one (all original music, by the way), and Gemini absolutely shows what potential this format has. Plus, for all you youngsters out there, it was recorded nearly 30 years ago. Believe it or not, your heroes Metallica are not the groundbreakers many people in this review section seem to think they are. Learn your history. A waste of money and time, and another clear indication that this once great band no longer wishes to put forth the appropriate effort into their work. Avoid.
