She is a disgrace to the women of the world. To approve of such adultrous actions of her husband and stand behind him 100% not just once but many, many times, and then knowingly, allow him to lie about it to all of the American people certainly shows how money, power glory are her priorities dictate her life. My heart goes out to Chelsey. How could anyone in the State of New York even consider voting for such a person?
