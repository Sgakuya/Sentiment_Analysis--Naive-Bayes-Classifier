Lol on a road trip back from Florida we kept seeing waffle house billboards and my son kept begging for waffles so when we all started feel hungry we decided the next waffle house we see, we will stop at. OMG it was the worst experience of my life .. well maybe I am going overboard but it was AWFUL. It was Virginia I think? and I guess it was mainly a trucker stop or something I dunno but the floor was gross when you walked on it, it crunched and the food was nasty.
