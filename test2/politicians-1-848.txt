Canada = France, North American branch. Canada is nothing more than America Jr. and they need to get with the program. You have a high GNP and a lot of economic power only because of your close proximity to the USA. Your country has zero influence on the rest of the world. I would suggest, Monsieur Chretien, that you respect your most important ally and understand that the US is your only defense from the rest of the world, and that it is US dollars that support your country economically as well.
