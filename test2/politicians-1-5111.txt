What a shame that any people believe in a man (whimp) who has so few credible things to say. It will be terribly embarrassing if Gore actually does become our president. A man who cannot admit loss and has to whine, moan and bully until he gets his way. What does it mean when Jesse Jackson says that a Bush victory would incite a massive civil rights rebellion ? Is this a threat? Are we going to have a repeat of the LA riots? This type of talk frightens me. We should not be bullied into making decisions. Joe Lieberman was chosen to help Al Gore's character, now would be an excellent opportunity for Lieberman to help save his. What a shame that Gore is so full of himself, that he won't back off for the country he says he's fighting for. I am truly frightened of what will happen after either outcome.
