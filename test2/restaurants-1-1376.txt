I have never eaten at Sonic. Why? because I don't have that kind of time! And I cannot believe their food is worth waiting for. 3 times I have tried; 3 times I have failed. You can'rt go inside, and they leave you hanging out there like Ma Bell does when you call with a complaint. I will never attempt that again!
