All i have to say is that Cash Money is the shiznit. I have not heard any other group rap so great since the NWA. Cash $ is most definetly the # 1 STunna's and Got that Fire! for real ya heard me! People need to realize not all music is meant to be serious , music is entertainment and CASH MONEY is exactly dueing that entertaining their audience wit what they like best and what their life is all about. Their is nuthn wrong wit a little head or alot of head at that, the bling bling, and the high rollin cars. Everybody knows if they were in Cash $'s shoes they would be lovin it just as much as they are and not playa hatin but be playin.
