Jesse Jackson has gone from being concerned with the welfare of people to being a terrorist, inciting people to riot. I have only contempt for his campaign to make blacks feel they are being abused by whites. He is a racist of the worst kind, for he spews his message of hate wherever he can be imported by the left wing radicals.
