Just another example of how inferior the Sony Playstation 2 is to Nintendo's masterful GameCube console, this game is just mindless and not enjoyable in the slightest. The premise of the game is offensive enough: steal cars, shoot hookers and other law-breaking, morally-offensive acts. In addition, the graphics are pathetic and blown away by any of the Mario or Sonic titles. The sound is lame, and the plot is just stupid. The game, simply, is not creative or upbeat in the slightest. I love Nintendo's quote, Mario will never start shooting hookers! Go, Nintendo!
