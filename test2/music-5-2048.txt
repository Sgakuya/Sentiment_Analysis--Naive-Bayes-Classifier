Bands such as Pearl Jam and the Stone Temple Pilots are helping to further progress rock, which is what SHOULD be done, instead of leaving it all up to Britney Spears and all of the tons of boy bands that are out there already. I hope they continue to grow as artists and also continue to kick ass!!!!
