Any Elvis music new or old should be praised, not many are still played on the radio for this long unless they are legends, but those dead legends just don't have new releases like this man. He is and always will be #1, the King. Alicat, I thought your comment was very well put, most low ratings on him burn me up, but yours was very nicely said. I think that even if someone doesn't like the music, they should respect the man for what he's done. As for me, I'll take him with me to the grave.
