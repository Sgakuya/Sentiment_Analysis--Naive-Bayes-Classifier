I spent over $2,000 personally designing a custom wedding ring for my husband through Kay Jewelers. Since then, the ring has been sent in for repairs 5 times.. each time it took the company 4-6 weeks to return the ring to me. IN the year and a half that my husband and I have been married, his ring has been in repair for over 1/3 of the time. The last time I brought it in, I was told that they could repair it again but it would continue to need re-enameling every 3-6 months. Of course that wasn't told to me when I was writing the $2,000 check!!! Even their customer service told me that all they can offer is to take the enamel off completely.. So their solution was to make my husbands ring look shoddy instead of repairing it. I had spent almost $10,000 at this jeweler before this incident but will never spend another penny there... beware!!!!
