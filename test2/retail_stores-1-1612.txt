I had a very bad experience buying 4 Yokohama tires from Sears. They did not stand behind the manufactures warranty, even though the tires were under half-way through the warranty period. The sales personal were very rude and unprofessional, and quick to blame the customer for the poor performance of the tires. I would not recommend this brand of tire, nor would I recommend to buy any brand of tires from Sears!
