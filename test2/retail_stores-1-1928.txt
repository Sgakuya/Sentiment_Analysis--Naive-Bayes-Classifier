MY husband brought in prescription for percodet for severe back pain. He picked up the pills (promised for 6 p.m. and he waited til 6:20 p.m. before theywere ready)and when he got home he noticed they were oxycontin. He called and was told they had the right to do change pills and sited the medicare laws of Florida whereby the generic pills must be given to Medicare enrollees. My husband is not on medicare. What right did they have to do that? When he picked up the pills, no mention was even made that they and changed the pills. He has diabetes and heart disease and wanted what the doctor prescribed..even if it cost 5 times more (it did. We were rudely handled, were told "they know better," and basically when I went to pick the correct pills up, I was treated terribly also. We will be going to CVS from now on.
