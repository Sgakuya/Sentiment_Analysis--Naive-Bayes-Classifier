My favorites are Sin Wagon , Ready to Run , and Let Him Fly . I love the fiddle on Sin Wagon and Cowboy Take Me Away . And Goodbye Earl is just funny but the part where Earl puts Wanda in intensive care still makes me cry. I listen to this album in my car and rather than air guitar, I do air fiddle. I am sure passersby think I have a strange nervous twitch in my arm.
