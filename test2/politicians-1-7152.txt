Jesse Jackson only worries about Jesse Jackson. He wants to stir up trouble where there isnt any just to keep in the limelight. Way back in the 60s we needed quota's to get minorities (including women of any color) into certain jobs. Here it is 30 years later and EVERYONE has had a chance to make something with their lives. There are many black people that are doing FAR better off than I am!! Quit preaching that the White Man is holding you back...no one holds anyone back except themselves!!The black people that George W picked weren't just token blacks to keep people happy they are educated, important people who didnt let your 'keep the man down' attitude affect them. You need to quit trying to stir up trouble and encourage the youth of America (of ANY color) to get educated and make something of themselves because they CAN if they want to ....but not if they keep listening to you!!
