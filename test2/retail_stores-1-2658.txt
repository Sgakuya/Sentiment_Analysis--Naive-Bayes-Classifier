My wife was a faithful Kroger employee for 7 1/2 years until she was dismissed for buying something that was marked down. The store manager and another worker had marked it down and even told my wife that it was on sale. That was in October and in Febuary she was let go. The employee who marked it down wrote a letter stating that, but, she didnt date it so they threw it out. My wife's supervisor kept asking the store manager when my wife was coming back to work and they told her shortly, but they lied. The supervisor was kept in the dark. She wrote a reference letter for my wife. It is still pending albitration.Some union. This happened in NC and I have heard this is not the only store. Has anyone heard of any more? All of this to cover up for the store manager!
