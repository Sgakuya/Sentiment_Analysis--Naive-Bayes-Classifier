McScrannies...blahhh. How can anyone enjoy this chemical engineered ****. Our hamburgers are made with 100% pure beef! Ture they are the meat is 100% but mixed with soya products. So your burger is composed of about 80%soy but it does have 100% beef in it. I cringe every time my kids vote for McSlop when we ask where the want to go to eat. I stopped eating at Mc's years ago...give me Harvey's anytime. Unfortunately for many Americans they can not enjoy this 100% Canadian company. One taste and you will never go back to Mc D's.I say to hell with the clown...go for a real meal somewhere else.
