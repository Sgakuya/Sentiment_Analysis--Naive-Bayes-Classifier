John Ashcroft is a bigot, a liar, and a freedom-taker. He has already launched himself on a campaign to take away a suffering persons' right to die, perhaps for lack of anything better to do. He is intolerant of all those who are not as alike as slices of white bread in the same loaf as him. As Slim Jim says, he has systematically tried to kill the Bill of Rights time and time and time again. Sorry, Johnny, you have yet to gain one speck of approval from me until you start acting your age and get a little more tolerant. Lyric of the Day (read this one VERY carefully): Somewhere there I lost my way, everyone walks the same, expecting me to step the narrow path they lay, they claim to walk unafraid, I'll be clumsy instead...take care, everyone!
