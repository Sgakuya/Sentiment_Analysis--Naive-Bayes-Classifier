These S.O.B went back and charged me for a dent that was on the car that I rented. However, it was there at the time of rental. Not to mention, it was the second car I got from them that day, because the first one hadn't had an oil change in 10,000 miles and the engine locked down. The second car (dented) only had 3/4 of a tank. Then I drop the keys in the drop box, and they bill me for an extra day after I correctly note the odometer reading and fuel level. Avis - They try harder? Yeah, to rip you in the (*) harder!!!
