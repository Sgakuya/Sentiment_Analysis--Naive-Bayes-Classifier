Five stars for the movie or either Broadway cast version (new or old). Just great songs with great actors and singers doing them. The movie soundtrack is the best of all three, but they are all great. Hopelessly Devoted is a standout. Greased Lightning and Summer Loving are great highlights as well. Just great!
