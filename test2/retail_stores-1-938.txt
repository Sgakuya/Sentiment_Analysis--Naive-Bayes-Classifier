Why anyone would pay money for clothes that look like they've just been taking out of a trash compactor is beyond me. If you want to look like a trashy frat boy or a prostitute, I recommend shopping here. Otherwise, consider a store which does not promote racist tag lines on their clothes and does not sell clothing that is degrading to women
