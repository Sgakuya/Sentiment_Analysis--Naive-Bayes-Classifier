Sigh. What can I say about George W. Bush. I just have some problems with the man. Right from the moment he was, uh, elected? I don't feel like the election was handled in, how should I say this, the most ethical way possible. If you're not up on the election scandal, or at least the parts that did not get mass media coverage, please check out www.gregpalast.com As for what's he has done since in office I have not been too pleased. He reduced air quality standards like he promised not to do, he pushed to begin drilling for oil in the Alaskan reserves and he used 9/11 as a way to pass the PATROIT act with his right wing lunatic appointee John Ashcroft. So far he has not done anything to make me smile, besides talk out loud, which I always find incredibly amusing. Allow me to end on an appropriate quote... I'm sure there'll be moments when we don't agree 100% of the time. Yes, Mr. Bush. Yes indeed.
