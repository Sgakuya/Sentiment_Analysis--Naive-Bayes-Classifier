They are the biggest rip off in the business. After our move, we had nothing but problems with them. First of all, they broke our TV, Computer, scratched our oak desk and stained our chair. Then they said that even though we purchased the "full replacement value coverage", our computer was not covered. Even though the wording clearly states that "any article that is damaged or broken will be replaced, fixed, or given a cash replacement value." Not to mention that the claims person was the rudest person that I have ever dealt with. This is the worst customer service I have ever received in my life. I paid $5000 to them and all I got was a broken TV and computer and insults from the claims department. You would be better off moving your stuff yourself than going with United. Consider yourself warned. Note: I only gave them 1 star because it was not an option to give them 0 stars. They are that bad and that rude.
