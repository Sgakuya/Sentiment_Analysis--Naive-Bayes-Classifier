Horrendous. This has got to be the lowest form of fast food. Roadkill on a bun with some cheese wiz slapped on it..GAG..Arby's is SO nasty..The smell of the Roast Beef isn't even appealing..if I was making something at home and it had that smell, I would immediately throw it away thinking it was rancid. The BBQ is too sweet and does nothing to disquise the nasty taste, smell and texture of the mystery meat. DON'T GO TO ARBY'S...unless you want to test your gag reflex.
