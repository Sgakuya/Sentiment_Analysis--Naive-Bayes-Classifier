Oh my, this album is great! I'd say it's his second best album behind Highway 61 Revisited. The entire album is quality music. This was my introduction to Dylan several years ago and I've realized the political and social influence he had in the '60s. Subterranean Homesick Blues is a magnificent song and it makes it better once you memorize the words.
