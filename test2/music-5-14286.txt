This soundtrack gives me mixed feelings of a time when I was growing up, in the 60's and 70's. Takes me back to my happy, carefree childhood, growing up in the hills of Kentucky. On the other hand, it brings back memories of a time whem my beloved country and people nearly tore themselves apart. It was quite a time to be alive!
