My sister and I had gone to the Kay Jewelers in Danvers, MA to purchase a mother's ring for my mother (she was turning 60). We were quoted a price of approximately $500 - $700 for a white gold ring with 6 genuine stones. We needed the ring by September 17, 2004 and ordered the ring two weeks prior. After several phone calls we finally found out that the ring would be ready on the 17th, beu for security reasons they couldn't give us a time. Well when you plan on giving a ring to your mother for her 60th birthday party it would be nice if you knew when you could pick it up. I mean, what if we didn't like it or a stone was wrong! Anyway, remember the price quote of $500-$700. Well, $1800 dollars later we have a mother's ring that is definitely not worth that price. A ring out of a gumball machine would have been nicer. Needless to say, we indicated to my mom that the ring is not what we ordered and we asked her if we could replace it. We are going to put a stop payment on our check and go to a reputable jeweler that does not give you the runaround and appreciates the fact that without the customer Kay Jewelers would not exist.
