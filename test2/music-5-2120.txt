I was a fan of the progressive sound of Dream Theater in the 80's (when music truly rocked). However, I felt the band lost it around 1990 or so and lost their sound. However, I couldn't have been more wrong. This CD is killer. It is good to hear a band go back to its roots and actually produce something that old school fans would enjoy. A breath of fresh air.
