Jimi's best effort while with the original experience lineup. Simply amazing considering it was recorded using only four tracks. The range from the blues inspired 'Voodoo Chile' (slight return) to the compelling catchiness of 'Rainy Day...Dream Away' highights his guitar skill and songwriting ability. Take your Rennon and use him as a suppository. Hendrix is better.
