As for the tourism argument I doubt that most of the people travelling to the UK are going there just to see these assholes. You wouldn't find them anyway. People come to look at the historical items. That doesn't mean that the past and present should be confused. The UK is a relatively benign area of the world because of its history ( from which people HAVE learned some lessons ) and the character of its people. The monarchy is just a fly buzzing around a horse's head. It's time to get out the bug spray!
