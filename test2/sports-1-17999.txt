Being an Arizona native, in my opinion the first mistake made was the fact that they retained the name of old without giving the new AZ team an identity for itself. Who wants a washed up team nobody else wants? This whole AZ franchise is F.U.B.A.R! Almost every game I have seen in Tempe has more fans rooting for the opposing team than the sucky cardinals. Pure idiocy.
