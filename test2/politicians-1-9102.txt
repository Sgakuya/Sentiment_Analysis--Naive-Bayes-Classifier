The only thing that will come mind a 100 years from now will be Lewinsky, blue dress, and plenty of jokes. This man has more gall then brains. A library to remember him by, what a joke. He should slink back under the rock he crawled out from. And God save the U.S.A. from Hillary. New York deserves what it gets. Clinton is a liar, cheat, womanizer, and does,t have the good sense to know he is being laughed at. Sort of like the King's new clothes. Well I could go on and on, but I won't. Please Bill slink away. Don
