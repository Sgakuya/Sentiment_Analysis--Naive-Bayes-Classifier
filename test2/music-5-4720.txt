I've never seen a better live show. Period. The Ladies' great music is made even better by good-natured humor, enthusiastic audiences, and the sheer energy of the band members on stage. If you're looking to have your skull broken in a mosh pit, go somewhere else. If you want a great fun time, go to a BNL concert.
