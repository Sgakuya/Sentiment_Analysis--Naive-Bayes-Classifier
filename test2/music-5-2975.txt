The most influential, experimental, and trend setting peice of music ever. The wide variety of material was proof that the Beatles could do anything, and be the best at it. It had so much depth, with revolution 9 (play it backwards!!) it is an unbeliveable experience. These 30 songs might have been the most important on how music has turned in its wake. Do yourself a favor and hear this album!!!!!
