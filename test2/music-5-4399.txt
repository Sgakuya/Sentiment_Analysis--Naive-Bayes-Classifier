I think that people overlook Ted's music because his political views often get in the way. I don't normally agree with what he says, but this guy is a talented musician. I bought Full Bruntal Nugity and all of these familiar tracks sound awesome. Ted is an average singer at best, but his guitar work and his backing band sound awesome on this one. Definitely a quality buy for fans of classic hard rock and fans that wish rock would get back to quality guitar.
