I cannot understand the American people. The first time Bush was elected it was a mess, accidental we could say. Now we know he's an incompitent boob and he's still elected. The man is corrupt and evil. He is out for special interests-chiefly his own interests and has lied about everything from his service record to who knows what else. He's perminted the civil rights of people, some U.S. citizens to be trampled on in the name of protecting our country. If it were YOUR husband, brother, son, YOU, being held without a lawyer, without your family knowing where you were, without charges being brought against you-some people for more than a year or two-I think you'd look at it differently. Bush, I'm not sure but I guess we should pray for his health-if not him then Cheney-now that's scary.
