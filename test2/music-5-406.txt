A rock-techno-pop masterpiece! Garbage fuses styles with astonishing ease, mixing and mashes music influences from the last thirty years and giving it their own dark technological sheen. Brilliantly produced, with dense sonic layers, this album has immediate appeal, but is interesting and intriguing enough to last through years and years of repeated listenings. A true gem.
