I have had terrible experiences with Enterprise, who rents cars through all the local car dealers when you are having body work done. They always give you a car with a little tiny dent that you probably won't notice, and then try to browbeat you into paying several hundred dollars to fix it when you bring the car back. I managed to cut the amount in half by sheer stubbornness and then gave up and paid it -- but I would rather walk than do business with them again!
