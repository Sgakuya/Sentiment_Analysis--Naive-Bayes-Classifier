I used to love hardee's. I used to go all the time to get the old Monster Roast Beef. And then they went and changed the menu, and didn't have that sandwich. Well, I just went today to get me a roast beef sandwich, because I love hardee's roast beef, and I found out that they no longer serve the roast beef. Now, that just makes me mad. When they stopped making the monster roast beef, it was no big deal cause I could add the cheese and bacon. Now, I can't even do that. So, instead, I went and got a double cheeseburger from mcdonalds for only a buck. I guess thats where I will be eating when I do eat out.
