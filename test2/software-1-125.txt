I had a motherboard failure which accesesed my zip backup (disk left in drive):( and caused an unreadable disk. When I paid $100 dollars to retrieve my backup files all was fine until I tried to open the Quicken backup file with the newly installed program. Not only wouldn't it open the backup but wrote to it corrupting the file on purpose. Quicken only wanted $700 to fix the file. I went on line and there are thousands of these horror stories. BEWARE
