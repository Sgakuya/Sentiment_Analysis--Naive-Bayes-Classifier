Gray Out Davis is THE WORST governor in the history of the US. He is about to be only the 2nd Governor to be recalled in history. Even in a socialist leftist nutjob state like California, you can't tax and spend the people in to oblivion without them rebelling. This just proves that tax and spend liberalism/socialism DOES NOT work folks. When will people wake up to this? When will the Republicans wake up and use this against the Socialistcrats nationally? There is irrefutable proof of what tax and spend policies do to an economy. Look at California now!!!
