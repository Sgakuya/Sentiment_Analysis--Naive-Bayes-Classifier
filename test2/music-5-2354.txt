This Dove Award winning album should be rated much higher. The lyrics are somewhat didactic, rather than just emotional as some Christian songs are, yet not bothersome, and cover a range of topics and for me that makes the album more interesting. It's got mostly a southern rock sound, some harder songs, some slow. Even nonbelievers I know like this album. It should be rated higher on this list, for reasons of lyrics, music, and production.
