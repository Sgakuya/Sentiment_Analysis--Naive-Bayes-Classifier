Gray Davis -- Batteries not included! Gray Davis -- Think of our state like camping! Gray Davis -- what you see is what you won't get! All of the above apply, and thrown into the mix is a man whose astrological sign is, For Sale. Democrats like to say, Follow the money. Well, if we do that in this state we need look no further than Gray Davis' re-election campaign chest -- $45 million and growing. Davis should replace the California motto of Eureka with Quid Pro Quo (i.e. for you Democrats, your government favors are on the way once your check clears). How anyone can support this Clintonian creature writ small is beyond me. Wake up Californians and vote for Simon before it's too late!
