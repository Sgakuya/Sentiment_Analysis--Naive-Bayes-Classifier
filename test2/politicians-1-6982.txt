Pick all the qualities you would not like to see in your leaders - racist, philanderer, liar, powermonger, attention-seeker, and the lsit could go on. Jesse, you're all of those things, and more so than most people i don't like. You have not even helped your own people - rather by turning politicinas and philanthropists alike against the causes you support, you have been more of a detriment to your own people than you have been an aid.
