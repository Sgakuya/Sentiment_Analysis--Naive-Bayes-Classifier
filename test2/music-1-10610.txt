First of all, I've never heard Let Go and I am not anxious to hear it either! Ever heard of Yanni from Greece? He can't even read sheet music nor write it, but he plays by ear! Probably because he got a high IQ! He's a New Age musician. But this lame-o can't even write good lyrics. Her IQ must be .5 or something, the way she pisses, moans and rats on people, and she can't even play a guitar! I don't know why anyone would waste their time listening to this chick! Heck, I can even play better than her-on the piano-BY EAR! It's not fair people like Avril has all that money! What a snob...
