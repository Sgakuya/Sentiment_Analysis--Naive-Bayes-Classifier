THE BEATLES, oficial name of the White ALbum, is one of the top five albums of all time. Not only for the serious Beatles fan, it has music that all rockers can enjoy. From the sublime to serious rock and roll, the White Album personifies what rock was in the 1960's. A classic album from the epitome of classic rock. If it were possible to rate it higher than *****, it surely would be.
