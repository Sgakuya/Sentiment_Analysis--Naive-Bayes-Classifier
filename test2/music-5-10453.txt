A voice that has changed my life! In addition his magical voice, he sets a wonderful example for young singers (two of my children) to study their craft and go after their dreams. I've played this CD every day since 12/26/01 and I'm still not tired of it! I've met this young man and he is as charming, polite and generous as his voice leads you to believe. I was also at the taping of his PBS special; a weekend I will never forget
