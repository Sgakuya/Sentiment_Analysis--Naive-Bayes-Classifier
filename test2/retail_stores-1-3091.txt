Terrible service when they sent me the wrong stuff. I ordered a printer and a digital camera. The delivery guy arrived with one small box, so I knew there was a mistake. I opened the box to find the right camera along with a hard drive I didn't order. No printer. Consequently, I explained the error to the delivery guy and refused the order. I expected he'd bring it back to the store and someone would come back in a few days with the right stuff. I heard nothing from OfficeMax for several days, so I finally called them. I was told that because the order was refused, they cancelled the order and credited my account. So I told them I never cancelled the order and was still waiting for my order. The customer service manager said I'd have to reorder, and by the way, the price of one of the items had increased and she would not honor the price of my original order. Pi**-Poor service in my book. Hello Staples. :,
