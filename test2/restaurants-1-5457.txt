The food is greasy and not the highest quality. The local Waffle House is the all-night hangout for deadbeats, burn-outs, druggies, bar flies, psychos and truckers. In my experience, this is pretty much the standard around the US. Usually dirty and usually a smoker-friendly environment makes this a restuarant no meant for the squeemish or those with children. I am sure there are exceptions, but I have not witnessed any.
