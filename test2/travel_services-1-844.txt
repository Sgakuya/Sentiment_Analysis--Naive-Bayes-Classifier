MOVING STAFFERS ARE CROOKS! I hired 4 movers staffers to get help loading a 24 foot truck with boxes, and shelving. This was done on-line at their website which states that my credit card would be charged $110.00 in advance and that I would need to pay the moving crew in cash the balance of $396.00. MY credit card statement arrived with a charge of $170.00!! PLUS, the moving crew demanded that I pay them an additional $499.00 in cash!! These people are SCAM artists. I would NEVER use them again, under any circumstances. Don't be fooled by the Bull SHi-!
