I feel that the scare tactics of the current idiot in office, should be squashed. Dubya, is trying to get his insain tax bill passed at all costs even undermining the economic stability if needed. His doom and gloom politics are transparent as wax paper, only the sheep can't see through his plans. In two years he will, come back and say Oh the economy is in a upswing now and it's all thanks to me Jack ass. Man, I can't wait until he's gone. I will sink every hour, and dime against him next term, if not to help impeach his hi-jacked presidancy. If there were only some way I could smack that smirk off his face. I would die happy. I hope McCain runs again.
