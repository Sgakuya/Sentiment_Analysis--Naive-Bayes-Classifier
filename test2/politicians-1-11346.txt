For the love of whatever hillside angry protestant God you worship please, please, please, no more posts about what-you-will-do if Hillary runs in 2008. For the last time- this goofball carpetbagger is un-electable anywhere outside of N.Y. Only New York would have elected this trailer-park-wife carpetbagger. Let it go. She isn't worthy of your anger. She is no danger to you, your kids, your guns, your car, or your investments. She will win nothing, nothing, nothing, outside of N.Y. Feel better? Good. Go play with your kids. Go do some pushups. And for heaven's sake, go to another weblist.
