Gosh, where do we start? Expanded America's role in Vietnam, with hundreds of kids, many of whom draftees, dying every week. Fought the war half-assed, as LBJ failed to let the generals do their job as he micromanaged the war to an absurd degree. 40 years later, The Great Society programs and The War on Poverty are a joke. I travel to Philadelphia periodically, and LBJ's policies haven't done a damn thing for that city as well as many others. LBJ's big government solutions didn't work; the state and local governments should be utilized to solve social ills because they know the problems of their constituents better than bureaucrats in Washington who go yachting on the weekends. Not to mention that it's not constitutionally mandated. As for LBJ the person, I think he assumes the throne for worst person to become President. Intimidated people, serial philanderer, held meetings with staff while wiping his butt on the can, and fought a war with no clear vision for his entire term. The only postive thing about LBJ was signing the Civil Rights Act, but let's not forget it was the Republicans, not the Democrats, who made passage of that legislation possible.
