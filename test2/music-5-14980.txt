I love the CD even more than the movie! It's soooo cool! It has everything I've ever wanted in a CD. I could listen to it over and over and over again! I got the CD on April 22 and ever since I haven't listened to another CD! And today is May 14!I think it's my favorite CD of all time! Oh yeah, another thing about the movie, It's really, really funny. I think Melody is my favorite because she's so, well , interesting. If you buy the CD I know you won't be completely disappointed(but FYI(for you info.)it's not anything like Britney Spears or Mandy Moore)!!!
