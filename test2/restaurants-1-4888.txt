I ate at the Ruby Tuesdays at 4 Seasons Mall,G'boro,NC.Service was terrible!!We had to get our own silverware,no salad plates at the bar,no refills,and never checked back on us.Hostess was an air head.There were several other people complaning too. P.S. THE FOOD TASTED LIKE CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
