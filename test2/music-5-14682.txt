The Matrix soundtrack was magnificent! It had a good variety of music alternating between rock and techno. A lot of the techno is fairly commercial but pretty good if you are into it. There is a warning I should make: this is NOT the Matrix score, which in my opinion was far beyond compare to the soundtrack.
