Stole the election through shady election results in Illinois, was pushed up the political food chain by his zillionaire father and his politcal machine. He dealt meagerly with Soviet expansion at the peak of the cold war (Vietnam and Cuba). He was actually a weak politician in general. His attemped expansion of the welfare state through New Frontier legislation was mostly unsuccessful (unfortunately LBJ was a much better politician) save for a spike in the minimum wage. He lacked any sense of personal morality, was an ampethemine addict, and is only remembered positively cause he was unfortunately shot by some halfwit nutjob. A guy who can read a good speech doesn't a great president make.
