Mr. Ambivalent here. It sat on my shelf for years and now I can't keep it on the shelf. I've come to appreciate the underappreciated classics -- Let it Loose (Jagger roars and cries, the horns are hot), Sweet Black Angel , Torn and Frayed , etc.--in addition to the hits. If it's not one song on Exile I'm craving, it's another. At first listen it all sounded careless. Now it sounds intricate, confident and really quite impressive. And yea- brilliant comment, Springsteen80sbaby.
