 My Opinion only Theives, liars and felons. Of course this is only my opinion after experiencing the worst move of my life. Showed up late and without boxes. Left our home a shambles. Said it took one hour to drive less than 5 miles on a Sunday evening without traffic. I don't know what possessed me to do business with them but I have been exorcised. Please email me with any and all experiences as a CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT is contemplated.
