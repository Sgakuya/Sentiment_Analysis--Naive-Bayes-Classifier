Okay, I don't get it. What the hell are those flying ninja things? And what, pray tell, does pretty much anything in that video have to do with that song? Which, in itself, is pretty durn sucky. What, is he one step closer to sicking his flying ninja on you? I realize that in this day in age having music videos actually relate in some way to the song itself is asking a little much..but this is ridiculous.
