I recently bought a watch for my boyfriend at Christmas. When I bought the watch I was told by the sales girl that it would be no problem to bring it back and have the wristband sized even with it being the week before Christmas. I have taken it in two times now and both times have been told very rudely that no one can help me in the matter - even the store manager! I explained the situation that my boyfriend was leaving the next day to go to LA to spend the holidays with his family and they told me I had no options but to leave the watch with them for a week and they would try to send it out. When I bought the watch, I was told they could do it at the store as well as that it would not be a problem. I hate this store and their rude sales associates and would not recommend them to anyone! This experience was at King of Prussia Mall in Philadelphia. This store sucks!!!
