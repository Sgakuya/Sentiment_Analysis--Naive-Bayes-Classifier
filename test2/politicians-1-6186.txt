Well, at least she was consistent in her decisions and policies - although I believe that all of them were wrong. Waco seems to have been botched from the get-go, at all levels, and the Elian Gonzalez case was ann exercise in liberal hypocrisy. First, let the Florida court decide what to do with Elian, and then when it didn't suit the administration, Reno and the DOJ step in to make this a federal matter. Lets' not even talk about sending in a SWAT team to rescue Elian from his relatives (who had been cooperative with the authorities from the beginning). What a farce!
