MaggieMoo's has boldly stated that their ice cream is the best and make reference to various blue ribbon awards from the National Ice Cream Retailers Association. First let me say that the blue ribbon award is for attaining a particular quality and in fact other companies receive the blue ribbon as well. This means that their ice cream isn't the best, it just attains a particular quality level along with other companies. The funny thing is, MaggieMoo's knows this, they just choose to deceive the public and try to make it a substantial reason why one should become a franchisee of theirs. THE STRING OF BLUE RIBBONS HAS RUN IT'S COURSE however. In the most recent "competition" MaggieMoo's was only able to achieve red ribbon awards. This is more than likely a result of them trying to lower product costs by purchasing their ice cream mix from a different dairy. Perhaps the strategic plan to sell out to Cold Stone is getting under way...their new dairy is the same as Cold Stone's. Unfortunate.
