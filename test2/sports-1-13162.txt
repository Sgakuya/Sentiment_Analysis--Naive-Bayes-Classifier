UK is awful while Louisville excels in Football. How can this be? Kentucky is an SEC school with SEC money and should be able to field a team that would beat up on Louisville most years. The lack on enough in-state HS talent is a partially excuse, but when you play in the SEC you must step it up from head to toe to compete.
