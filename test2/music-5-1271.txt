I am very fond of the Cars' sound. Released in the late '70s as one of the many new-wave genre albums flooding the ariwaves at the time, this self-titled is very fun to listen to. There is a great sentiment that you feel whenever you hear Let the Good Times Roll, Just What I Needed, Drive, or Best Friend's Girl. The Cars aren't often recognized as one of the better bands of the late '70s and early '80s, which they most certainly are.
