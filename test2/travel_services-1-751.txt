I made a reservation at their LAX location. They never picked me up - I was at the right bus stop (I checked by calling them) and saw their bus go by 3 times and called them 3 times before giving up and boarding the Avis bus. I could have saved the 45 minutes of extra wait time just going straight to Avis.
