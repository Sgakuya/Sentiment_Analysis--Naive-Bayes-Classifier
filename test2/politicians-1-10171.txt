Do you guys belive that 3 Presidents were voted WORSE than him? So Nixon cheated in his reelection? Bush had to cheat the FIRST time. So Harding was in the pockets of the oil industry. Atleast he didn't start a war over it. So Hoover was President during the Great Depression. Bush gave us the largest economic recession in American History. And while Hoover may not have done enough to help the poor, atleast he didn't cut taxes for the rich. That's my Bush!
