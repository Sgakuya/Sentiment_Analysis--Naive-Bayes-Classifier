Governor Bredesen has not fulfilled his promise to fix TennCare in the state of Tennessee. As a Tennessean, I can say that I once liked my governor, but now I would never consider voting for him. Not only has he screwed up TennCare, but has also introduced and signed a bill allowing illegal aliens to attain driver's licenses! I believe that the key word in that last sentence is ILLEGAL! Our governor has failed us and I will be strongly supporting our candidate in 2006.
