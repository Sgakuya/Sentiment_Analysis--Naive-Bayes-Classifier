I used to be a Labour voter but now I pine for the halcyon days of Maggie. Who are these Americans who think he's so great? Try living in the UK for a while and see the almighty mess he and that bunch of 10th rate losers and chancers in his government have made. What was bad up till 1997 has got even worse. Maggie was a hard old bird but even she only went to war once in her 11 years in power. Blair's taken Britain to war 6 times in half the time and at huge cost which we can ill afford. If he's not conceiving half-arsed policies then he's reneging on others. So, you Americans who think he's so great for backing Dubya for atacking Iraq. Do you still think the same, even no WMDs have been found while the country's in a state of violent chaos, possibly heading towards civil war. Further to the above:- You folk who don't live in the UK don't understand what a smug, self satisifed, self-deluded incompetant little t*at he is. He won the 1997 election on socialist policies, except that he's reneged on all of these and is even more right wing than the Tories. Under him, privatisation of public services is proving a disaster with the health service and transport infrastructure approaching meltdown. His government's so called environment policy is a farcical joke. On the one hand they want people to cut back on car use by increasing fuel tax & yet they're pushing for major road building projects and a doubling of airport infrastructure, much of it being built on land with environmental protection. Even though his popularity rating has gone through the floor he's said he won't resign. So much for the joke that is western democracy.
