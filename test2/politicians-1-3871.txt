How can anyone take George W. Bush seriously as a political candidate? It was clear from the debates that he is not familiar with the issues. He does not have a handle on the nuances within the issues that are at the heart of this election. GWB is more a face on a political party wanting desperatly to win this election at ALL costs. Unfortunately, those costs are the American public.
