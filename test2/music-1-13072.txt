I don't know how it happened but in an age when film and T.V. is mostly getting better and better, music is just getting worse, and this is absolutely awful. I have never heard anything as banal, shallow, monotonous, tuneless, dull and humourless as Thong Song and for some reason it got really popular and I found myself hearing it EVERYWHERE. What happened to the 80's when songs were either soulful and meaningful, had beautiful well-crafted melodies, or a livelyness and sense of fun and humour?
