I don't understand why they say Britney Spears is such a role model for young girls. Take this video (and just about every other Britney Spears video) for example. Britney is so scantily-clad and looks so slutty that it is a wonder people have any respect for her at all. The lyrics (as well as the lyrics to some other Britney Spears songs) are raunchy and it makes me so angry that she doesn't have to have a Parental Advisory sticker on her CD's when her lyrics talk about sex more often than not. She has no singing talent whatsoever...but obviously she didn't become a star for her singing talent. She became a star because she is willing to do music videos like this...she is willing to dress slutty and show off all her skin and act all sexually suggestive. Now, I don't know who would consider her a role model. It is pretty sad that one of her other videos got pulled from the Disney channel because of it's content (Britney in a bikini on an island beach with some guy and them on the verge of having sex)...if I was a parent, I would never let my children watch any of her videos...it's practically pornography. If you don't believe me, watch one of her videos...if you can stomach it.
