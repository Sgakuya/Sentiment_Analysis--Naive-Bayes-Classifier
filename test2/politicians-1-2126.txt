I think that Gray Davis shouldn't have the High School Exit Exam at all!! Why, because many kids are slacking off in school as it is, and all of the schools will be over-crowded. If he was going to use this method, push it back to 2005!!! I also heard that he wants to extend the school year. What is with that!!! Most kids dipise school as it is!!! Why make them suffer more!! Why take away their vacation time just to stay in school to slack off!! I think Gay Davis has a bad approach to the entire education system!!!!!
