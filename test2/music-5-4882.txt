I'm so sick and tired of hearing songs about get your guns bam,bam,bam. and she's cheating on me, or kiss me here and there type of garbage!!! I hardly ever listen to country music just rap music. When I heard people talking about Billy Gilman (One Voice) I thought I'll try listening just once to the song. I loved it instantly. His music is just so refreshing. His song gives a good message. After hearing this song on CMT I immediately went to a record store and bought his CD One Voice and Classic Christmas. Go on Billy!!! I can't wait until your next CD!!! My favorite song is What's Forever For?
