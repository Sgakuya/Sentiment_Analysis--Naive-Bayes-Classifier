Ripoff warning!! Jensen's movers fill out an inventory before moving, with codes to indicate pre-existing scratches and damage to furniture. In my case, they marked every side of every piece of furniture (which is all like new) as being scratched, obviously to relieve them of any responsibility for any damage that they might cause. They also damaged several of my walls while moving. When I called to complain, the company representative was extremely rude and unresponsive.
