absoultly hate albertsons! at least the florida ones. can't find anything in there. no employee's to help. bad lighting, the set up is backwards (pet supplies, t-shrts and condoms when you first walk in). finally found the frozen sasuage near the fish in the middle of the store instead of the frozen food isles. i just hate feeling unwelcome, helpless and backwards
