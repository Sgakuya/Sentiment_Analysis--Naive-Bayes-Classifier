I left a $1,500 camera in the car by accident and turned it in. 10 minutes later I realized my mistake. I called and they could not find it. I spoke to lost and found, the manager and the customer relations directer via e-mail since. The people that touch that car all have to initial it. They have never interviewed them to find out what happened. The camera was in the car and it was stolen by an Alamo employee.
