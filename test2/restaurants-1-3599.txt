did any of the people that rate these places ever EAT at any of them?? Thank God that the Little Caesars in our town is closed down.. because I don't know how it stayed in business as long as it did. The pizza may be cheap, but the taste is like rubbery dough.. I had the pizza by the foot when it came out, and I'm telling you it had a roach baked into it.. Bad enough that it was nasty to begin with.. so I took it back and I filled out a card saying it was awful.. They sent me a blah blah letter and coupons for free pizza. I never used them.. come on, If I didn't want it when I paid for it, why would I want it for free?! Bad Bad Bad.. do a favor and get a totinos before you eat here. Don't subject yourself or even your enemies to this nasty stuff, blecch!
