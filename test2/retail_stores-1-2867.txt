My sisters boyfriend and I went looking aroud for engagemnet rings for her. He found one that he absolutely fell in love with. We did not know the size of her finger, but we got it anyways..Well 2 days after he got the ring and 4 days before she got over here to NC, he was put on the Hurricane Katrina Releif by the Marine Corps.Well when she got here I found away to find her ring size and took it in to get sized.I was suppose to pick it up on that following Friday, but I was on Ptad and didn't get the chance. Now these people in the jewelry store new me and new that my sister lived with me. so indicent can you get to ruin the best surprise of anyones life. They called my phone to let me know I needed to pick up the ring, but when they called my sister answered and they asked for me, she said that I wasn't here but she was my sister and asked if she could take a message and they hung up on her.. Good, I'm glad they did, but 10 minutes later they called again only this time asking for her boyfriend and she said he wasn't there, but she was the girlfreind, and told her to tell him to come pick up the engagement ring they had to get sized, how much more unprofessional can you be.That is the best surprise and feeling in the world and they ruined it for her, now she will never get to experience it.How can they do that she flat out told them who she was, but they still insisted on saying it. Wrong, and they had the odosity to tell me it wasn't their fault, how not, she told them exactly who she was.
