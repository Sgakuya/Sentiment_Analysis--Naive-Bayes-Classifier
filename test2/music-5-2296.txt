Life is Zoegirl's second cd overall following their self-titled debut, and this one is truly a step above the last one. 'Dismissed' is a song about letting others know they can't run your life. 'Forever 17' is a sad song dedicated to a girl; who died prematurely. 'Plain' is one of the best songs here, focusing on the fact that all girls are beautiful at least on the inside, as God made all girls unique and beautiful in their own ways. That's actually the major problem with the record; some guys may be turned off by all the songs talking almost exclusively to girls. If you just don't care and enjoy heartfelt songs, or if you can mentally switch the lyrics to apply to guys too, the album works just fine.
