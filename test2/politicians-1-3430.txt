In the beginning I respected him for his quick thinking regarding what to do next in regards to the 9-11 terror attacks. I lost faith in him when we invaded Iraq. I'm still confused on this whole issue, he invaded a country with no warning, no proof, and really no reason at the time. He captured Saddam even though Bin Laden was still hiding out free as ever, and they celebrated a victory. What victory? We captured a man that had no reason to suspect we were after him in the beginning. While we were doing that, thousands died and the people who died on 9-11 haven't gotten the justice that they deserve.
