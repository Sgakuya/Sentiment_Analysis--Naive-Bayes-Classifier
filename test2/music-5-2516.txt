wow. is this album underrated. this one is so mysterious and technically experimental, i would think more people would appreciate it. Most of the songs aren't originally theirs, but the sounds and improv styles sure are. Jimmy lays his sound down thick and Robert's vocals get under your skin and shiver through your veins. JPJ's basslines are so complex and Bonzo is amazing. Songs like You Shook Me, I Can't Quit You Babe and Dazed and Confused really show how perfectly the four of them worked together.
