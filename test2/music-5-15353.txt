My most honest oppinion about eiffel65 is, foreign group(s) are commonly disregaurded and underated. To be honest, the way there elements of sound and beats come together to form a radical tempo of techno, is trully remarkable and not to mention pretty d*mn good for where they come from...not to say that Europe is bad place, just unheard of. NEwayz that's what I think.
