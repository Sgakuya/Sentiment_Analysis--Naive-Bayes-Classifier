I hate Duke more than any college basketball team. Everyone kisses their ass, especially CBS and Dick Vitale. They didn't win anything from 1993-2000, and the way they were treated was as if they had won a championship every one of those seasons. Nothing better than when they get eliminated in the tournament.
