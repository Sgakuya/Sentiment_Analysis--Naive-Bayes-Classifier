I luv the album! It's got a mix of pop/rock/hip-hop so everyone can get a taste of it... So what if she's apparently 'no different' from Britney or Christina (according to pip_squeak in the next comment...which i totally object to)??! At least her music is actually different and genuinely written by herself!
