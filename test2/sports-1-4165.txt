Roy is a liar that does not keep his commitment to his school, players, and recruits. Then he has the guts to say that the ncaa should change thier rules so he can try and i say try to steal those recruits away stabbing his former school and players in the back. He is an ok coach that will NEVER win it all and i think he did ku a favor by leaving now we can get a coach that can win it ALL!! GOODBYE LIAR AND ENJOY YOUR LOSING SEASONS AT UNC. If ku does play you next year they will destroy you and as for the fans they would not pee down your throat to put a fire out in your belly.
