Those who refer to Pat Buchanan as a patriot have confused patriotism with jingoism. There's a big difference. And to refer to him as a Nazi sympathizer is hardly disingenuous, since Buchanan himself made the statement about Hitler being a great but misunderstood man. The similarities between Buchanan and Hitler are really scary when one considers that there are few policy differences between the two and the only cosmetic difference is a mustache.
