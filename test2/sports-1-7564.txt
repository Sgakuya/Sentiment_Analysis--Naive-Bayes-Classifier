Remember when the bottom seven or eight teams in the league were all in the Western Conference and the Jazz were fortunate to play those teams 4 to 6 times a year? That's great! Beat up the Nuggets in December. That will win you a championship. Actually, it doesn't and Karl, along with his buddy Stockton, were the two most overrated players of the 90's. People always said, Yeah, but the Bulls had Jordan . Funny, I never heard that come out of Pistons fan's mouths when Dumars co. used to shut MJ down and send the Bulls home. If you like basketball that just doesn't quite cut the mustard, the Mailman is for you. I perfer people who can win championships.
