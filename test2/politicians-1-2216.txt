The idiots of CT??? I've only lived here for a year, and I'm already in-tune about what a jerk Rowland really is. Nice to see he resigned!!! Did you know that back a couple years ago he was against having 2 people man the plow trucks because he thought it was a waste of money???? HELLO! Safety! Ehh, not important. Money in his pocket is MUCH more important. Look where it got him. It'd be nice to see him in a nice orange vest, rotting in prison!
