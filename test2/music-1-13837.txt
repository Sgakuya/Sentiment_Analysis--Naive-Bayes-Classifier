The album is deep and obviously written and performed by educated artists. However, it contradicts itself and makes numerous comments against the bible, and in essence God. That's just wrong man. To think you can become more powerful than God. If only these artists would swallow a little pride and acknowlege something greater than there arrogance,,then they would be able to make a true difference in society...Maybe their next album should be called , The reeducation of Dead Prez.
