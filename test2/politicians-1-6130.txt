Jaime's comments are also very interesting. I guess it's just that taking money from that particular drug company and a beer company seems hypocritical for such a righteous man. Every day that particular company enjoys patent protection is a day that generic-drug makers cannot offer consumers a cheaper alternative. Ashcroft Victory Committee has received only one other gift as large as theirs, a $50,000 donation from Anheuser-Busch. Anheuser-Busch giving major bucks to a teetotaler? Well, at least it shows that Ashcroft, who banned alcohol on moral grounds from the Missouri governor's mansion for eight years, is pretty flexible himself when selling his political soul. Abichara, when big government comes in and starts regulating and taxing industry, these companies are forced to cut back on this research and charge higher prices for their products, is that why so many people are getting their drugs from Canada, besides many non-US pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs too. I am a registered Republican, I like my taxes to be spent wisely, there is corporate welfare as well as individual welfare, we have to have some of both. My husband is a retired Army officer, if you want to talk about waste, I've seen plenty in the Military/State Department. I am grateful for his great pension, and he truly enjoyed his 30 + years in the military. I do not feel that government is the end-all solution to all of our problems; however, MY MAIN POINT, I do get annoyed when politicians act so moral/righteous.
