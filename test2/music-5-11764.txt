Hey i just wanna say i love GC. They're songs are very inspiring. They are very talented young men. And who the hell cares what kind of music group they are classified in? They could be country and still be amazing. Kids feel like they have to look and act all punk just because thats what people say GC is. Well you dont just be yourself!!! GC is a great band no matter what.
