Al is an old-time liberal democrat with the same old, failed ideas: fix education by throwing money at it. It hasn't worked in the last 10 years and it won't work in the next 10. But heaven forbid!. Don't try any new solutions! After all, the Republican congress forced welfare reform, and just because it's been a spectacular success, doesn't mean we should try fresh ideas, like vouchers, in the schools. Don't give those poor kids a chance to escape a failing school. They'll do it!
