Silent Cal was an idiot who sat idle and lame while the stage was set for the great Stock Market Crash. A real do-nothing, rubber stamp, lockstep Republican who looked the other way while the cutthroats, thieves and pirates in Corporate America manipulated the economy to their benefit and laughed all the way to the bank when the Little Guys got crushed in the Autumn of 1929. The only thing of merit this guy ever said was I do not wish to run. He probably came to this conclusion when he sensed the center couldn't hold anymore and the entire crapshoot was soon going to spiral down the toilet. Furthermore, he had one of the worst records of any U.S. President in the area of law and order as the 1920s proved to be one of the Golden Eras of Organized Crime. It was a great idea, in 1926, to name J. Edgar Hoover as Director of the FBI: makes perfect sense to have one crook keeping the other crooks in line.
