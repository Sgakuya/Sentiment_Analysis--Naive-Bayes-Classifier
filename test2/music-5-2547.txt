I don't know what some of you people are talking about. In My Life is one of the most exquisitely crafted pop songs ever--lyrically and musically. It justifies this album's inclusion on this list almost single-handedly. But with songs like Norwegian Wood, I'm Looking Through You, Nowhere Man, You Won't See Me, and reallly, on and on, how can it NOT be on a list of the greatest pop albums? Doubly interesting because it marks the Beatles first shift into deeper musical waters. Where do you people come from?
