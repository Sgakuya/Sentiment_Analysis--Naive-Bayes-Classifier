Will never shop at this store again. After purchasing a $250 purse and a $100 wallet I went to the men's department to return a shirt that I had purchased for my husband 2 months earlier. They refused to take the shirt back for an exchange or store credit because it had been over 30 days! They have a very, very strict return policy and the store manager couldn't have cared less that I had just spent $350. I marched right back to the clerk I had purchased the purse and wallet from only minutes earlier and returned it. No cared in the least.
