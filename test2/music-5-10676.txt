This is by far one of the most amazing works of musical talent ever! Mad Season by Matchbox Twenty is absolutely beautiful, with strong, passionate, and as always very universal lyrics, that anyone and everyone can find themselves identifying with. Mad Season truly shows that Rob Thomas and Co. have really poured their hearts into this sophomore effort.--Shawna
