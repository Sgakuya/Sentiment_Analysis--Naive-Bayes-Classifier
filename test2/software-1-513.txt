My experience with computers pre-dates even Microsoft. In the days before most of you were born we operated at 16Mhz. When the speed lapsed to 25 then 33 MHz we led the engineering world. Word is not and has never been the best word processor. It's Microsoft's marketing that has forced Word into our computer's. Wordperfect is far better and more powerful then Word. I use both and Quattro Pro is much better then Excel. But, kudo's to Microsoft for their business savy.
