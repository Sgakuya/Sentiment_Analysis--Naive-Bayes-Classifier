I went to Dillard's in Broomfield CO for the first time. I was suit shopping and knew nothing about suits. The gentleman working was wearing a suit from 1985. I finally had to ask him for help after being in the department 20 min. He than told me what size I was (which was wrong) and left me with no more information. I had never bought a suit before, and this was not helping. I finally went to Nordstrom where I was measured for the correct size and informed about what makes a good suit. Dillard's is a high priced Wal Mart with merchandise thrown around the store and sale people that know nothing about what there selling. I will never shop there again.
