Jesse Jackson is to sanity and reality like the San Diego Charges are to the Super Bowl. How ridiculous this blasphemous idiocy that spouts from his moronic mouth. Jesse Jackson refuses to relinquish the hatred and bigotry for the White Man, while pointing his contentious finger at everyone else and blaming White folks for all of his woes. Jesse Jackson is his own worst enemy. He has absolutely no desire to heal any racial divide, only to exacerbate it. It is the only thing that continues to give him something to talk about. How pitiful that this supposed Christian can be so jaded about the truth. The truth is this. President Elect Bush won the Presidency each and every time the votes were counted. Even when the counters themselves were manufacturing votes for Al Gore, still the Democrats were unable to find the votes to overturn the election. Mr. Jackson speaks of fairness and equality......please. Where was Jesse Jackson when the Broward County canvassing board was manufacturing votes for Al Gore? Where was Jesse Jackson on election night when the networks announced before the polls even closed in Florida that Gore had won the state? Mr. Jackson, please just go away. Your feeble attempt to cast a shadow on this election is only superceded by your complete ignorance of the facts. You create your own world Mr. Jackson, and anyone with any intelligence can see through your paper thin stories with ease. Just shut up and go home! Ronald Fulton Saint Petersburg, Florida
