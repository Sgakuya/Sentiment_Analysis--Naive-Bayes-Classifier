Frys has the best prices! They have the best selection! They make money by having the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. ONLY go there if you know exactly what you want and it's on sale. DO NOT GO THERE if the item is NOT ON SALE, or if you don't know exactly what you want. I recommend looking online (Amazon) then going to Frys to purchase the item. NEVER buy a whole computer from them (unless it is from Sony), NEVER get computer repaired there. ALWAYS return items on the weekday before noon, after than and on the weekends its a MAD HOUSE. NEVER buy anything that has a returned sticker on it, in fact, don't even by the product if ALL you can find is previously returned items. Some products simply DON'T WORK, but Frys will keep selling them untill the stock is out. THEY DON'T RETURN FAILED ITEMS, they just sell them for cheaper the next week. So long as people buy the stuff at half price, some don't bother with returning it. Oh, they've gotten alot better about their Mail in Rebates, but it used to be a huge problem that they woudn't give you enough time or info to get the rebate. And be sure you read the 1 per household = 1 per address. I can't wait for the class action suit agains Frys customer service - sign me up!
