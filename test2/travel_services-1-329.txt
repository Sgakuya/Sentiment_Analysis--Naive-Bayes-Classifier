I find the customer service terrible. Why do I always get the impression that they could care less if I fly with them our not? Even the most simple request like a seat change is such an ordeal. Several times when I hinted that I was shopping around and might change my airline if they couldn't assist me with a genuine concern, I could almost sense the shoulders shrugging on the other end of the phone. I fly coach. I've noticed their ads never are directed at me, just the few lucky ones that can afford upper class. They should be watching and learning from the competition.
