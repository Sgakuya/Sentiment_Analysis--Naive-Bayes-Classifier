Chavez never fails to make me laugh, whether it's his Dan Quaylesque spelling, mismanagement of the economy or his constant anti-American diatribes! Although I agree with America's policy of overthrowing him since he's a complete idiot I admire his courage and toughness in standing up to Uncle Sam. God bless Hugo!
