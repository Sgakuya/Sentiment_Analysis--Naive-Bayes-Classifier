PLEASE, he is good but can't touch Dean Smith or Roy Williams. He makes courney commercials, not to be a show of but to get more bball players to come to Duke. His credit card commercial was a joke, he talked about how good and talented he was, HE was suppose to talk about money and spending it. He is so desperate he results to that! PLEASE! Oh ya, and when he hurt his back, it just ended up when his team was the worst in the ACC, he didn't want to hurt his precious record, what a pretender he is. And is just me, or does he look like a rat, he acts like one at least.
