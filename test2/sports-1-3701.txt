Joe Morgan is the most overrated second baseman of all time. His lifetime average of .271 is pathetic, and he amassed stats by staying in the game way beyond his prime. Morgan fans say he hit for power--he hit 271 homers during a 22-year career, or roughly 12 a year. Looking at the defensive side of it, he was even more pathetic. He made 27 errors in one year--those are dead ball era numbers. Not to mention the balls he couldn't reach with his limited range, especially later in his career. The best second baseman ever was Rogers Hornsby, and there can be no argument with that.
