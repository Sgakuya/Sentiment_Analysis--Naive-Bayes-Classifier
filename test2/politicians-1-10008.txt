I believe we should only go to war when either we are attacked or an ally is attacked. Anyone hear of WWII? That was probably the last righteous war we have fought (possible exception - Gulf War I). I realize wars are all political at some level but if the ONLY reasons are politics and profiteering, then I'm going to have a hard time supporting it. Anyone here read the Downing Street Memos (downingstreetmemo.com or afterdowningstreet.org)? The intelligence from our CIA, FBI and agencies from other countries was not simply erroneous, it was FIXED to support our foreign policy. What about that are you unwilling to make yourselves understand? Thank God I haven't lost anyone I know in Iraq yet but my oldest son turns 18 while GW is still in office and with recruiters consistently missing their quotas, I fear that my son will end up being drafted to fight a war that neither he nor I believe should have been taken up to begin with. I feel great sympathy for the families who have lost sons and daughters because losing a child is the most unnatural thing a parent can experience and should never be allowed to happen unless it is absolutely necessary. I don't believe it is wrong to stand against this war because it was started for reasons other than those given to us. I can understand the dilemma of those parents/relatives/friends who have loved ones in Iraq because they want to seem supportive of our troops by saying stay the course and Cindy Sheehan doesn't speak for us but what they should really be doing is fighting to bring them back home. Be honest with yourselves - what good will it do to be proud of a fallen soldier, telling everyone that he fought bravely for freedom, when having them home in one piece would be so much better? Don't you love your sons and daughters the way we love ours?
