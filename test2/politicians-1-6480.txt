The first time I heard Maxine Waters open her mouth was on Nightline in the wake of the 1992 L.A. riots. The shrill rhetoric that came out of her mouth back then convinced me that she was just another black hack, barely worth even insulting, much less taking seriously. Frankly, black apologists like her mystify me. She doesn't strike me as a stupid person, but on some metaphysical level she just doesn't get it. Her whole career has been devoted to angrily denouncing purportedly racist whites for perceiving black people as crude racial stereotypes. But when has Maxine Waters ever behaved like anything OTHER than a crude racial stereotype? She is the classic loud-mouthed militant: really experienced at demanding respect from society, but not very experienced at earning respect.
