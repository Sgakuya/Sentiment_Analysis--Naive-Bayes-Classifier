Thank goodness we don't have kings, or this woman might be in office forever! Unfair jokes about her masculine appearnce aside, this AG has been among the most partisan to ever hold that position. Her presence is an honest danger to representative government, when those who abuse the powers granted them by virtue of their position can so easily abuse them with impunity, because the chief law enforcement officer refuses to do her duty. So long, Janet..!
