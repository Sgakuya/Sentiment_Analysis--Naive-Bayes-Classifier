Absolutely the worst president in my 40-year lifetime (even worse than Nixon), if not ever. This man claims he is Christian and compassionate yet his policy is one of arrogant war mongering, hubris, and total unconcern for those struggling and oppressed. His tax cuts have destroyed the economy and benefited the wealthy. Even rich people like Warren Buffet have questioned his financial policy and said it is reckless. I know I'm in the minority, but I'm an evangelical Christian who is totally appalled by this man's arrogant, pompous, self-righteous leadership. In the 2004 Presidential debates he would not admit error--this is not the character of a righteous man. But pride seems to be a popular American theme. I live near Canada where I get an outside perspective, and every Canadian I've talked to sees him in the same light. I would give Bush a zero if I could. My children and grandchildren will be paying for this man's mistakes long after he's gone.
