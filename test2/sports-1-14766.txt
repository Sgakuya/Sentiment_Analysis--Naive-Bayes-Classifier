A scrub... Emmitt Smith is a discrace to the game. He ran through holes ten miles wide created by his all-star O-line. I take that back, he stummbeled through the holes like a flippin' chicken with its head cut off. The pu$$y-a$$ bi-o-tch would always run OB so he wouldn't get hit. He has such a big ego he can't see that he sucks pecho. Why didn't you throw in the towel earlier you sick-a$$ mofo! All the other great backs went out while they were the best: Walter Payton, Barry Sanders, Jim Brown. But you, you son of a bi-o-tch, you had to keep on going for 15 flippin' seasons just so you could have your name in the record books. Well geuss what? Despite that fact, everyone knows you are the most overrated sack of $hit that has ever walked the face of the planet!
