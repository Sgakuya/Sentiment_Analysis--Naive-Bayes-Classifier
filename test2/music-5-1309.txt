One of the greatest theme albums of all time, Ziggy Stardust, moves the listener with beautiful musical arrangement coupled with lyrics that tell a story with a grace and strength that make you feel that you're a part of it. This album also features one of the best first songs, with 5 Years, and last songs with Rock n Roll Suicide that act as perfect bookends to this perfect album.
