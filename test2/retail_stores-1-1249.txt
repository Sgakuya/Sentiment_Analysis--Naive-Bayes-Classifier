This corporation is ahead of gas and car companies in revenue AND profit. Yet, it totally f**ks its employees and is gradually sinking the poorer people to new lows. The people who work there can only afford to shop there and its becoming a vicious circle. Wally World is THE single contributor to dividing classes of people. Its pathetic and its flat out WRONG. Greed is at the top of the deadly sins folks.
