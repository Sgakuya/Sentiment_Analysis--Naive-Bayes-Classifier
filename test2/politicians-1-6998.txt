Dear Jesse: Thank you for keeping the suppression of your people alive. Thank you for adding to the rosters of hate groups. Please fade away quickly before the IRS finally gathers the courage to do its job. You are no longer of any value despite your legions of supporters. Remember the phrase 'What have you done for me lately' Well that not only applies to old white guys getting replaced in business. It applies to ALL of us. The best part of all of this is that the Democrats will still allow Jesse a say in some matters, after all since when does integrity matter.
