The most spiritually based main stream rock album of all time. This disc absolutely makes you think about life and what is truly important. If you can't identify with this CD and its message, I recommend you examine yourself a little bit closer. I feel lifted when I listen to the music and feel so in touch with a higher power. Amazing and thereputic. The best disc I have ever owned or heard by 100 times.
