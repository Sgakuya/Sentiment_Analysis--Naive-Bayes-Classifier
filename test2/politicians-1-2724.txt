Mr. Bradley's continued support for Princeton University after the appointment of a man who advocaates euthanasia for disabled persons and teaches that any human can become a non-person with the onset of a cognitive disability is disturbing to say the least. I don't think this makes Mr. Bradley a man of conviction, but rather a person who sees no value in people who live with disabilities. Not so, Mr. Bradley! We are voters and we have your measure!
