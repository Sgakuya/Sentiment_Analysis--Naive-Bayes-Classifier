BA Miles Household account is the biggest pain out. I thought it would be a good idea to merge my BA miles with my husbands so we signed up for the Household account. All was fine until I went to book tickets and then found out we can only get tickets for myself and my husband as the 2 members of the account. I didn't add the kids as they don't hold BA executive cards and there didn't seem any point in them having one either. But apparently I now can't book tickets for them. It supposedly says all this in the Rules and Regulations but those are as clear as mud. Even after having read them about 6 times it wasn't any better. As this clearly isn't going to get me any tickets booked - I phoned to either get the kids added or to get rid of the Household account to be told we couldn't do it for 6 months as: 16.1.7 Once a Household Account is established, new member(s) may not be added or existing member(s) removed more than once every six months. A Household Account may not be dissolved or re-established more than once every six months. Reading the above appears to me that I should be able to make 1 change as I don't count Establishing the account in the first place as a change - but apparently not! I now am locked out from spending my miles for 6 months - just for making a simple mistake and not having a Law degree to decipher the small print. Only resolution is to write to the Head honcho - and how long will that take before I can book tickets and get this hopefully resolved. SO moral of this story is BEWARE - watch out for the tricky rules in the BA exectutive club as what seems like a good idea is a treacherous minefield.
