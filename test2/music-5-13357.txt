Cornell Haynes Jr. b.k.a. Nelly is extremely talented. I like the fact that he has brought back the old school nursery rhymes.I truly enjoy #2,#3,#4,#8,My favorite #9 (Thicky Thick Girl),#12,#13,#14,and #16 because that song is sweet. He thanks his mother loving him. I would one day like to meet and let him know how much I appreciate his talent. Bangin' album...
