Jesse Jackson, over the past 10 years, has joined the ranks of going nutty along with the likes of Ross Perot. He is doing nothing to help the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. I believe this organization would have much better response from the nation if he were not at the forefront any longer. His fights are not for the people. They are to get his image on TV. Jesse and your colleagues, please take a long hard look at your fights. You have done nothing but harm the unity of the nation. Get the FACTS and fight with them. Stop putting the ridiculous spins on your causes because these untrue allegations on your part are only making racist generalizations seem more true. It is truly sad when I have to keep my children from watching a black person just so I don't have to try to explain what got his undies in a wad. You are not a role model for this country anymore. Please get a grip.
