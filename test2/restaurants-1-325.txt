Wendy's is done, DONE. I went there last Saturday and paid 5 bucks or so for a Big Bacon Classic Value Meal. The patties on ALL the burgers now are PAPER-THIN! This happened very recently, not just to the value-menu burgers! It's not worth your money anymore, they're charging full-price for burgers that are virtually 1/4 the size, if not less! If you don't believe me, go buy one today if you don't believe me! I'm not ever going back!
