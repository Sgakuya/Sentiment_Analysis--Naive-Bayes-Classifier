This album includes at least 2 of the best songs ever written by one of Rock and Roll's best poets: Romeo had Juliette and Dirty Boulevard should be taught in high school English classes as shining examples of the fusion of language and rock music. It's 10 years old, so some of the politics in the stories serve double purpose as a history lesson to the younger listeners. All set to bare knuckles rock and roll - 2 guitars, bass and drums. Brilliant.
