I doubt that you need my financial support now that the Republicans are making large block media buys in WI, OR, and WA markets for Mr. Nader showing his criticism of Mr. Gore but not Mr. Bush. Perhaps they will name some of the protected wilderness in Wyoming after Mr. Nader in thanks. Mr. Nader says there is no difference in the two major parties. This proves otherwise. I hope you accept this Republican corporate financial support with enthusiasm. We look forward to Mr. Bush's relaxation of coal mining standards and coal fueled electrical power emissions here in KY so that we may create even more acid rain across the eastern seaboard. Perhaps we can steal the tire plants from Illinois for our polluted rubbertown in Louisville. The Paducah nuclear plant will continue to glow on as a sign of our commitment to corporate defense spending. Regardless of our State Democratic Governor's efforts Mr. Bush and our Republican Senate and congressional representatives will wage the good war against environmentalists and workers. Thank your Republican friends for me.
