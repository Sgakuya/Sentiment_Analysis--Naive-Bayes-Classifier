While he has a right to promote himself and his views, I think almost everyone can agree on few things. The idea to bring everyone home from Iraq right now is insane. We couldn't possibly do that without causing huge problems for the people of Iraq. They need our help and in the state we have put them in now, we can desert them. Also, you would think after losing miserably every year and being humiliated, and knowing realistically that there is no way he could ever win would make him stop running. We'll see in four years I suppose.
