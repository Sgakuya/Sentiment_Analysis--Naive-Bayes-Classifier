It is so refreshing to see an artist do well who is so incredibly talented and real. Alicia's voice is to die for, not to mention the fact that she's only 20 years old but managed to birth such an amazing album. This is one fan who is hoping that she'll be around for a long, long time. I can't wait to see her live on SNL at the end of September - 29th I think?... She was awe inspiring on the MTV music video awards.
