Hell on Earth is how I describe Walmart. When I die and go to hell it'll probably be a walmart. They have low prices, and I like that cause I'm a poor boy, but quality at walmart has dropped considerably in the past few years. There are some nice people that work at my local walmart, but there are some that remind me of the surley barkeep in the movie Lonesome Dove.
