I find it interesting that John Kerry is trying to make it sound like he knows the woes of the middle class and poor. How would he know??? He married Theresa Heinz for her money and is now a millionaire!! What a joke.... If this idiot gets into office this whole country is going to go to hell in a handbasket!!!
