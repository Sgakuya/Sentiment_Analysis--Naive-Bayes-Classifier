My new husband used Bekins to move from Seattle to Michigan. They didn't estimate right, so they split his shipment and put some in storage. Lots of damage, filed a claim in Nov. 2001, talked to them in Feb. 2002, and they send a damage appraiser/repair person then. We haven't been able to connect to a live voice since. Their customer service is terrible and we would NEVER use them again. Use at your own risk!
