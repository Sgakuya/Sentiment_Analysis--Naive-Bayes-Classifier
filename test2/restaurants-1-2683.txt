There's only one thing worse than Micky D's and that's Chez McDo in France: horsemeat. We all KNOW that the golden arches are really supposed to be a woman's breasts. We know that the restaurants are made to get people in and out as quickly as possible. I avoid the place for my life--those fries may win taste tests, but I sure felt sick after eating them. My entire family will swear to you that their food tastes of cardboard!
