Morals? He's dishonest, cowardly, cruel, vindictive, arrogant, and intellectually lazy. This draft dodger launched a war on lies and has wasted the lives of a lot of brave men and women to avenge a family vendetta and test out crackpot neo-con theories. I can find nothing good to say about him other than he probably won't get a second term.
