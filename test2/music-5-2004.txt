In my humble opinion I think Mer De Noms is the best album to come out in ten years. This is a classic. A work of art. This band has literally made a landscape of sound with some of the most melodic,complicated and heart felt songs I have ever heard. This is of course by Tool front man Maynard James Keenan's side project, A Perfect Circle. These talented and ingenious musicians have created an album that deserves to go down in Rock history. But, unfortunatly it won't. Why? It came out in the Rap Rock year of our Lord, 2000. This band and their incredibly dark, gothic sound were buried by such trash bands as Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach. How could one of the greatest bands ever assembled stand a chance? A band that pumps out the best songs in years? How could singles like Judith, 3 Libras or The Hollow ever stand up to songs like Break stuff, Last Resort or One Step Closer? Instead of pre packaged teeny bop rock, A Perfect Circle's Mer De Noms deleverse a mature and proffesional sound backed by strong vocals and strong messages. Of course this album has been forgotten and looked over by the music world. But for those of us who have this incredible and breath taking album, we know, this album is one of the greatest of all times.
