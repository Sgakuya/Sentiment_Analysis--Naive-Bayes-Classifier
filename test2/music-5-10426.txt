Josh Groban is not only a delightful individual but a breath of fresh air! Already a major talent according to John Williams, who needs no introduction to the music world. Josh is not an opera singer, in spite of being called 'operaboy' by an obviously ignorant talk show host. He never claims to be an opera singer even though the world is already trying to pidgeonhole him in a genre incorrectly. It's refreshing to hear a voice that can sing Alejate beautifully and turn and sing Elton John without sounding 'operatic'. Josh is the major new talent of the time!
