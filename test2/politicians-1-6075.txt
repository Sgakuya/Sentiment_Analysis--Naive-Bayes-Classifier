spending tax dollars to cover up a freakin statue, tapping people's phone lines, investigating what kind of books people are checking out of the library...I never thought I'd see the day when the Secret Police landed on our shores. Patriot Act???!!!! PATRIOT ACT????? Our founding fathers are probably rolling over in their graves in furious fits of spasms! Do a little reading and educate yourselves, people! It won't seem funny anymore when we wake up one day and find all of our civil liberties gone and a bunch of KGB wanna-be sickos keeping files on our every move. Back in the USSR...
