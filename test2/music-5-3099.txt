Its Too late, Natural Woman, So far away, all top ten hits recorded by the likes of Aretha Franklin and Rod Stewart later on. I can see some young pups who dont know what the hell they are talking about tried to stick thier five cents in. Ah Youth..I remember being so numb skulled and so ignorant about so many things. This woman was writing hit songs for rock and r&b artists before your moms were born! This album is in my top 5. If you want to know what a great and well written song is, take your 50 cent and your Moby off the cd player and take a listen.
