I would agree with everything that Oscargamblesfro said so eloquently below. Bennett exemplifies for me the hypocrisy inherent in all rigid, doctrinaire moralists (and they tend to be conservative Republicans, let's face it). Invariably, they're hiding some dark quality within themselves that they just can't face. Father Bruce Ritter worked with abused, homeless teens before being exposed as a pedophile. Strom Thurmond the Southern racist had a "love child" with a black woman. Dick (never was a first name more appropriate) Cheney, the upholder along with Bush of "family values", has an openly gay daughter that he never seems willing to acknowledge. Bush himself, the stalwart war-hawk, was a frat-house drunk who used his family connections to avoid Vietnam. Bennett the pompous pontificator on all things moral turns out to be just another degenerate gambler. Before he lectures others on ethics and discipline, he should work on getting his own house in order first. He can start by getting his gluttony under control...the guy's a fat slob. After that, he can enroll himself in a group like Gambler's Anonymous and get the help he so obviously needs. I suppose at that point he can try and pass himself off as a redeemed sinner ala Susan Atkins or Tex Watson who has seen the light. Maybe then he'll be able to spout off on "moral issues" with some marginal degree of credibility, but why waste your time? Wouldn't it be better to listen to and follow the example of people who actually are demonstrating morality and ethics by how they live...helping the poor, the sick, the lost? People like that are out there in the world, but they never get the publicity that empty blowhards like Bennett get. We'd rather listen to hypocrites like Bennett, or concern ourselves with the troubled affairs of Paris Hilton. It's sad...
