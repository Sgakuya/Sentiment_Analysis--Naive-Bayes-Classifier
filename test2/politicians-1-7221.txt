I don't know if anyone heard this one or not but Jesse Jackson has declared Bush's administration a COUPE DE TAT. He said that if all the votes weren't counted in a third world country, the party would be considered a coupe. I only wish I could put him on a fast plane to a third world country and then he could appreciate the Justice system of this nation...LUNATIC....FREAK
