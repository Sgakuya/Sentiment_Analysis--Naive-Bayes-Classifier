Okay all you righteous Constitution waving states rights right wingers, where are you as Ashcroft systematically trashes the Bill of Rights and attempts to impose his views upon individual state laws. If you support this frightening man based upon a single issue (such as the right to life or the right to bear arms) you are as shameless as he is. The good people of the great state of Missouri know John Ashcroft well, and elected a dead man to the Senate over him. They say you can't legislate morality. The Hell I can't.
