Jesse, Jesse poor Jesse, this isn't about the color of someone's skin. Everytime you open your mouth 100 more people vote Republican. I wish you knew what bigotry really means. I have met racists, and I believe you are one of the worst. Leaders inspire and unite us, Scoundrels provoke us; guess which you are??
