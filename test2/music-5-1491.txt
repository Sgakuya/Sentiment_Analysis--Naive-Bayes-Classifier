I absolutely loved this album. The band is so great and not enough people know about them--or they do and don't listen to them--which is extremely upsetting. My favorite tracks have to be Dark of the Matinee and Take Me Out. I think that Take Me Out is one of my favorite songs of all time, everything about it is fantastic, from the lyrics to the melody. I definitely recommend this album.
