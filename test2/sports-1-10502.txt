He is not a good football coach. He plays a week scheldule every year and every time he gets a chance to move to a good confence and play some quality opponents in the SEC he chickens out. We saw how bad they were against Miami. Florida will beat them. His 2003 team will lose 2 Florida. He was a good coach when he had Richt though.
