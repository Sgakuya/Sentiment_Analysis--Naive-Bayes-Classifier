This guy's been in office for two terms now, and average New Yorkers have not benefited from a single significant tax break during that entire time. What good is it to have a Republican governor but no tax relief during his tenure? he asked rhetorically. No good, is the non-rhetorical answer. This guy was an ineffectual hangeroner consigned to the sidelines during the 9/11 disaster, was ineffective in keeping state college tuition in check, refuses to raise the minimum wage in one of the most expensive states in which to live, has done nothing to revive the sluggish upstate economy, and holds downstaters (i.e., the ones working and making the lion's share of $$$ and also paying the lion's share of taxes) in quiet contempt because we won't support his vapid candidacy. Here's a guy with close contacts with some of the most unsavory real estate developers and brokers in the mid-Hudson region. Here's a guy, who despite his family's well-heeled status, pulled bogus stunts to have his father committed to a charity nursing home rather than foot the bill himself to make sure the old guy was well taken care of. A really dishonest, slimy, cheapskate sleazeball.
