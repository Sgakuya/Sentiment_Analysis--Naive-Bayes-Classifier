This album set the standards for all those rock bands that followed zep. Their music has so much texture to it, listen beyond the basic rhythms, hear the subtleties of the music, don't just judge it on Stairway. Appreciate how it was recorded. The very best of British innovative music.Listen to music today and the influences are there.
