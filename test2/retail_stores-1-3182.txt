After several delays in shipping of DVDs and then half the time they are damaged and skip or stall all over the place, Blockbuster and Hollywood Video are a breath of fresh air. At least with them, you can go right back and get a clean copy to take home and watch. With NetSux, you are waiting at least 4-5 days turnaround just to wait and see if you get to go through the same hassle again.
