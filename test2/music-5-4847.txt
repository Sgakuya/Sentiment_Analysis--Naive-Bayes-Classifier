I'll always remember Martina crooning Independence Day in a slow, melodic way right after 9/11. It gave me chills and I was surprised to find that tears were running down my cheeks. Her voice is so beautiful and she has such a wonderful personality to match. I'm so happy that she has done so well recently. Her Greatest Hits CD is one of my favorites; I never get tired of listening to it because it has so much variety!
