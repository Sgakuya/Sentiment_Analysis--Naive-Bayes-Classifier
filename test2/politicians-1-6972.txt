Well, I see by the extremely high number of derogatory comments that it would be pointless for me to trash him even further...Oh well, maybe a comment or two: First, I'm completely convinced that this guy is in it to get his fair share--fame, publicity, money, whatever. He's doing it for himself, not for his race or country. He cries racism when and where there is none. By doing this, he keeps open the door for even more tension between the races. In other words, he makes mountains out of molehills. Case in point: the recent hiring of Steve Mariuchi to coach the Detroit Lions football team. Guess who goes and cries racism because he feels a black guy didn't have what he considered to be a legitimate chance at the job? Now, I'm not particularly a fan of Mariuchi or the Lions, either, but I never once considered it as racism that he was hired. Jesse Jackson was trying to stir up trouble where there wasn't any before. In fact, I have very serious doubts that he knows the least bit about football to begin with. He probably wouldn't know a football if someone threw one at him. He needs to mind his own business.
