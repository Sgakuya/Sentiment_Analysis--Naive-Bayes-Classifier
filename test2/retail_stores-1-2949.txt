I have had the worst experience with Kay's/ Ostermen Jewlers.... I purchased a special order item back in December of 2004. I never recieved a phone call stating it was in but now they are saying I recieved the rings when I purchased them. How can one recieve a special order item the day of purchase when that was when the order was placed. Now I am disputing them for the last year about the $450 that they charged me for them. The store manager even says that I was in there and that I signed a paper. Yes I signed a paper for them to charge my store credit card but that was it. I have gone to lengths with customer relations at Kays but no one wants to return a phone call or help me get to the bottom of the situation. After this experience of causing great headache and damages to my credit I can not even step foot in their stores again and do not wish this experience upon my worst foe. This all happened at a Kay's store in Muncie, Indiana.
