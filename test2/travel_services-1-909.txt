The movers were very unprofessional. They argued with each other the entire time they were packing. They left us standing in our house with 5 full carloads full of stuff as they drove off. They took over 4 hours to make a 3 hour drive. When packing our furniture into a storage shed they broke several things. They tossed stuff up to the top of the stacks of furniture they made instead of placing it in storage shed. We have not completely unloaded the storage shed to check out everything, but so far every piece of furnture we have pulled out is broken or scratched.
