Unwarranted late charges are a form of theft! Theft is a crime! All criminals should be held accountable! If Hollywood Video steals from its customers the very people who make that very same business viable this just adds insult to injury. These types of inept underhanded operating procedure must not be tolerated! Contact the BBB & the Federal Trade Commission. Its just like VOTING if you dont participate you cant win Hollywood employees need not reply!!
