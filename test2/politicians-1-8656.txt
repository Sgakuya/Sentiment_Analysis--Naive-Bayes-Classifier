Woodrow Wilson was one of the worst Presidents ever to occupy the White House. President Taft correctly called him a mulish enigma, a mountain of egotism. Wilson exacerbated relations with Mexico, introduced segregation and other forms of racism into the federal government, needlessly involved the United States in the First World War, and upset the balance of power in Europe, sowing the seeds for discord which led to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Other than that, he wasn't bad.
