KROGER SUCKS!!!! They will only have one cashier working there at any given time so your choices when you check out are to wait in a long line or go through the pain in the ass uscan line. Yesterday, I was in the back of the line and the manager looks at me and says that lane 1 is now open. I go down there to discover that- surprise! Lane 1 is the uscan line. I have a full cart of groceries including a bunch of produce and this is just not an option. I lost my place in line. I only go to Kroger when Publix does not have an item I need. From now on, though I will just special order at Publix insted. To Kroger management: BITE ME!
