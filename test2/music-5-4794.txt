Let me get my bias out: I am a HUGE Britney fan. That doesn't mean that I am going to say everything she does is perfect. It just means I am going to have to think more critically about her than I normally would. I like Britney's concerts. I love the music (some of it), and I love the performance. The back-up dancers, while gay, are still magnificent performers, as is Britney. This is where Britney REALLY shines, not in singing, but in dancing.
