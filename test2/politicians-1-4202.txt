I can't believe this moron is costing Al Gore the Presidency...and he won't even get his precious five percent! Thank you Ralph Nader. After four years of a Republican president, congress and Supreme Court, history will remember Ralph Nader as a selfish jackass who helped the country go down the toliet instead of as the noble consumer advocate he once was.
