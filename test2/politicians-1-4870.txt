The most notable Cold Warrior retread/political hack hangeroner fossil among the so-called advisors supposedly leading the clueless George W through his on-the-job training. An arrogant and self-impressed clown who strutted around during the early going of the war and threw down that with us or against us canard when cooler, saner heads questioned the validity and need for this dubious military misadventure. A twerp and a phony who was a prime mover and shaker in selling this totally elective and unnecessary act of aggression against Iraq to the noncomprehending American public, who basked in his power and influence while he led the best interests of this country to Hell in a handbasket. Now that the Mission Accomplished aspect of Bushie's Iraq debacle has been shown up for the failure it truly is, the hostilities continue in a state of out-and-out anarchy/chaos in that beleagured country and U.S. casualties continue to mount for the most spurious of reasons, Rumsfeld doesn't come off as the great leader and genius we were led to believe he was. This turd totally underestimated the scope of the social, political and attitudinal dynamics in Iraq, totally underestimated the will of those folks in that country who are antithetical to Western values and will defend to the death their beloved homeland. Rumsfeld and rest of the idiots in his cadre operated under the flawed and ridiculous assumption that our professional killers (i.e., the military misfits the drooler faction is still worshipping) would be considered liberators, when the actuality is these unfortunates are really considered invaders. The end result is that the U.S. bit off more than it could chew, ushered in a state of chaos that is no better for the average Iraqi citizen than the conditions they suffered under Saddam, caused countless billions of dollars in infrastructure and property damage in that country and killed thousands of civilians, alienated what used to be called the Western alliance, alienated and totally dissed the U.N., and turned most of the free world against us. Our military is spread so thin that the Pentagon would be hard pressed to come up with sufficient troop numbers in the event of trouble suddenly springing up in another part of the world, which means if this so-called War on Terror is to continue, Americans are going to have to get used to the idea of re-instituting the draft. That's gonna go over big, believe me. And as there's no exit strategy in place regarding Iraq, it's very likely that U.S. casualties will continue to mount, Bushie's war initiative will continue to cost the taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars that would be better spent in this country to address social ills and economic problems, and the overall peace and security in the Middle East will continue to be compromised by this heavyhanded, jackhammer storm trooper approach devised by Rummy. And as this guy is the prime architect of this fiasco, it tells you plenty about the wisdom of Bushie in employing old and in the way retards like Rumsfeld in such important and sensitive policy-making positions. Darling of the Droolers turns into an ineffectual sack of crap before your very eyes!!! Actually, he was a sack of crap to begin with, but the American public, poisoned by the nonsense barfed up by the conservative-controlled media were mystified once again, and the droolers still don't get it. The 2003 Elections can't come soon enough to rid Washington of the stale fart known as The Bush Administration II, and Rumsfeld will prove to be the noxious vapor best dispensed.
