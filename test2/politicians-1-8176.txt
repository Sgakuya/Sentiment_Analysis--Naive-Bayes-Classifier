Did well by recognizing the necessity of tax cuts. However, his abandoning of the Cuban people in the Bay of Pigs could be the all-time greatest show of spineless diplomacy in the history of American presidents. He began the American entanglement in Vietnam. The half-hearted plan allowed the American Congress to set the military agenda - a huge error that cost 50,000+ American lives and eventually millions of lives of innocent Southeast Asian as communism swept through the region. Very poorly done.
