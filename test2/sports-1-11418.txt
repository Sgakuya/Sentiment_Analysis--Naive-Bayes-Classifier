His no class treatment of his Alabama players last year was as low as it goes. A man with no personal loyalty except to the almighty dollar. No courage - his website has been shutdown - can't stand the heat I guess. And tremendous pressure to win or else - with this track record for job hopping he has to win or fall by the wayside. The Aggies ousted a coach with tremendous loyalty to his players and the school in favor of this guy?!?!?
