I feel a surge of hope for rock'n' roll. I bought Reveal with my own money and felt that it was worth every cent. All the Way to Reno is one of those songs you just have to love. I've Been High is my far-and-away favorite, with Saturn Returns coming in second. Not as good as Automatic for the People ---how could R.E.M EVER get that good again?---but what counts is that I now have hope in my heart instead of the pain and sorrow that *NSANE and B(ull)ritney S(h*t)pears give me. Keep it up, R.E.M., and take care, everyone!
