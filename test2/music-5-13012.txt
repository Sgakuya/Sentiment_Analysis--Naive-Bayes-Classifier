It's shameful that such a masterpiece like this could be so far down on the list. I guess it's not idiotic enough to make the eMpTyV zombies happy. Too bad, because Shadow struck gold here. This is one of those precious few albums I've heard where I can just press play and let it run. A work of art. Changeling is a beautiful piece of music.
