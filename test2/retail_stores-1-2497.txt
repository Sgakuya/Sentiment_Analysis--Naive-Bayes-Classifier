I have shopped here for some time because it is the closest grocer to my home, and for that reason alone. There is nothing else to recommend it above any other mid-price chain grocery store in the area. However, after my experience today, I will happily shop at the family-owned locals, or Sentry, or Jewel-Osco, or whatever, just to spare myself from the wretched customer service, and the supervisory staff is even worse.
