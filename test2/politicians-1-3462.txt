Do you know that George W. Bush's IQ is less than half of the American population? For a man who committed our troops into an unnecesary war, who ruined the American reputation among our NATO allies, and tried to steal the property, oil illegally from Iraq, would he be worth to be the commander of cheif again. Give me a break! George W. Bush should be ashamed to be called the President of the United States.
