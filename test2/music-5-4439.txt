Maybe the greatest recording in the history of music. Kleiber's interpretation of the Fifth Symphony is almost unparalleled. The Wiener Philharmoniker's precise execution of every movement of both symphonies is absolutely remarkable. From the first note of the Fifth Symphony to the last, you are drawn in to the work and can't get out. The first movement is so powerful, so tragic, and so flawless. The transition from the third movement into the finale is one of the most uplifting few seconds in all of music. The key to this amazing transition is how softly the violins bring out the tones F (1st violin) and B (2nd violin) at first and then suddenly begin to crescendo with assistance from primarily the brass (on the tones D and G). The result is a sudden powerful group of C Major chords to open the finale. This transition is also the key change from C Minor to C Major. The finale itself is performed with such power and precision until the final note, a unison C held out by all but the trombones, which cut off after the first beat of the final bar.
