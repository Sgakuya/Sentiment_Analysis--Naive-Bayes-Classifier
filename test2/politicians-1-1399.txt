A cowardly weasel...I am shocked at the French attitude toward America...I do know one Frenchman who appreciates what America did for them in WWII. My husband and I were the guests of the Owner of the Sofitel Hotels about three years ago. We were wined, dined and treated like Royalty. You see, my husband was one of the brave Americans who landed at Normandy and liberated that town...By doing so, his mother, locked up and waiting execution by the Germans was freed.He thanked us and expressed his love for the American people...Shame on you Mr. Chirac for your actions toward the American people...
