Listen up, Lou, I'm 13, and I AM NOT an old hippie. I love the Beatles. Their music isn't just for old hippies, believe me.And Angel, the Beatles out-bad themselves? HELLO! Reality check, your name should be Devil. The Beatles are the best rock band on the face of this earth. For the last time, their NOT overrated. Their music was and still is the best. Name one artist of today that in 30 years will put out a number one album. Plus, have you listened to the White Album. Sexy Sadie is my favorite off of there. It's a masterpiece. Beatles are number one on my list, and they'll always stay there.
