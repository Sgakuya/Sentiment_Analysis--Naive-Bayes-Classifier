Another smooth job for Bad boy Bowden, I thinks its discusting that florida State is in the BCS. There are 6 other teams that are ranked higher than they are, that should be playing Georgia. Just because the ACC is the worse Football conference and always has been, I feel that its another Bowden sly job. Hell they don't even deserve to be playing at all. GIVE ME a BREAK.. GO DAWGS.... Teach them a lesson.. Ken Ocala
