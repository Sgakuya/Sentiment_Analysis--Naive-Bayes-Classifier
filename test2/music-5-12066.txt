Mary J. is the bomb, she has always produced great music. Her music always seem like she has been that fly on your wall in your life. Her music always seem like she is personally talking to me, or refering to a incident in my life. Especially her duet with Wyclef , 911, that joint was tight. If it weren't for Mary, I don't think that song would be as tight as it is. She has a differnt sound in the way she sings, her music don't come out in a real high pitch voice it comes out as if she is reading a poem. So major props to you Mary, keep on dropping those bomb a** hits girl!!!!!
