First of all, I think Fab Four was being used tongue in cheek. Secondly, I can't believe Fag isn't on Rate-It-All's list of undesirable terms along with certain hateful terms for blacks, jews, etc. Thirdly, the opinion of someone who'd sincerely use a term like Fag Four in a public forum is most likely crap anyway. Last, it's a great cd.
