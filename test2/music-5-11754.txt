this cd is great! every song is as good if not better then the other. `emotionless` is amazing. who cares what you call them? does it really make a diference if you call it punk rock or punk pop? i would rather listen to punk pop then to some a**hole yelling dumb lyrics at me. and for all of you who say that gc is for losers- im sorry that we can`t all be perfect like you and that some of us have problams and need bands like gc to help us. i envy you for never knowing that pain of being called `the freak`/`stoner`/`junkie`
