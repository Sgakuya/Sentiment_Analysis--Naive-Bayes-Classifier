Meh...Not even close to the best back in history. I can name 20 that i would rather have. Starting with Alexander, Larry Johnson, Marshall Faulk, Barry Sanders, Jim Brown, Oj, and so on. He will not win a rushing title he is not a big time rusher. Only reason people consider him good is because they throw to him alot. Look at Marshall Faulk. Leader in yards from scrimmage many times. 26 TDs 1 year. He is better.
