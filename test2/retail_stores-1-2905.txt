I bought my husband a ring that was promised in white gold. the manager cut off the bottom of the receipt to avoid notifying the customers of their rights. I came to find out this is a regular scam they run to avoid any returns. my husband wore the ring for two days before it turned yellow. Came to find out it was dipped in white gold and was not white gold. I was very upset because i had spent $4,000 on a ring that was not what it was promised to be. I called the president in Chicago and my calls were not returned. I called the district and regional managers, my calls were not returned. I finally chased down the dm and he made it seem like he never got my messages and tried to charm me with some discount on the diamonds. They know most stores cut off the bottom of the receipts, which is illegal and clearly a case of fraud. If anyone has more information about this please contact me. They need to stop!
