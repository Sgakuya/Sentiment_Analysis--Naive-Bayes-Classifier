He drove Nebraska into the ground. Once Osborne's recruits left, the team won only 7 games. He could not recruit, either. He only went after in-state guys. Some friends of mine play football here in Nebraska and Solich is sending them letters. Had he been at Nebraska, they would be the gems of the recruiting class next year, adn they are not good enough to compete at that level. Terrible recruiter, terrible coach, good athlete.
