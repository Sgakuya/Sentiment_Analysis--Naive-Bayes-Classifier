I, too saw that program on T-V about the cockfighting and was sickened by what I saw....how barbaric can people be? And to take their kids there!!!Senator should be hung upside down for 3 days...see how he likes that, and that would be humane compared to what he allowing to happen....I cannot stand cruelty to animals....You could tell that one rooster had feelings because as soon as they laid him down, he got all limo, knowing what was going to happen.....SHAME on you Senator Lott...you are not human...
