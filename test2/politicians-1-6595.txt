This man is not misunderstood, he is a racist, corrupt, inflammatory maniac. As a Canadian, I have special emnity towards this a$$hole, as he seems to think that his brand of psychotic bigotry should be extended across the border into our country. That will never happen. This man has no moral scruples, for all his bible-thumping prosletyzing. He was supportive of the president of Liberia, simply because the man was a baptist, forgetting that Charles Taylor was also a corrupt and genocidal lunatic. Buchanan also forgot to mention that he had financial interests in the current Liberian regime, which was the basis for his support rather than any ethical reasons. As long as Americans listen to this fanatic, I will continue to look down upon your country, because a country where even a fraction of the populace supports guys like this deserves everything that every happens to it.
