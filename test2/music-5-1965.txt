Our Lady Peace is one of the greatest bands of all time and this album just proves that point. Raine has one of the greatest voices in music. If you've never heard OLP before I recommend starting out listening to Naveed(their first album) then Clumsy, then Happiness...Is Not A Fish That You Can Catch and working your way finally to this album. You can't help but totally fall in love with every song on every album. Few things are better!
