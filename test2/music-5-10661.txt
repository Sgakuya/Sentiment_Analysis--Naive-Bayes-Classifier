When I bought this CD I was expecting great things. I loved their last album and Santana's Smooth, so I had very high expectations for this CD. The first time I listened to it I wasn't sure if I liked it, it was so different from the first one. But as time passed I found the catchy tunes stuck in my head and it made me want to play it more and more. I ended up buying two copies of the CD, one for my car and one for my house. It is by far the most played CD in my collection. I have become a great fan of Rob Thomas and his music that stays with you for days after you hear it for the first time. Rest Stop is a visual picture you will not forget and You Won't Be Mine is an excellent ballad that you probably won't realize how much you like it until later when the words and melody continure to run through your head. Matchbox Twenty is one of the best bands to come out in the last twenty years and I know they will be around at least as long as Aerosmith. I am looking forward to their next CD and my expectations are even higher for that one. I know they won't disappoint!
