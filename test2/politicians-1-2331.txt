All of the hooplah regarding Powell is just pure baloney. He is product of the privileged class and is a lacky for the thief in the white house. Just because he is a retired general does not mean a thing to me. All generals do is sit around on their butts, send the troops out to fight and take credit for all of the hard work that is done by thier staff.
