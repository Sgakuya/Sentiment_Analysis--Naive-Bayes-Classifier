Josh Groban has one of the most beautiful and powerful voices of our day. Regardless of your genre preference, almost anyone can appreciate the beautiful songs on this album. I've been a fan of rock/pop genres mostly, but Josh blew me away. I saw him in concert twice also, and he is just as amazing. Five stars, two thumbs up. I am a fan for life.
