I am truly appalled that this restaurant chain is still in business (and apparently doing well). What makes me the most upset is that there are so many women willing to eat and work there. Somehow I doubt this would be the case if the tables were turned. I mean can you imagine men going to a place called Big Willies (or whatever) for dinner? I don't think so.
