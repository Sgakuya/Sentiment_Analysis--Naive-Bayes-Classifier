The happiest day turned into the worst day ever. My husband bought me a beautiful pair of diamond hoop earrings for Christmas. The most expensive piece of jewelry I've ever had beside my wedding rings and to say I was estastic is an understatement. I wore them on the 26th of Dec for a girls day out with my mother and sister in law. The very first time I wore them I lost one!!!. I have been wearing hoop earrings for 30 years and have never lost one, except in bed. To say that I was devastated is an understatement. I went back to the retail store to tell them of my experience and to let them know that I knew there was nothing that they could do, but to give me the contact info regarding the manufacturer, as I had issue with their shoddy workmanship. The manager, completely unsympathetic, said there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak with the district manager, who I was told at the time had been in an accident and was out for a week. She would call me then. Its been a month and still no response. I cannot believe that they can still be in business with such terrible customer service. I went to 3 other jewelers in the same vicinity of this store and was told by all at the least I'd get store credit for the remaining earring and at most get a replacement earring. Boy, did I choose the wrong store! I plan to take them to court and to let EVERYONE know about my experience with this horrible company.
