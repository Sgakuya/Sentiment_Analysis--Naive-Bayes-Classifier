I'm not a very huge Faith Hill fan, I love her voice, but I don't keep up with her ya know? I own 4 of her albums... Faith is a suprisingly great album! It was just before the whole Faith goes pop thing....which I have no problem with. Faith is something that you can listen to from start to finish, just great!
