Black Sabbath are the most overrated band of all time. They are the worst imitation of Cream I have ever heard in my life. Their music is loud, noisy, and unintelligible. Ozzy Osborne gives every garage band singer relief as the garage band singers can all outsing this dolt, the worst vocalist in the history of all rock.
