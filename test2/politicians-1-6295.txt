Cynthia McKinney is an ill informed embarrassment to this country. Her many erroneous statements are too numerous to list here so I will refer to only a few of them. On April 12, 2002 the Southeastern Legal Foundation sent a letter to the US House Committee of Official Conduct requesting formal sanctions against McKinney for issuing statements suggesting that the Bush administration and top government leaders knew about the Sept 11 attacks beforehand but remained silent in order to benefit financial investors of a Washington based investment group. The request was sent to US Rep Joel Hefley, Chairman of the House Committee of Standards and Conduct and referenced Rule 43 which states A member, officer, or employee of the House of Representatives shall conduct himself at all times in a manner which shall reflect credibility on the House of Representatives. The letter went on to say that It is shameful and indeed unethical and dangerous that McKinney has publicly alleged an unfounded conspiracy of silence involving high elected officials, government employees and the President himself that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Americans. At the time the letter was written McKinney was being investigated for violations stemming from the invading of polling places on election day 2000, and harassing and intimidating poll watchers and directly soliciting votes while in the polling place. Twice the Georgia State Board of Elections heard evidence and voted unanimously that action be taken be a state administrative law judge. McKinney is of the opinion that the United States is one of the worst human rights abusers in the world. She has said An African American newborn has less chance of reaching 65 than does a baby born in Bangladesh. What McKinney doesn't know is that life expectancy for men and women, race not considered, is 9 years greater than in Bangladesh and you can read that in any comparative World Atlas. (Athens Banner-Herald, Tues, 6/26/01) McKinney and other congress persons represented the Clinton administration at the inagural of Charles Taylor, the new president of Liberia. When she returned she made a statement to the Atlanta Journal & Constitution about Mr Taylor in which she said Taylor was one of Africa's potential continental leaders and she would work to improve trade between Georgia and Africa. Mr James Kpanneh Doe of Atlanta wrote to McKinney calling her her statements disappointing and embarrassing by giving sanction to a government that is yet to prove its commitment to democratic governance. Mr Doe went on to say McKinney had a lack of informed understanding of the Liberian crisis and contrasts with views of others such as president Jimmy Carter who had a longer association with Liberia and a deeper involvement with Africa. On August 20, 2002, the voters of the 4th Congressional District ousted McKinney and elected her challenger, former State Court Judge Denise Majette.
