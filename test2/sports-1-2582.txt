Ed Wade is a walking disaster as a GM. His lack of baseball knowledge is disgraceful. He is a prodcut of a Sycophant organization that rewards butt kissing over talent. He has had the job for 7+ years now, the Fillies are NO better now than they were 7 years ago. Their minor league system is still as bare as ever.
