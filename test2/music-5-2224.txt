Short, but rockin' blues album by a 70 year old man. Burnside finds a riff he likes and he goes with it. Songs are very much in the highly electrified tradition of Muddy Waters, Albert Collins etc. I had the pleasure of seeing R.L. Burnside in concert in 2001 in CA and it was excellent. I feel somewhat privileged to have seem him in concert as Mr. Burnside recently passed away. Very much one of the more unappreciated bluesmen of the last decade or so.
