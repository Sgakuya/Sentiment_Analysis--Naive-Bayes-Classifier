Barbara Boxer, suffice to say, is a divisive person. As U.S. Senator from California, she has succeeded at helping create the poisonous atmosphere today which is clearly evident in politics, bowing down repeatedly to either special interests or to the far, liberal left. Very partisan, Boxer showed her true colors during the Clinton Presidency as ANYTHING the President did she considered 'alright'. Never once did she reprimand the President for his personal conduct (but of which was probably not an impeachable offense). Boxer has never introduced any bills of great significance, instead opting to use her office to build a campaign war chest to get repeatedly re-elected (and not going by her record of which is shameful). And to compare her to her peer, Dianne Feinstein, would be an insult to the latter because, unlike Boxer, Feinstein is actually capable of being non-partisan from time to time. Californians ought to realize they deserve MUCH better than having this shameless, leftist hack representing them.
