My experience was that of Mulebreath. I had items stolen from me. I had items damaged. They extorted money before they would unload (I was at work at the time, leaving only my wife and an eight week old baby to deal with these pricks). They showed up without enough inventory stickers; they didn't have proper moving equipment; one of the movers brough their (roughly) ten year old child to help load. Seriously, don't ever consider using these guys to save a few dollars.
