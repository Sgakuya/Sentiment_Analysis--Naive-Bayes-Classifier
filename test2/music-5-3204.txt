Black Dog, Rock and Roll, The Battle of Evermore, Stairway to Heaven, Misty Mounain Hop, Four Sticks, Going to California and When the Levee Breaks. I mean, come on!!! "Has not aged well"??? "Not worthy of inclusion on this list"??? Not only is this the best Led Zeppelin album ever, it's the 3rd best album of the seventies and the 6th best album OF ALL TIME!!! Don't believe me? Just ask me. I've ranked them all.
