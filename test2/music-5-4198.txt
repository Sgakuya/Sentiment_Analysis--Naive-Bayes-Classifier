I just love this album! It reminds me of summer '95! I must say I'm very glad to see Born to Run as the fist song. I would have been disappointed otherwise! That song, with Thunder Road are just beautiful. Badlands, Hungry Heart, Born in the USA, and Glory Days are just awesome! The River, My Hometown, Brilliant Disguise, Streets of Philadelphia, and Secret Garden are so beautiful, so romanitic, so meaningful! Dancing in the Dark and Human Touch are so cool I just can't say anything more about them! If I could have some input as to what songs were on this album, though, it does leave out a few of my faves: I'm Goin Down, Cover Me, etc.
