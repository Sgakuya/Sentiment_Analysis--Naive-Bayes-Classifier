I think it is an American tragedy that we have resorted to allowing A candidate to keep counting and recounting and recounting and so on, just because he is a sore loser.. The hand count CAN NOT be as accurate as the machine count, and if they hand count Florida, then Hand Count the rest of the country... Sad day for AMERICA
