I've said it since they hired this man. I HATE his coaching style. Big games like OSU vs. TX is no time to play conservative football. Tighten up the defense BEFORE your opponent gets into the red-zone. And for heaven's sake, how about TRYING to convert on a third down every once in a while instead of settling for a field goal! It amazed me that I didn't see ANY long pass plays or any trickery to stir things up during the Texas game. Your team is easy to defend against when all you do is run on 1st and 2nd then short pass on 3rd. And try maotivating your team for once Jim! Walking back to the huddle is unacceptable! Your blood should be boiling during a game like this and you should be ripping off that damn sweater vest and acting like you care whether you win or lose.
