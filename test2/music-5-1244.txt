I think that this is a great album! The songs have a great rhythm that doesn't lose your attention. I can't seem to get the lyrics out of my head. This CD is definately in my personal top 10!! It is especially great on those bad mood days. My favorite song is Tail of the Sun . It's laid back, and the lyrics take me to a place that's hard to go to. Totally worth the money!
