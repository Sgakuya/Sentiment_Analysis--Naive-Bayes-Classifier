Bad Reputation is one of Joan Jett's best albums. The title song Bad Reputation is a signature song that the Blackhearts never fail to play live. The other original songs like You Don't Know What You've Got, Let Me Go and Jezebel are great too. Joan really knows how to cover a song and bring it to life like the rockin' Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah), Shout and Wooly Bully. This is a must have album in your music collection.
