I've now taken my family to two Coldstone Creamery locations in Palm Beach County. No surprise they were identical since its a franchise but what made them the same was the mess. Ice cream and mix in bits all over the floor. If their kitchen is this messy it makes you fear for your health. We won't take our kids to one of these again.
