If you can't afford the whole Tracks set, then definitely don't pass this one by! 18 Tracks is a great sampler! The songs are really fun and you don't get tired of them easily. I can't really pick a favorite because all the songs are great! Growin Up, Rendezvous, The Promise, and Pink Cadillac are especially good, however! Buy this! It will not let you down !
