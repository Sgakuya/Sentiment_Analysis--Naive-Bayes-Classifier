The K-mart in my town is a filthy rat hole with surly employees who never know where anything is and no selection. There are never any cashiers to check people out except one girl who obviously has only worked there for 10 mins. The fact thst they associate with Martha Stewert shows just how desperate they are. Both of them can enjoy bankruptcy together.
