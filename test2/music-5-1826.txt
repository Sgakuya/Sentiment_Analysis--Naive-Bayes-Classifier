This is my favorite band. They are the true meaning of the word punk. I recently saw them in Houston and I must say, I had the time of my life. This album is a change for them. I cant listen to it enough. They made the way for bands like Blink 182 and SR71. Lets not forget, Green Day has been making music like those guys since the late 80s, so stop trying to rip off the original!
