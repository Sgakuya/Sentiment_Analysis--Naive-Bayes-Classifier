Just so everybody knows this rating is negative 1 because he is by far the worst president this country has ever had. First, he got us into Vietnam, which in no way can be compared to Iraq, almost got us into a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, and developed the Peace Corps, which is why, to all of you liberal scumbags out there, why everyone else hates us. Whether you'll admit it or not, we are still cleaning up the mess left by JFK. War hero my ass! Oh yeah, when the mob cheated him into the presidency, ahead of Nixon, a future great president, he turned on them and tried to crack down. People wonder why he got shot. I wonder why he didn't get shot earlier. Honestly, I would much rather have organized crime be our biggest crime problem rather than these poor white trash, black people and latinos who can't tell their elbow from their ass running around. How could a man who couldn't even fix his own problems (*cough Marylin Monroe cough*0 fix ours?
