Captaind D's used to be a wonderful place to eat.The Oklahoma restaurants have gone down hill badly in the last year.You can't get service any more and there is never a manager available.I spent my last dime on them last week.It took 10 minutes just to order and 10 minutes for my food,which sucked!!! What has happened????? signed back to long johns
