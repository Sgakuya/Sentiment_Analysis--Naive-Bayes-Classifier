A modern masterpiece. Unforgettable themes. IT helps make Star Wars: A New Hope what it is today, a classic film. The end of the movie where Luke, Han, Chewie, Leia, C-3PO and R2-D2 are standing there with their medals and suddenly, wham here comes the credits with this great theme that picks up the spirit of the moment just perfectly. I get goosebumps even thinking about it! And the Imperial Theme, so dark and sinister sounding. Hats off to John Williams. I love this music!
