Ihave finally had it! For the last three months every time Ido my grocery shopping, the shelves are empty of the weekly specials!! Ihunt for 20 minutes to find a manager to inquire and I'm told sorry the truck just pulled up. It doesn't matter if It's early morning, in the middle of the night, or high noon. The shelves are empty. I'm sorry but I don't care to run back to the store three times a week. I will now shop where things are stocked!!!!!!!!!
