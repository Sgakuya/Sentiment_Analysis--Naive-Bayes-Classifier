I am glad to see that this album is finally getting the recognition it deserves. This definately is high on the list of Floyd albums, do to the incredible lyrics, and the emotion poured into the making of Shine On You Crazy Diamond. Shine On You Crazy Diamond (the WHOLE song) is about as perfect as a song can get, complete with great lyrics, and great guitar riffs, all in a song devoted to schizophrenic former guitarist Syd Barrett. Parts 1-5 talks about the early days of Syd, how he was caught in the crossroads of childhood and stardom. Welcome to the Machine progresses as a Record Executive explains how an artist (supposedly Syd) got into the business, and how the Executives *told* the artist what to dream about. The Elevator noise comes about, and the beginning of Have A Cigar is upon. Have A Cigar exploits how Record Executives will act like they are interested, but really are just riding the gravy train , or in other words, in it for the money. Wish You Were Here is a change of pace song, probably a song about how the band misses Syd. The wind blows, and that brings about Shine On You Crazy Diamond (6-9), which is mostly instrumental, and in which the lyrics talk about how he is gone away. Truly, the album may only have 4 songs (technically 5), it has much substance, and great musicianship to boot.
