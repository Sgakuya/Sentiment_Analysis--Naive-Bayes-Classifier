Give me a break. I heard this album twice and both times I had to turn it off by Happy Just To Dance With You . Talk about songs with NO soul at all. Simplicity is taken to the extreme here, whereas most Beatle albums are very amatuer in the sense that a big achievement for the Beatles was playing tapes backwards, a la Rain . I wish their music would just go away like Milli Vanilli.
