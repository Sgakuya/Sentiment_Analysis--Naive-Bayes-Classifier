I am totally amazed that anyone of sound mind could even consider voting for Al Gore. I challenge anyone, to name just one accomplishment that the Clinton/Gore Adminstration has made over the past eight years. Gore says that they have reduced the size of the Federal Gov. - they did in fact do this, they terminated over 250,000 military individuals, most of them with over 10 years experience. At the same time, Gore says that he is for a strong military, how is this?? So again, I just say name me just one POSITIVE accomplishment that this adminstration has made.
