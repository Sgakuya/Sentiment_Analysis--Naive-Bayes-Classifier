I've been to the CF a handful of times over the past several years, and every time I go I wonder why I went back. I also wonder what all the hoopla is about. Everything is mediocre. I'm stunned that CF rated higher than P.F. Chang's, Ruth's Chris, and California Pizza Kitchen. Just another indication of declining American tastes and an increasingly indiscriminate palate.
