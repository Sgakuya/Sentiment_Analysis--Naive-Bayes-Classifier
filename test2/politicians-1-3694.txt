Hundreds of history experts rate Republican President Warren G. Harding as our worst president ever. That is about to change. When (if) Dubya (George W. Bush) becomes president. Our buddy Dubya will replace Harding at the very bottom. He'll call daddy every chance he gets. Daddy wasn't that great, himself. Dubya is lucky. He was a minor partner in the Texas Rangers baseball club, yet it made him a millionaire and he had a great deal of power. He had a losing oil company for several years until he got lucky and sold out to someone with real knowledge and savvy about the oil industry. His friends are daddy's friends in politics. He is so lame he doesn't really have any of his own friends. This guy smirks at executions. For or against the death penalty how can we allow such a person to be president?
