let's look at the facts...the number one program in the country in the nineties..has fallen out of the top 25..all because tubby is a one dimensional coach..defense only..kentucky cannot recruit the top players anymore because of one reason..the coach..unc loses their 7 top players and replaces them with top talent why can't uk?? a student of basketball can see that one man dribbling and 4 watching is not a productive offense...uk deserves the best coach available...unfortunately tubby smith is not it....
