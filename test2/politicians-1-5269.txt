There is a great evil in this country. It has been eroding our moral base, and our strength internationally. This evil is abortion. Like slavery of 200 years ago, it is not politically correct to say it is evil, even though it is. Politicians wavered on it, and compromised by slowing its expansion. In the end, slavery split this great nation and we paid for our complicity in slavery through the bloodiest war to be ever fought in the western hemisphere. I fear such an event will happen again. And we will repay every drop of blood shed by the syringe and the forcep with one drawn by the sword. This country is going to fall. It is pro-choicers like Gore that will lead to its demise.
