I think people are missing the bigger issue here. Does any one realize that Tim hortons does NOT buy fair trade coffee? Shamefully, and selfishly, I work there. I simply needed a job for university tuition, and for that I am nearly forced to ignore my beliefs and say here is your coffee that was brought to you by starving people and controlled by the government.
