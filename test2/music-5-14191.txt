I am normally not happy when a type of music goes mainstream that is normally just a limited group of listeners, however I like that this got semi-popular. My reasons for this are that bluegrassis the true American music. If there is a traditional American genre, this is it. The album does justice to bluegrass greats like Norman Blake, that really do deserve recognition for their talents.
