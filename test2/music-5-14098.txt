This is a return to the Classic late 60's early 70's Bee Gees style, and it's like they haven't even beem away from it. She keeps on coming is as good as Bad bad dreams from To whom it may concern The title track is as good as anything from the Bee Gees 1st album. Overall I give it 10 out of 10. It's amazing that they still have so many great song ideas after all these years, and still sing as well, too.
