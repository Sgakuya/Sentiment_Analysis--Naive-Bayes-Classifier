Kobe Bryant is a sorry ass player.The only reason he scores so much is because the refs call every ticky-tack foul just like shaq(but that's another story). The only reason I watch Kobe play is because I don't want to miss someone whooping his ass in a game like Chris Childs or Reggie Miller did to him.
