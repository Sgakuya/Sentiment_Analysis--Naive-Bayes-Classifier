My husband bought a platinum bridal set which both had diamonds around the band of the engagement ring and the weddding band which pitted in the platinum around the diamonds - the manager and all the employees told me they never saw anything like that and replaced the set - then 3 months later the same thing happened - they asked me if I hammer my rings or if I have a job that is hard on my hands - I'm a mortgage consultant - so we traded it in for a white gold setting with a band that looked similar to my old one that is now cracked - a jeweler told me it will eventually crack right thru. DO NOT SHOP AT WHITEHALL - when I returned with the second platinum set that had pitted -this time they told me I abused my rings but they would replace it for the white gold. All I want now is my money back - and no more trade ins - what do you think the chances of that is???
