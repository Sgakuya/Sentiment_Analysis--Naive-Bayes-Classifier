Terrible store. Employees goof off and talk with their friends instead of helping customers. I needed help in electronics section but I couldn't find anyone. I found a few teenage employees in the next department over, toys, who where fooling around with each other and told me to wait at the electronics counter and someone would be there soon. Nobody came and after 5 minutes i left. Maybe other Targets are better but the one by me is not worth going to.
