The Aphex Twin are one of my favorite techno artists. They have been in my collection for years. I like how they perform a different kind of techno from the mainstream in America today. They are much more electronic. They use very interesting songs and compile them very well. It sounds very European. They have a wide range of sound types. My favorite song is Boy and Girl.
