What is the big deal? A little patty on a biscuit with a small slice of cheese, and that... salad dressing, or whatever it is. I will say, it's amazing how such a small burger can create that much gas in your body. If you want to lose all your friends, eat two or three White Castle burgers and go on a long road trip.
