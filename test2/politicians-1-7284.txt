It is obvious that the Democrats are planning to continue this assault on the Bush presidency for years.Their chief trouble maker, Jesse Jackson, was back in his familiar pre-Clinton posture of promising expanded Civil Rights marches. He talked of tyranny, compared Bush to Milosevich, said his people have been victimized again, and on and on and on. Isn't their any law against public exaggeration and inciting riots. You would think Bush was going to exterminate a sector of society the way Jackson talks. Democrats need to do the responsible thing, and tell their supporter to tone down their rhetoric. It is not America's fault that Rainbow/PUSH and other Democratic special interest groups can not work with anyone but the Democrats.Get over it Jesse Jackson. Join the human race, and start caring about all people. Practice the tolerance you preach, even as it relates to Republicans
