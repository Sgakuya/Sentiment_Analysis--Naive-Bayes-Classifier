Like someone stated before, this is the best freshman album that I have ever heard. I dont think that its possible that he could top his album Emotional , but if he can you better believe that i will be the first one at the store to purchase it, just like I was this time. The album was released on my birthday, and what a wonderful birthday present it was. Carl Thomas has a soulful voice that no one else out there in the music industry can copy. He is totally worth the two cds that I purchased and the $65.00 that I spent on front row seats to his concert with R.Kelly in December. One Love Carl.
