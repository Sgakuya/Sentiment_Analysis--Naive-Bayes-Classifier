Absolutly the worst mayor ever. People who think this man is good because of the 9-11 thing are ignoring 99 percent of his political career. Crime has soared, and innocent people have been sent to jail more often than not. This man is a real piece of garbage. Why i shook his hand after Dinkins, before Rudy became mayor, I do not know. But i wish i would have spit in his face.
