This is Outkast's best album and argueably the best hip-hop album of all-time. Every song has a lot of heart behind it. The production on this album is excellent, and Big Boi and Andre are at their best on this one. I still have this album in my stereo and continually listen to it as it never gets boring; in fact, every new listen contains some kind of new element to it. This album is for everyone, not only hip-hop fans. That's just the kind of appeal that Outkast naturally carries.
