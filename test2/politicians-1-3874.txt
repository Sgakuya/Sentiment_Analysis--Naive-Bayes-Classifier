Was George W. Bush be using an earpiece during the Debates? To me and to several people I know, it seemed like GWB was pausing after each sentence in order to here information he was being fed by some kind of transmitter. He even bungled a certain response in such a manner as to increase such suspicions. Did anyone else notice this? Do you think that GWB was being prompted by the use of some kind of listening device?
