He brawls and gets away with a shortened suspension. Then too, he's arrogant, has a goofy baby-face, and only scores cause his team gets him the ball a lot. Lots of other players could score like that if they were given the ball. How many times has he produced in the playoff's biggest games? Zilch. The numbers speak for themselves. Get this guy out of the NBA before he ruins the league. Or stick him on the bench, whatever.
