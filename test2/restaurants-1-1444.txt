They opened around 100 or so of these crapholes in my city in the last few years. who go's to them, I do not know. Please, any comparisoms to the old-fashioned drive-inn restaurants are ridiculous. The service is horrible, you have to get the teenage workers to get off the picnic tables, where they're hanging with their boyfriends, just to carry your food to your car in a paper bag. Make sure you ask for condiments, God forbid the worker should have to make a 2nd trip. The food is standard fast-food fare, a step below McDonald's or BurgerKing.
