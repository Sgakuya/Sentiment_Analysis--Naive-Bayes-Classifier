Bought a wedding ring for my husband, with in 2 week one of the stones fell out, when I went to have it fixed they looked at me like we did something to it. They took the ring and made us wait 3 weeks while they were trying to figure out if they were going to fix it or not. Now we have it back and it's in a box, 1 year has passed and I opened the box and the 18K white gold ring is now very yellow. I don't want to return to the store in fear of the same service we had before. I will cut my loss and go someplace else.
