I am SO tired of hearing this man's name along side of Williams, Ruth, Musial, etc. From what I have researched of the man, and I have researched him, he was a slightly above average hitter with good speed. I would hardly rate him high enough to put him in the HOF. He's obviously there only because he broke the color barrier. To me, this is just plain wrong. Should we make a place in the Hall for the first Latino, or Japanese, or Canadian? I mean, it's all about being fair, isn't it? Latino's are clearly discriminated against in MLB even today. Where is their Jackie Robinson? The hypocracy of it all is appalling! If I want a lesson in race relations, I'll turn on a MLK speech. I want only the very best players in baseball's HOF.
