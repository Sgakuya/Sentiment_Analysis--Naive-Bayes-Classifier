Pat Buchanan is a big, loud, rude, arrogant, pompous ass. He is a pig face caucasian version of Al Sharpton. Buchanan is really more of a shock jock than a politician. His major claim to fame was being a member of Richard Nixons staff. Aside from being on the steering committee for the Titanic, I cant think of a worse credential.
