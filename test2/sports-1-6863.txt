This guy has never seen a hyped-up player he hasn't liked. Sorry Isaiah, just because Stephon Marbury, Jamal Crawford and a few others are stars doesn't mean they can win games. Marbury is an excellent PG that many say plays poor defense. The rest of these guys may also have good backgrounds, but the sad fact is that they can't win! Isaiah needs to start making moves that make a difference, instead of acting on his gut instinct and going after the first name in lights. I bet he gets the ax soon.
