Released in 1976, Boston's self-title debut release suffers the same problem as all Boston releases, namely an overly uniform sound; however, in the case of Boston, that sound is extremely unique and has never been duplicated (though many hope no one ever tries). Nevertheless, Boston is most likely the pinnacle of 1970's arena rock. This debut release includes most of the band's signature songs (except Don't Look Back and Amanda) which means (of course) More Than A Feeling, Peace Of Mind, Long Time, and Hitch A Ride. The layered sounds of guitarist Tom Scholz and vocalist Brad Delp are instantly recognizable, and the lyrics are non-confrontational. While Boston is admittedly dated, it remains an immortal guilty pleasure.
