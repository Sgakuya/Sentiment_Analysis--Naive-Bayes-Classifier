Josh is an extremely talented performer, a gifted singer and performs songs with depth and emotion - he is the best performer out there! ADDED: This CD was even better than the first, I especially love listening to them back to back. When I am truly stressed or unhappy, listening to this CD helps me deal with anything that comes along. The CD is refreshing, passionate, thrilling, filled with emotion and such a pleasure to listen to over and over and over again. I don't ever get tired or bored with it!
