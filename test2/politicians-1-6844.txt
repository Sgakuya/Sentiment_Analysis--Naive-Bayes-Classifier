It is a shame that we cannot give Massa Trent Lott a one way ticket back to his Mississippi plantation. This man is a big loser. He wished that Strom Thurmond was elected in '48' because minorities knew their rightful place. Anybody could see that....To those people who doubt that Massa Trent is a racist. I suggest you check at his record. i.e Massa Lott supported discrimination at Bob Jones University ....Update: It appears that Lott's apologies was a bogus. Massa Trent whines that his enemies are out to get him because he is a God-fearing Christian. Hahahha, this guy is too much.
