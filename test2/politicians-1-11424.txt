I don't trust ANY politician who doesn't trust ME, or any other honest, law-abiding citizen to own an assault-type rifle, or high capacity magazines to feed it. And anyone who says they believe that life begins at conception, but still thinks it's ok to kill off the unborn, is a freakin' idiot, and someone who just looks the other way while evil continues to flourish.
