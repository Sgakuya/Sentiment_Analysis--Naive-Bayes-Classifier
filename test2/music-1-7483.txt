C'mon guys! Was it groundbreaking? Influential? Historic? It's just Ricky. Teen girls shouldn't be allowed to vote on these things because of the breivity of their cultural addictions and the poor taste they have in them. Donnie Osmond and NKTOB would have been on top of this list in their time too because of the teenie boppers. And don't give me any crap about it. Ask your mothers and older sisters. You'll be embarrassed to say you voted for this by the time your 21. Get this junk off the top of the list.
