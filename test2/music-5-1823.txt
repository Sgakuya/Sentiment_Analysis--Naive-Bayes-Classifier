Warning is my favorite CD. I take it with me everywhere I go. In the car, in the office, and I play it at partys. This album is way different from any previous green day album. It has a lot of different genres. It sounds like punk, rock, pop, classic rock and everything between. If you want a band that kicks ass and gives out candy, green day is the band.
