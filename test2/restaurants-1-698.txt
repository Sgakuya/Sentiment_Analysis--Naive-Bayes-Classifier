I joined their new gimmick--free blizzard with the purchase on one, printed the coupon online, went to the local dairy queen in north bergen nj, and was told by jimmy (manager) sorry we don't accept this coupon, I stated it had his address on it and he had no explanation and walked away-(so did I)-- this is a cheap lowlife gimmick by corporate scum to suck $$ out of our pockets-- as for me never again dairy queen-dairy_queen_sucks@verizon.net--my new email address
