Abercrombie and Fitch bothers me...It's not the prices or the sizes. You can find clothing that is even pricier and possibly smaller at high-style boutiques around the world...and as someone who loves shopping in New York, believe me, this place is NOT classy, preppy, or elite! What gets me most about this store is that it seems to be one of the few clothing lines where you pay only for the brand name, not for the style, the quality, or the design that should be associated with it (and once was). Don't shop here!
