I ate there once and what I thought to be hair was wrapped around all the ribs I ordered. After talking to the manager I was told the BarBque brush had broke off in the sauce(gross) and that was the reason for the hair like stuff. I had to wait 20 more mins. for more food which was hard to eat. OH by the way still paid for hair and all.
