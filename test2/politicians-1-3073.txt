A sinful, slimy, skirt-chasing, lying weasel. His eight years almost ruined the country. The so-called great economy was smoke & mirrors. It started falling apart near the end of his term, just like Eron and the other corporate scandals eventually came to light. He weakened our military, the FBI & the CIA. Scandals were an everyday thing with this crooked, lying piece of crap. Will be remembered as one of the worst Presidents in history (unless his folks write the history).
