Wow. Reviewing concerts featuring artists you'd have to be paid to see. That's a unique way of spending one's time...might I suggest knitting as a hobby? For the record, I saw Clay Aiken in concert in 2004, and he puts on one of the most entertaining shows I've seen. It's unusual for a solo artist to not only acknowledge the talents of his back-up musicians and singers, but to feature them outright. Geniune talent and exceptional generosity...two things lacking in most entertainers these days.
