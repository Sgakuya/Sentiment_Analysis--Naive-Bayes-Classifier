I wasn't old enough to vote in 2000, but I woulda voted for him. That being said, I give him 1 star because he tried to steal the election Bush won fair and square. Electoral College is part of our Constitution, but Gore wanted us to ignore that in favor of the popular vote. Plus, Bush never would have carried on the way Gore did if he won the pop. vote and lost EC. Don't believe me? Look it up! Ann Coulter's book mentions a newspaper that ran an article saying Bush would concede if he won the pop. vote and lost EC. This was what people were expecting to happen in the weeks before the election.
