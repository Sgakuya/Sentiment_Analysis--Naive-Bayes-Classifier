after waiting 25 minutes for them to 'find' my car...they had actually rented it out, and told that I 'must' take the additional insurance to avoid having to pay for any damages...my car arrived without any gas in it, but being late for my appointment I left anyway and coasted in to my appointment. When I called Hertz to tell them that the car had run out gas, they told me that I would have to either go get the gas myself or pay for a tow truck!!! After getting the gas myself I had some time to kill before my next appointment and 'tried' to use the navigational system. Wow, was that stimulating...I punched in an address that I already knew how to get to but when the directions came up they were going to send me the opposite way to where I had entered. From talking with my coworkers (we have 'had' a corporate account with Hertz) this was not the first time that my company has encountered this type of customer service and problems. Do yourself a favor and rent from somewhere else!!!
