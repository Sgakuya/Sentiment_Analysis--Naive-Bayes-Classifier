I don't think the man's a murderer, but I do think he has used his name, money and influence more than once to stay out of trouble. In addition, I don't care for ANYONE who sticks to a strict party line politically. I don't think it's possible for a free thinking, normal human being to be completely liberal or completely conservative all the time on every issue. I don't trust anyone who claims to be.
