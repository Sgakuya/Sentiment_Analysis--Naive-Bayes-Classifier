Worst president in my lifetime (and that includes Nixon and Carter!!) You have to be a born again to like this loser b/c only a person with blind faith could ignore the bad decisions this bozo has made. Once the European Union surpases the US historians will look at W's presidency as the nail in the coffin. Could lead to the end of American democracy with his support of electronic voting machines. A dangerous destructive facsist.
