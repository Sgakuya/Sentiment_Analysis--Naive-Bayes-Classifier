I am a huge Auburn fan and I just don't understand what in the heck he is thinking so far this year. With all of the talent and depth that he has and he can't even score a touchdown. He obviously doesn't know how to adjust to what the other team is doing. I'll consider it a gift from heaven if we beat Vandy this weekend.
