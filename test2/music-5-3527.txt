I have worn out more copies of the Wall than any other album/cd... I've got the DVD, etc... Huge fan of the music. I dont think the movie (geldof!) does the music justice, but the animations are awesome. The music is good, but if you really get inside Pink, it's a trip you'll ride for years. Superb.
