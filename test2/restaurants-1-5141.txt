Here is how I would rate Appleebee: Decor-A. Service and Food-D. The Applebees near my school was terrible. My moronic waiter took a long time to give me my check and he didn't apologize for keeping me waiting. My chicken dish was very dry. I felt like I was eating a TV dinner at home. Not worth the hype!
