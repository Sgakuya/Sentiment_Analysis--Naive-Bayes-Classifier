I love this CD. I know it's considered Pop, but it's above and beyond anything I've heard so far. These boys, if I can call them that, have true talent, and they know exactly what they're doing. They have put a new face on pop music they've made a whole style, dirty Pop and it's a hit. I have a feeling they're going to be around for a long time, and that's a good thing. They have the potential to turn the music industry around. If they stick to the formula they're using, they're going to go places! and I truly believe that.
