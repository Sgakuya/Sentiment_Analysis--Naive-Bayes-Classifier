Here is another bluegrass gem from Alison Krauss and Union Station, always consistently excellent. The cd combines the most traditional of bluegrass tunes, such as The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn, with new pop-influenced, bluegrass-styled tunes ( The Lucky One, and New Favorite, written by Gillian Welch). As in any of the cd's with Union Station, this is certainly a collaborative effort among all group members, not just Alison. Dan Tyminski, along with great guitar work, turns in some excellent lead vocals, sounding just like an old-time bluegrass troubador. Ron Block (banjo and guitar and also a great songwriter), Jerry Douglas (dobro and steel guitar), and Barry Bales (bass) are all important factors here too. Of course, Alison Krauss herself is a shining star with her crystalline, soothing voice and phenomenal fiddle. She's a charmer and a wonder. As usual, this latest release from Alison Krauss and Union Station is a down-home, introspective, charming, warm and graceful work. And I hope their participation in the popular O Brother... soundtrack turns even more folks on to this talented bunch of musicians. I can't wait for their next concert to hear some of these great new tunes.
