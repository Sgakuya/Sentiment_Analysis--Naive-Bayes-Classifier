I have a lot of lost respect for Colin Powell, he was the lone voice of sanity in the Bush administration, advocating a position more in the middle rather then the fanatical far right. But, he laid down his arms and allowed himself to get whored out by this administration. He could be a great man, but he needs to stand up for what he believes in, not the master in the house.
