It is a wonder that this CD is even listed in the best current CDs. It is extremely annoying and I can't imagine having to listen to it several times. And Who Let The Dogs Out is the hit single, so that tells you how awful this CD is. This CD is even worse than Macy Gray's CD's and all of her CD's are awful. Just multiply the awfulness of her Cd's by 10 and you get this CD.
