A man who has escaped all blame in both the ENRON disaster, use of illegal gerrymandering in re-districting of state of Texas to turn the whole state republican, and despite many criminal practices, is still in elected office. Whow. Texas sure can be stupid sometimes. Politically-wise, he is the re-incarnation of Joseph McCarthy, but without the scare tactics...for now. Bad news is, most politicians are afraid of his threats to use pesticides and other chemicals if they don't bend his way. WMD anyone?
