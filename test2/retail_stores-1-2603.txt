First off food lion is not American owned anymore but ownen by a corp out of Belgium.second they discriminate against handicapped shoppers.third they put my food back up when I told the register girl who was black who was more interested in talking to the other black register clerk to wait while I went for bread & cheese my stuff was not on the conveyer,when I said something to the manager who was black he said it was not their responsibility to get gro for people this was after I said I was a bilaterial amputee,I believe that had I been black the sitituation would have been delt with differently.my wife witnessed the incident and I have contacted food lion and the north carolina Attorney Generals office.I plan to file a reverse racial discrimination lawsuit.
