I do not understand the appeal of this clothing brand AT ALL. Believe it or not, I didn't know anything about A F until very recently. Maybe because I've been out of school for a while... maybe because the high school I went to was a working class one. But I recently started going back to school (transfered to a top UC campus) and noticed that a large percentage of the student body proudly sport clothing adorned with the A F logo. I'm puzzled by the fact that many of the students who wear the brand are Asians. I mean, the company clearly idealizes the Aryan aesthetic. Considering how many minority customers they have, you would think they might use a person of color in some of their ads... but NOOO, almost all of their models are while, blonde, and blue eyed. Furthermore, I found some disturbing articles about the company's racist hiring policy. How can a minority with any self respect shop at a store like this? So obviously, the company is sleazy. But that's not the main reason why I don't shop there. The main reason is because I think their clothes are dorky and over priced. I mean, I don't know how these guys decked out in A F gear can possibly look in the mirror and think they look good. Big, goofy cargo pants and a dorky, faux vintage t-shirt of a made up sports team? That's the cool look now? I didn't know it was cool to look like a member of O-Town these days. Personally, I think their clothes are too silly looking. Well... I think they might be good for a preteen kid... but they just look goofy on anyone over 18. I mean, if you're over 18, you shouldn't be walking around in a bright orange sweatshirt with the words ABERCROMBIE 22 CITY CHAMPS written in HUGE letters. It's just lame... not only because it looks stupid, but because everyone knows that you paid $60 for it. To be fair, their clothes aren't any worse than Old Navy, American Eagle Outfitters, etc. But A F's crap comes with a considerably higher price tag... even if it's very similar stuff. You'd have to be an idiot to shop there. I think the majority of these A F billboards on my campus are freshmen. Most of the older students have developed their own sense of style. And I think that eventually, these freshmen will too. Eventually, they'll learn that not everyone looks good in the same clothes. And that just because something is expensive/trendy/brand name does not mean it will look good on you. Some of the coolest stuff in my wardrobe are stuff I picked up for a few bucks at thrift stores and bargain bins.
