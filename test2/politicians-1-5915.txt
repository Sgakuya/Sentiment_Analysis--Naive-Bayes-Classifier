The pride of the democratic party. Talk about operating under a different standard of ethics! The democrats have a gay pimp (Barney Frank), drunk driving killers (Ted Kennedy), oval office sodomite and repeat sexual harrasser (Bill Clinton) and a card carrying Klu Klux Klan member (this clown Robert Byrd) all in their party! But hell, as long as they follow the secular religion of liberalism they are A-OK! The hypocrisy is so thick you don't know whether to laugh or cry. Newt Gingrich made a mistake on his taxes from a 403a to a 403b deduction and wham-O ...he's out of a job. Trent Lott makes the stupid mistake of saying he's proud Mississippi voted for Strom Thurman in 1948 at his 100th birthday party as the guy was literally dying not realizing it was on a segregationalist platform and HE'S TOO out of a job! Liberals as long as they adhere to their public religion they can do whatever they feel up to and their liberal buddies will jump on board. It's shameless but I guess that's the point.
