I would give him 5 stars if I was voting on selfishness, propoganda, division and lack of reason. But other than that he's a piece of HIT (with a capital S) who doesn't care about his own people, only attacking groups that have money for the sake of his wallet and publicity. BTW ... Mr. Jackson, where DID all of your money come from? I would seriously love to see your tax statement. Hey Jackson! High fives on keeping the masses occupied.
