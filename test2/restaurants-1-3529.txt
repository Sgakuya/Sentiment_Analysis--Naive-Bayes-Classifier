Donato's Pizza is absolutely HORRID! The sauce was so bland and devoid of taste, and reminded me of that cheap tomato sauce that comes in a can. Their cheese didn't taste too fresh as well. Most 'NY style' mom and pop type pizzeras blow Donato's away ten times over! If you know what good tasting pizza is, stay away from Donato's. One of the worst tasting pizzas ever!
