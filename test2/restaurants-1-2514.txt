Terrible stuff, and it's like a ubiquitous nightmare. Even in the Andes or the steppes of Siberia, you can't escape McDonald's or Coke (or Burger King and Pepsi). And I'm as guilty as anyone of eating it, although not because of any overwhelming compulsion or urge. Sometimes, I'll find myself on the NY Thruway, or Rt. 95 towards Boston, at 3pm or so, not having eaten anything all day, and the only thing qualifying as a restaurant that you'll find readily accessible is McDonald's. I always feel awful afterwards, like I've opened up my veins and poured spackle directly into my heart. I remember working for them for about a month as a teenager and feeling like an indentured servant. Slave wages, horrific working conditions and exploitation of the young, dangerous and tasteless food, constant mind-numbing advertising...now I understand why it's so popular!
