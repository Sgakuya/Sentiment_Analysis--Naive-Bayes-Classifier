what really bugs me out is that people are too quick to judge this album, they listen to one song on it that they don't like and immediately say the whole album is crap! I personally have taken the time to listen to it thoroughly and I give it a 5. I think that the song Toilet Tisha is one of the best because it is getting a message across to young mothers out there that you are not alone! it sort of reminds me of Brenda's got a baby by Tupac (R.I.P)
