I can't believe this album is number one on the list--ridiculous. I mean, I admit that Stevie was pretty damn sexy in the 70s, but that does not change the fact that this band sucks. For crying out loud, these guys are almost on the same level as another group of 70s rejects: The Bee Gees. Ridiculous!
