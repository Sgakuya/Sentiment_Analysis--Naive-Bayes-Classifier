As a Texan, I feel the need to warn y'all that things over here ain't peachy - we have the highest pollution, the lowest family insurance coverage in the country, and dammit, Austin just hasn't been as much fun since Georgie moved here. So, George - you want things in our country to be like they were in good ol' Midland, Tx., huh? You mean segregated? Well, I can't say your work is cut out for you in that area, buddy. Still, if Nader splits the Dem vote like everyone says, all of us activists will have job security. Follow your hearts - it makes things more interesting.
