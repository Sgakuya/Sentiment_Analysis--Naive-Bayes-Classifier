Never again! I bought an Airlink print server, a case fan and a Coke this week at Fry's. The print server did not work. The case fan had defective screw holes so it could not be screwed onto the case. Then the Coke... figure that can't be a problem, right? Well, the cashier, out of frustration with her register, she started shaking my coke bottle around in front of me!!! I yelled at her to stop shaking my Coke cause I'm about to drink it and she just rolled her eyes at me! The trip back to return the two items was not a great one, either. Apparently, it takes five Fry's employees to credit back a refund. A customer service associate to punch in the details into her computer, then her supervisor to approve... then I'm sent to to cashiers' line to process my credit card! Then the cashier punches the info all over again on her computer, calls not one but two supervisors to approve the transaction! What a waste of time and money! I am never ever going back to Fry's again!
