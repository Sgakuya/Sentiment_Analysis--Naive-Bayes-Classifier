It is unfortunate that the quality of the merchandise is offensive, stone quality is poor and the employees lack any motivation. However, if the customer can't afford real jewelry and are upset at the thought of wearing plated costume ..I GUESS Finlay's junk is the next best thing. Avoid this crap - but if you don't know... you get what you pay for!
