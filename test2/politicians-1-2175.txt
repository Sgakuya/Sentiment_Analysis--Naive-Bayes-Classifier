This loser better resign, he has wrecked Illinois State Police and any other police/fire/school district you can think of! We presented a way that a car company (disclosed) wanted to lease cars for one dollar and then trade them in for new ones reather than have 203,000 thousand miles on a car! He said NO! Also, now the cars in some of the districts are so old they have to weld metal plates on the car so they don't fall apart. ALSO, they make it so in some districts you have to call long distance to get ahold of a local police officer even if you live a mile away! HOW PATHATIC IS THIS GUY! GIVE TAX CUTS AND STRAIGHTEN OUT THE BUDGET ROD BLAGOBITCH!
