This is my favourite Green Day album ever! The reason I think it tops the other albums is because this displayed a more mature Green Day, less punkish, which I really like! Besides all songs in this album are total hits! You gotta like every song that's in it. Unlike the previous albums who had 2 or 3 extreme hits and the rest were just fillers... Great Work!!!
