I am a 14 black female and i think Bush should not be president. He is prejudice and if he's president imagine how life and our future is going to be for black Americans. Can't you people see? Look what he let happen in Texas when he was governor, Why would you want someone who let that happen to a state run your country? I know he said he was going to do good things but some are just lies. So i hope Al Gore becomes president!
