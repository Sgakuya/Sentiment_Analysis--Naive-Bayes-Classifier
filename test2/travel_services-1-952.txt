It has been almost a year since Bekins moved my wife and me from Denver to Boston. Our shipment was late--5 days past the last day in the delivery window and some of the items were damaged. We filed a claim in September 2000, but it was not until February 2001 that Bekins offered us a settlement. Now it's August 2001 and we're still waiting for the money they owe us. It is impossible to reach anyone at their main office and they do not respond to messages or letters. Use Bekins at your own risk. We learned the hard way and will not use them again.
