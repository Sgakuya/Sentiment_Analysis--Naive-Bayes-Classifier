Great stats, to be sure. But when it COUNTS...he is no where to be seen. The NFL and the Colts should have seen it coming. Great collage quarterback, but could not win a title. U of T wins the NCAA title THE YEAR AFTER he graduates with, of all people, Tee Martin. In other words, the team had the tools to win with Manning, but did NOT have a leader or winner with Manning at the helm. This type of play has carried over to the NFL...lots of yards, lots of touchdowns, folds when the going gets tough. What REALLY gets me though, is that the media has annointed him a Football God, and the Colts have given him obscene millions of dollars...to a guy, who in the end, is simply a loser.
