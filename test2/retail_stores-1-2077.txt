Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever had. Took a T.V. in for repair & was told 7 to 10 days until pick-up, but wasn't ready for almost 30! Each time I phoned about the status of my set I got a different apathetic response ranging from We can't find any info on your repair(even though I gave them the claim ID they had issued) to The part is on order, it will be ready in a few days. I was actually told no repairman had looked at my set, when just a week prior they had informed me it had been checked out & was in line for service. This seems a bit odd for a business who does all repairs at the STORE. Not ONE associate I spoke with offered to solve the discrepancy in their files concerning the repair or call me back, that is, until I took names & asked to speak to the manager. Just be prepared to exercise your junior private investigation skills when dealing with this company. Finally, after a month of nonsense I was charged $140(that's labor only!) to replace a solitary fuse. Caveat emptor! Buh-bye CC!
