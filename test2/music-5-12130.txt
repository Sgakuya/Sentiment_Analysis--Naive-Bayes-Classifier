I am a huge fan of Shani and Concrete Rose is her best cd yet. I hope that she keeps up the good work. I like all the songs on her cd. I can relate to some of the songs for example Freedom. I can definitely say that she is talented and a great actress. People should give her a chance and not criticize her. She is my role model. Holla
