Axlrod2003 is exactly right about the racist thing. I heard this on the radio last night. Abercrombie is apparently now featuring a racially offensive T-shirt targeting Chinese people. When questioned about it they stated that they make fun of everyone as if to suggest that it s okay as long as they don t leave out any specific group or minority. Well, guess what Abercrombie IT S NOT OKAY! It s ugly and hateful and certainly something we do not need to be cavalier about especially considering the problems in the world today. I say boycott, boycott, boycott you re sorry store!
