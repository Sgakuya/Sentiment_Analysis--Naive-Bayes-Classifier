BE WARNED BEST BUY CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS.... I went in to ask about a printer for my wife to prints photos. I asked the sales person about archival quality printers. He had no idea what I was talking about and after I educated him as to why the ink was important so the prints will not fade he said they didn't have any. As I was walking out the door I found a floor stack of 30 printers with a 60 year archival rating right on the SIDE OF THE BOX! After we owned the printer for three weeks it quit working. I took it back to have them exchange it. ALL of Best's competition will exchange items within 30-60 days. They DID NOTHING! They would not even ship it to the manufaturer as ALL the competition will.
