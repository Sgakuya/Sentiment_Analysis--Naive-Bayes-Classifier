Pull my Chain is an excellent cd. Toby just keeps getting better and better. I'm just talkin about tonight and I wanna talk about me were both No.1 on GAC. The next song on the cd is I can't take you anywhere This song is the kind that stays in your head. Tryin to matter is a deep song about giving love one last chance. Pull my chain rocks and the drum rolls are awesome. This is one of my favorites. The Sha la la song is the reversal of How do you like me now . Pick'em up and lay'em down was written by Kenny Loggins but, Toby nails it when he sings it. I can't imagine hearing Dave Loggins sing it.The next couple songs Forever hasn't got here yet and 'Yesterday's rain are both love songs My List was also a hit on GAC.The last song(other than the bonus track) You didn't have as much to lose is a slow song but, if you really listens to the words it's a beautiful song.It's written by Toby and Chuck Cannon.Bonus Track Gimme 8 seconds totally rocks and has got some awesome guitars! Toby at his finest, at least til the next release!
