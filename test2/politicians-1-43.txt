Recently Prince Harry dressed as a Nazi at a empire costume party (at a sensitive time of Holocaust remembrance). The reason I give him 1 star, instead of 3 for just being ignorant about the matter, is because after the uproar he never offered a satisfactory apology. He did one of those I'm-sorry-if-anyone-was-offended things, which really blames the victim by accusing them of being oversensitive instead of saying he was sorry for making light of genocide.
