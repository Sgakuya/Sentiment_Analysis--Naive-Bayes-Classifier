Bloody FANTASTIC! I didn't even know the songs on this album when I bought it, I got it on advice from a coworker and other people who raved about it. The *FIRST* time I listened to it I loved it, it didn't even have to grow on me like most albums do... I listen to it repeatedly. Favourite track is Shiver ... WOW!
