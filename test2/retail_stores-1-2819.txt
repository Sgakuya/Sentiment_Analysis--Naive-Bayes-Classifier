Christmas present, Movado watch. Whitehall in Fort Worth TX. will not stand behind a Movado watch they sold that was not running. When Christmas came and the watch present was unwrapped we noticed that it did not run. We've been back to Whitehalls on four occasions with NO satisfaction. We weare told: "All sales are final", "it is the responsibility of the buyer to notice that the watch was not running" and "Movado has a good warranty program, just deal with them". This is out and out FRAUD! The onus is on the SELLER (not the buyer) to make sure they are selling an operational product!
