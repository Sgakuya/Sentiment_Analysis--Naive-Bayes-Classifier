You know what Chelly, up yours. I think that you are an egotistical, PREJUDICE, judging by that gay comment about Darren Hayes's voice, and you are insensitive to other people's feelings. Yes, you have the right to speak your mind, but do it in a HELPFUL way. Many people are very interested in Savage Garden. I am one of them. I think that their music is very expressive. I think that Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones both have very precise and specific views on the world and life and virtue. I think that they have blessed us with their melodious and unique, individual sound. I think they are a very good pair, music wise - being that Darren has a beautful metaphorical vocabulary and the voice of an angel and Daniel has the ability to write a tune that can fit perfectly with the lyrics. As for needing to get a life because Darren's gay - firstly, how does a person SOUND gay? A man that sounds feminine and vice versa, is just a man that sounds feminine and vice versa. And secondly, if you have something against gay people, YOU need to get a life. You just got told by a 12 year old.
