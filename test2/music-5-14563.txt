The Bee Gees contributions to this album have received praise from all spectrums of the music world. From Alice Cooper to George Martin to Tim Rice. Visit www.beegees.dk/regular.htm#newsingle to hear their new single This Is Where I Came In . It's nothing like you've heard from the Bee Gees before. I'd give THAT song 5 stars.
