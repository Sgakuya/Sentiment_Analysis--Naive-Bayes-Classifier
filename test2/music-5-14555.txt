Over the years I've heard the entire collection of disco reeks remarks but the fact remains - historically, disco was a legitimately red hot dance craze once upon a time. (Hey, I never listened to rap either but still see the hypnotic rhythmic attraction others might have for it.) The problem is that it was so over the top and off the main road that people had fun with it for a while but got tired of it REALLY fast. I'll shamelessly admit that, for about 5 minutes of my youth, I enjoyed dancing to this thumpty thump stuff and NOBODY did it better than the Bee Gees on this album. In years to come music history classes will no doubt refer to the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack as the collection of songs that best sums up this short lived, fairly screwy but enjoyable era in dance and questionable clothing styles.
