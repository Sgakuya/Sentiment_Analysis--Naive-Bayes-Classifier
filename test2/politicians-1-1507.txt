I think Day's plan for National Defense was to erect a huge prayer shield around the country. (a) That would never work, and (b) Pray on your own time, pal, don't waste mine. I was actually glad when Stockwell was the leader of the Alliance, because he was such a lunatic that no one outside of Alberta would listen to him. Now that they have gotten rid of him, the way is paved for some slick, photogenic, reasonable-sounding shyster to bring the Alliance's Nazi ideology to the rest of Canada. It is no coincidence that Stockwell's hometown (near Red Deer) is the centre of white supremacist hate in Canada.
