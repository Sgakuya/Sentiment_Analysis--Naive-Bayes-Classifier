beautifulGarbage, the band's third album is the most creative offering yet from them. Many will abhor it for its poppy overtones, but these are the same people that will fail to listen closer. There is still, as is a trademark of Garbage, so much going on in each song. The lyrics are decidedly less dark than previous offerings from Shirley Manson, but she explores her vocal range like never before on such tracks as 'can't cry these tears' and 'silence is golden'. If you do not enjoy it thoroughly the first time, then listen again. This is beautiful, to say the very, very least!
