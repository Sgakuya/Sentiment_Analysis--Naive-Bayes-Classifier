Prince Charles has brought disgrace and embarrassment to the Monarchy. He obviously is not cut out to be King, and I hope that when Queen Elizabeth dies, the crown passes to Prince William. Not only does Prince Charles lack class, he lacks taste. How could anyone prefer that horse-faced, chain-smoking Camilla whatever her name is to the beautiful Diana?
