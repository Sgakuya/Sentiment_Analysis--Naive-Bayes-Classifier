Nobody (and I repeat nobody) does live music better. It's great to see Springsteen back with the E Street Band; just as it was meant to be. His shows are still longer than any other rock act around (and he's 50!!). It's too bad that the 1999-2000 tour is coming to a close in July. I think he should tour the world again!
