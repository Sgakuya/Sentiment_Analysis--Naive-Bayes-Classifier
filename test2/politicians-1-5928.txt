Now, nothing more than a drunken blowhard that is reelected by his home state only because of the Kennedy legacy that preceded him. JFK didn't think he would amount to much but it's good that JFK wasn't around to endure what he has done to the Kennedy name. Maybe if he was a success like his two brothers he would have suffered the same fate. It was like Teddy was the only one that had control over his fate and just made a mess of it, while the rest had to go down in terrible tragedies that they had no control over.
