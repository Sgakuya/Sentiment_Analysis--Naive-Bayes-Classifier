OK - truth about Pig Stands. I only tried, yes - tried to eat there once. I had some kind of pork slop sandwich in some watery, vinegary sauce. It had a nasty after taste. I didn't even finish it. I can understand the 24/7, ambience, slice of SA vibe, but it's just plain nasty. Maybe it's supposed to be.
