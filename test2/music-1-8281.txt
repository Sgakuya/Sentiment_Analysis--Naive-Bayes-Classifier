So, if I understand this correctly, if a hip-pop video is deemed good if the glitter from all the gold, diamonds, platinum and cheap camera work maximizes the viewer's likelihood of having an epileptic fit while simultaneously boring them to death with far-below-average talent, then this video pays off in spades. However, if there's still anyone out there who gives a sh!t about talent and creativity, this video works about as well as a screen door on a submarine. Yet another shining example of the mass-produced trash designed to keep the public fat, stupid, and happy.
