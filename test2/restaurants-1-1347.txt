I tried the green salad today and my, was it bad. Nothing but white pieces of iceberg lettuce. I had asked at the speaker area (I drove through the drive through) if there were tomatoes in it and this is really sad---two, very thin half slices with part of the core in it and the pieces weren't even red. I drove home without looking at my order which I'm afraid, can't ever be done again. The green salad should be tossed straight into the garbage.
