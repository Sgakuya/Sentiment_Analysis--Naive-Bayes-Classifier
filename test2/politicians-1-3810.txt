H - E - L - L - O-, Excuse me but is it me or is America full of MORONS???? I am an 18 year old female high school student and I voted for Al Gore and eventhough, I live in Texas, George W. Bush has not done S*** for this state. He takes credit for our academic achievements, but our success has nothing to do with him. You cannot live life by daddy's name, exhibiting a poor performance in school and the military (National Guard), and a questionable performance in the business world, trading SAMMY SOSA and telling extreme fabrications about your current pathetic political career. Not only does he not have the knowledge, intelligence and experience to be a PRESIDENT, but he lacks sincerity about the position he is applying for. Before the electoral college and popular votes were announced, he was cool, calm, collected and quite conceited about is title he would win. If he does not win he would be able to say, Daddy, I tried , but Al Gore is dedicated and is passionate about becoming the President of the GREATEST country in the world. I am not praising the Clinton-Gore Administration, because they were Not even close to perfect, but I would rather trust my government with an experienced canidate. Al Gore has not only been Senator, but Vice-President for 8 years, give him a chance to prove he was Clinton's better half. Think about it!!! Do not ELECT A MORON. Clinton has already embarassed us enough. Examine the issues at stake, health care, tax cuts, education and abortion. I would rather continue the peace time prosperity we've experienced in the past 8 years, then revert back to the phenomenal Republican rule we experienced with Regan and Bush,Sr.
