At first I didn't like You've come a long way baby by Fatboy Slim. I'd heard the singles on the radio and I thought it was pretty much hype. Reluctantly I borrowed a friend's copy and was instantly hooked. Next to Paul Oakenfold, he is the world's best DJ, and his mixes are outrageous. I went out and bought his whole collection.
