Al Gore is correct for wanting a recount in Florida, but strange how he doesn't mention any other state that has had many errors in its voting process. Being the arrogant prick that he is, he only wants a recount where it matters. The point- if you recount votes in one state, you have to recount votes in all the states, not just where you want it, Al.
