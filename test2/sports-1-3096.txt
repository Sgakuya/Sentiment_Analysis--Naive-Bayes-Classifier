He wasn't any kind of hero. He beat up an old negro woman once, and probably pistol-whipped a man to death in an alley. Even though he was filthy rich (he was one of the first investors in Coca-Cola) he was notoriously cheap, often stealing towels and sheets from hotels to send back to his Georgia estate. He used to deride Babe Ruth and his ilk for only hitting home runs, but that was just because he had no power of his own. He was so successful on the basepaths because opposing players were terrified of getting in the way of his cleats, which he'd sharpen down to razor points. So he had a lot of singles and stolen bases. Big friggin' deal. A hateful and violent man who turned a wonderful game into a war zone. A complete a$$hole.
