We flew several time with Cathay Pacific and members of Marco Polo Club. Boy were we stupid! Cathay Pacific service has gone from bad to really hopeless! Their reservation service staff has an outrageous bad attitude & their economy seats are one of the smallest out there in the airline industry. I have just cut up my Marco Polo Club Card and to hell with Cathay Pacific. Good riddance!
