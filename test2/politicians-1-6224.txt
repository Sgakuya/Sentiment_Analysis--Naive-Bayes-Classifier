Anti-religion, baby-killing, consitutional rights violator. I just can't say enough bad things about her. (okay, the baby killing is by proxy...but she is ultimately responsible for the actions of her subordinates) ADDENDUM: Having read a few vast right wing conspiracy comments, I have to add something that is about as left wing as you can get. Why didn't Janet Reno pursue any of the THOUSANDS of criminals denied the purchase of a firearm by the NICS system? It is a FEDERAL CRIME to attempt to buy a firearm if you have a felony record. They are proud to show the stats of how many people were turned away, but WHY DIDN'T SHE PROSECUTE THEM? Once again, laws are enacted and not enforced. AND IT WAS HER JOB TO ENFORCE THEM.
