Any soundtrack list must start with Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Grease (1978). A double album when it was originally released on vinyl, this soundtrack includes so many classics that are still played today (eg Grease, Summer Nights, and You're The One That I Want). The sound of this soundtrack was a very effective merger of 1950's retro rockabilly and doo-wop with the then contemporary disco sounds (especially in the title song written by Barry Gibb). Even with these gems, my personal favorite remains the third side which was dedicated to Sha Na Na and their pure period 50's style (eg covers of Blue Moon, Hound Dog, and Born To Hand Jive). Throw in contributions by Frankie Valli (who sings the title song) and Frankie Avalon (Beauty School Dropout), and one has a undeniable winner. As other comments have noted, a few songs do not stand alone without the movie very well (eg Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee), but these are the exceptions rather than the rule. The bottom line is that when the other soundtracks are being disposed of at the next garage sale, people will still be buying Grease.
