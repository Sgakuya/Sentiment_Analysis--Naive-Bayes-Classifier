They are a good example of settling for less.It just goes to show you how the current music scene has reached the lowest denometer. When people can say 2 girls playin banjos n 1 fat chick with a whinnin voice is great its time to recognize.After seein Fatalie on TV poutin n whippin her tears n sayin Im not sorry is pretty sad.The only thing she cares about is gettin to the All U Can Eat rest. Its soo lame n weak. Speak your mind but dont cry like a big baby who wants her bottle. Forget it I think if anyone should be embarressed its Americans for her uninformed opinion.She needs to spend more time on the treadmill,tryin to drop that lard she's wrapped in.
