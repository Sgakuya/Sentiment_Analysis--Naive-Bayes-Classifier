One of the dimmest bulbs to be lit in the White House in modern times. Unlike Harding, who was humble about his incapacity, Bush is singular in his arrogance, and insists on alienating the world with his agenda of military and economic domination. I'm appalled that a man of such limited talent and capacity could have become president at all, but then he DID get the five votes that counted.
