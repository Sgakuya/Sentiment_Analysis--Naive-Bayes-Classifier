The video is boring. The background music is bland. Kroeger and Scott cannot keep themselves out of it. And it features one of the all-time worst vocal performances I have ever heard (as if ONE Pearl Jam wannabe isn't bad enough, I get two, in the same song, in unison, singing a cappella!) But if one entirely ignores the song, here's what we get: footage of two idiots standing on a tall building, and some slips from a movie. YAWN. Music videos of this type should be banned.
