Ha, absolutly got his head knocked loose by a smaller more skinny, yet quicker Doug Christie. You L.A. Ladies fans need to remember one thing all bad NBA rivalries eventually have a brawel to them. Look at New York and Miami. I guarantee you southern loosers that little event in pre season of play a year and a half ago won't be the last physicall confrontation between these two teams. Yeah I heard all Shaq'talk about us being the Queens, and his little jabs at Mike Bibby and Dougs wife. And Phil Jackasses comments about Sacramento. Here's a hint for you L.A. Ladies fans. You guys talked the talk with your violent nature. But when it became more than a good mannered sport and hatred flooded and violent talk became physicall, you guys done got yo asses stomped. Oh think Shaq being in there would have made a differance. I don't see why he got his over logeaged ass kicked By Barkley and Oakley when they play. Okay so we never won a playoff series against you guys. LoL, that's a bunch of bull. But okay we have never won on paper. Even the the Spurs beat you in two series we were still your biggest threats during your so called championship years. Ha! You Ladies disgust me. I would have rated Fox at a 0. But evidently shit doesn't even rank that low on this sight. LOL. GO KINGS, DIE LAKERS.
