I live in Wisconsin and, quite honestly, livingm among the Packers and Packer fans, the fans are arrogant and conceited about their team, considering themselves holier and more rightrous and deserving than ordinary NFL teams and the team itself is consistently one of the fattest, slowest, most lack-luster teams in the league. Brett Favre makes them go, when he is gone, so are they.
