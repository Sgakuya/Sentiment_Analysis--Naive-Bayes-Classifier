Worst president of my lifetime. Clinton looks almost ethical by comparison. Expanded pointless Vietnam War to prove he was tough. Ignored advice of generals and picked bombing targets himself. Stole his first congressional election in Texas. Helped Kennedy steal Presidential election in Texas then covered up facts surrounding Kennedy shooting (in Texas.) Covered up facts surrounding Robert Kennedy Assassination (1968). Covered up facts surrounding Martin Luther King Assassination (1968). As for LBJ's womanizing, not even Janet Reno would be safe around this guy. No woman dared swim in the same pool with him. (He liked to pinch them.) Only bright spot on his record (civil rights legislation) was actually started under Kennedy. LBJ was a vulgar power-hungry man whose primary legacy was the Vietnam War.
