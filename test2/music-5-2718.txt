This is one of my Favorite albums of all time. Unlike so much of the C.D's being released you can actully listen to all the songs without skipping any. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band {and reprise} is a great song. The way Ringo sang With A Little Help From My Friends was perfect {oooh, that guy made me melt}. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and A Day in the Life are some of John's greatest works. I love Getting Better and Good Morning Good Morning. So what if I wasn't born when it was released. I can't say enough about the cover. This is a great album to scream the words out in back of a pickup truck.
