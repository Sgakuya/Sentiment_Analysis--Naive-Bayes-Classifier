Y'all are all nuts. Near Wild Heaven and Belong are two wonderful songs. Why don't any of you appreciate them?! And Low ---ohhhh, is this what falling in love feels like??? Oh, yeah, Losing my Religion and Shiny Happy People are fine too. Well, maybe better than fine. This is up there on my list of good albums with A Night at the Opera and Who's Next . R.E.M is a great group! However, this CD is not quite as good as Automatic . (By the way, automatic for the people is the slogan of a food plant in Georgia---that's where they got the name!) Well, Out of Time is terrific. No need to say more.
