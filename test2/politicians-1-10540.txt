Why? Why?? Didn't people learn their lesson with Reagen? And Bush I?? The Republican Party no longer represents middle-of-the-road conservative America. It supports the richest 1% of Americans who made their millions by crushing the working class. When are people going to realize this and demand new political representatives for this party? Bush Jr. is a prime example of this kind of thinking. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he was kept out of combat in Vietnam like so many other modern Republican politician by his father. After flunking out of several colleges because of a lack of committment with to his studies, not to mention drug problems, he married a librarian and fathered two girls who have lived up to their father's legacy perfectly. Once again, his own father's influence came in handy when he ran for Governor of his home state of Texas, after which, he was given the Oval Office seat by several Supreme Court Justices, and Katherine Harris. And now what has he done for us? The economy is in shambles, he's started a war in Afghanistan that he has yet to finish, and now he's wanting to start another. FINISH WHAT YOU VE STARTED!! The Bushes are going to go down in the history books for BOTH starting wars in Iraq that went unfinished. What kind of legacy is that?? And don't get me started on what they're doing to out Social Security. Right now, I'm just 18, so I have time to save some money for retirement, since the Republicans are going to gamble away my Social Security. So I get $5000 when my grandmother dies, and what do I do? Why, invest it in a stock market fund, of course. Clinton is in the White House, we have a great economic structure- what's this?? Oh no! Another Republican. There goes my $5000. I should have done like I wanted and kept it in the bank. So you see, we need more semi-conservative representation in the government, because the Republican Party is defunct. Bush II- Even worse than his dad thus far. Elect him again, and we'll have repeat of the Don't give a damn. 1980's. God help America.
