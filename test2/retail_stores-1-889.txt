Hey, want to pay more for less and be guaranteed that whatever it is will stretch out of shape or fall apart after the second wash? Well, the next time you see a Lane Bryant store be sure to stop in. And what is it with the horizontal stripes on large sizes - always a great choice if you want to pass up chubby and go directly to rotund. This store has managed to look more upscale than it once was, but they just don't have the quality you pay for.
