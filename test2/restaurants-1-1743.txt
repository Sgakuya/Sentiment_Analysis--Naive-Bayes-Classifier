Used to make their meat and beans in store as well as in-store vegetable prep.. It's all trucked in and prepackaged now,,no telling from where. [Hellooo MAd Cow!!!] Can you say "mechanically seperated spinal meat?" If you're hungry and don't mind tacos with exactly one shred of tasteless "cheese" on them, and don't want to spend a lot, eat here. They're very consistent in the product. Mex version of McD. They've cut WAY back on portions in recent years. Is your hunger really worth this?
