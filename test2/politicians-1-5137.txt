I would never have believed that you could be such a hypocrit. If you were concerned about all the votes being counted, there are 49 other states and more than half of Florida that you would have included. How disgusting to stand before the public and say It is not about winning when everybody knows that is all you care about. What you are doing is a disgrace and it is truly pathetic that you are continuing. You pat yourself on the back for reinventing the government. Try talking to some of the government workers who have had a difficult time working with the mess you have helped create. You have given early out ($25,000) to a lot of employees and then hired some of them back as consultants for a bigger salary. You have also made a grand slam mess out of the government offrices. There are also a lot more higher grade jobs in some agencies. No credit for a good job is due. For heavens sake - GIVE IT UP. You lost, accept it. If you do manage to cheat George Bush out of this election, every time you stand before the public you will know that you are despised for what you have done. Ellen Messer, Oakland, TN.
