You just about have to beat me to get me into a Wal-Mart store. My gosh, what a pathetic and depressing place to be. Every time I have ever been in our local store, I can never seem to find what I am looking for or if I find where it is supposed to be they are out of stock. The people that work there aren t any help and the lines are ridiculously long as hundreds of people try to get through the 3 out of 24 registers that are open. To top off the foot traffic they pull all their trash off the shelf that hasn t sold in the past year and cram it all up front in clearance racks and broken buggies, that s right, by the registers that are not open. Now all the people that are not in line can mingle amongst the ones that are and look at junk no one is ever going to buy. The bathrooms are filthy, and no, I do not want one of those stupid yellow smiley faces on my kids or me. And heaven forbid you actually find what you are looking for and it happens to be locked in one of those class cases. You know the ones, those cases that require the key from the guy is never around but responsible for the department or the gee I m sorry he just went to lunch guy. Nope I m sorry, the only time I go to Wal-Mart is when I m in a really good mood and have no right to be. So, I go in there and come back out ill and grouchy just to put life back in order again.
