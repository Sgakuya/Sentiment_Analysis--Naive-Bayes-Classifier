I'm sad to see so many people don't like this album. But then I am happy to see that us true dedicated fans have so many good things to say about them, because they r the best. Hanson is one of the hardest working bands around. They work there butts off to get where they are. I think they deseve a lot more credit. Hanson unlike Nsync and BSB write their own music. They don't steal other peoples songs. They deserve A LOT more respect than they are getting. Hanson is #1 4ever!
