If Dan Marino is so good then why did he lose to Cool Joe. If you are truly great you succeded no matter the circumstance. At the end of the day you just gotta count the rings. For Marino thats ZERO. You count Joe's Rings, thats four and you say Wow, thats the best quarterback EVER! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
