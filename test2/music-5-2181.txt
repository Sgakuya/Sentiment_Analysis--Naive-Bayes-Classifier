This is the problem with people. They don't give artists time to develop. Oasis rippin off the beatles is a lazy comparison. They don't sound like the beatles but it's the easiest thing to say for lack of experience. This is album you have to think was writtin durin 3 divorces,2 guitarists leaving, quiting drugs, 2 kids and many other things. This album is not there best effort but non the less an Oasis classic.
