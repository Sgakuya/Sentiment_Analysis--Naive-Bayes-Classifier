The last time I went to a Friday's, the place was a complete mess (dirty tables everywhere) and even the management seemed to be no older than 20. Just heat up their frozen food in your oven - that'll give you the Friday's experience, especially if you let it sit and get cold for awhile and then drop the plate on the way to your table.
