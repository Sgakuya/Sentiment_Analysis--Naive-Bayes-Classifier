Get ready to 'think' and be 'angry'. George Bush is a stupid Stupid STUPID white man, a prejudice bigot and an enemy of America. He is a typical spoiled white man who has spent his entire life on his daddy's lap. He has made three oil companies bankrupt, kept the ugly state of Texas filled with lethal injections, traded Sammy Sosa during his involvement with the Texas Rangers. He is weak, and his wife (that looks like Marion Ross from Happy Days) stands along side him as the obedient librarian. It is time for Bush to be thrown out of the White House, literally, picked up and thrown out never to return. Bush has put a for sale sign on the White House lawn, going price two million dollars. Bush's policy 'keep the rich richer the poor poorer'. His mentality Bomb! Kill! Bomb! Kill! Bomb! Kill! Invade! 48 hours to leave Iraq! Yeah! We killed his sons! Bomb! Kill! Bomb! Kill! America! Live Free or DIE! Bomb! Kill! The American Way! Number One! We did it first! We dropped atomic bombs first! We walked on the moon first! We turned all of our people gay first!' Bush is a hypocrite and a religious fanatic. Christ is NOT the son of god. Israelis are NOT the chosen people. Palestinians have no land promised to them from god. Allah is not great. Guess what, Christianity, Judaism, and Muslim is are all WRONG. Three false faiths, read the Holy Koran(Chapter Nine verse 1 through 11, pay attention to verse 14), The Holy Bible Revelations Chapter 11 verses 4, 5, and 9. Also read Edgar Cayce, Nostradamus, Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, and Micheal Moore's Downsize This and Stupid White Men (also see his movie's Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine -the movie the Bush Administration doesn't want you to see). Bush represents bigotry, anti-American mentality, lies, fixed elections, the ugly state of Texas filled with depleting oil wells, flat uninhabitable land, tumbleweeds, belt buckles, slaughter houses, hypocritical wannabe cowboys, child molestation cases, and the largest product in America guns, Guns, GUNS. I have four words for the dumb state of Texas and all of its citizens that are brainwashed enough to have convinced themselves that they actually 'like' that state, ready, are you listening, probably not -you're a stupid Texan, here it is any way Don't Mess With America! There are forty-nine other states that will stop you. Here's a message to the Oval Office George Bush Will Step Down! I am not a democrat, nor a republican, I am not independant. I am of the Superior Cherokee Nation NOT American Indian you bunch of moron's! We are not from India, that was Columbus's European mistake. Here's another list of Stupid American men and women besides the Commander in Chief; Bruce Willis, Tucker Carlton, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna, Tony Blair (he acts like an American), Bob Novak, Nancy Grace, Micheal Jackson, and George Bush Senior. Remember, you all don't belong on My Land. The Cherokee Nation owns all of you, this includes the other Superior Tribes Blackfoot, Cheyenne, ShiShoni, Wabanaki, Souix, etcetera, etcetera. If you think you can't be ousted you are all wrong. You already are, by your own foolish laws. This is my land you are all paying rent on. I hope this makes a lot of people angry. Feel that anger you feel. How can you say these trhings? How? FREEDOM! That's how. Liberty. Bring me your tired, your poor, your hungry. God bless America, land that I love. Stand beside her and guide her through the night with the light from above. From her mountains, to her prairies, the the oceans, white with foam, God bless America my home sweet home. A True American.
