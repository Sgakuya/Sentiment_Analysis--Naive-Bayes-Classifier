I'm seeing a lot of people here giving copious amounts of grief over Best Buy's pis-poor service and pimply-faced staff without clues. At least these people bought something there. Three times we gave Best Buy a shot (Flat-Screen TV, Camcorder, and portable DVD Player). Each time we were attracted by a decent ad in the paper. But when you go to Worst Buy, the parking is always hellacious, the place is always congested, and the desired item you wanted is never there. You wait about 30 minutes for a pimply-faced dude to see if there's one in the back. That's when the pimply faced dudes try to sell you something twice as expensive and are unable to answer the simplest question on consumer electronics. We always left without buying anything and got what we wanted at Circuit City. Don't waste your time going to Worst Buy.
