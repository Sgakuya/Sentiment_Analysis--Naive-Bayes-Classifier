This boy is too stupid to be president! If he ever had an original thought, it doesn't show. It is obvious in listening to his talks that he learns a few things from his advisors to say about a subject and can't formulate additional ideas or opinions on his own. His knowledge of international and national politic is non-existant. He may be OK for Texas, but give the rest of us a break!
