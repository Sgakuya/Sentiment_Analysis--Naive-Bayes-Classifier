The only performers I've come across right now who are behind our administration and the war effort. It's refreshing to know that there are FINALLY some people that have fame AND good sense, which is all the more reason I'm going to see them next week. I guess it just took some good ol' boys from mississippi to stand up to hollywood....plus their music just rocks anyway.
