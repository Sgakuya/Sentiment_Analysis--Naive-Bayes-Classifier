Now, I'm a woman so most people will probably take my opinion with a grain of salt. However, Judging this place on food alone it is horrible. Their food is over priced, and not very appetizing. I understand most people don't go there for the food, and I went there for a friends birthday party, and it was fun. They made him do some funny things, but honestly gentlemen is it worth going to just to ogle some girls that you would never have a chance in hell with?
