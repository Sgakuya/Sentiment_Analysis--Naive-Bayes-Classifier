I worked there -- and no, I'm really not a disgruntled employee; just some opinions from someone [a long-time professional marketing exec] on the inside: 1) the worst management I've seen in 30 some-odd-years in business; ASMs, Operations Mngrs, and Store Mngrs are mostly sociopaths, amateurs, and morons who came up "through the ranks" ie, have no marketable skills applicable anywhere else. 2) huge turnover -- mostly hire warm bodies and then browbeat and intimidate them into meeting sales expectations. 3) Inventory is either CRAP merchandise -- or if it's a brand name -- way too expensive and easily able to be bought elsewhere for less. And as with Wal-Mart and most of American retail, (sadly) you might as well just fly over China and dump your wallet out the window. ALSO: never buy their retail price; the sales are scheduled in huge percentage-off increments -- going as low as 75% off -- which tells you their initial margins are staggering and border on theft.
