The WORST ever! The service contract said the owner could seal the crates but on the moving day, the movers show up 7 hours behind schedule late in the evening. They finally moved everything in the truck at 12am and told me I couldn't seal the crates until the next morning. I had to leave town the next day. So I called the salesman who gave me the quote requesting to buy additional insurance. He said the movers can do it. The movers said yeah you are insured and have me sign. Sure enough some boxes were cut open and items were missing. Then they told me they would pay 60 cents per each pound of each item. I have a nice wooden jewelry box that was handmade and weigh less than a pound and they would pay only 60cents. Not to mention other missing items. They are licensed THIEVES and excellent LIARS!!!!!
