Pearl Jam's debut album has been hailed as the cornerstone of a revolution that brought back rock from its faded image and idealistic obsessed turn. True and powerful themes ring through songs like Why, Go, Alive, Porch, and Oceans. This album has five musicians at their rocking best, with a mission to prove that you can say what you feel with no pretenses attached, and rock like hell at the same time.
