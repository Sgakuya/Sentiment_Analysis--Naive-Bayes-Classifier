We actually got a recommendation from a friend who had a good experience with these knuckleheads (one of the very few, I'm sure), and decided to use them. It was a nightmare. LUCKILY, they didn't break anything, but they were unprofessional, exceptionally late and slow, and they added a bunch of spurious charges to our final bill. Natually, we disputed these charges. As others have mentioned, their so-called customer service was dreadful. It took more than a month to hear anything back from them. All we got was a rude letter saying we had no grounds for asking for any money back. So we called them and had the dubious distinction of talking on the phone with the reincarnated Attila the Hun. She did tell us ONE helpful thing: the reason it took them so long to respond to our complaint was that they had a huge backlog of complaints--going back several months--that they were still trying to sort through. We didn't end up taking them to court, but it took a report to the Better Business Bureau for them to grudgingly give us back the money they had overcharged us. No wonder there are so many horror stories about this company! It truly is a horrible company! Avoid it like the plague.
