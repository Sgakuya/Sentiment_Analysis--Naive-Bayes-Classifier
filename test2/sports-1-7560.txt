Karl Malone is a second tier player - never won or will win a championship. He has no class and plays a dirty game. Shaq is aggressive, but not dirty. The great players in NBA history never played like punks. He's hillbilly chump that's riding Shaq and Kobe's coattails. I hope he get's run over by one of his 18 wheelers. By the way darknessforall - you're an idiot. Mailman's b**ch.
