Nice man, but should have never gone into politics. Much better at peanut farming and building houses for Habitat For Humanity. Remember the late 70's????? Double digit unemployment and inflation, 20% interest rates, a military in disarray, gas lines, hostages, misery indexes, and Jimmy Carter saying the job was too big for any one man to handle. Reagan sure handled it fine. Nuff said.
