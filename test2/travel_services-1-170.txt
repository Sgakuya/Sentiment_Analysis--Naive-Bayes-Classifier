I just called Delta to ask if I could skip the outbound leg on an award ticket. Yes, a ticket that I purchased with loyalty points. In essence, I was asking to use 1/2 the service I purchased. Their response was to ask me to pay a $100 rerouting fine!! Its no wonder this company is losing so much money. What an interesting way to reward your loyal customers. Good Job Delta!!! Nice knowing you.
