It's a shame that high school offers only a limited number of students in home economics where learning to sew cut patterns and sew clothes is promoted. I save a fortune selecting cloth and sewing my own designs. It takes patience and interest to sew and I urge you to take at least 1 lesson where you learn to sew. You will enjoy lining your garments and they feel great! Enjoy!
