Shame on you Rev. Jackson. You are truely working hard to continue to divide America. How about getting on your knees and praying that God's will, not yours be done. If we all would put God back into this country the division would slowly dissappear. You are undoing everything to undo what Martin Luther King Jr. started. I am white and admire everyting I have ever read about him and have brought my children up to treat everyone with equal love and respect because that is what a TRUE CHRISTIAN does.
