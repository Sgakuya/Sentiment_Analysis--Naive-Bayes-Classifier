This is one of the best TECHNO albums ever. I have it since 17.01.2005 as mp3, but i will buy an original, 13 years after release!!! - i still hear oldskool and classic techno (Lords of Acid, Phantasia, The Prodigy, Channel X ...). I like bluesrock, jazzrock, gothic rock, poprock, electronic ... and this old techno vibes, bringing me the feeling, like i was in 1991/92 - and reality is not exist. No one new sound will be better like the first - classic! Music is my legal drug! -T4 from Slovakia-
