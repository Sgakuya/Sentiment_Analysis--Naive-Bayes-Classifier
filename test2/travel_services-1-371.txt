On our last trip to florida our return flight was cancelled without notice. We were forced to run across the NC airport with 3 children under the age or 6. When we got to the plane the we were given 5 center seats. The crew was unwilling to do anything to keep young children with their parents. When we got off the flight our stroller was smashed and unusable. We were given vouchers for the horrible experience that are so difficult to redeem they are useless. Called customer service to complain and they were rude and did not offer any resolution. They may be ok for business men traveling alone, but are very family unfriendly. Avoid if traveling with small children.
