The worst electronics retailer period. Returned merchandise is simply dusted off and put right back up on the shelf. Buying previously returned merchandise does not entitle you to a discount. The warranty is a joke, as you bring something back and they fix it for you - which takes weeks, sometimes over a month. God forbid you just get an exchange. RCA products are the absolute bottom of the list. Pushy sales people force you to listen to a sales pitch on cellular or direct TV EVERY TIME. - Avoid at all costs.
