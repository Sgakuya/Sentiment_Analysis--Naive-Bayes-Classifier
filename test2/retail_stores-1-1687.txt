Our local Kmart is dark and dirty. The employees are a joke. They are always rude and super low class. I am so glad that Kmarts are dissappearing around the country. The only reason I would go there is to get the Martha Stewart kitchen supplies. I wish she would just randomly walk into one so she could see firsthand what hell hole is selling her stuff.
