The only reason I go to Denny's is because it's open 24 hours and I want a bite to eat at 3 am. The service is almost always horrible, and the food isn't so great either. The prices seem to keep rising as well. It used to be a good college student hang out, but now it seems like we can't even afford Denny's. Who wants to pay $6 for bacon and eggs you waited an hour and a half to get and arrive cold?
