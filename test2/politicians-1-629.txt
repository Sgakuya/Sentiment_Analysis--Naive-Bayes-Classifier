I wish there were a less than 1 option. It seems that he constantly has his foot in his mouth. I'm surprised he has lasted so long. He should have been kicked out the moment he implied the Japanese people were a superior race. And now...expressing his condolences for the drowned and the family of the drowned...by playing a game of golf. His arrogance is too much for the individual with common sense. Unfortunately there are so few in the Japanese government. Why else has Mori lasted so long in office?
