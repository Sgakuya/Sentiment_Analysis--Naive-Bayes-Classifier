Subway sucks. The only thing the place merits is that they make their own bread but it stops there. I went there for a steak and cheese sub... and they lifted the cover off a tin full of grey matter (supposedly shaved steak... very offensive to anybody from Philly), the meatball subs are served cold and you can't even get Provolone cheese there. If that wern't bad enough the commercials with Mr. Polly Prissypants "Jared" are beyond annoying.
