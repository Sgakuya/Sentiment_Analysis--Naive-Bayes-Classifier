Perhaps the most repulsively obese member of Congress, which is a corpulent body (aha!) of noteworthy lardasses. This is really saying something. How many calories does this slob inhale every day? 5,000? 8,000? Obviously, he never met a menu he didn't like, yet I understand he's on a new diet and currently down to three diners a day. His elephantine girth did not enhance his photo ops when he was so gung-ho about impeaching Bubba Clinton's ass: everytime this load tried to get in the picture, he'd take up 90% of the frame. The other hippos in Congress got really pissed off about that.
