I have seen Creed in concert three times and the last time in St. Louis they took me to a new level! My friends and I will never forget Creeds performance--quality lyrics, awesome guitar and of course, Stapp's voice, which lifted us HIGHER and HIGHER! It was certainly one of my best life-time memories.
