I support civil rights activist, but, when there is no issue don't make one. He gets stirred up abouth everything and calls it a racial issue. The issue in Florida is not racial. What 4 recounts isn't enough. I also do not support civil rights activist who support hate groups such as The New Black Panthers, as Jesse Jackson does.
