I had to update my piece as I understand that Bush has said God told him to invade Iraq. America, please open your eyes. This is dangerous stuff and every bit as insidious as the religious fundamentalism we are seeing from Islam. Some have mentioned..'yes, but consider where the source of this has come from'. Well, Bush himself said just yesterday that he appointed Miers because of 'religion'...see the pattern? I'd say let's consider the points raised for an examination of the truth, whoever reveals it to us. (In that regard, maybe it is God's will, that the two faiths finally slug it out until humanity realises that neither of them is a true representation of God.) I've taken Wiseguy's comments and digested them fully. They are now in the pan where they belong. Update: It is sad that a nation can be coerced into fear and paranoia so successfully as has been done by Bush Inc. but we know that the voters were split and I have witnessed something like despair in the Americans I know and work with. President Bush has no qualifications to be a world leader and his first term in office has shown this. He is inarticulate, unconscious of other histories and cultures relating to issues that the world faces today, a man caught up in his own fears and insecurities over the safety of his America (not yours or mine, by the way, only his) and has the diplomacy of a tank. Added to that the Greed of his administration's corporate interests and you get a poor choice as world leader. Still, he's there and we have to put up with him. I hope he isn't so arrogant to ignore considered advice in the next four years, but his cabinet choices don't seem to reflect that hope. PS. I'm still trying to work out Psalmy's comments.... Nope, they make no sense. FURTHER UPDATE: It was uppermost in mind that if Bush acted alone militarily as he did then this would encourage other leaders to feel they had the same right, something that is not good generally for us all. Now we have Putin claiming that he needs more power to run his country, almost reverting to the one-party state and undoing the fledgling democracy that was growing in that country. If Bush can act by flouting international 'acceptance', (and increasingly the US appears to be a one-party state itself) then why shouldn't Putin? This might suit some diehard Republican thinkers who like to have an enemy, but it does no service to democracy in the world.
