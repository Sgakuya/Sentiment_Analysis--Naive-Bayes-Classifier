I don't like Jack in the Box because of the problems they've had with e-coli bacterium. Once a restaurant kills people through their employee's unsafe food handling, or improper storage, or inadequate handwashing, I am no longer interested in eating there. I think Jack in the Box commercials are great. I like Jack and I think it is great that they created his character as that of a family man. I particularly enjoy their particular stand for diversity.
