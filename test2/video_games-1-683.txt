Why on earth people play this game I'll never know. Did you ever notice that the only people who ever play Risk are men with Napoleon complexes? Always wanting to conquer the world... plus, this game can go on for hours, even days. They plan out these huge strategies, form enemies and alliances just trying to take over Switzerland! Then once they win the game their ego shoots through the roof- they conquered the world! Hello, it's just a board game. For those Risk players, how many women play the game? You'll be amazed, not very many, I wonder why!
