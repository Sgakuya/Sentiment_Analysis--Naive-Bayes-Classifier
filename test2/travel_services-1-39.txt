The worst. A one hour layover turned into a 10 hour layover and then they lost our luggage. On the way back home a delay of and hour and a half causing us to miss the connection. Stuck overnight and had to fight for a hotel voucher. They refused to retrieve our bags so we spent the night at a hotel without any of our things.
