It's still a free country. If the Rev wants to run, so be it. Forgive the cynicism, but the Rev must be working for the Republican National Committee. He will do more than anyone in getting out the Republican vote while ensuring that the Democrats stay home and watch TV. On a more philosophical note, let all the evils that lurk in the mud hatch out. If we have all these problems that the Rev says we have, then let him run and let's confront these issues head-on. And, the way we confront these issues is at the ballot box. Considering that the Rev has not been elected after three tries at major office, I'm wondering whether this campaign will make any difference other than enhancing his stature among his followers. No a bad opportunity for a consummate opportunist. So far, the electorate's answer has been a resounding NO! His effectiveness seems to diminish beyond the disaffected whom he has suceeded in marginalizing in American society. Great work Rev. You've created more misery for your fans while you personally get fatter.
