YUCK!!! The little monster is getting worse and worse! How the heck did she ever get fans? If I had to choose between her lastest CD and Baby one more time, I'd take the second option even though that one is total crap, too. And to be honest, I don't give a rat's a$$ what she looks like or who she's supposed to be a role model for or how she dresses. The point is that her music SUCKS. Period! Exclamation point! End of argument! BTW...for anyone who wishes to exit the abysmal of bubblegum, I am working on constructing a time capsule to take us back to the time of Queen. If you are loyal to rock music, I welcome you to join me! Take care, everyone!
