Steady Teddy is a sorry excuse for a human being. He left Mary Jo Kopechne to die and could have saved her if he wanted to. But no, he was too drunk and only thinking of his sorry ass and political future to care about Mary Jo. It's been reported Mary Jo possibly lived at least a half hour after the car was submerged in the water. He should have been charged with neligent homicide or vehicular manslaughter and thrown in jail, not being re-elected time after time. If his brothers weren't assassinated, he would have been toast.
