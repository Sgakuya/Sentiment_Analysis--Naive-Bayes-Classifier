Thank God for Barbara Boxer - best thing that ever happened to the Republican Party :). California, my condolences (but you DO keep voting her in - what DOES that say about you? Hmmmm?) (Oh, right, I keep forgetting I'm from Maine, the East Coast California, sigh - I do my best, honest, but 6,000 to 1 just doesn't get the right people voted in, darn it! At LEAST we aren't responsible for Barbara Boxer - nah nah nah NAH nah!)
