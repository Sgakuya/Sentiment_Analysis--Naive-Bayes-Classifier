I used to like McDonald's when I was in junior high and I knew everyone that worked there (translation: free food). As I grew older, the employees started to appear younger and younger to me (imagine that!)... so much so that I don't go there anymore because the employees are kids. It's like a McSweatshop. In addition, as a fundraiser in highschool, the local establishment offered our group 300 bucks if each of us put in an hour of work at McD's. I made egg mcmuffins in the morning and flipped burgers later on. No one in the back gives a flying fart about the quality of the food (and maybe that's true at more restaurants than I want to admit). It scared me enough so that I never go to McDonald's.
