Biggest hypocrite in college basketball. Always talking about how it's the "relationships" that count, yet lets it be known in no uncertain terms that it's all about winning with him. Whines more than any other coach if a call goes against his team, and is the biggest teacher of "flopping" to draw fouls that I've ever seen. It's all about ego too. Petitioned the NCAA to remove the losses from his record the year he bailed on his team because of back problems. With Coach K its ego above all else.
