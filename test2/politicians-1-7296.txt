I cannot stand Jesse Jackson. I am so outraged today because I am watching MSNBC and he is just about to start another stupid rally. I don't know why they give him so much air time. I personally cannot consider him a reverend. This upsets me so much. He is for Al Gore and abortion and he is suppose to be spreading God's word. I personally think that we Christians are accountable for who we vote for. I know God does not agree with abortion for it is murder and when people vote for someone who is for abortion we are condoning this and accepting it. We shouldn't be so accepting to this and we Christians should not be so accepting of Jesse Jackson calling himself a reverend and promoting Al Gore and abortion. I can't take it and I hope he reads these. Who does he think he is? Does anyone agree? I am so outraged and I would love to tell him this to his face. He is making a mockery of Christianity.
