Bob Stoops is a tool. Even when he was getting his butt handed to him by LSU two years ago, he acted like a baby at half-time when a reporter refered to LSUs defense as the #1 defense. (LSUs was the #1 defense in terms of points allowed per game, OU was the #1 defense in yards allowed per game) He snapped at the poor reporter about how his team had the #1 defense and didn't even address her question, even though I'm pretty sure not allowing points is a little more important than not allowing yards... Also, OU doesn't exactly have the toughest schedule these days. The only anually good team they play is Texas ... then they just run up the score on all the bad teams to make themselves look better. If OU played in the SEC or Big 10 they would have had 2-3 regular season losses the past two seasons. Instead, snuck into national championship games that they didn't deserve to go to. It should have been LSU vs USC, and then USC vs Auburn. End of story. Oklahoma went and got embarassed both years. I bet Bob Stoops went home and beat his wife and daughters after this past year's national championship game. I'm glad to see a team like TCU stand up to OU and not take their shit anymore. Go Horned Frogs ... or whatever they are.
