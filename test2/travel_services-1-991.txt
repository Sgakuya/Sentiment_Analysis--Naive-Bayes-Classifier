UNETHICAL - I hired two small men out of Winnipeg to move to Toronto. I was told that it would take 6-7 days which I was counting on as I am 7 months pregnant and needed the time with my partner to drive to Toronto with our dogs. The movers were to be at our home at 9:00 am and showed up at 4:30 pm. They moved 1/2 of our furniture into the van when they told us that we had 2 days to be in Toronto. I told them that we would try to be there in 2.5 days but couldn't promise anything. My partner was not there when the movers were there as he was flying in from Toronto. I felt completely taken advantage of. At this time, they arrived to Toronto early and left everything in the garage and then proceeded to charge the rest of the bill on my visa. DO NOT GO WITH THESE CRIMINALS!! We had to hire someone once we arrived in Toronto to move everything into the house. The 2 abusive men with no hearts are ignoring my phone calls. I am still trying to get money back from them. DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY. THEY ARE UNETHICAL AND SHOULD BE DRIVEN OUT OF BUSINESS!!
