Had a good game in the Super Bowl, but everyone knows that Tampa's D won that game for them. Anyways, does this guy have some serious off-the-field issues or what? First he had some sort of domestic violence charges while playing for the Cardinals, then he rams his SUV into a car with his wife, his kid, and the babysitter in it?!? This has nothing to do with football, but any f**king a$$hole who does that to his family is pathetic.
