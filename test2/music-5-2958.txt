Growing up with the Beatles in late sixites, watching their cartoons, they were for your older siblings. Abbey Road was just release and I miss out on the radio play, when Let It Be came out, I was in tune with the am hit parade, the album was Rough and Ready the way I like it, the guitar version of Let It Be is better than single any day. My follow up album was the White Album. This is not the cute, lovable mob tops. It's the mature album as they express themself, this is the opposite of the colorful Sgt. Pepper,a stark white album. Honest to the core. Love real music or Hate it for not being slick, over polished mush muzic! This album has been the most over bought album by me. First was the serial stamp version record, then the cassette, then the half-speed master, then cd and finally the 30th anniversary version with mini me poster photos! You can always look for something wrong with any Beatle record, maybe not with Rubber Soul. With Captiol American versions records, it not the same as British, oh well! For the Fans of THE WHITE ALBUM, could you really come up and single record version? Maybe Side 1 and Side 3, no too many good songs on Side 2 4. Anyway try this: Ringo one song: Goodnight, George two songs:While My Guitar Weeps and Savoy Truffle, Paul hits: Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da Back in the U.S.S.R., With average of 7 full song per side leaves 9 songs. Paully gets majority rule 5: Martha My Dear, Blackbirds, I Will, Mother Nature's Son, Rocky Racoon, John gets only 4: Dear Purdence, I'm So Tired, Sexy Sadie, Cry Baby Cry, The new album BLACKBIRD all black out! Side 1 - TIME 21:35 Back in the U.S.S.R. 2:43, Dear Purdence 3:56, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da 3:08, While My Guitar Weeps 4:45, Martha My Dear 2:28, I'm So Tired 2:03, Blackbirds 2:18, Side 2 - TIME 21:37 Rocky Racoon 3:32, I Will 1:46, Mother Nature's Son 2:48, Sexy Sadie 3:15, Savoy Truffle 2:54, Cry Baby Cry 3:01, Goodnight 3:11, Wild Honey Pie 00:52 ( to equal out the side for cassettes). With this album no Charles Manson, Sharon Tate live with baby. Lennon QUITS for good because of the songs left off now become a solo album for John, their is NO Abbey Road, John songs added to solo album GLASS ONION . Paul dies in car crash smoking dope! Ringo and George cont. in success. Wasn't that a better tale?
