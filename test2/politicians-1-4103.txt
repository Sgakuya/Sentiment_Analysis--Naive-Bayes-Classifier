I'm sick of people like Ralph Nader, George Bush, Al Gore, John Kerry. etc. Telling us how to run our lives. What ever happened to the constitution limiting what our government can do. These polititions completely disregard our individual liberty for the benefit of society. Not only is that immoral and cantrary to our constitution, it doesn't work. So these fools are going to continue to argue about how best to control our lives and if people dont wise up it will keep getting worse. Eventually we will lose all of our liberty. Wise up people!
