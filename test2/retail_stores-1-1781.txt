I don't think I have EVER had a positive experience with Wal-Mart! I've found many of the people who work there are just so rude, inattentive, and unhelpful or they just plain don't understand English. (With the money that they make, I'm not surprised they treat customers that way.) If it's not an employee I'm having a problem with, It's another customer because the rudest, nastiest, most self-centered people seem to shop there. I'd rather spend a few extra dollars and have a pleasant shopping experience then go to Hell-Mart.
