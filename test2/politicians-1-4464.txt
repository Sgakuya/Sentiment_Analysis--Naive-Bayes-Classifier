This guy is frightening. Deranged, raving, crazy muthajumpa. Never learned that politics and religion don't mix, that such a cocktail is undeniably Un-American, but he's not alone in that regard. A strident Johnny One-Noter who should close his trap and actually do something for the people rather than relentlessly promote himself and his mutant agenda.
