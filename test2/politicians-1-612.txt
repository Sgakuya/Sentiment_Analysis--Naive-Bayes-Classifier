I should have expected people to praise her 100%. I grew up in the Thatcher reign - and my family suffered because of it. She brought in The Poll Tax - which both rich and poor were meant to pay the same amount. Impossible for some families, including mine. Because of her, both my parents went to jail becuase they couldn't afford it, first my father, then my mother. House prices are ridiculous because of that woman and she abolished people's right to a Worker's Union. She helped destroy families who couldn't afford the lifestyle she thought the people of our country should have. I know that because there were thousands of them on the marches against the Poll Tax and regarding what was happening to the miners. I hate her. If you want to see a film adaptation of what it was like for the majority of the miners who got laid off, (about a quarter of a million of them) watch 'Brassed Off' featuring Pete Postlewaithe and Ewan McGregor and you'll see what I mean.
