My sister bought her engagement rings at Littman's jewelers and after a year decided to have them insured since they had spent a lot of money. When they were appraised they learned that the rings were only worth a 1/4 of what they had paid. The diamonds were of poor quality and the rings had been plated. Needless to say they area rip off and I would never shop there.
