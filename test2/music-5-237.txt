 Black, Deep, and Release are probably my favorite songs on what turned out to be one of the most impressive and influential debut albums of the early 90s. How many of the songs on Ten turned out to be huge radio hits? Three or four? There s Jeremy, of course, Even Flow, and Alive, at least It s a shame Pearl Jam was so shell-shocked by the success of this CD that they ve never been able and/or willing to put out something better. Vs. was excellent, and I liked Yield, but most of their other stuff doesn t hold up.
