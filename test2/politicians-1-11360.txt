Yeah she's independant allright... because EVERYONE would know about her if she wasn't a first lady. Off the top of your head, anyhow, how many first ladies can you name? She wasn't just a first lady... she was the first lady that got cheated on by the president of the US. That's the only reason anyone even knows who she is. The fact that she is even still with Bill is tribute to the reality that she is NOTHING in politics without him. There are much more strong-willed and intelligent women out there. Condolezza, for one.
