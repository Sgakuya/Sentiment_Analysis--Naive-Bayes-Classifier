I went through the drive-thru one night and it took over 30 minutes on an early Friday evening. And there were only 4 cars ahead of me. There was no attempt to satisfy an unhappy customer. I called the complaint number and e-mailed headquarters from their web site. I NEVER got a response from either one. They do NOT care about customer service. I have discontinued patronizing this chain.
