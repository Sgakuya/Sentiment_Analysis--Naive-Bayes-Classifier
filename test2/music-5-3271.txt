Where to start? Sway and Can't You Hear Me Knockin' were absent on Hot Rocks and Forty Licks , but are nearly up to par with the others. Wild Horses may very well be the Stones' best ballad, the intertwining guitars spinning tales of sorrow and regret. And the album's conclusion, Moonlight Mile --shivers of cocaine and symphonic orgasms--is simply epic.
