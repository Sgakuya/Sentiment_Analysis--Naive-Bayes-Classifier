He gets one star, but only because you have to give one. To quote Ralph Nader, "he's a corporation disguised as a human being." Chicken-hawk war mongerer with a terrifying lack of knowledge. Clinton was slimy, but he was at least intelligent. Says he doesn't like to read! I like my president to be smart. He could not make any money despite being born with every advantage. While Governor of Texas he never saw a death penalty case worthy of more than a cursory review, yet unceasingly yaps about his "culture of life." Spends incredible amounts of time mountain biking and clearing brush from his ranch. Claims to be a uniter and not a divider. (You shouldn't have to tell people this because if it is true people will notice on their own). Comes to power with the help of some shady election work in the state governed by baby brother. (Meanwhile half a million more voted for the other guy.) Appears to have neglected his military duty, yet starts an unprovoked war with dubious evidence. Tax breaks for the mega-rich; the loosening of environmental restrictions; attempts to privatize everything he comes across (even the government itself!); destroys a short-lived budget surplus (created by Rep. House and Dem. Pres.); enlarges the government tremendously with Homeland Security Dept., No Child Left Behind Act, Medicare prescription drug entitlement; runaway spending; war profiteers in Iraq; Armstrong Williams, Jeff Gannon, Judith Miller; FEMA undermining; appoints his personal attorney to the Supreme Court (who was shouted down by Republicans and rightly so); and the worse part of all is that most of these are just within the last two years in office! He did make a really neat landing on an aircraft carrier though.
