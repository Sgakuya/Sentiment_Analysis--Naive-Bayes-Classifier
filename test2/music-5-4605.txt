U2 combines traditional rock n' roll with the most artistic (and challenging) music I have ever listened to. It keeps the spirit of punk alive without over doing it. There is definetly a reason why U2 has lasted for 25 years. It is because of their awesome music that is made for every type of people whether you are 15 or 45.
