I cut my teeth on Michigan football! My family goes to almost every game... I am sick and saddened at what has happened to our victors! Please go after a good coach and fire Carr. The fans want him out. This is NOT acceptable. He is a great man! But his time is up! We need to revive Michigan Football. I could understand losing a BCS Bowl - but come on - the Alamo Bowl against Unranked Nebraska? Please help your loyal fans. Ohio State would never let this happen to their program without action... Go Blue, Matthew J Maddix
