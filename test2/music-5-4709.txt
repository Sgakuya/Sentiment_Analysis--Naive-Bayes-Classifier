Creed puts on one of the BEST live performances out there!!! There music is filled with symbolism and frankly ROCKS!!!! Those that don't care for Creed or want to bash them - most have not listenend to all their albums nor experienced their LIVE shows-- There is an energy at a Creed Concert that I have not experienced before, and I go to alot of live ROCK shows. Do yourself a favor, listen to the MUSIC - food for the soul! Rock On....
