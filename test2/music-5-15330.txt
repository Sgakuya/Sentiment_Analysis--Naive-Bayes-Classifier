Moby is one of those artists who can take a subtle sample and play it into something grand. On Play he samples from across the musical spectrum and all seem to fit the mood of the piece. Body Rock is a jump up in your face party anthem w/ an 80's hip hop sample while Honey combines a trippy sound with an old bluesy sample.
