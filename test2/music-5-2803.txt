Here's a masterpiece. The first album where he's totally departed from acoustic work. Even Bringing It All Back Home was half-acoustic/half-electric, to ease people into his new sound, I'd suppose. But driving on Highway 61 is a unique electrified experience complete with beautifully confusing lyrics, like Blonde on Blonde, coming soon after. Like A Rolling Stone, a ground breaking rock and roll song, along with the rest of the tracks are very well-written. I'm proud to say that I've deciphered Ballad of a Thin Man with a little help from a Brian Jones biography. The record is like a series of puzzles. The music on here is just so top-notch.
