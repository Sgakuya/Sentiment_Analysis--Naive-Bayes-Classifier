Along with Blue, this is a true Joni Mitchell classic. It was also my first introduction to Joni when it came out in the 70's. Ever since I heard Help Me on the radio, I was hooked. The entire record is amazing and influential and begins to hint at the places Joni might go in the future, including jazz. People's Parties, Free Man in Paris, Court and Spark, Down to You, Just Like This Train, Raised on Robbery : they're all on this cd and all classic Joni songs in my opinion. From the sensitive to the playful, there is lyrical poetry, inventive song structures and a voice that is breathtaking. I'm convinced that this record belongs in the top ten of all rock or pop records ever made.
