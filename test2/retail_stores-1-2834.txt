My husband purchased a ruby ring from Whitehall Jewellers to use as my engagement ring. Upon taking it to the store for the 4 month check the sales associate informed me and my friend that she remembered my ring because she had previously purchased it but then decided she did not like it after a week and so she returned it and it was re-sold to me. I immediately phoned my husband and he set up an appointment to talk to the store manager (who also happened to be the sales associate I dealt with). She claimed that we misunderstood her-which we did not-and that I could trade in my ring if I liked. My husband got numbers for customer service representatives who happened to be impossible to contact. After speaking with a secretary he was connected to someone who was actually willing to answer their phone. This customer service representative gave us a song and dance and in the end basically called us liars and said she felt that we did not want a refund because the ring was used but rather she thought it was because I didn't like the ring to begin with-a false speculation to say the least. After filing a complaint with the state attorney general, we have received numerous letters from Whitehall, all saying the same thing...we are making the event up. We are still fighting this, but are running out of options. Whitehall is without a doubt the worst jewelry store I've ever dealt with, I encourage everyone to shop elsewhere; you can't get much worse than selling used jewelry as new and then disrespecting your customers enough to call them liars.
