Question!!! why would anyone take the name of a serial killer and then sell himself as a commodity. People forget that Charles Manson's family vicioulsy murdered 5 people including a pregnant woman, and now this psycho-melodramatic fake, brian warner wants to take his name, act disgusting, call his show art, and all that. I used to think he was all that but he's just a show. Hello people. and his lyrics have so much unneeded negativity to them, and negitivity can be good if it has a point or meaning or reason behind it, all of which Brian Warner lacks.
