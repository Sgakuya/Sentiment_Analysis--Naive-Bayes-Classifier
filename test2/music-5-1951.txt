I find Spiritual Machines to be an inspirational allbum, one that makes you think. Our Lady Peace have successfully put together music that carries a message about society today. Each song draws the listener in and is so unique. Raine's falsetto is a great example of this on Life, and the slow and sensitive Are you Sad? also shows OLP's creativity. Yep, i think SM ought to be rated as great! 'brennyjade
