Al Sharpon is greedy, racist crook. He makes his living as a parasite, stealing money from successful blue collar workers. He has raised millions of dollars from his racist squander, oh, and don't forget all those millions are tax free. Out of all those millions he made, that were supposed to be used for charity, and to help his fellow black citizens, only a few thousand were actually used to help the poor black people. Al Shapton even has the IRS afraid of him, the government doesn't want to be labeled racist now, does it? It is trully despairing knowing that black people support this evil felon. The sad thing is, it is not me that he is hurting, it is his own people.
