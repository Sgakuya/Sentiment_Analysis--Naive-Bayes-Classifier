The fact that internet explorer is susceptible to spyware and hackers is one reason not to use it. The other reason not to use it is the selfish monopoly which Microsoft has on the entire computer market. Microsoft products and their built in spyware is just another step closer to 1989. There are many other very good browsers (Firefox, Opera) which are not (yet) in the grips of Microsoft. Here in Europe, users are very sceptical about the profound invasion of one`s privacy when using Microsoft products, not to mention the amazing instability of the software. Every keystroke you make is registered by Microsoft. Even the work you do offline is transfered to Microsoft the moment you go online. Yes, of course, people will argue that no one reads any of that information since it is impossible to read all of it. In my opinion, even the slightest possibility of my private mails and letters being read by anyone but the person who is to receive it, is a reason not to use that software. Do not be so naive and think that it does not matter, because each infringement of your privacy is a step closer to the complete loss of your freedom.
