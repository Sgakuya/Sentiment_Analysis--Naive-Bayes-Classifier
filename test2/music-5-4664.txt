I understand how Bob has had a worldwide influence on music, honestly, clarity of spiritual thought but I should like to make this connent personal. I'm just so grateful to have a kindred spirit through a life on this crazy world so packed with both beauty and insanity. Sending Bob love and light always. Jenn
