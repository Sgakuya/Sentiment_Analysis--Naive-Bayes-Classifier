This man is a fool. He is a fool from a rich and powerful family who are using him as their puppet to increase their own profit and power. But a fool is a fool, and buying him an election is no more redeeming than buying him a functional brain to use. His presence in the White House makes the US a laughing stock for the whole world. What we need is peace not Dubya. Bring back Jimmy Carter!
