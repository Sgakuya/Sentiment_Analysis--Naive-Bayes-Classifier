I laughed out loud reading the comments about how wonderful the Kennedy family is! Do a little serious thinking about that statement! Among the members of this family are a rapist, drug addicts, adulterers, alcoholics, sex-addicts, bootleggers, election-riggers, manslaughterers, someone accused of murder, a child molester...I could on and on. I think JFK probably tried to rise above all this but sadly failed.
