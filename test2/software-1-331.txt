Sure it's more stable if you were using 95, 98 or ME before but if you are using Windows 2000 it's just as stable, they both run on the same NT kernel. XP just adds more bloat and eye candy. If you're running 95(god help you) 98, ME(pos) then you should definitely upgrade to XP but if your using 2000 then there's really no need to.Another thing that bothers me, the default user interface is horrible, did Microsoft hire Fisher-Price to design the looks? Why am I giving it only one star? It is Windows 2000 with extra crap(mostly uneeded) added, not exactly innovative.
