Crescent Jewelers has the worst customer service ever. I guess it's kind of my fault because I should have known from the way the sales people barely spoke english and didn't know anything about the diamonds in their own store! They couldn't tell me their size, clarity, color or even the correct price. They tricked me into buying a ring by saying my credit line would only be good if I opened the account right then and there and they were about to close. They said I had thirty days to exchange or return the ring in case I wanted to come back when I had more time to shop. They also gave me a discount of 10% and that's what they used as their excuse when they refused to take back my horrible engagemnent ring that has three huge black inclusions. I could only see it after I left the store. They don't do custom rings and their selection is horrible. I took my ring back to clean it and it looked worse than when I gave it to them. I need to have it sized also but Iknow they are going to try to charge me to do that and I'm scared I may not get the same ring back. I've contacted customer service who is going to contact corporate so I'll give you an update when or if they respond to me. I'm sure their excuse will be that it has been over 30 days (their no questions asked money back garantee) even though I called in before the thirty days were up. Never shop here even if you have the worst credit ever. It's not worth it. Go get a mossanite.
