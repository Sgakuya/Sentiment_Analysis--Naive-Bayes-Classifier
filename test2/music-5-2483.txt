An awesome effort. Gimmie Shelter (spelled Gimme Shelter on Hot Rocks), is an powerful, dark rocker. Love In Vain, which I didn't believe was a Robert Johnson song when I first heard it, was nicely adopted by the Stones and they turned it into a wonderful folk ballad. Country Honk is a sleazy acoustic rendition of Honky Tonk Women, one of the album's only flaws. Let It Bleed is a classic honky tonk tune (Ian Stewart Rocks), Midnight Rambler is a powerful blues number with great harmonica work by Jagger, You Got the Silver is a decent first chance for Keith to show of his unique voice, Monkey Man is an energy-driven wild tune with great piano work by Nicky Hopkins, and the album closes by teaching morals with the classic You Can't Always Get What You Want. Mr. Richards' guitar work is probably what shines the most, although all the band plays well-- especially the piano guys. And you may argue that Keith is too stoned to be an excellent guitarist, but after hearing this, I understand that many other guitar greats would break their hands trying to do what he does. This album is surely a classic- a much better work than Exile.
