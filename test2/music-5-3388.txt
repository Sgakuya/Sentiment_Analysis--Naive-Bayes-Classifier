Another perfect album. When Pink Floyd makes and album, they treat it as one huge experience that can only be expressed in one world, AMAZING. Also, what a concept: an album about the struggles the eeryday man goes through. Hearing songs like 'Breathe,' 'Time,' and 'The Great Gig in the Sky.' wll make you think Yeah! I've been there. , and I go through that everyday. There is something for everyone here.
