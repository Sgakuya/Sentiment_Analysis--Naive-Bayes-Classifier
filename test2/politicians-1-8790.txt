I also hate all the people saying if he could run again he would win. Well he cant run again and even if he did he wouldnt win. Did Kerry win? No and Clinton even went to cities with him. I hope this country wouldnt put Clinton back in office. It would make me think what kind of world do I live in. Way to go Bush
