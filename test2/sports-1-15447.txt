Regardless of talent , he has always been a totally selfish egomaniac , from the his first day in the NFL . A veteran like Vince Carter,who played 15 years , tried to straighten him out , and Moss just blew him off . And he hasn't changed at all since . And last sunday's mock mooning/wiping his ass on the goal post act , was the last straw . He deserves no respect,because he has never shown any behavior , even close enough , to being worthy of it.
