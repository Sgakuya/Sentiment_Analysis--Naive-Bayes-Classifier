Clay is certainly not the guy you would want to snort coke with, if that is what you are looking for. If you enjoy talent, stage presence, and incredible singing this is the artist that you surely want to follow on his tours. Not only is he a gifted vocalist, Clay's personality is pure magic, and he has thousands upon thousands of women in love with him! He is absolutely adorable, handsome, kind, generous, loving and a christian, so, ....what's not to like????? You guys need to 'get over it' and realize he is a tough act to follow!!!!!! Give the guy credit! He doesn't criticize you, so leave Clay alone!!!! We all adore him!!!!!!!!
