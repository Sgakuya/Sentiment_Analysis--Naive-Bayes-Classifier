Awful. Poor infrastructure, dreadful signage, execrable security and undermanned immigration and checkins. Amazingly stupid check-in system in Terminal 2 where you go through passport control (LONG queues) before check in (even LONGER queues) before security at the gate. Piss-poor connectivity to Paris. Take the shuttle bus to the Gare and risk the RER train to Gare du Nord. Be aware that non-French credit cards probably won't work in the ticket machines.
