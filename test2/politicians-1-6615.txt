A great example for every insensitive, intolerant, jingoistic clod to come down the turnpike. Being a conservative is one thing. Being true to oneself is also one thing. But being patriotic and pro-American to the point of denigrating and deeming all alternative perspectives and viewpoints as subversive and worthy of whale waste is just plain bigoted, narrow-minded, tunnel-visioned, insouciant, anti-intellectual, and just about any additional adjective that can be applied to this esteemed Catholic thinker. I read his autobiography, Right From the Beginning, and I learned to appreciate that I live in a country where all viewpoints can be tolerated---not liked, necessarily, but tolerated. Pat is a by-product of a parochial, insular environment that venerated family, church, marriage, education, and so forth---all highly worthy, practical values. But when goofuses such as Pat Buchanan distort and misappropriate these values to reflect his ideal society: segregated schools, no acknowledgement of back-alley abortions, no social welfare net for the indigent, banishment of the mentally ill and the mentally retarded to out-of-the-way institutions, no acknowledgement of other religions' and cultures' contributions to the betterment of American society except white European males and females, lack of available higher education to blacks, Hispanics and other minorities----this is a nightmare! I can only hope that there are people in our country who can see Jack Boot-chanan for the right-wing wacko he is, and not be taken in with his beady-eyed intransigence and threats of communists and socialists and Shriners and Muslims and any other group he deems a threat to his seemingly fascist views. He would look pretty good with the little black mustache on his upper lip, wouldn't he, now?
