ahh most responsible for the lard like state too many americans are in. mc d' stuff just sucks, man. see Super Size Me to scare you straight. burgers that have been sittin for 30 minutes, overgreased, small, over priced, no variety on the menu. the salads are a step in the right direction, but a long way to go.
