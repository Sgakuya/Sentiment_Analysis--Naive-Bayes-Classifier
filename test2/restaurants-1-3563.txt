Pizza is a lot like sex - Even when it's bad, it's still OK. That said, although I give this a 1 rating, I wouldn't turn it down if I was hungry. When it comes to pizza, Little Caesars is the bottom of the barrel. It looks as if it's made in a factory, shipped to the stores and then reheated. It tastes artificial and soulless, lacking the flavour and character of a hand made pizza. It is dirt cheap however, so if you're on a budget and want a lot of food for a little money, Little Caesar's is for you.
