I seen him on TV at the last State of the Union Address. He was eating two giant tubs of ice cream with extra syrup. Bush had to stop during the middle of the speech becuase Ted had ordered 2 large Dominoes pizzas that were delivered. He didnt even tip the guy. During the final ending of the speech, he had gone through 5 Jack Daniels, the ice cream, the pizzas, a slice of cake Daschle gave him, and was now working on an orange creamsicle. After he left, he rode away in his Mercedes (that the people of Massachusetts paid for) and went to the local bar. According to my sources, he was there until 3 in the morning getting stoned and drunk. After that, he looted homes and ran around yelling. Quite possibly the worst disaster in the state of Massachusetts.
