I have been reading some of the pro Radio Shack postings here and I just realized that All of Radio Shacks problems such as no inventory,out of stock items, discontinued items,bad customer relations, lack of knowledge ect. ect. are all caused by me and other people like me. It's my fault when I go in there to purchace an item and you do not have it in stock. It's my fault when I go to purchace an item and said item is missing parts and you give me a BS story that those parts are purchased seperatly and on the box it gives you a detailed breakdown of what is included.and I guess it's my fault to when I return a defective item and I get the song and dance to have it exchanged. I am also truly sorry for the lack of technical expertize. I have only been dealing with electronics for the past 25 years, this by in no way can compare to your whopping 55 hours at Radio Shack Tech. And for as knowing what I want, well you got me there again. What do you call that thing you say hello into? You know, it sits next to that thing that the pictures come out of. On second thought, I really do'nt think it's us or even me. I think it's you, the crybaby employees of Radio shack. If you think your customers are babbling idiots and your overworked and underpaid, do'nt cry to us. Find another job, go sell icecream or something. Or you can keep your stupid comments to yourself and do your job. And heres a thought, most people know nothing about electrinics thats why they come to you. Try being helpfull and they just might return to buy that 500 dollar item.
