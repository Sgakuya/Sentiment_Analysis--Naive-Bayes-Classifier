Brilliant work by John Williams. Can anyone hear the opening theme and not know what is about to come on??? Even the extra opening music during the 20th Century Fox banner was added for Star Wars and has been kept in 20th Centuries' movies ever since. Another Star Wars contribution to the movies as a whole.
