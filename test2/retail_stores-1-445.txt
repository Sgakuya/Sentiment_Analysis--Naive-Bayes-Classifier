The Gap is a great place to shop if you have no sense of individuality or taste. They sell generic clothes for people who are afraid to be something other than what they see on television. The hard thing to believe, is that people don't care. Everybody in vests . You mindless sheep, fashion should be an expression of self. Is that how you want to be seen? A generic cop-out lining the pockets of people who have designed you.
