As if one album hadn't been enough! This album is complete trash with even less catchy tunes. She can't even sing! Her whiny voice makes me want to pull my hair out! The sad thing is that she has already sold millions of her new album. I think parents should sit down with their children and explain to them what real music sounds like.
