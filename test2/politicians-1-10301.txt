This guy should be counted among the terrorists. He has done more for Al Qaeda than Osama could ever do. But what is the scariest of all is that this guy is one of those kristians, a guy who believes he is in partnership with the Almighty while at the same time rejecting the sympathy for the poor and outcasts that Jesus voiced. I wonder if he is trying to play his part in the unfolding drama of the Last Days? He is very scary.
