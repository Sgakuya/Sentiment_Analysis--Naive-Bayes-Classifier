i used to be quite a fan of borders due to their selection. but found their customer service lacking when i asked to see a manager and was flat out denied. as a 19 year old at the time, the employee must have thought i would let that slide. i didn't. i did see a manager and have never gone back since. as nice as it is to have a good selection, i'll take good customer service anyday
