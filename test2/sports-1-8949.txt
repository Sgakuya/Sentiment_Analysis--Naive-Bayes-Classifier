I am ashamed to share a name with this man (Wallace, not Rasheed). I don't care how good of a player this man is, he has one of the worst attitueds and sense of sportsmanship I have had the misfortune of coming across since Ostertag. He has so many technicals to his name it is shameful. Just shut up, stop pushing the other guy and play the game. Wallace is a brawler and a complainer and that bugs me.
