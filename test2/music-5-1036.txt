I bought No Angel two weeks ago, and I can't stop listening to it. Sometimes I have to listen to a CD several times before warming up to it, but I liked No Angel the first time through. The entire CD is strong, and I never get tired of Dido's beautiful voice. I think she sounds a bit like Sade, another artist I really like. There's a good reason Dido's CD is ranked very high on this list and Amazon's top-sellers list.
