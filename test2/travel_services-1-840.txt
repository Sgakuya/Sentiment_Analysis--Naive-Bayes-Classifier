Shafted - Budget Truck told me about these guys - they don't stand up for their cusotmers. I have claims and tried to purchase insurance as I was informed I could - Last minute I find out that I was unable to purchase the insurance I requested. Now I have 14 broken items and Moving Staffers won't return my call December 9, 2005
