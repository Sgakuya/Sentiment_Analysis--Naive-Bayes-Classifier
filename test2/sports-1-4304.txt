Tubby Smith SUCKS as a coach for the most elite program in college basketball. With Kentucky being compared to high performace sports car, Tubby is driving it like a compact piece of junk. We have ZERO top 100 recruits coming in and none on the radar. He let Pitino come to Rupp (his old school) and beat the #1 team in the country.....on talent alone. I pray for the days when I can actually enjoy watching the top talent in college basketball once again put on the UK uniform and dominate basketball the way it should be at the winningest program of all time. I do not know who should coach....but I feel like we are in the Eddie Sutton days all over. Give me the best players available. Play the freshman players. Talent wins and wins consistently. PURE BLUE FOR LIFE.....OUT WITH TUBBY AND HIS SORRY ASSISTANT SAUL!
