Goes to show you how dumb and biased Florida State fans are. The coach is only playing for the record which he doesn't deserve to and won't get. Besides Notre Dame, they play in the weakest conference in America. The college has to help its players through classes because they are too dumb to learn anything. This is one of the most overrated football teams in America and the fans are too dumb to realize skill when they see it. Otherwise, they would like a team from Florida that is actually good such as Miami or Florida. And I hope that everybody that does that gay tomahawk chop gets their arm cut off.
