Jesse Jackson calls himself a minister of the Gospel? A Reverend? How dare he after he gets on national TV and says that he believes in a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Has he ever even picked up his Bible and read it? It sure doesn't sould like it. The Bible tells of many false preachers and what will happen to these people on Judgement Day for misleading God's people. Read your Bible, Mr. Jackson. If you want to be a politician, then call yourself a politician...not a reverend.
