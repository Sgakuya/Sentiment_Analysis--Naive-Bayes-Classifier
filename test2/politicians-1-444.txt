The only reason why Tony got in was because the nation wanted the Conservative party out. His party no longer has the meaning it used to, its turned into another conservative party. The percentage of people voting is at an all time low over here because people have lost all faith with all the parties we have. It has no socialist values at all and theres no balance at all.
