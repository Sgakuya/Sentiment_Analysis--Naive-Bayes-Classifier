Probably the best studio album ever recorded. This album is timeless, deep, inspirational, and multi-layered. The lyrics, the key of the songs, the effects, and the performance, all serve to convey the tension between wanting to grow and be free while being limited and restrained by time, society, work, and, in the end, self-doubt.
