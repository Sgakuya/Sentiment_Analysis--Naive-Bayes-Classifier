I'm extremly sorry and embarrassed to be the first one to say that this series won't help your child, but it really doesn't. Your child learnf if he or she has fun doing it, and Schoolhouse Rock ONLY focuses on teaching your child and not encouraging them to make the right choices. It has bad animation, which isn't good because your child is attracted by bright and colorful things and this isn't. Your child won't understand it because it is set up as a musical, in which some of the words cannot be heard.
