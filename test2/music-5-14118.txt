I personally love Tracy Chapmans' music. She has touched my life in such a way that it would be hard to describe. With such songs as Baby Can I Hold You, and At This Point in My Life, you have to know and realize that this lady has experienced so many of the same things that I have. I feel as though I know her personally simple because I can relate to her music. Even though I know I don't know her, only in the artistic sense, it almost seems as though she is writing about my life because it sounds just like me! THANK GOD FOR TRACY CHAPMAN
