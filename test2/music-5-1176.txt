Here s a CD that took a long time to grow on me. But, like most CDs that take time to appreciate, Summer Teeth has staying power. This is music I ll probably be listening to years from now. I recently saw Jeff Tweedy perform solo at a small place in San Francisco, and it gave me an even greater appreciation of his voice and song-writing.
