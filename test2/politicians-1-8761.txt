I absolutly hate Clinton. I was in the military during his dictatorship and he reduced our pay and benifits. I was a democrat until he came along. Now I am all about Republicans. Republicans take care of the troops. The economy was only great because of Reganomics and had nothing to do with Clinton. He was president during the dot com boom in the early 90's and had nothing to do with Clinton. Clinton in my opinion is the reason for Sept 11th. He did not take Bin Laden when he was offered him buy Sudan. Clinton was bad for the country. He was an embarrasment to all Americans. He could not even keep it in his pants. But that's just my opinion and it will never change.
