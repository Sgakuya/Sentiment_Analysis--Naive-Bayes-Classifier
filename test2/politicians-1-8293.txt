Don't know whose worse Bush or Raygun. Poor old ron was just a mouth piece for those who actually ran the country. If you listen to Reagan speak he sounds alot like bush. I really don't think either has ever had an original thought in there heads. They just speak what is written down for them. The Proof is when you catch them off guard with no written down reply's. The Republicans needed someone to act like a president so they picked an actor. By the way I am not a liberal just someone smarter and more caring about other people than most conservatives. All I have to do is claim to be christian and wrap myself in the flag and I bet I could be President. Well as long as I have good speach writers to.
