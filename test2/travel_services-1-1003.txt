If I could give this company a zero or negative amount, that would be much more appropriate. This company steals, lies, and uses horrible practices in order to make a buck. They reel you in with false amounts (and will even sign papers to the effect, or tell you ou are not allowed to have said paper), and then blackmail you into paying a higher amount to get the stuff off the truck. They broke, lost our stuff and they ruined our couch. A full account (with other peoples accounts) can be read here: http://www.deadwife.com/peopleihate/archives/000005.php
