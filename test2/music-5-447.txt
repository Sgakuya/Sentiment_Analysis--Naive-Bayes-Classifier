I agree with the comments that Californication is showing that RHCP have grown up since they broke into the industry. I think its great that they are coming up with new material instead of trying to do BSSM again. The lyrics, harmonies, guitar and singing are fantastic! Whenever me and my fiance go to our local, at least one song is played and the whole pub is singing. Wonderful album!
