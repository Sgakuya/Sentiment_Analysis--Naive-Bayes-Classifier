They are a last place team and they really did make a bit of a turnaround for a few years. Mets fans were jubilant after they got Burnitz, Vaughn, and Alomar over the off-season. That was before that it came to light they all three would to terribly for the Mets. They have one of the highest payrolls in baseball, but with no chemistry, the team sucks. They had a futile season and have no one to blame but themselves. I have to laugh at the biggest joke of the year.
