Adult contemporary drivel. This is run of the mill pre packaged blah rock. Nothing new to say and no new way of saying it. Just catering to the mainstream goof troop who often mistake sappy lyrics as insperational deep healing ballads.These guys have a vision though. A vision of cold hard cash. Sell out and cash my fellow Tallahasseeans. I saw them live when they used to live in my neighborhood. They are no longer the people I used to know. Whats with all the I AM JESUS crap in their new videos? Self ritiouse much?
