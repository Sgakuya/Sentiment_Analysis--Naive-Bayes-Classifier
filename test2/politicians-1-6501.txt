(Late night TV, June, 2005) Hi everybody, I'm Tom Daschle. If you can remember a time when I was a senator and the Democratic party was not corrupted by special interest groups then you will surely remember all of THESE groups and their number one hits from the 1950s and 1960s, now available in one fabulous package. Stay tuned and for the next half hour my friend John Edwards and I will take you back on a nostalgic trip through time when cars had lots of chrome, the Democratic party was honest, and rock and roll was real music. You'll hear the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, The Ronettes, The Lettermen, John Kennedy, The Coasters, Dion and the Belmonts, Bobby Darin, and so much more. So let's bring out my friend John Edwards and together we'll look back on a time when we were young and full of ideals, the Democratic party stood for middle America, and great music was the cornerstone of our lives.............
