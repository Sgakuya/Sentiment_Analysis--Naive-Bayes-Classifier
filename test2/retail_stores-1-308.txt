Very overpriced, better to go to ebay and buy the same thing for the price it should be. I use to like this store, thinking that it would be a classy lingerie store but when the company put their advertising on Public Tv instead of on Pay per view or HBO where it should of been ..they crossed over to the sleezy side. They pushed their merchandise towards males but the females buy the majority of their own lingerie and we don't buy it hopeing that our partners will get off on the VS models first we buy it so we can be the ones they are focused on. Geeeeesh..what a crock!
