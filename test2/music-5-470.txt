This is a great CD because it combines rock with some slow melodic songs. It is especially good while driving if you play it really loud. Red Hot Chili Peppers made a great CD after a long time out of the studio. Some might say that their old stuff is better, but I think that this is the best one yet! The tunes are catchy and great sing-a-longs.
