Their current Advertising featuring the Moron brothers is insulting. Are all Sonic customers morons? If the adverting agency they use was trying to get people to remember their commercials because they are terrible, then it worked. Then again I think of them when I pass by a Sonic and remember not to stop. There is nothing Sonic about their service. It takes longer in the drive up window than it does to park and order from one of their bays. Frustrating if all you want is a drink. You then feel like you have to tip the carhop, but that's their plan for you. Their toaster sandwiches on Texas toast is terrible, the toast comes out all flat and soaked in what I think is liquid butter most likly painted on wth a brush. I visted their web site and nowhere is there a e-mail link to contact them. They tell you to contact the manager at your local Sonic. It is far easier to post here and let them be ignorant.
