Expensive, below par food. The last time my friend and I ate here we got snubbed by every Woman working in this place. The waitress was so fake, she didn't even play it off good, she would talk to me, ask me what I want to eat, but wouldn't look at me while talking. Her service was much better at the table next to ours, a table full of studly guys got good treatment, us Average mortal Men get the crap service. When we got done eating the greeter by the door said nothing to us, like Have a nice night or Come back again If I wasn't mistaken me and my friend must have been invisable.
