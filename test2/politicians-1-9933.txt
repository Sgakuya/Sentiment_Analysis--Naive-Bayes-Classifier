Too bad there is no rating for ZERO stars! Bush is the WORST President we've ever had, hands down. His popularity has plummetted in the past few months, even amongst huge numbers of Republicons. Just listen to the dufus with a capital D attempt to talk. He comes off as an inarticulate redneck and has fumbled for words more than any President I can remember in my lifetime. This moron has the I.Q. of a garden tool. He is living proof that America has lowered it's standards BIGTIME. The 'dumbing down' of America continues unabated with this embarrassment in office. Anything this guy does is a grand failure. The Iraqi invasion based on WMD LIES, the embarrassing and unethical lack of response for Hurricane Katrina, the environment, creation of jobs (most low wage Wal-Mart and foodservice type positions), record numbers of jobs offshored to India, China,... etc. etc. Rove and company have succeeded in brainwashing legions of 'red state' yahoos into thinking Bush was a good choice, by using petty 'smokescreen politics' such as 'gay marriage', 'Merry Christmas vs. Happy Holidays', 'intelligent design vs. evolution', etc. etc. ... all issues that are an affront to every intelligent thinking American that wishes they would discuss and do something about the MAJOR issues like healthcare, job creation, energy costs, etc. What is telltale is that the areas of the United States that were directly hit on 9/11, mainly New York, Pennsylvania, and D.C. all voted for Kerry, not Bush, in this past election. And i'm just scratching the surface here. Even my 77 year old father, a lifelong Republican retired Medical Doctor, voted against Bush and the Republicons for the first time in his life. To quote my dear dad, "Bush has taken the Republican Party so far to the right, it scares me." 'Nuff said.
