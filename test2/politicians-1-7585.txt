Lincoln was a bastard and a tyrant. He constantly abused his power while in office, and our schools today are filled with propoganda telling of what a great and noble man Honest Abe was. Puke on that. He caused a war between the states that split families apart and killed overwhelming amounts of noble, young americans....why? Money of course. He was determined to get the South back into the Union so he could feed his overgrown, money-hungry, tyrannical federal government with outrageous cotton tarriffs on southern exports. And in all actuality, he was more of a rascist than any slave owner. His emancipation proclamation was issued only to try to punish the states in rebellion. If you haven't actually read it, i encourage you to do so. I'm sure you'll be surprised. He was more of a monster than a man. And if you ask me, John Wilkes Booth should be on the 5 dollar bill, not Lincoln.
