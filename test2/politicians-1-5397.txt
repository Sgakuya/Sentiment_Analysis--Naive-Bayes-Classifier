Whats your freedom worth to you ? If Al Gore Wins then your freedom could be lost forever!The second amendment is my issue. guns dont kill people kill people. If gore wins and abolishes the second amendment then the goverenment controls the people the people no longer control the govornment.I agree that we have a problem with gun violence but whos to blame .NOT THE GUN OWNER if children were raised to respect people and there parents and parent had there children under control i dont think we would have this gun issue.What do we outlaw next butter knives??If you hate to vote for gore then dont!!!!
