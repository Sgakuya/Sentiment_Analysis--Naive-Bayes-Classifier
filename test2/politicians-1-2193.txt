First off, WarGameFan, you are 1 1/2 months late with that comment (and you did not read anything written before you). Second, almost every president has cheated, so don't downrate him for that. You have to downrate him for the fact that his term has been ridden by scandals only somewhat affected by his personal life. Plus, he did a classless thing announcing that he would resign after the election to keep the Democratic party in control. Now, it would take a miracle for the Democrats to keep this seat after the next election. The party as a whole is up in flames and their tight control in New Jersey has dissapeared. This state is swinging towards the Republicans now and unless the Democratic party gets it together, could go Republican in the next presidential election (and gubenatorial of course). McGreevey made some dumb mistakes and has nothing to fall back so that history comes nice on him. He has done nothing. He won't get an historical reprieval like Hoover or Nixon.
