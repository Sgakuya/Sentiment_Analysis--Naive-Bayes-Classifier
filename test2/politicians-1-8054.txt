His presidency is depicted in the history books based more upon a mythology than on any facts. After his first two years in office (the extent of most presidential tenures), FDR had actually worsened the economy (a second depression emerged, higher deficits were incurred, and inflation was rampid), broken most if not all of his campaign promises, and deceived the American public. Additionally, this great liberal was responsible for rounding up Japanese CITIZENS, cartelizing national industry, and provoking Hitler in order to salvage his legacy by forcing the US into war. This man was more like Clinton than Washington or Lincoln.
