This is where MW shows raw talent - no lyrics, just his composition. Great stuff. The record plays like a osundtrack, from a period-war movie (think Glory , The Patriot , with a little Armageddon and Independence Day mixed in). It's inspring stuff, and proof that this man isn't close to quitting yet. Recommended: Freedom (track 1); Hibernia (track 5); The Call (track 10). Check out clips at www.michaelwsmith.com.
