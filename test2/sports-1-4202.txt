Jerry Tarkanian (aka Tark the Shark) was and remains just too dirty ethically, and he coached most of his career at UNLV without steady annual competition within his conference. In fact, I believe that there were some teams in UNLV's conference to which Tark never lost. I realize that we all want our teams to win, but winning every time suggests something is wrong with the opposition. Anyway, this inflated Tark's record, which is impressive by the numbers. Tark amassed a total of 778 wins in 31 years at Long Beach St., UNLV and Fresno St. Jerry Tarkanian was born on August 30, 1930.
