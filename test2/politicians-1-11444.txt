Dumbest senator, now serving, and in the finals for the dumbest senator of all time in the 1789-2005 contest. If you don't believe me, watch her on C-Span. Her performances in the house were even funnier. Californians, who leave the polling place after voting for her, should wear a bag over their heads in shame.
