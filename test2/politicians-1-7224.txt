I get tired of seeing the self-pleasing Jesse Jackson`s face on the television. Everytime he gets a chance he puts his ugly face in front of a camera. This man is no religious man, he is the devil among us. Why is there not a rating less than one star? I would pray that his type vanish from this earth so we may all live together in harmony.
