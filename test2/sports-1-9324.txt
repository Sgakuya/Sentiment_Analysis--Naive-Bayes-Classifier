As a lifelong Knicks fan, I have a lot trouble rooting for them with this guy on the team. He is a complete jerk who has never taken responsibility for his actions. Instead of apologizing with any sincerity, he has blamed everyone (the Warriors, the NBA, his lawyers, his agent, the media) for the problems surrounding his choking and threat to kill PJ. In fact, he still has lawsuits pending with respect to the incident. He is a bad guy and the Knicks will live to regret their decision to give him a huge contract.
