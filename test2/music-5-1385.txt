Another classic. Each song on this CD is amazing and the order they exist in together is a moving experience. Everytime I hear this CD, it is as if I am hearing it for the first time again, amazed at what beautiful music they make. This is my favorite of all U2 CD's. It's so hard to find a CD where you can really say you LOVE every song on it, but this is it!
