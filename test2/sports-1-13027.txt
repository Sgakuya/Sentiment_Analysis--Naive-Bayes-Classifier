All I can say is disappointing, disappointing. What happened to the Cardinals this year?! Somebody better tell Willingham to get Da Farm back in order. Although the miracle win against USC was a bright spot in the Cardinals losing record this year, the Cardinals have disappointed fans this year, adding support to the PAC-10 being a powder puff league. I give them a 1 for not living up to expectations.
