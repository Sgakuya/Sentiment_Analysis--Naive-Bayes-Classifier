His corruption and misguided policies have done incalculable damage. The civil rights legislation was done more for political purposes than a genuine desire for equality. (Lenny Bruce once did a comedy skit saying how Johnson could not pronounce the word Negro without turning it into a racial slur) Credit for the civil rights act should actually go to John Kennedy. It was because Kennedy was so well liked that Johnson (up for election against Goldwater in '64) seized the opportunity to pay tribute to the slain president, knowing in that vein, the legislation would pass in spite of the Dixiecrats who still opposed the idea. Probably the most colorful aspect of Johnson's presidency were his home spun sayings. My personal favorite is when Johnson was trying to convey that someone was not very intelligent, he said He couldn't pour piss out of a boot if the instructions were printed on the heel.
