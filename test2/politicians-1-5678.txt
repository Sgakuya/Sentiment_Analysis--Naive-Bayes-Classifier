If I could rate her as any worse I would. That I rate her a one puts me to shame for labeling other things one. If I could give her a lesser rating, I would give her about a -3. To be honest, she terrifies the hell out of me because she combines the three political evils: she is a communist, she is a facsist, and she has not a bit of the capitalist in her. I find her face unpleasant to look at, but that is the most beautiful thing about her. Billy boy was definatley her better half, and I have no idea why he would stay with her! He has a conscience (he ignores it but he obviously has one). She is the sum of all evil in the world. She capitalizes on feminists and abortionists, and other Democrat demogouges.
