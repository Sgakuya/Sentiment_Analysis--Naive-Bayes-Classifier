The fact of the matter is that the Beatles never put out a bad album. Let it Be is right up there with their other classics, while not as widely known and popular. The title track along with Across the Universe, Long and Winding Road, and Get Back are all great songs. It has a bit of sentimental being their final album. Overall though, definitely deserving of the 5-star rating.
