This woman has to be the biggest polarizer (and liar) in America. Now, she is bitching that FEMA should not be a part of Homeland Security. HELLO? YOU VOTED FOR IT! The Democrats are complaining that the Homeland Security Dept is another massive bureaucratic agency. Well, if we look back, the Democrats were hounding President Bush to create this after the 9/11 commission's report. Are you admitting you made a mistake, Hillary? I hope she gets the Democratic nomination in 2008. That will mean a sure victory for the Republican Party no matter who is nominated.......they should save the big guns for another time.
