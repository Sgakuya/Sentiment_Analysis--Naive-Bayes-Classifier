I remember hearing SP on june 1st 1967, the day it was released in the UK, when I was 16. I knew that things would never be the same for me again and that album changed my entire life - now that's influential! Today I have many hundreds of CD's vinyl albums but this is the greatest one by the greatest, most original talented bands of all time.
