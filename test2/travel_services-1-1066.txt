World Moving services told me that their only job was to schedule a reputable local moving company to transport my belongings from LA. to FL. (to act as an agent). I paid them more than $1000 to do this. The local moving company, Jenn and Greg's moving out of San Antonion, Texas is who WM scheduled for me. (Jenn and Greg's received the other $1200.) Both companies were amazingly difficult to deal with, one saying it's the other's fault and no one taking responsibility for what went wrong. The mover showed up one day late and two hours late that day. I stress that ONE mover showed up to moved a fully furnished 3rd floor apt. The moving co. was informed that they would need at least two movers (for my heavy furniture) and a pulley system to remove my couch over my balcony since it would not fit through the front door. They told me there would be an extra charge for this and I agreed. Then ONE mover showed up with little equipment and took no action to get my couch out. It took him more than 5 hours to move my boxes alone, and creeping up on my deadline to be out of the apt, I called friends for help. It took 3 of my friends and their equipment to remove my heavy furniture and the couch over the balcony. The owner, Greg, offered me $150 for my friends' time and nothing more. It took more than 8 hours for the mover to put all my items in his truck. I was told it would take 3 hours for the entire job. Once it arrived in Florida, 2 days late, SIX of my boxes were missing and several pieces of furniture were damaged. When I told Greg about this, he said he wasn't allowed to offer any more compensation for my troubles, because World Moving told him so. I asked WM and of course, they denied they ever told Greg that. I feel that for $2200, I should have received better customer service, ALL of my belongings on time, and maybe an apology. I highly recommend NOT using World Moving Services or Jenn and Greg's Moving.
