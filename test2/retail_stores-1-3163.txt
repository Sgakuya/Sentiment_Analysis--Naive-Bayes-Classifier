Netflix starts off good and quickly turns sour. Their advertised policy of unlimited rentals is not the case. The more you watch, the slower they are to send you new movies. A comparison between a new account and an old account shows that new accounts get priority on movies (they are never listed as having a wait). Their customer service is difficult to get a hold of and consists of scripted emails and voice responses. Don't waste your money on Netflix.
