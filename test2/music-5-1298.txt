Once again, Ruby is way ahead of me. For many years I had passed off most of this album as mediocre at best. But Bowie WAS in a groove and it's taken time for me to tap into that groove. Moonage Daydream, Star and Hang Onto Yourself are all spectacular and under-appreciated. And Bowie certainly did his homework in creating the Ziggy Stardust character; elements of Brian Jones, Hendrix, Morrison... and Bowie brings out the tragedy and decadence of that glittery stardom. It's quite touching really. The band plays up a storm, Bowie is a fearless and relentlessly creative songwriter... let the children boogie.
