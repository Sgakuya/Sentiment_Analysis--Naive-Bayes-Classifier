It's fun listening to Clarke, Joe Wilson, and several others coming out of the woodwork writing anti-Bush books. They basically say, If they would've listened to me and done xyz, we wouldn't be having these terrorist problems. Selling books and sheer ego are the reasons a majority of people believe Clarke is a rank opportunist.
