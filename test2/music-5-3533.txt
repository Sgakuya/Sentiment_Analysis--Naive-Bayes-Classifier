This album is the culmination of an idea that began with Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. It is pure genius!!! The lyrics, the chords, the song structure, the theme, the images... they all come together to convey an important message: don't let the pressure of society, your past, and even your present status as a rock star (in the case of the fictional Pink), separate you from those that really care, as well as from yourself and your dreams. It will only lead to maddness! Yet, the Wall also tells us that there is a way out of this madness, tear down the wall. Depressing but true. Also, musically, one of the most perfect concept albums ever recorded!
