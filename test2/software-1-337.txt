Yet another Mico$oft approximation of a real OS. Even worse than its predecessors. It's slow, unstable, awkward, and incredibly limited. I don't think the interface is anything other than cute. It certainly isn't easy to use for anything important. I have one Windows machine upon which I do nothing by run Quicken, and a Unix machine upon which I do everything else. I'm about to say goodbye to Bill Gates and Company forever and buy myself an Apple. OS X is a Unix variant and Apples and Mac OS has always been light years ahead of PCs and Wondoze.
