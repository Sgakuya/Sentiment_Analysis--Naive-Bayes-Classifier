BLECHHHH! One of our worst presidents, that's for sure. I agree 100% with ellajedlicka_21 on the Medical Research page that REAGAN is partly to blame for watching thousands of innocents die of AIDS and NOT CARE! It's his fault! Someone's got to take the blame, and I swear to God that I'll make CERTAIN that it's HIM!!! The frontman of the greatest band in history died of AIDS, and REAGAN sat back and watched him suffer. And just because the poor man was gay, REAGAN decided, Oh, nobody cares about this, it's just a gay and druggie disease. BZZZZT! BZZZZT! BZZZZT! WRO-ONG! No one, not Freddie Mercury, not anyone else, deserves to suffer like that! Ronald Reagan, not John Tyler, was our REAL Acting President . How can anyone like this s.o.b! He is THE DEVIL! He did NOTHING good, he could have caused another Depression. It's ALL HIS FAULT!
