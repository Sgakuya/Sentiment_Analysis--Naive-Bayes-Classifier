When i first listened to Led Zep i never really thought anything of it but as i got older i started noticing how good it was. I was too caught up in new age type of music to actually see the good quality of his singing and music. His musics so basic that it's actually really good, no other band can match it's style, music, and sound. They difinately brought cruddy old rock into a new era i dont know what would've become of rock if they hadn't stepped up to bat and kicked ass. I know they probly dont have their music down as good as some newer rock groups but back then they are at the pennicle of their heights and new music that people rate better then led zep probly would've never existed without led zep's influence of overly empowering rock music. Every tune they come up with seems to be from some other world, and it brings everyone into it very well. Songs like Stairway to Heaven, and Dazed and Confused make sure of that. They deserve a 5 star.
