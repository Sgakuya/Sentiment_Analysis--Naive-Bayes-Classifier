How's this for Carolina thinking it is better than everybody else? - WE ARE! Do the research - we are better than every school in almost every category. Seriously, objectively, why wouldn't we think Carolina is better than everybody? Be logical! We might urk the hell out of you, but that doesn't mean we're wrong. Visualize this: you had your 3 season hoops window and didn't take advantage of it. Now think about our current squad. Now think of us having possibly the best recruiting class in the history of basketball in '05-'06. And don't forget McCants' pledge to stay 4 years , that he made yesterday. Not to be outdone by May, who said earlier this month, and I quote, Even if I have a banner year, I will most definitely be back for my senior season. Your second place finish last season was your high water mark.- it's over. You are the sh&t on our Nikes and always will be. Oh yeah, looks like you can't even beat us in football now. Rivals? Yeah, rivals like the Knicks were to Jordan's Bulls.
