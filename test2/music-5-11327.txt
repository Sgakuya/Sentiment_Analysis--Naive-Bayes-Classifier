This Album is actually Marc's 3rd english album. His first was in 1991 called "When the Night Is Over" with Louie Vega and the 2nd was his self-titled album in 1999. I love this album "Mended". It has some ballads and has alot of upbeat songs. His sings amazing in all the songs. My favorites on there are She Mends Me, Everything You Do, Give Me A Reason, Do You Believe In Loneliness, I've Got You,and I need you.
