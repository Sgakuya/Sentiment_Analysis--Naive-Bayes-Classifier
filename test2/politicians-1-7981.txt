The creator of the American welfare state on the domestic side. On the foregn side, he was one of several world leaders who stood by and watched Hitler sweep through Eastern Europe. Only a surprise attack on the American Naval base at Hawaii jolted FDR to military action. After the war, he allowed communist Russia to enslave all countries east of Germany in the chain of communism, setting up decades of unmitigated slaughter of innocents. Awful.
