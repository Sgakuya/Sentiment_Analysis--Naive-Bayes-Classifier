A megalomaniac with a thirst for blood and power. Saddam Hussein had great dreams of glory for Iraq, indeed, he saw himself as something of a latter day Nebuchenezzar, the ancient Babylonian emperor who ruled the Middle East. Here was a man who was born to rural poverty only rise in the Ba'ath party network to prominence. In a way, it was a stroke of luck that he made it alive and to the top, considering that politics in that part of the world is literally a blood sport. He became President of Iraq in 1979 and subsiquently began foreign wars of conquest in Iran and Kuwait respectively. Saddam's had two real goals in starting both the Iran-Iraq war and the Kuwait war. One was to establish a reliable connection to the Persian Gulf to ship out petroleum. The second was to consolidate his control over Iraq by invoking nationalism; there is obviously a personal component to this, he wanted to personify himself as a great military commander. Truth of the matter is, like his personal hero Josef Stalin, his medling in military matters ended up costing his army dearly. Still, even after Iran and Persian Gulf War he managed to hold on to power by way of mass massacre of his political opponents. Whole groups of people were subjected to genocide; witness his gassing of the Kurds in 1988 in retaliation of support for Iran or his repression of the Southern Marsh Arabs, who were suspected of rising against the regime after Persian Gulf War. The US supported Saddam through the 1980's in his war against Iran; we supplied him with weapons during that period. We were not exactly friendly with Iraq, but we did have diplomatic relations. Saddam attacked Kuwait with the understanding that the US would stay out of the conflict, another misreading of international politics. Saddam had the potential of de-stabilizing oil markets throughout the Middle East as a result of his plans of expansion in the region. As a result we rid Kuwait of the Iraqi army in 1991 and proceeded to establish a deterrent presence in the region to check Saddam's army. Saddam continued to rule with an iron fist, but deterrence de-fanged Saddam; even if he had weapons, he would have been unable to attack Israel or any other Arab country for that matter. The security threat was minimal, links to terrorism were weak; indeed there are other states that sponsor more terrorism than Saddam. The primary reason why we invaded Iraq in 2003 was that Iraq has began trading petroleum in euros rather than dollars; the thinking went that we needed to pre-empt this move towards establishing the euro as an oil transaction standard. We invaded primarily to establish control of these oil fields to give us leverage against OPEC when dealing with the Europeans. The wisdom of this strategy was weak in that the movement in foreign government funds towards the Euro has actually increased; in the long term, we weaken our position by not negotiating a currency band to trade oil for currency. But enough about macroeconomic policy; this is about Saddam. Really the public reasons to liberate Iraq were to liberate the people and to destroy Saddam's WMD program. The first count was a noble goal, but ultimately it's not our responsibility to be the great liberators. Such a philosophy leads to arrogance and hubris, as it always has throughout history. On the WMD and terrorism charge, Saddam didn't have anything that would have been a major threat to the US by a long shot, we informed the world that our intelligence agencies had proof of Saddam's WMD programs, but it turns out that a lot of it was based on hearsay. This has kind of weakened our credibility in the world. The bottom line is that we desposed this guy because he happened to be sitting on top of the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world. He was relatively weak and easy to hit off, so we did it. Saddam, who wasn't a nice character by any stretch of the imagination, was deposed, but the political situation remains very fluid and the issues involving the petro-dollar are far from resolved. In the aggregate, our strategic situation has been weakened by this war.
