Shroomwoman - an excellent idea to have a place called Big Willies . A new strip club just opened up here in Seattle called the Golden Banana, maybe now if they'd serve some shi**y bird wings, women would have their equivallent to Hooters. A good point in Hooter's favor is that alteast they provide the Hooter's Hoochies with a place to keep warm. The street corner must be cold at night. Fortunately for me, I can enjoy the benefits of having ample credentials to be employed by Hooters, but I also have a functioning brain, which I use at my office.
