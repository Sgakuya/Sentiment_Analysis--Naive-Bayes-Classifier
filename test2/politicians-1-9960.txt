First of all, I despise him and all of his family, second of all, I cannot believe that people actually considered even voting for him, jnless you are wealthy or from Texas. Second of all, the war in Iraq, I deffinately didn't need to happen. I mean, innocent soldiers are dying, and for what? So we can help other people when we have our own problems at home!? I really think that he needs to get a grip and look at the real American life because he obviously doesn't know what it's like or he would help change it,if he even cared about America. Or maybe he just wants to follow in Daddy's footsteps. I don't know, but I don't like how he's running. Thank god it's almost over...
