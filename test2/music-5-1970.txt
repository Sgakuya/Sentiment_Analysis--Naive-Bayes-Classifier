I don't know how else to explain this CD other than it being just one of the best CDs that have come out in recent times. Our Lady Peace is a band that continually strives towards making NEW material and not just relying on tricks of the past to continue their album sales. In the US the first single was Life, which showcases OLP's unique ability to use synth-line backgrounds in harmony with REAL drums and not just someone working on a drum machine. In Canada, most people have heard In Repair as the first single, which also features a great synth background and even church bell-like sounds which make it a great song. The lyrics on Spiritual Machines are also great, and even in the liner that comes with the CD you can see the changes that they went through with the edit marks written on them. Other songs on here are also just as good, from the chilling All My Friends to the soft ballad-style Are You Sad, this CD delivers everytime and won't leave your CD player for a long time! GO BUY IT!
