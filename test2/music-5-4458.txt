The most inspirational, high energy concert I have EVER been too. The music and talent in the band, especially Lucia who is one with her violin, add depth and strength to an already incredible vocal performance. The interaction and connection with his audience & FoJG compare to no other. He is at one with his fans and is the first to admit he's just human and in his eyes you see the love that he has for his art!
