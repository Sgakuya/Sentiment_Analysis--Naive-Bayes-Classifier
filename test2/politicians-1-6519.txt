Senator Dascle has to be one of the most idiotic, stupid, retarded person I know. Its completely ludacris to even think that Dascle is a Democrat. He isn't. He just votes on everything that is against what the Republicans are saying. Stupid idiot, saying he is deeply saddened by Bush's actions . For a politician to say that, when he himself supported the Clinton strike against Iraq in 1998 is appaling. Lying liberal idiot.
