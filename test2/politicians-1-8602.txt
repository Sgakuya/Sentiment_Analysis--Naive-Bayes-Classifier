He borrowed more money than anyone in the history of man, and didn't pay back a dime. He didn't want big government to interfere with federally insured S Ls while their operators pulled off the biggest bank heist in history right under his nose. He funded Latin American dictators who tortured or killed tens of thousands with drug trafficking and treasonous arms sales to our archenemy Iran. The list of disgraceful failures, lies and blunders is longer than Rush Limbaugh's belt. Is there any way I can rate this guy a zero or maybe a negative number?
