Only reason Lincoln was not the worst President is that Wilson was elected later! Lincoln was a virtual dictator and started a whole war to introduce the merchantile system of England and a government based on political patronage. We now have a government which takes from the poor and gives to the rich. The abolitionists were being funded by the Merchantile interests starting in the 1830s in order to create sectional animosity The Merchantile interests combined with the midwestern free soil movement, which wanted to ban slavery, not to keep slaves out of their states but to keep black people out of their states, as they already had laws prohibiting the residence of free blacks, but could not prevent an individual from bring their property into those states!
