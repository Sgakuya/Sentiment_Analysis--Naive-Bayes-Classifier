I don't get it... why is the media on this man's balls? I watch him on TV and I am not impressed. He won 2 Superbowls, but he is just part of a good offense and plan. Put him on the Browns and he sucks. I can't wait til Brady shows his true colors on a crap team THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tom Brady is the most overhyped player in sports. The reason why he's good is because he's on a good offense. Adam Vinateri won his games for him. Why? because he kicked 3 field goals that gave him the super bowl trophies. In fact I hate the entire Patriots team. they won 3 super bowls by a grand total of NINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tom Brady sucks. I don't care what people say how good he is.
