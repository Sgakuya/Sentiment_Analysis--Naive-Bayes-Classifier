The worst movers I've ever seen! Should be named two lazy crack heads and a truck. These guys put holes in walls and ceilings, damaged the lawn by putting huge gashes in it from the truck, scratched the hard wood floors, and damaged personal items. Took 3 guys and MYSELF 12 hours to complete an estimated 7 hour job (Estimated were from 2 other companies also) because 2 of the guys were too lazy to do any work. One of them never left out of the truck until the last hour and a half. Even one of the workers opted not to charge us for the whole amount because it should have only taken 7 hours, 8 at most. Company owner still wants to charge us for 5 extra hours of work and for boxes we never used. Company owners also illegally charged our credit card for the remaninding disputed amount without permission nor notification. Shady business in Charlotte, NC. Would not recommend these guys to my enemies!!!
