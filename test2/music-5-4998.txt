what an inspiration! my 15 year old daughter named sherrie and i loved this song. by the way i don't listen to country music. sherrie died on 072900. she was ijected from the back of a pickup while visting her best friend in colorado. this was the last song we shared together. We argued about the radio stations and what songs to hear on the radio we agreed on this song. what a gift to know that she would want me her mother to give faith a chance and not let some hell bent heart live me bitter and finally to dance instead of sitting it out. i feel this song was written for me. whenever i feel i can't go on i listen to the song and i know that sherrie would want me to go on and not take the path of least resistance. you saved my life with this song. thank you and i know sherrie thanks you too from the heavens above. This song is mean't for a child from a parent. i know that. instead it is from my child to her mom. what a gift. it gets my whole family through this ordeal. my husband and sherrie's little brother he's eight yrs old. we even have the book. please i just want to say thank you!
