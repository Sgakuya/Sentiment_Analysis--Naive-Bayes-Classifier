And I thought slick Willie was bad. This guy didn't just cheat, he cheated on a guy. He has been accused of sexual harrassment by New Jersey's former Homeland Security Advisor. A shame that in a state where 700 people were killed on 9-11, this lying, cheating loser named a guy who was unqualified to protect New Jersey. And now he admits cheating on a man. A real disgrace to humanity.
