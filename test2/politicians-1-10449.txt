Let me understand this: he wants to eliminate dividend taxes because -- according to what he said in his State of the Union Address -- the elderly rely upon dividends as income? Huh? If older Americans are relying on dividends, that means that they've invested their money very, very poorly (should be in low-risk funds at that point in their life). This is a human (barely) who has never had to work for anything in his life, has a mediocre cabinet (Ashcroft and Rumsfeld offset Powell), and has killed every corporate endeavor with which he's ever been associated.
