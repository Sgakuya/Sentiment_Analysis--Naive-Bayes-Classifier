Politician? Well, if the definition of a politician is someone who tries to cooperate or finding a commonwith other citizens and leaders just so that he can secretly keep killing mankind, then he fits the bill. Oh, and finding a common level with citizens, I stand corrected on that remark. If he truly did, he would stop the numerous forms of eradication on his own people. Iraquis are slaves to Saddam. PERIOD.
