So far W has managed to make legal abortions more difficult, reward big biz by abolishing a mandate to protect workers from repetitive stress injuries (which are extremely common), and push an excessive tax-cut which, now that the campaign is over, he admits favors the most wealthy individuals. His campaign promise to work towards bipartisanship has yet to occur with any sincerity, and he just seems to get smirkier and smirkier . . . I do not believe the man is a reprobate, but just because he no longer drinks and does blow is no reason to think he brings moral character back to the whitehouse. Being less sleazy than Clinton is not an actual achievement.
