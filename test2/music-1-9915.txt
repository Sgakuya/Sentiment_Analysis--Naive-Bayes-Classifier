Who is more annoying, Mandy Moore or Christina Aguilera? Of course they're good-looking, otherwise music industry executives wouldn't have chosen them and others like them as vehicles for marketing an almost indistinguishable array of vile, dangerously catchy, ultimately lifeless, pop music. I frequently ask if people are really that stupid and spineless, and the answer is yes, we really are.
