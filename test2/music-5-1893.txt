I really enjoy this album! I don't see why people say she's whining; like *you* never wanted an ideal life? or *you* never felt heart broken, and just layed down and yammered on to a friend? Gwen Tony Tom and Adrian are real; and they make wonderful music and get paid a cool amount to do so. So, they have no worries..they're amazing and thats that.
