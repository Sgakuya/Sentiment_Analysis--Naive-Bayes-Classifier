Nasty, greasy burgers, drowning in sauce-- practically a lardshake on a bun! The rest of the menu doesn't cut it, either. And their advertising campaign borders on nauseating. The sight and sound of some slob chewing on those drippy sandwiches-- WITH THEIR MOUTH OPEN-- makes me want to vomit, not eat. Give me the perfection of an In 'n' Out Double Double. Now THAT'S a hamburger!!!
