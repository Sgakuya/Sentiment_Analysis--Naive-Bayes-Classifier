Unfortunately, I can't give these people a zero star rating. This is simply the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. Me and my brother paid $15.00 for a large pepperoni and a 2-liter a while back. First, the pizza didn't arrive until an hour and half later on a freakin Tuesday evening!! When the pizza finally arrives, we open the box to find this sorry, wimpy pizza with a good 1/2 inch of bland crust topped with a paper thin layer of tasteless cheese and very few toppings. I have never ordered a worse pizza in my life. How Domino's has managed to stay in business all these years is a complete mystery. I wouldn't pay 99 cents for another pizza from them.
