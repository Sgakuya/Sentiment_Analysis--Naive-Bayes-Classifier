Kobe sucks! He is the most selfish person the league has ever seen! The reasons he scores as many points as he does are...ballhog, 20 free throws a game when not even getting fouled, WIDE open shots because Shaq gets triple teamed, and he plays 45 minutes a game! He is a baby that cries about everything! If he has a bad game (likely) there is ALWAYS an idiotic excuse! He is the most over-rated player in the NBA! If you want to see the best...tune into the Raptors games! Oh and uh...Kobe can't even shoot 3's! It's very sad. Could you people imagine Vince playing for the Lakers??? God spared the rest of the NBA teams for keeping VC away from LA!
