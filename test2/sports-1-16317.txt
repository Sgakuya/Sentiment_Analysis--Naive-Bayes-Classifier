Does anyone remember a basketball player by the name of Dennis Rodman who used dye his hair funny colors and basically act like a jerk to everyone? Between the cellphone call, the Desparate Housewives incident, insulting his own quarterback, and now fist fights with his own players he is quickly becoming the Dennis Rodman of the NFL. He has absolutely no sense of sportsmanship, I'm now officially embarassed to have him on my team, and I wish I could give him a zero raiting. The worst part is he could have been one of the greats.
