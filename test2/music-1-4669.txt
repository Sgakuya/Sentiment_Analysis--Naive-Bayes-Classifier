Dave Matthews Band concert was horrible. He looked like he hadn't slept for days with his dark eyes all glazed over. He barely even talked to the sold out crowd and looked bother to be there. To be honest, I was bothered to be there. I will never go to another DMB concert again and my advice to you is to spend your money on something else
