George w. Bush does not know anything about being a good president. He thinks that lowering taxes is more important than preserving the world. Not only does he plan to drill in Alaska's national parks, but now he has decided to dispose of Clinton's rules for saving forests from logging. He does not care about the earth and I will never respect him because of that. At least Gore would have done more to preserve our planet.
