Below is the comment I had left prior and had rated them a 5. I wouldn't spit on Bruce Ratner if he was on fire. He has no sense of commitment or obligation to his community. He is blinded by spreadsheets and short term bills. Take your pathetic team to Brooklyn! You're no longer wanted in Jersey. I loved this team through all the crappy years and now finally when we are right on the brink of something large they have a yardsale and backup the trucks. I hope you rot in hell Ratner! ************************************ Love my Nets! They need to sign Kenyon and get rid of Kittles; sign another shooting guard. Im going to be devastated if they move to Brooklyn and that's what seems is going to happen after years of putting up with all the poor lousy seasons- they finally put together some strong teams and they're leaving... If they don't sign Martin and start a $#@$# yardsale instead of staying competitive I will rescore them a 1 star but as of now they came one basket from putting away the team that beat the best of the West- they're damn good.
