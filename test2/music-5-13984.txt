Here's something I just don't get. Why doesen't this group win more awards? I watch almost every music award show but Savaage garden is rarley even nominitated. I find this just plane strange. This is the only music group I've seen that scans such a large age group. People from my younger brothers age (28) to my dads age (57) like Savage garden. I watch t.v. shows like Vh1s The list and in catagorys like best new group (and similar caragories) this band isn't even mentioned. I just don't get it.
