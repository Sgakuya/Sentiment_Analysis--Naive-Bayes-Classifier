Would somebody please tell Al Gore to stop the whining?! Haven't we the taxpayers spent enough money investigating immoral acts the Democrats have done the past eight years? Whitewater, Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Jennifer Flowers, corrupt campaign contributions from the Far East..and now Florida. Yeh, we need him as President.
