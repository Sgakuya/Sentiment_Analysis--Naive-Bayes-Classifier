There you DUKIES go again, raving about the POWER of JJ Redick. The guys got OK skill. Dukies just love to compare Redick to others. I saw a guy comparing him to Jackie Manuel. You can't compare a defensive with a forward. THERE is nothing to compare. Personally, if ya all wanna talk about Redick talk about the cheap push offs he gets. WATCH YA BACK DUKIES, the heels got skill even though there a freshmen team that just lost 7 of there players.
