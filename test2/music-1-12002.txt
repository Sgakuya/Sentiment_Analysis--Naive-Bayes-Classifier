Now you know! Destiny's Child absolutely sucks. They have absolutely no talent, and should be forced to compensate the public for having to put up with them. True, Beyonce does look quite stunning, but just because SHE looks good, doesn't mean she can sing. The other girls can't sing either. Their voices are very flat, and there is never any variation in the pitch of their voices, they just sing low, just as if they were hollering at you. It is also obvious that they have no writing capabilities. I'm not sure if they write their songs or if someone else does, but they suck. They all sound exactly alike. A LIITLE STORY: One time my girlfriend asked me to figure out which Destiny's child song was playing. I said one song, she said a different song, and it turned out to be neither one of the songs we chose. It is time for music companies to get on their p's and q's and bring America some real talent. Whatever happened to the days of the Isley Brothers, Anita Baker, Sade, Jimmy Smith, you know, real talent. Destiny's Child sucks. I wish there was a 0 rating on here b/c they absolutely suck.
