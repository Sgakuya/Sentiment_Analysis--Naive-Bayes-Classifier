I loved the first CD and am thrilled that the 2nd CD, although totallly dif from the 1st is even better! There is much more maturity in the music and the guys blend better! Noone writes like Rob does and this CD proves it! One of the few CD's that I can listen to the whole way through and love every song on it. Rock on guys!
