But of course you need to bear in mind that calling someone a maniacal fascist doesn't prove that's what they really are. And the fact that Clinton was president during prosperous times doesn't prove that he brought about that prosperity. It could have been due, instead, to business and technology factors at play during his presidency. If you want to credit Clinton for the prosperity that occurred during his tenure, then you must also credit him with the recession that began before he left office.
