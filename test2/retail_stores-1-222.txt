I am a Banana Republic employee, and I emplore you not to shop there. They exploit their workers, forcing us to work longer hours than scheduled (sometimes unpaid) and schedule us at unsafe hours (it is simply dangerous for me to take the NYC subway to work at 3:30 in the morning). The clothing is horrible quality, and it is all made in sweatshops. If employees seem like they are not helpful enough, it is because we are overworked and often cannot attend to customers because we are trying to do the jobs of two people because they won't pay for enough workers (we do not work on comission, so it really doesn't pay for us to spend time with customers). Also, DO NOT GET THE BR CREDIT CARD! The interest rate is sky high and it's just another way for this terrible corporation, Gap Inc, to keep consumers in a spiral of debt.
