This man is a great example of whats wrong with our leadership.He voted against civil rights,against gays, and when thousands of innocent people were being killed, he was hiding in a bunker.If our leaders would step out from behind thier barracades and live in the real world like the rest of us,we might see a little more concern for the future from them.
