Fox US Rent A Car I will never do again! US rent a car failed to pick me up at my pick up! This car rental company knew they were late when I called and said someone was on the way. I again called US rent a car up 20 minites later and they said I was not at my pick up! I waited 40 minutes for nothing. I asked the bell hop if this is where they pick up he said yes and said he never saw them drive through. I figured someone was running behind on thier pick ups and to cover thier @ss they just moved on to the next pick up. So much for the great customer service of US Rent a Car.
