Extremely poor customer service and the food is not that great. I ordered 2 take-out dinners and a dessert recently. When I arrived home we discovered there was no bread in the order. When I called the restaurant the mgr. on duty advised that we had to ASK for bread. I said, I paid $17 plus and I have to ASK for bread??! Silly me, I thought it came with the meal. Food is overpriced anyway and we will NEVER return there.
