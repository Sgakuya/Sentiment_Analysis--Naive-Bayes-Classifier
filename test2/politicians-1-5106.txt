sure he made a great speech last night (thanks to his speech writers) but it was typical gore. dont beleive a word of it america. it was calculated to make him appear presidential and stately because he intends to run again in 04. all this man has ever wanted is to be president and he will do whatever it takes to achieve this goal(the past month will attest to that). He clearly only has his own interests at heart, not the country and will undoubtedly go down as one of the most villified political characters in american history. he has been a liar his entire political life and america definately deserves than this. 8 years of the morally bankrupt brothers is enough. he is nothing but a lying sack of shit and he has definately gotten what he has deserved. america deserves better.
