They installed the wrong carpet and will not replace it even though the paperwork was correct. When we placed the order, we handed them the sample of the carpet we wanted and they had us sign paperwork for the correct carpet. Later they phoned us with the actual price and said it was the price for buckskin which we assumed was the name of the sample we had given them, but was actually a completely different carpet in a different color - switch and bait is what it is called in the legal world.
