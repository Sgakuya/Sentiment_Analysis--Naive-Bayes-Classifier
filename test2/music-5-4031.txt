I can't describe the feeling I get when I listen to this, but I will make an attempt! I grew up on about half of these songs (all the ones on Greatest Hits and I'm Goin' Down and Downbound Train ) and I always had taken them for granted. That is, until I got the CD! I listened to this CD the same night I bought Born to Run , so right after Jungleland I was like okay, how can anything compare after Jungleland ! I was about to find out! Yes, it's a more commercialized pop album than Born to Run , but that didn't stop me from falling completely in love! I found myself unable to resist any of the songs, the ones I'd heard two million times before, and the ones I'd never heard before! There is some kind of magic about this album, and I was definitely under it's effect! This is such excellent music, and it really speaks to me and my life. True I don't Work on the Highway or ride with my buds to Darlington County . In truth I've lived so few of the experinces of Bruce's characters on this album, but It's my memories of songs like I'm Goin' Down , Downbound Train , Dancing in the Dark , and My Hometown that really ring true. I can't think of anything wrong with any of the songs except that there are not enough of them! I have listened to them so many many times before, and will again undoubtedly! If you truly love Bruce, then you will love this! I know some fans who don't, but then they don't really appreiciate the album that converted so many into fans in the first place! This is classic 80s rock, but it DOES NOT sound dated even slightly, save the memories we attach to it! I love the Boss, and this is a brilliant album. It has been known to upift me from many a bad mood, and always puts a very bright smile on my face! Plus, if you listen to Cover Me and look at the album liner pictures, he is really handsome! I get chills. But that is of course not even close to the only thing Bruce has going for him, and I recommend this album to anyone, you'll see for yourself! My reviewing in no way does this album justice! Take everything I said and multiply it by about 15 million (I think around the # of copies sold? Maybe I'm wrong on that statistic...) but don't just trust me, get it for yourself, and be prepared to be moved, and to know why so many of us love Bruce!
