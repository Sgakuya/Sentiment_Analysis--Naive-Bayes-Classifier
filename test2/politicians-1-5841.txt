I would first like to applaud LOTF1955 for the courageous (and correct words) about having a clear alternative. It only makes sense for the Democratic party to go left...and it will lead to their ultimate demise. Left-leaning policies haven't worked in the past, and they will continue to fail because they go against human nature. Nancy Pelosi will push the party down that path, and that is fine by me. Unfortunately, I am from her district, and she will always represent it. I love her anti-war stance, and I will love it even more when the war is a success and she looks like a bigger fool than she already looks like. Nancy, you suck, get off of the national stage before you look like even more of an idiot.
