Clinton exceeds even Nixon in lowering the standards and bringing shame to the office of the Presidency. Yes, we've had a wonderful economy during his presidency -- thank Microsoft and the Internet for that. Clinton's legacy is the debasing of the office, the violations of the rule of law, the politicizing of the Department of Justice , and the corrupting of America's soul. Way to go, Bill... that's some legacy!
