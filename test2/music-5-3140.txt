Though on the surface it appears as merely one of the greatest collection of songs ever, Who's Next was the result of Townshend's ongoing Lifehouse Project. This is topped by few as far as greatness of songs on an album goes. You can't go wrong with songs like Going Mobile, Bargain, Baba O'Riley, and the classic epic Won't Get Fooled Again. The raw power displayed on this album makes it one of the top ever. This is pinnacle of the Who's success and it is just the apex of their greatness.
