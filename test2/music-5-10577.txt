This CD is awesome! It's truly loaded with different sounds. I especially like the mix of music in One Night Man. Unless you have listened to this CD (and I mean REALLY LISTENED, not just one quick go through), you won't know what you're missing. Ricky's sensuality really comes through load and clear.
