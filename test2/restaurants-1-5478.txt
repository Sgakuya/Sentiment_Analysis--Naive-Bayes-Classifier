When I went to college in Ohio many years ago, this was one of two places in town. We used to joke that the meat was actually kangaroo (before Outback existed or was ever heard of)... recently went to the local one here in northern New England and while the meat is no longer kangaroo, I think they have switched to elephant or something equally tough. Bad bad bad and designed mainly for those who think unlimited buffets are a worthwhile endeavor...
