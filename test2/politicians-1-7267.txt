Jesse Jackson is an evil man. He masquerades as a minister but is in fact anathema to everything good about religion. I can't imagine any legitimate faith ordaining him as a minister. His title of Reverend is absurd and illegitimate. The only thing he is a minister of is hate, racism, divisiveness, dishonesty, fearmongering and cynicism...and stupidity. I'll grant he is a minister of these things. He does not speak for a majority of African Americans. I know this by asking every African American friend and acquaintance I have and NOT ONE of them respects Jackson or believes he is good for black America, or America in general. His comments are so racist, so stupid, so transparent and so self-serving that I can't believe he can utter them with a straight face. He is a liar, a hater, a charletan and a fraud. I wish the African American community would publicly and forcefully disown him and repudiate his hate and vitriolic rehetoric. Jesse Jackson is a dishonest and hateful man, incapable of rational thought and comment, and a traitor to his race. He is a Judas, and his hateful and moneygrubbing selfish motives for spreading his hate are obvious. Jesse Jackson, shut up and leave America...you are only doing harm. You make me sick.
