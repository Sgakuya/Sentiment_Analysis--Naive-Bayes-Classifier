NetFlix was a great service at first. For months I had no problems in returning movies to the Flushing, NY center. However, they recently opened a center in Stamford, CT which began to service my subscription ( I live in CT). Since December I have had returned EIGHT movies they claim they never recieved. Other movies that I had placed in the mailbox at the same time were recieved in 2-3 days. My account was placed on hold, but after I filed a claim with the post office for the lost DVD's and called Netflix to give them my claim number they did remove the hold, but just this last week, TWO more DVD's appear to be lost . In reading the other reviews on this site, I am glad to see that I am not the only one with this problem, there is definitely something going on in the NY/NJ/CT area. Either there is someone in the postal system stealing the DVD's, or the Netflix staff here are not recording recieved DVD's properly. The only other online DVD service I have found (and used for a short time) that ships from the east coast (thereby reducing turnaround times to an acceptable 2-3 days) is RentMyDVD.com. However, their inventory was very low and most of the movies I wanted were never available. Every other company online ships from California, which means you can only get about two rounds of DVD's a month, making Blockbuster about the same cost.
