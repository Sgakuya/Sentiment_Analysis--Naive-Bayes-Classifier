Living in Alaska for 30 years, without question the worst governor ever. $50 Million in contracting turned over to a private firm outside of the procurement laws to save $230,000 - yet he needs a new business jet ! Got rid of Science & Tech foundations that was making money & modernizing the state for a small one-time gain. As bright as Barrow in December!
