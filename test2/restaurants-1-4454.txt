The employees were great, but everything else sucks. The food is tasteless and very greasy. Anything fried is loaded with salt. Your clothes end up smelling like a grease pit when you leave. The only reason they are so busy is because they spend a fortune on advertising. ANY other restaurant would also be as popular if they too also spent a fortune on advertising.
