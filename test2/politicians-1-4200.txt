I hope Nader is happy! This so-called Green candidate has deprived the world of an environmentally friendly US president. Al Gore was electable, unlike good ole Ralph, and he is intelligent and an environmentalist. Ralph should've voted for Gore! Plus, unlike Nader, Gore actually understands foreign policy and other issues that Nader has never even heard of. Great work Ralph, you sure struck a blow for the environment tonight!
