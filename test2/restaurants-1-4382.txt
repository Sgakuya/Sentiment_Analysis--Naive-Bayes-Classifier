Not only is thier food horrible, taste like caffeteria food. But every time we have eaten there we have had to wait for our food for over an hour. My husband works in the industry and we find this rediculous. Furthermore as a former employee I can attest to the fact they are one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. They treat every employee as if they have absolutely no value other than to put money into thier huge corporate pockets. No wonder the employees dont produce!
