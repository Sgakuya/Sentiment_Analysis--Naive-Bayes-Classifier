The yankees suck! i really can't stand them. they're ego is way to big and they need to realize that just because they win a lot doesn't make them all that all the time. Plenty of teams are really good...like the Braves. Just because the yanks win all the time doesn't mean anything. The odds are against them skanky yankees and one of the coming seasons it'll all turn around and be a differnt story because they won't always be #1 like they may think. They have so many bandwagon fans it is unreal...I'll stick with a team that has TRUE fans.
