If i had the op i wouldn't even give them a 1, they have awful quality, everything i buy there galls apart, and they use sweat shops. Incase you don't know what that is, thats when they go over to some poor country in asia, build a factory, and hire children for EXTREMLY low wages, and if those poor children ruin something on acident (just put a button in the wrong place), those poor kids have to work without wages until they pay of however much that would cost, and that takes along time, and while those kids are working off what they owe, they don't get paid and they work long hours so they can't get a second job, so those kids have to STARVE untill they pay it off. I for sure don't want to suport anything that does that and if you do something is seriously wrong with you.
