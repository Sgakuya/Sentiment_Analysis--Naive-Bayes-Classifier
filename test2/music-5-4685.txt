I LOVE MATCHBOX TWENTY ALMOST AS MUCH AS I LOVE ROB HIMSELF! THEY ARE AWESOME! SEEING THEM LIVE IN CONCERT WAS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME. I ACTUALLY CRIED WHEN THEY CAME OUT ON STAGE. I HAD FIFTH ROW/FLOOR SEATS SO I EVEN MADE EYE CONTACT WITH ROB! WOO HOO! WHEN I GOT HOME THAT NIGHT FROM THE CONCERT IT WAS KINDA LATE AND I WAS REALLY POOPED BUT I WAS STILL SO HYPED THAT I COULDN'T SLEEP. I RAN THE WHOLE CONCERT THROUGH MY HEAD BEFORE I SLEPT AND DID THE SAME FOR THE FOLLOWING 6 NIGHTS. THERE CONCERT IS DEFINATLY AN EXPERIENCE THAT I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET!
