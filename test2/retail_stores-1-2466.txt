In Wisconsin Piggly Wiggly has high prices. The produce section is shameful, I even saw the produce manager picking off the rotten shoots of green onions and leaving it the onions on the shelf, ick. In one Wisconsin city Piggly Wiggly closed a well established low to middle income neighborhood store, got a TIF built a new upscale store on a landfill, raised the prices, has the worst possible customer service I have ever experienced, the produce department is still shameful. The meat department is the only area of the store worth shopping in, thank goodness for the butchers.
