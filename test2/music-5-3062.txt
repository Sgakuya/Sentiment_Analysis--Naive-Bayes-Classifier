The 1968 masterpiece, Astral Weeks is all about emotion. Van plays what he feels, and the album is held together by neat string bass parts (a rarity in pop music), Morrison's visual lyrics and powerful voice, and a cast of great back-up musicians. In my opinion, the highlight is Sweet Thing , a flourishing melody of great power. It's beautiful to the last track, where it disappears into the Irish mist without any warning. The whole record is masterfully done- good music to meditate to. If you don't know the story behind this record, Van hired a bunch of jazz musicians, telling them to play what they felt. He sat alone in a glass booth and played a series of folk-based songs with them following behind. I didn't understand it when I first bought it. But listen to it enough times, you'll understand its genius. Yes, I do believe that this is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard.
