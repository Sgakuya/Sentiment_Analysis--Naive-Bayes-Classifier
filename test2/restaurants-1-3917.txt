We called the new store in Oxnard, CA and asked if we could use two coupons and were told we could. Upon arriving to pick up the Pizzas we were told we could not use two coupons by the manager. We were told we, my wife and my self, could not purchase the pizzas separately, because they had been ordered together. The employee who took the order stated she had told us we could use both coupons. This is error on the part of the business, they should have honored the purchase. But instead chose to accept a $20 loss, because I did not buy either of the pizzas. When a business makes a mistake they must honor the sale and then make corrections to ensure it does not happen again. Obviously Noble Roman's Pizza does not care about the customer.
