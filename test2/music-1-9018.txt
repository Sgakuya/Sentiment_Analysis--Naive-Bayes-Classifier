To the tune of the REAL American Pie: A long long time ago, I can still remember when I heard this song and how it made me smile. But now this girl in leather pants, who kind of sings but cannot dance has made a lousy version techno style. Madonna's remake makes me shiver. She cut out the heart, I can't forgive her. I think they call it dance rap, but I'm pretty sure it's pure crap. I broke the window and jumped outside when I heard her bitter notes collide. She should be charged with homicide, she made a classic die. So bye bye to American Pie. When Madonna killed this classic I just wanted to hide. If Britney ever takes a shot at 'Vincent' I'll die. They love to make the music fans cry. They love to make the music fans cry. Why did Madonna kill American Pie? It's so tragic how this classic has been hung out to dry. She might as well have jammed a sharp pin in my eye. They love to make the music fans cry. OKAY, IT'S A LITTLE SHORT, BUT YOU GET THE POINT!
