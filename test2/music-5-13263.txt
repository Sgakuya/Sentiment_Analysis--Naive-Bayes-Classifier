Bumpin' dan a Mutha B***h, Each album Phatter than da last one, I am usually not one 'bout negativity, but every fake ass crazy ho need 2 think twice before they say controversial bulls**t about This click, really people who hate from anyside on squads for no logical reason need servin' in my opinion. So anywayz keep up that realist shizendz on da streets. the ghetto in europe where i come from is full of fake ass wanna bes' it's a ruff area but u aint gettin smoked over s**t u wear 4 fashion. I do enjoy mentally scaring haters who can't get hold of da hard unda-ground s**t I can order from the comfort of my own pad. those ho ass hatin' b*****s where I'm from haven't even smelled the s**t I bump on my tweeters Ha Ha. they jus catch a glimpse of da C.D cover, coz they don't appreciate good music, so I dont no why most of them be listenin' to 2pac. P.s. Can't wait 4 the new tear da club up thugs P.P.S I wonder if C.B koopsta n Lord Infamous were placed here? we's out the realist N***A east side of the pond!!!!!
