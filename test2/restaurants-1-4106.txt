I shouldn't bash this place based on one experience, but after one trip there, I just can't force myself back through the door. Not when Logan's Roadhouse is so close by. I must say this place is a horrible excuse for a restaraunt. The food was bad, the staff was incompetant, and the only thing I found good about the experience was that the beer was cold( even though it was not the beer I ordered!) Find another place to dine and you won't be sorry.
