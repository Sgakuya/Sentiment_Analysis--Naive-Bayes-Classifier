it's even worst then the first. the developers decided do be realistic and make buildings bigger then the people, but what we got is buildings the size of your whole screen (the castle), and you must scroll half an hour to get to the second end of your camp. you can't get an overall prespective of your camp, cus all you can see is one building. also, it takes too much time to destroy buildings, and too much upgrades, you just keep upgrading more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and it doesn't over. even longer and as boring as the first. nice intro though.
