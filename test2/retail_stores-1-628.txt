Poser town. A E should be ashamed for themselves. Ripping off A F was a discrace to teh retail industry. The clothes may look similar but the quality and the fit are horrible. Whenever they try to do something on their own, they make a fool out of themselves. However, they are good for underware and sunglasses but thats it.
