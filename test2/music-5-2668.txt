Like vol 4 zep 2 is much more than one track.WLLove shows just what Jimmy is about as an innovator on guitar and producer. Listen on headphones to get what the band was really about, listen to that rhythm section,the beatles and stones run a poor second to this band. Robert turned rock into sex rock on this album.The playing is sublime throughout, Jones's bass is so intricate and Bonzo wasn't just a thrash merchant, he could be so subtle and gentle. My only critisism is that the sound mix is too low.I love this album.Ilove this band but they were never afraid to challenge their fans with the changes in direction. Its part of what makes them timeless.
