jeb bush not only shows no respect for the elderly, he dones not show any for the disabled people. my daughter had to pay $400 + a month to attend Sunrise Arc in Leesburg, FL...only because the medicade program has a freeze on it or at least that's what i've been told. i think it is a very sad thing to do do the the disabled people.
