Like the Grreat Kman said, The Sims needs to be stopped. With nukes. And Kman couldn't be more right. I mean, double-you tee eph is this? Some game simulating real life? It seems interesting at first but then it becomes a total waste of time. And no game should have more than one X-Pack. Five is WAAAAAY too much.
