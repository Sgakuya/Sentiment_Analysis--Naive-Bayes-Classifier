My wife reserved a car with them - $20/week cheaper than Thrifty. She called from Chicago and confirmed that there would not be any additional charges - including insurance. She was traveling alone to LA and was subjected to an hour of arguments and insistence that she needed to buy additional insurance - her credit card and our personal insurance covers car rentals. We even took a print out from the credit card coverage - but they would not agree. Finally she gave up and took a shuttle back to the airport to rent a car from Thrifty for the $20 more. Avoid these Foxy and crooked car rental people like the plague!!!!!
