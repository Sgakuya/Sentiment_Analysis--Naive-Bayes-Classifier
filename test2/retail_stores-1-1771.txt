Completely new review from me...this place sucks, Wal-Mart treats employees like garbage. I've gotten chewed out twice in two days by managers for the horrible crime of talking to another associate and sitting down on a desk while talking to a customer. The second time, an assistant manager, SITTING in the back room, spied on me using a camera. That scared me a lot. I hope this company burns in hell. It's gotten too big and the managers are young, stupid morons, who like another poster said, think they are royalty. All of the employees are white trash idiots, which clearly illustrates the typical valued associate at Wal-Mart. No one is competent. That's why I'm gone. I quit today and I'm looking for a better part-time job. I'm a college graduate from UMich, and I don't need to put up with this garbage. I'm only working here until I can go to law school. Toodles Wal-Mart, I'm only shopping there when I have to. I'm sorry I initially gave this company a good review. Even Kmart treated me better. Much better.
