Sorry, I'm repeating what others have already said but I couldn't agree more. Roosevelt was an overated socialists who instituted programs like welfare and social security. If it wasn't for his programs, the depression would probably have ended sooner. Unfortunately his programs paved the way for even more wasteful programs that continue to this day.
