Binaural is an album only Pearl Jam could make. With equally shared musical influence and writing credit, Pearl Jam creates a diverse album with a no-nonsense approach. Once again, they show us their instrumental prowess without showing off, or even trying, and their capacity to notice and care about the people and issues around them. Nothing as it Seems and Thin Air show the beauty of PJ's quiet moments, and Grievance and Breakerfall do worlds to prove that Pearl Jam are punk rockers. Another amazing album.
