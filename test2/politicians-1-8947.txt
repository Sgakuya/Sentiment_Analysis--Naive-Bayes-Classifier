One of the VERY WORSE Presidents we ever had!! He sat up in his office and done all those sick things with Monica and then committed purgery in court. And for all that he did he didn't have to suffer any kind of retribution. If President Bush was to do anything like that he would be drawn and quartered. Now Clinton is running his mouth about the war in Iraq, like anythng he says holds any water!!
