Ok thats a whole lot of comments regarding the most famous US. leader...so i would say lets go to positive negative side: positive side: 1- He is very sharp strict in his actions 2- a he is doing exactly what anyone would expect from someone with his mental ability. 3- you never feel angry of his speech(s) as you rarely understand a thing 4- he did very well in throwing Saddam regime off the game 5- he did go to war with his Dad(s) puppets bin laden Saddam which is a true example of in-house democracy. 6- he is dedicated to fight terrorism 7- he has many (coloured)ethnic advisors. 8- he is very brave that he wants to run again for the Job 9- very loyal to his background (Oil companies). 10- in all through the years since America been established it was never the center of all the world (anger) like this 4 years. no to the negatives: 1- US dollard has never went so low until he arrived. 2- jobs(economy) are down down down (appologies to Mr.Springsteen) 3- America is now hated in most of the countries after it was the dream of anyone freedom lover. 4- i wonder if the times has changed and France or Russia became the no. 1 power what would we feel if they go to war alone disregarding any world wide support like this!!! 5- first time ever to have violance against protesters in the USA..what sort of democracy do we have!!! what sort of message do we give to the outside world whom we promote freedome if the police was harsh with protestors then by all means how can we say Saddam is a dectator!! 6- we created a monster (twice) first we gave saddam WMD's (Mr. Rumsfield was the middle man -Pentagon documents + CIA- that's why the report that Iraq handeled to the UN was taken first by us to edit the shameful details thats why our dear GWB was sure Saddam had WMD)to fight Iran for 8 long years ended up with millions dead on both sides. then we supported (money ,weapons trained) Bin Laden men to fight the ex- Soviet Union during their occupation of the Afghan country then we used them again to disrupt Arab leaders and in the end they turned down on us !!!! you create a monster eventually he turns back at you..simple. 7- now we have the number 1 country in the world run by firms..the oil sharks now runs the country..everything is bought sold...never the less any opposing sound will only be an Anti-American ( when was that ever said in the United states..how come americans turns to Anti- American A.K.A anti - bush for just saying i do not support your cause...i'm afraid when they will be a time when a n iraqi leader will come to change our regime!!. 8- we stupidly lost most of our allies in Europe (yes the ones most of us originated from) forget about the governament support whenever you walk down the street you will feel the opnion. 9- BIG question who will pay the war cost ? 4 answers you can choose from A- US B- the Iraqi people (who are so poor after 20 somthing years of pure tyranny we go uninvited to collect their only income!!) C- the coalition of the willing (who was willing other then Australia UK?????) where is the 30 something countires (out of 196 countires world wide) D- the allies (ex-) who we did not take the time to convenice them (without proof ) that Saddam had WMD's . 10- we did go to Iraq (none Weapons of Mass Destruction were found nor did we find Saddam !!)we did go to Afghanistan (Neither Bin laden on his closest advisors were found) will you consider this a failure? I DO..but guess what Afghan have a sea filled with Oil near by (but the cost of Infrastructure was too high as the bustards live in tents) and Iraq have 30% more of Oil reserves...anything in common here...:-) anyhow Mr. GWB..thank you for colouring up our lifes with the Orange alert , red alert green alert..i'm sure most people bought the duct tape (tell me how commission did you have 1 % or 10 %) thanks for being afraid to travel abroad as we became loved everywhere (thanks to your naiive policy) thank you once again for making us live in one big firm i suggest changing the name of the country to United states of Shell , Mobile , Esso, Tamoil, halib....etc.
