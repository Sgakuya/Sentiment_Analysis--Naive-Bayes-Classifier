It's amazing what this guy did. Just take one of his last executive orders. Doctors would be required to send all their patient's medical records to the government to be hel in a national registry. This way, some bureaucrat can expose your private, personal records if he or she chooses if you are doing something they don't like. But yet, Clinton didn't want HIS medical records to be public knowledge. This is so typical of his whole presidency. Do as I say, not as I do.
