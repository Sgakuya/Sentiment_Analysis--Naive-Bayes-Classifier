I would like to respond to Truthteller1's comments. Although I don't particularly hate Jesse Jackson, like most people here I have no respect for Al Sharpton. What I want to know is why is it that some black people - like you for instance - invariably respond to any criticism or dissent from white people by calling us racist. Are you insecure, my brother? Are you frightened by uppity honkies who don't kowtow to political correctness? You say that White America is afraid of nonsubmissive African-Americans, but I think you may be misinterpreting the reactions you've been reading on this clipboard. My sense is that most of the people who have commented here genuinely respect Martin Luther King, not exactly a submissive African-American. The reason we despise Sharpton is not because he is an outspoken black man, but rather because he is a barely literate black buffoon. If Sharpton's brain were one tenth the size of his mouth he might actually be a worthwhile human being, but it isn't and he's not. I think the problem with black individuals like you is that you are badly confused. Dr. King was the moral equivalent of a lion; Al Sharpton, on the other hand, is the moral equivalent of a ghetto cockroach. When you can't tell the difference between a lion and cockroach, you are CONFUSED, my brother. I do wish to sincerely thank you, however, for being straight up with us. If we are ever going to reach the goal of interracial harmony, it will only be by traveling down the road of absolutely unvarnished interracial honesty. You were honest with us. I have tried to be honest with you.
