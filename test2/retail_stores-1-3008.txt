I have bought alot of jewelry from Kays and will not buy any more. I bought an extended warranty on a necklace and it has broke twice and looks horrible and they won't replace it. It is just going to keep on breaking and I have wasted alot of money and will tell everyone I know that buys jewelry from Kays.
