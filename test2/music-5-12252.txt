I love Lucy Pearls new CD. It not only has original hits, but it as sensational piece to own. I really think it is bringing a new wave of sound that everyone don't hear to often. My favorite single is Hollywood.....it's great because it has like a rock and roll sound. I think this is a remarkable album and I would recommend anyone to buy it!!
