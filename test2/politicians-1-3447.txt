How he became president I'll never know... George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, FDR... George W. Bush?! I mean just look at his picture! That says it all. I was surprised when he just became Governor... we need a smart President in office who isn't going to go to war unless we have to, and who is going to actually care about what is going on in America and help out people in poverty.
