Oh its all true, WIN ME sucks the sweat off a dead dog's scrotum. I thought my computer was messed completely because it was always crashing and having to shut down. It took me on average three restarts to get all the way to checking my email. I'm currently rocking WIN 2000 due to my upgrade and its all good. If you don't think an upgrade is worth the cash, don't be dumb, your computer won't work with ME. The programmers should be shot.
