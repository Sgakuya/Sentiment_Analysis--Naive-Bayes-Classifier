Bill Clinton is a disgrace to America. He is a man without integrity, without morals, without shame, without honesty and without concern or respect for the law. He has disgraced himself, his family, his supporters, and the nation by his sleazy, selfish and arrogant crimes. He will be indicted after he leaves office, and I hope and pray he serves jail time for his crimes. Then he will have an appreciation for the price of his arrogant and illegal abuses of power. Bill Clinton is the most shameful and dishonorable American since Benedict Arnold. He makes me sick.
