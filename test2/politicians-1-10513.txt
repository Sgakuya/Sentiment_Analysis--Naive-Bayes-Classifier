He won on an outdated fluke and by Katherine Harris's depriving black voters of their constitutional rights. As President he has done nothing progressive on any front. He has strained America's ties to the rest of the world. Made reform more difficult in non-democratic countries. Rolled back environmental standards meant to protect American's from industrial poisons. He has put our most fundamental civil liberties in jeopardy. Finally, he can't even speak the god damn language. Worst President ever!
