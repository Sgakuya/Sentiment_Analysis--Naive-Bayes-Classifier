Rented car from Payless franchisee "Affordable Auto Rental Inc." 82 Evergreen Ave. Warwick, RI 02888 because it was an affiliate of the body shop next door that I was using. The auto body shop was great, as were the employees of the rental car company. But the owner of the rental car company tried to attribute preexisting damage to the car to me the day after I had dropped the vehicle off and had received the paperwork stating that the car was returned by me with no damage to it. He charged my credit card without authorization, had no proof that it was done by me, had the minor "hail-like" dents removed before I had a chance to inspect them and left me with only a photograph of what he claimed to be the damage. He admitted that I did get the "all-clear" the night before but that they found the damage a minute after I left and tried to contact me immediately. This is not true because they had multiple phone numbers and I was next door for 20 minutes. They did not call me to report the damage until they had possessed the car for over 16 hours. I did not receive a call until the next day and was told to come in around noon, which I did, but the evidence was already gone or "fixed" and my card was charged. He was also rude in that he assumed that because I was young that I had no business education and that "I didn't understand how business worked" and that I should take business classes. He didn't have much of a response, much less an apology, to my having an MBA and working on my JD. I told him that my lawyer would be in touch and that American Express would fight tooth and nail on my behalf for an unauthorized charge. He was not changing his attitude, which was beligerent from the start, so I left. Only after I called 20 minutes later to ask for his merchant code did he decide that it was not in his best interest to charge me.
