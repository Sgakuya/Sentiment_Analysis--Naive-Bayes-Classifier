In my opinion, Nine Inch Nails' seminal album The Downward Spiral is one of the greatest rock albums of all times. The songs, all written and composed by genius one-man-band Trent Reznor, are great in and of themselves. No one does dark, angry, and heavy better than Trent. However, it's the album itself that is the real gem. It is a narrative album, which tells the story of a depressed man's desperation, self-destruction, and eventual suicide. The story concludes with the title track, but then goes even further with the eerily quiet (in comparison to the other songs) Hurt, which is really the theme song of the whole album. This album flows and goes from one song to the next brilliantly, with most songs leading to the next with a transition, a la Pink Floyd, which is really what Nine Inch Nails is: the metal version of Pink Floyd. Tracks on this album are: Mr. Self-destruct, Piggy, Heresy, March of the Pigs, Closer, Ruiner, I Do Not Want This, Big Man With a Gun, A Warm Place, Reptile, The Downward Spiral, and Hurt. This album is a masterpiece of brooding, angry rock.
