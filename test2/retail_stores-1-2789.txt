They have the worst customer service ever. They will delibertely not sign off on an inspection to void your warranty. I asked them if they needed to sign, and they said, oh no, we keep records of inspections. Then when i needed a stone replaced that has fallen out three times in less than 2 yrs they said my warranty was void because i didn't get my paperwork signed. I paid for my stone to be replaced then, and when it fell out again after only 2 months, they are giving me the run around. My ring has been in their possesion now for almost a month and is still not fixed. I called the corporate office after a store employee hung up on me, and they don't care. They wouldn't call me back either, just like the store personel. And they don't care that a store manager refuses to call me back, and hangs up on me. I have never cursed at them or even gotten loud. I don't know what to do, but once i get my ring back, if i ever do, (it is my wedding ring, and 3/4 carat diamond engagement ring, worth 4,000 dollars) i will have to take it somewhere else and get the stones reset and pay so that i can get a new warranty with a reputable store. EEEK!!
