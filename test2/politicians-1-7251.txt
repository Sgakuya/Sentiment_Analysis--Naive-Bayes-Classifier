I would really like to know who actually LISTENS to this man!! He is despicable. African Americans should unite and kick his butt out of the spotlight for good. Who does he think he is? And why in the world do we refer to him as reverend. He stands for no morals. CNN and all the other media lower themselves by giving this man air time. Anyone ever check out his book in Barnes and Noble? Something about Money and how to Make It -- hustling the public. You may be fooling a lot of people Mr. Jackson but you're not fooling God!
