Hello. I am sure that most of you who are reading this comment are American, so I will be civil. 1. It may have failed to come to your attention that it was the Americans who supplied the Iraqis with chemicals which they used to build chemical weapons and chemical agents ie anthrax. Perhaps Bush thought this infomation too sensitive for your fragile minds, or perhaps it slipped his mind. One of the reasons why the muslims are so p i s s e d is because Bush never had a foreign policy, which showed that he never gave a damn about the world. At least Clinton recognised the importance of foreign policy. He tried to negotiate with people. Take the hint. Give just a little bit of wealth to the desperately poor people in the Middle East and you would recieve a lot more credit. 9 11 happened because you failed to give a damn about the world and the whole Palestinian issue. Oh yeah, do me a favour, take your heads out of your asses and sign the Kyoto agreement of World Summit. You make most of the pollution. Why not clean it up? Bush is poo poo
