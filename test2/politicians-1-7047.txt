Sit, Jesse Sit. As an African American who's never been a Jackson supporter. I was not at all alarmed. Ironically, just the day before a fellow employee commented on the eloquence of The Most Right Rev. Jesse. My comment was you have to look through the smoke screen. While there still remain numerous civil rights issues that need to be addressed ... Jesse's not the one to address them. Not to mention the fact that as a born again believer, who reads the Bible and knows the word...Jesse's way off. The Emporer has NO CLOTHES. And that's the naked truth!
