I first heard this song while watching tv on 9/11 when the news came on about the plane that was forced down by its own passengers... they talked about the cell phone messages and the last calls to loved ones... and behind me the radio was playing the song... I just started crying, thinking of those who were able to say goodbye, and those already gone who never got the chance... but like the song says, are already there... in every little part of their day...
