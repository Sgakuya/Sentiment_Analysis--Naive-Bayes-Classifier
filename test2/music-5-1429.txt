The title of the album is a symbol of the theme of the Talking Heads as a band. Many of their lyrics either aren't coherent or cannot be successfully deciphered to have a meaning. These random lyrics are even comical at some points. Listen to Life During Wartime or Once in a Lifetime, which contains the lyrics same as it ever was; look where my hand was. The Talking Heads are the best of the new wave bands and are in the same league as the all-time greats, maybe a noch below.
