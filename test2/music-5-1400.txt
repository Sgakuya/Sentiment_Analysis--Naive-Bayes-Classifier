Best U2 record ever? Ask me that when I was 17 and in this corn field outside of Syracuse, NY one afternoon prior to going into the Carrier Dome to see the band perform on the tour supporting this record? I would have choked down the last half of my can of Old Milwaukee and told you that you were fu**in crazy if you could name a better album than 'The Joshua Tree'. I can no longer drink Old Milwaukee, still use expletives like a teenage boy and really enjoy the merits of this record, but am not sure it is the best ever. 'Red Hill Mining Town' still reminds me of an old girlfriend. When I get together with my budies from high school, one story that we will always re-visit is that U2 concert. I have pictures of me posing with the actual record... This was the breakout album fo rthe band. It was great to see them finally get noticed and some acclaim as I was a fan since I first heard 'War' as an 8th grader. Not a bad song on the entire album.
