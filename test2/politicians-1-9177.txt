After the (arguably justified) war with Spain, McKinley presided over the occupation of the Phillipines in which between 200,000 and 250,000 Phillipine civilians were killed by US troops, and countless others raped and tortured. Respected patriotic Americans like Mark Twain were appalled by this senseless slaughter of decent people who just wanted to govern their own country rather than be occupied by a foreign power that they had never lifted a finger against. America only defeated Spain so easily in the Phillipines in the first place because native nationalists bravely fought alongside them to drive out the colonialist European power. They were then betrayed by the US president who had promised them independence in return for their loyal support. Thus McKinley was the first American to have committed genocide and occupied a foreign country, instead of allowing them self-determination according to classical American ideals and principles. Sorry but you can't give an oath-breaking genocidal imperialist who betrays brave people who fight alongside his countrymen anything other than 1 star. The 2nd worse president after Nixon.
