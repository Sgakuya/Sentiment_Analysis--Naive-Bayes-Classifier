Wow it's too bad I can't give them lower than a 1. Ok my family adn I have been going to department stores in New Jersey for years. Ames, Caldor, Bradlees, Jamesway, K-mart were all great. Until Wal-Mart came and started building ugly buildings in areas that couldnt fit them. Now we have way to much traffic and it takes me 3 times as long to get where i wanna go. Plus all the good department stores are gone except for K-mart. At least we still have that because I will never set foot in a Wal-mart store.
