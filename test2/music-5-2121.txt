The Dream Theater train never seems to die down. Once again, they have been able to release another pretty much perfect album. Seven great songs are included on this disc. A warning who don't like or appreciate epic songs, every song on this album (except for the 2 to 3 minute somber piece vacant) ranges from 7 to 14 minutes long. Still, this is an album to be loved by music buffs everywhere.
