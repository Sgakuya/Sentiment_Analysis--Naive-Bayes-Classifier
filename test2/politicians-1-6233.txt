If Janet Reno runs for goveror she will be defeated by a large majority. Most of the majority will vote republican in dpite of being true democrats who can't stand Reno. This will assure Jeb Bush a victory unless his brother sewts him up as Vice President or Secretary of State. PLEASE FLORIDA, DON'T LET HER GET ON THE FLORIDA BALOTT.
