The Sex Pistols were the greatest punk band ever.!!! They mostly sang about things that meant something. If you are a fanatic punk rocker you should have this in your collection as with all the other Sex Pistols albums. Sid Vicious, Johnny Rotten, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook made a great punk group probably the best then, now and in years to come. Although Never mind the Bollocks wasn't the best album it is one that you need for your punk rock collection.
