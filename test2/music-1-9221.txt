Alright, I saw this video over and over again on TRL. Why, you ask? Because I like to see boobies. That aside I really don't understand how anyone could truly enjoy any Jennifer Lopez's videos. Such is the reason I wasn't expecting much from Play when I watched it... or heard it (I'm glad that she found a rhyme for 'song', that can often be difficult). Anyway, there's a neat little option I discovered on the TV remote, it's called a 'mute' button. I recommend you take full advantage of this feature when watching this music video.
