Like many others on this site, my flights with Continental have been OK but when a problem occurrs their customer service is amazingly terrible. After waiting 8 hours for a delayed flight, we had their folks yelling at us about how many hours they had to work. I saw them leave children, old folks, and people with disabilities high and dry in Houston - no food, no place to sleep, and no compasion. Thank goodness for some kind souls on our flight who took care of each other. All said, Continental is probably OK as long as everything goes right. Otherwise, you are screwed.
