Homicidal alcoholic thug, just like Yelstin. Expect this pattern to recur for many years to come in Russia. He is a coarse and vulgar man, who has enjoyed waging an unjust and reprehensibly criminal war on the Chechens. Seriously, the war in Chechnya is one continuous war crime with Putin the kingpin.
