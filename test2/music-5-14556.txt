I think this is one of the best albums, soundtrack or regular album. It has such a great variety of styles and artists. Is there any surprise this album has sold 10 million copies?! Of course the Bee Gees are simply great, and almost a quarter century later, I can still get up and dance to Night Fever and Stayin' Alive. I also really like the Yvonne Elliman song If I Can't Have You, written by the BGs and More Than a Woman by the Tavares. The album has a nice mixture of Latin salsa, funk, pop and R B, which are all the basic ingredients of great disco music. I don't care if it's campy, I'd rather listen to SNF any day over today's crappy ass music!
