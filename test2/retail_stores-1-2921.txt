I bought a saph/dia br. from the local Zales for my girlfriend. This was to be our first Chrismas. I wanted it to be special. She opened it the next day in which one of the stones fell out and the clasp was broken. When I went to return the item I was given more horriable service. I was told it would take up too, two weeks for a new one. I demanded my money back. Zales had poor service and even worse jewelry!
