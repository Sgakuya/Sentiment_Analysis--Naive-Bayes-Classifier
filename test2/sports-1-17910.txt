Hey , Rivers , you dodged Peppers in college , but when you come to Charlotte, he's gonna snap your back , son. People , don't send me a bunch of football comments, because I only care about basketball. State was decent in football , and they kind of ran with that since they suck at everything else. Sooooooooooooooooo , since they are so proud of that , I can't wait to see Peppers crush their golden boy. I'm from North Carolina..................I could care less about football. I just don't like State thinking they finally have something on Carolina . They are nothing. All this is Tarheel territory.....................I don't care if State has Joe Montana.
