hORRIBLE- THE FUNNY THING IS THAT THEY THINK THEY CQAN COMPETE W/ LSU. SAYING THEY HAVE 10,000 FANS IS AN OVERSTATEMENT MORE LIKE 500 AND HAL OF THEM SLEEP THROUGH THE GAMES. OH AND HAIWII ISN'T AS GOOD AS TEXAS. O YEA BY THE WAY- YALL CANT EVEN WIN THE CUSA AND LSU WON THE SEC AND SUGAR BOWL IN 2001. THE SEC IS ON OF THE BESR CONFRENCES AND CUSA ISN'T EVEN IN THE BCS. cHUNKMASTERFAT - GO WATCH TULANE LOSE AGAIN. YALL CAN BARELY BEAT MSU WHO LSU BEAT BY 40 PTS. TULANE'S A JOKE
