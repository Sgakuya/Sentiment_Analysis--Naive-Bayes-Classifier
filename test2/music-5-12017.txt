my three year old daughter loves their song, say my name. she sings it all the time. i had to buy the cassette for her. it is her bed-time song. i would say she listens to it over 20 times every day since it came out. i wish they sold video cassettes of their songs so i can buy it for her. she stands in front of the mirror and sings and dance to the song.my three year old daughter, my two year old cousin and i give them all five stars for say my name.....
