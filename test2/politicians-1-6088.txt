The guy is a vile,lying man. What was Mr. Bush thinking when he nominated this jerk to become Attorney General? It seems that according to what his supporters say, he should get the job because he's qualified (he wins elections, in other words, he's a career politician), he's a Christian (i.e. he goes to church), and he has high integrity (yet they never mention his lying to the Senate about Ronnie White). And please don't play that religion card. I'm a Christian myself.
