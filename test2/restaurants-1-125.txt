Terrible! I was treated rudely by women employees in 2 different locations. One even called me by the wrong gender! I think they should work on their customer service. Too many of these chains in my city. Too expensive. Bring back the mom 'n pop groceries and individual little coffee shops and caf s, and less slick, impersonal, expensive chains!
