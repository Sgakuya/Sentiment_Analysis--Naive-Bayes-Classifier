I honestly thought this pizza was just disgusting. I reallly tried to give it a chance, I honestly did. I guess I am obviously a person who came of age in the 1980's...pizza is supposed to be done when you go to pick it up, or when they bring it to your house. Why would anyone want to buy a raw pizza to make for themselves? I guess it is one way to make people feel better about themselves, when all they are really doing is buying MORE fast food ! But seriously, if the pizza actually tasted good after you cooked it yourself, it might be worth it. But their sauce is pretty horrible...
