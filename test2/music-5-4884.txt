Billy Gilman, simply put, is THE BEST! He far excceeds The Moffatts Hanson. His voice is quite frankly the best voice for a 12-year old ever discovered. One Voice and Oklahoma are beautiful videos and songs. Oklahoma is an award-calibre video. It reminds me of the ending to the movie, The Color Purple. I especially love One Voice a timely, touching allegory against hand-gun violence. Have you noticed we haven't had school shootings since the song was released? Kids will listen! and when another kid is doing the speaking...(or in this case, the singing) they'll listen even more. Billy is so special because of his age. How many C W singers out there are 12 years old? I just hope as he grows, the novelty of his age won't wear off. He is a dedicated young man to his craft, so please leave him alone if you don't care for his music. Billy, keep up the great work. My niece can't get enough of you! One side note: His song, Oklahoma is #1 on the country charts: the #1 college football team on the AP poll is: ...OKLAHOMA! cool, huh?
