mad season by matchbox twenty, I'll admit wasnt so hot when I first played the cd. Its not as youthfully dramatic as YOURSELF OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU had been. But after about three or four times, when the tunes start to stick in your head, you enjoy it. You can rock out to songs like Crutch and get a taste of some southern blues with the album titled song mad season.
