Being as though I am a female lyricist, I know good lyrics when I hear them. The simple reason why I luv Brat's music, is becus she's raw, real, and uncut. She keeps it real unlike so many of these corny hoochified female rappers. And the best aspect about her, is that she has the versatility needed to write her own rhymes. Holla. (1-Luv Philly)
