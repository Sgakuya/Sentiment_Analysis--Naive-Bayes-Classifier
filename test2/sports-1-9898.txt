As far as being a likeable team they are one step above the Lakers to me. I used to love watching Reggie Miller and the Pacers shut them down every year in the playoffs since it seemed to always pair the 2 teams up every year. John Starks was a cocky little prick and Patrick Ewing was always just a big, ugly, sweat-pouring disgrace.
