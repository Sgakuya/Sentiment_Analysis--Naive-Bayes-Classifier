Wish I could give them 0 stars. First of all, that Kroger card, which many people champion as a great way to save money, is at best an illusory savings. Often the ads they run say 99 cent coke*, but you have to buy $10 of non cola merchandise to get the price. Make sure you read all the fine print in their ads. The card also has your demographic data so they can track your purchases whenever you use it. Very 1984-ish (well your records show that you've purchased tampons and beer in the past. Would you like tampons and beer today?). Of course you also get the benefit of using their crummy card to save 3 cents a gallon at their crammed gas station full of angry drivers in their Suburbahogs honking their horn at you when they think you take too long at the pump (this is a only slightly exaggerated version of something that happened when I stopped there once). In my 13 gallon tank, the savings is an amazing 39 cents. Whoopee. Oh, and the station down the block is less crowded and is 2-3 cents a gallon cheaper than them anyway. This brings me to the worst issue of all with them, their RUDE, IGNORANT and STUPID employees. I was with my dad at the U-Scan while he was trying to check out. For some reason the computer wouldn't take the item. The overweight commie-nazi running the register was screaming at the top of her lungs NOT THAT WAY NO YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG, NO ROTATE IT THE OTHER WAY, NO NOT THAT WAY etc. etc. She wouldn't bring herself to move her 400 lb butt over to the register and actually HELP FIX the issue. Finally, my dad just put all of his items back in the cart, took them to her and told her to put them away. I'm sorry she's overweight, stressed out and miserable, but don't take that out on the people that pay your paycheck. Folks, this is one of the worst grocery stores in terms of customer service. My dad is a very friendly and tolerant person but no customer (excepting the ones that start fights) deserves this kind of abuse. I honestly gave them a shot, but only once. Save your money and patronize stores that don't post advertisements bordering on fraudlent and treat their customers a bit better. Don't be fooled by their promotions, it is a false savings.
