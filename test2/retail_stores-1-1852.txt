Passing a bolwing ball through my system would be more fun than going here,...esp. at Christmas time. Yes, the prices are the most competitive you can find in the cheaper side of the retail market, but G-D, I HATE this place. You know you're in the Trailer Park Capitol of your hometown the minute you get into the parking lot and start looking for a spot, where no matter where you end up, chances are you'll end up with a door ding, that is once you make it past all of the people who pretend they don't see you driving. There is very little combined IQ employed there, so expect slow, if any, customer service. Why are the prices so low? Because everything is absolutely the cheapest of the cheap in quality. 90% of the cashiers appear to be solving a Rubix-Cube whenever checking someone out. On the positive side, the large parking lots normally keep all of the smokey mobile road harards off the streets on the weekends.
