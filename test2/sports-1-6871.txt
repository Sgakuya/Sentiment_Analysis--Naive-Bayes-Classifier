I dislike Danny Ainge about as much as it is possible too. As a player, he was a hot dog, always trying to make the big play. He took too many three point attempts that were unsuccessfull, and cost the Phoenix Suns many games. In fact, he cost them the NBA title. In the final game of the series, he should have been guarding Payton, but no, he had to be the big man and try to take on MJ. What happens? MJ passes to the wide open Payton who puts up an easy shot, and the Bulls win. Ainge should have covered his man. A poor excuse for a player and a rotten coach.
