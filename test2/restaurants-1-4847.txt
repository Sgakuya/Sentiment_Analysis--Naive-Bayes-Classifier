We ate at the IHOP in Branson, Missouri a couple of weeks ago. First of all, when I go in to sit down and have breakfast, I don't want to feel like I'm in a fast food joint. They have the cheap tables all jammed in together. It's noisy, and way too crowded for comfort. Second, I expect something resembling service. It took forever for the waitress to get there. Then, after a 20 minute wait for our food, they forgot our 11 year old's meal completely. She said it would be 2 minutes to get it. It was 7. By that time we had discovered that my wife's over hard eggs were runny, and when the overdue meal finally got there it had over easy eggs, instead of scrambled like we had ordered. When I complained to the manager I got the usual sorry speech and no offer to do anything about it. I will never step foot in an IHOP again. Period.
