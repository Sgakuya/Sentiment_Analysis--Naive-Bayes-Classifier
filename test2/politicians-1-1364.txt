Jacques Chirac continues to embarrass himself and France, making snide remarks (such as about Britain's 'Mad Cow' epidemic or how British food is awful)- totally unbecoming of a world leader. Not that he's the reason Paris lost their bid to host the Olympics in 2012, but Chirac and his inability to SHUT UP probably didn't help their cause either. It wouldn't hurt this immodest twit to be less of an ass, and show the world he is capable of being a bit more dignified as a leader.
