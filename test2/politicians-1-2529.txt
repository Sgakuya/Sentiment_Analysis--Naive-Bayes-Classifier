I lost all respect for McCain when I saw him stumping for Bush this last election, how much of a lap dog he had become, allowing shrub to kiss his head, rub his head like a dog, what a disgrace especially after shrub and his nasties really made McCain look bad in the 2000 primaries with their continual lies, how he could stump for and help elect that monkey boy, drunk, cocaine addicted coward, beats me, and I will never vote for him now!
