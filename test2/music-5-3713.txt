Queen is one of the most talented bands-EVER. They could do a flatout heavy metal song or switch to something that could come out of the symphony. I didn't agree with Mercury's sexuality but he is a true talent and sorely missed. If you want to start an album collection of great rock, Queen is a good place to start.
