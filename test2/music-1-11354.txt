So much of what respect I had for Britney Spears has gone completely out the window. To think that thousands of little girls around the country will be getting this CD for Christmas and Hanukkah this year nauseates me. This album would make a great soundtrack for a movie...an X-rated one! Now, don't get me wrong, this is where I am coming from: I'm not a nun, a prude, or even a parent. In fact, I'm still quite young and I'm all for suggestive rock/pop music----But only when it's done appropriately! When the adult feelings of love and/or sexual desire are portrayed in a song, I love it just the same as I do any song about any other aspect of life...hope, faith, strife, happiness, sadness...desire goes right up there on the list! But the difference is: When Madonna sang Like A Virgin she SANG it. Despite the high, almost whiny voice, she sounded like a young woman. The feelings of love and desire were already there in what mildly suggestive lyrics she had....there was no need to, as Britney does, murmur ooh...do you like that?....give me more...ahhhh over every single song! When Bruce Springsteen sang Cover Me , he captured the raw desire that can sometimes be all that seems to be left in you, but somehow, the human side, the romantic side was still there. Unlike Britney's album, on which, come to think of it, there is absolutely Zero romance! Songs like Bombastic Love and Slave 4 U (which is, by the way, a very childish way to write it) don't even succeed in successfully showing honest desire, let alone love! Typically, these teen-pop manufactured performers can manage to eke out at least one watery, sappy love song. Not so here. All this is is a childish attempt at rebellion from her so-called good girl image. And if she thinks anyone is going to believe she's staying a virgin til marriage, I'm sorry to say that she's wrong. But what kills me is that she sings (if you can call it that) like a five year old. She doesn't sound one bit like the mature adult she so-called wants to be. I like the song Lady Marmalade by Christina Aguilera, Pink, and Co. better, because even though they're singing about being hookers, they don't try and make their voices sound like little girls. They sing it like young women....slutty young women....but at least they don't sound like 5 year old girls! And what is with all of the cursing on Britney's new album? It's like all of the swearing and sexual references are on the CD just for the sake of being 'edgy'! They don't contribute to the songs at all, really. I mean, sometimes, as in Springsteen's Badlands , 'Darn' and 'heck' just isn't going to cut it....but it's all in the context, and these songs would be little-girlish, whiny pop tunes about sex and wanting to abandon responsibility to be a role model so that she can be as slutty as she wants to be with or without the cursing. I truly was happy for Britney Spears. She has the whole world at her fingers, she's young and beautiful, her childhood dream has come true....and I wished her all the best! But after this CD, I find respecting her to be really difficult. It makes me so angry that her music (which is in a little girl's voice, and aimed and marketed to little girls!) is so obscene that I walked right back in the store and returned my copy the day after I bought it. I was very dissapointed in this CD, and I am not looking forward to hearing the little girls of our nation singing these songs, or to having Britney continue to market sex to them. Please, if you are a parent or know anyone who is, make sure they are aware that this is no Baby one more time or even Oops I did it again ...this is something you probably don't want your children singing!
