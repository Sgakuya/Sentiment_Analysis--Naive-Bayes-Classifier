I've been all over this country and many parts of the world as well. Everywhere I have been New Yorkers have always gotten a bad rap. But if the New York voters elect Hillary (I never held any office, feel sorry for me I got cheated on) Clinton you deserve everything you get. How can any true New Yorker even think of voting for her, she knows nothing about New york. Why didn't someone ask why she even came to NY to run did she think that she could easly pull the wool over everyones eyes well I guess she did by the looks of all the polls.I have only one thing to say to miss whitehouse how do make an eggcream, end of story.
