the album is hotttttttttttt. this is an album that it is clear what the singles should be: only u, don't leave me alone, take me tonite, and turn it up! the album shows the growth and strength in her writing. hopefully shhe picks the right 2nd single : DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE! BUT UM FOCUS IS NOT A SINGLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to go from ONLY U to FOCUS is a downgrade. and wiht this album we want to get them sales. SHany we love u!!!!!111111
