I think it is interesting and funny that Bush and so many millions of Americans call themselves Christians when they so blatently contradict the teachings of Jesus Christ. Many people who call themselves Christians are greedy, selfish, capitalist pigs. On Oprah and in other speeches and interviews, Bush talked about his faith in Christianity. He is decieving himself, like the millions of others who justify their evil actions. Last week while working in a little ice cream shop in Princeton, NJ, I saw the bumper sticker WWJD. What Would Jesus Do?! First of all, he wouldn't buy the $50,000 SUV the sticker was stuck on. Would Jesus think it was ok to try to amass as much money as one possibly can? Would Jesus believe that the death penelty is a good Christian practice to continue (Thou shalt not kill ring a bell?)? I am not a Christian, I am not a Democrat, I am not a Communist, but I may be a leftist if that means I take other people into cosideration and work to preserve the earth before our civilization becomes extinct, dragging along all of the other animals of the world. By the way, it's funny that some people enjoy ranting about how they are glad that Clinton's 'radical', 'leftist' regime is finally coming to an end. Clinton is not radical or left or a Democrat for that matter. That should be obvious to anyone who has been thinking for themselves.
