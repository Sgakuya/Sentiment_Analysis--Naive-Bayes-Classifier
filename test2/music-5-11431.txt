The Clash are not only one of the greatest of all punk bands,but one of the greatest of all rock and roll both on and off the stage.I admire The Clash even more for their devotion to their fans,like bringing as many fans without tickets back stage,they were as unique as they were good. It is easy to see why Rolling Stone named this album of the 80's.
