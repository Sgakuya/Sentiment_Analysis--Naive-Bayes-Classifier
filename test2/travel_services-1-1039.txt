Is there any NO-STAR option? First they are a bunch of Thugs (Los Angeles) office. Take their time so you will pay more, and offer to sell stuff under the table. My suggestion is to pay with a check and if you are not happy - stop-pay on the check and DO NOT TIP. It's funny to see their face when you don't tip.
