I am not a crook. Well, not just a crook anyway, Tricky Dick. You're a liar, too. Taught American children how to lie right into the camera long before Slick Willie. The running mate he selected for his first term and who eventually became our vice-president, Spiro Agnew resigned in shame, but was a logical choice for Tricky Dick. Just think about it... A president who would have been impeached and who resigned in shame, and who had a former vice president who resigned and was ultimately convicted of tax evasion. Shameful, pitiful and disgusting. Easily THE MOST corrupt administration in the history of our country. Makes Slick Willie look like a choirboy. But not to a republican...Nixon's NOW DEFENDED BY THE HYPOCRISY THAT DEFINES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. Hypocrites...have you no shame?
