How can you not give this album 5 stars?!? This album served as a template to other masterpieces such as other 5 star albums like Appettite For Destruction , License To Ill . Heck, even Garth Brooks loved this album and he's got good tunes as well. Bonzo was very creative when he stuck microhpones at different heightened intervals to get that echo with his drums on 'Levee Breaks'.
