Herb's time has definately run its course at NC State. He is a good man, but also just a good coach and will never take the Pack to the next level. Anyone who can't teach kids to rebound doesn't belong coaching an ACC school, much less a Big 4 school. When will we get a real coach, this program deserves it!!!
