JJ Redick is one of the most over rated players. I have seen him only play against Carolina, because he is to awful to look at. But, all he does is get cheap push offs and does nothing defensively, probably one of the most over rated players ever! If JJ redick and the rest of Dukes players are so great, then why did they loose to Virginia Tech, Maryland twice, and Michigan state in the sweet 16? PLEASE STOP comaring Redick to other players.
