Actually, this is a wonderful album. Eva Cassidy had such a haunting, clear voice and she makes these songs like Over the Rainbow, and Sting's Fields of Gold her own. I actually prefer her version over Sting's by a large margin. It's such a shame that she is gone, but at least we were able to discover her before her music faded into obscurity. Maybe now she will live on forever.
