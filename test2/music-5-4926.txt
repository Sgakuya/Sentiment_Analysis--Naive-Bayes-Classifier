I cried the first time I heard this song. It touched my heart because I just moved from a suburb in California where children are living with virtually no hope of going to college or on to good jobs because their parents have no hope and are often lost in a world of drugs, alcohol and violence. Thank you Billy for reminding us that their is still hope in the power of prayer.
