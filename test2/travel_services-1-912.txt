I used the company 4 times so far and the first 3 times I was extremely happy with the care and concern they showed me but the last time will be the last time I use them. They didn't send the crew I had requested to finish my move which was done in 3 separate segments. The last crew didn't seem to want to be there and do their job. They were lazy and sloppy. They left 3 or 4 boxes of my belongings out in the rain and weather and broke the glass tops on two of my dressers and then tried to hide it from me. I also had just received a new console cabinet just days before they brought the remainder of my things to the new address and they took a chunk out the front of it. Things didn't get put where they needed to be in all it was a diaster. When I found the damage I requested a damage report be made and was told they didn't have any with them but to get a couple quotes for the broken glass and to call one of the movers and they would get it replaced through his mothers business. Color me stupid but isn't that a bit odd. I didn't do that but did call the office and they sent someone out to get the broken glass and to take pictures of the damage to the cabinet. That was over a month ago and so far no new glass and no repair to the cabinet. I called to day and was told it was on its way and the repair person would contact me which was the same story all the other times I have called in the past month. I finally did get the furniture mans call and said that this was the first he had heard about the problem and he will be here in a couple days to correct things. Don't deal with this company they lie and hope you will get tired of calling and everything will go away it didn't and it won't. One unhappy customer can and does ruin a reputation.
