It's unbelievable to me, as a lifelong New Yorker, that other New Yorkers could not or would not see through Mrs. Clinton's insincere run for US Senate. I think both she and her husband are incredibly arrogant and power hungry. They simply believe they can get away with anything -- that laws don't pertain to them. What's even worse, they often do get away with anything.
