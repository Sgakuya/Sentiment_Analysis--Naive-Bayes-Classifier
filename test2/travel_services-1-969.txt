THESE GUYS ARE SOOOOO BAD!!! I still have nighmares from dealing with them. They lie. They are incredibly rude. I really can't believe that they are still in business. The President of this pathetic excuse for a company, JEFF GREEN, won't take any phonecalls. He hides behind the claims guy JOHN WILLOUGHBY, whose answer to everything is " Sue Us." The whole friggin company is related so if you think you've gotten ahold of someone who gives a crap -YOU ARE WRONG!! Please don't make the same mistake I did. I would tell you my whole story but all the problems would take too long to explain. Basically it is the same issues as everyone else here!!
