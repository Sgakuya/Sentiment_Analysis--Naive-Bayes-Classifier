Stockwell Day is a elitest, binary thinker. In his campaign commercials last year, he showed the normal 2-parent family with a boy and a girl (which is binary thinking - when you can only see things one way). This bothers me because he should have shown a different family setting to show diversity, but he doesnt believe in that, so it's just as well he didn't. I hated the Canadian Alliance from the moment it was formed (first named the C.R.A.P. party, Canadain Reform Alliance Party, I'm not joking! Just shows the binary thinking there, that they didn't bother to see what the initials were), because of its snooty, right-wing beliefs and unwillingness to see things from another person's point of view. I am not saying ALL right-wing people are bad, just this particular party leader, Stockwell Day. He is so unemotional that he looks like an android! He just talks in a monotone, never showing any passion for what he believes in. When the Canadian Alliance finally half-fell apart, I was ecstatic. Although I heard Stockwell Day is running again this year, I hope very much that he doesn't win. Canada would be a land of conservative, stuck-up snots if he did.
