More and more I m starting to understand the impact of Sgt. Pepper s on popular music. The fact that I wasn t alive when it was released in 1967 makes it a little tough to truly know what it was like to hear this album when it first came out, but I imagine it must have been pretty exciting. But forget all the baggage about influence everyone hangs on Sgt. Pepper s it s just full of great individual songs, and they somehow work together as a whole. This is a classic that belongs in everyone s collection.
