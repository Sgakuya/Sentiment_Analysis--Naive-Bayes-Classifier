I live near Toronto, and I can tell you that I stayed on the Carter bandwagon longer than anybody. I defended him through all his injuries. But this season, even I gave up on him. And for those that still defend him, for God's sake, he admitted he stopped trying! I wouldn't be surprised if fans started throwing stuff at Carter the next time he's at the ACC. Hell, someone might go Monica Seles on him. I'm not saying I want it to happen, but I wouldn't be surprised. That's how much Raptor's fans have grown to loathe Carter.
