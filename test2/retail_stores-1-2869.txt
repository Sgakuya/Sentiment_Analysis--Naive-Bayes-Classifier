DO NOT BUY FROM OR USE THIS RETAILER IN ANY WAY! WhiteHall has had a sapphire bracelet (purchased from them) for 2 months for repair and at this point I have no hope of ever getting an adequate repair - as this is the 6TH TIME they have attempted to make the SAME repair. Before I was aware of their total incompetence, I gave them a heirloom pearl necklace to be restrung. They returned the necklace a full one inch shorter. I took it back 2 months ago and are still waiting for its return.
