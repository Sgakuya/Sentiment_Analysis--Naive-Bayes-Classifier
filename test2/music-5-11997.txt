Destiny's Child cd is the bomb because it talks about everyday life. I am not just saying this because I am their #1 fan, but they have some great songs on this cd. For all of you hatas, find something better to do because this world does not need that. The first time I heard the cd I was so amazed and was in love with it. When I bought it I must have listened to it over 50 times no exgeration. Each song on the cd gets 5 stars from me.
