Yippity doo dah...yippity ayy...my oh my what a wonderful day. Uncle Tom in the flesh. White folk love it when black folk hate that they were born black like Alan does. Why is Alan Keyes so popular among white folk? Because he lies to them and wipes away their guilt. The problem is that the lie doesn't remove the reality of the crime. Go away, Alan.
