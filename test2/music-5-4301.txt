It's unfortunate that the world has not heard any new material from Pink Floyd for over 9 years. Yet, they still hold true to fact that whatever they do always turns to gold. It's nice to see that there is a great greatest hits album that is worth listening and BUYING out of the many G.H. albums (Boyz 2 Men, Mariah Carey, Collective Soul, Bare naked Ladies, and LOTS MORE!!!) that keep popping up from artists who have flat or dead careers! Those who love floyd and want a good retrospect of their 30 year career, this is a must buy.
