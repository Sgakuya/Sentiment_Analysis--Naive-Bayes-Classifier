I'm surprised that this man was not invited to administer Bush & Company's EPA with these kinds of credentials. A complete disrespect for Nature and future generations. He seems especially fond of GOP propaganda that ANWR's 6 month supply of oil will rid the US of its need to import foreign oil. He calls people who care about preserving the Tongass extremists and those who want to exploit it responsible corporate citizens. It's amazing how greed has blinded so many Alaskians and others in all those red states.
