Jesse Jackson is angry because his party didn't win. I think his reaction is childish. We have enough hatred and troubles these days without someone like him trying to get more stirred up. Somebody had to win and someone had to lose. Because of reactions from people like him I am changing parties, I will register Republician now. He needs to put it to rest and get on with other issues. If you don't know how to use the voting ballot ask someone I am sure others would be glad to help. Don't dwell on the past, thing could be worse he could be President.
