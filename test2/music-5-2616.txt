This album is phenomonal. I'm a HUGE George Harrison fan and I can't see how you can dislike Here Comes the Sun and Something. These 2 are my favorite Beatles songs. I also enjoyed Come Together. I wish I were there when their albums came out. I would have enjoyed it no dought. I get teased a lot because I'm only 13 and I'm a big Beatles fan, but I brush it off because I find them so fascinating and I just can't stop listening to their music. Abbey Road is a great example of the Beatles masterpieces. It's too bad it had to end. I thoroughly enjoy every song on this album. I love it with passion. It's probably my favorite Beatles album. A timeless masterpiece of great songs. What else can I say?
