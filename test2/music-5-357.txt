One of the very finest contemporary albums,voted the all-time #1 in a British poll not long back.A work of great originality and musical talent,lyrically distinctive,and sung with an expressive mellow lilt.It has a strange ethereal,haunting quality;i remember playing it in the car one dark,spooky winter night,and felt like i was gliding in an other-worldly sea of fog.It fits together as a whole quite beautifully.5 stars very definitely.(if only my computer were O.k.,though-it's taken ages to post this.One moment full of the joys,then reduced to feeling like Basil Fawlty thrashing his car in frustration!)
