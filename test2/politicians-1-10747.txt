Less than a week after the Confederacy surrendered, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in Washington D.C. Andrew Johnson took office with Republicans confident that he would continue Lincoln's policies. Lincoln had not adopted a plan for Reconstruction, but he seriously had considered a moderate Reconstruction Plan which included the states simply swearing loyalty and abolishing slavery. Johnson himself adopted a similar program, but a firm believer in states' rights and a southernor himself, he did not please his own Republican party. (1)Crisis Leadership: 1 out of 5 Stars- By December 1865, Johnson had his own Reconstruction Plan created, which was based almost entirely on Lincoln's. It consisted of requiring the Confederate states to pledge an oath of loyalty and abolish slavery. He agreed to pardon most southernors in return for their oath of loyalty. Johnson, refused, however to pardon high ranking officers of the Confederacy such as political and military leaders. However, Johnson almost in a routine fashion handed out thousands of pardons which resulted in most members of the old planter class and many Confederate leaders to reemerge in power on the state level. The Congress resented Johnson's weak plan, and rejected it, and thus began a battle between the President and the Congress. He vetoed the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, which established the bureau to ensure that would provide shelter for displaced African Americans and put individuals accused of depriving African Americans of their Civil Rights on trial. The Congress passed the bill over his veto, however. Johnson also vetoed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1866 which established that all persons born in the United States were citizens and had to be treated as such. He believed that this was a states' rights issue. This too was passed over his veto. It was clear- Andrew Johnson was a southernor who basically sided with the South, adopting the same policies of the Administrations of the 1850s. The Congress also passed the 14th Amendment which was basically an echo of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. With Congress and Johnson at a political war, impeachment proceedings began, and Johnson was acquited by a narrow marigin. Almost all Republicans believed at that time that he was totally unfit for office. His southern sympathies and states' rights beliefs allowed the old South to rise again and led to another 100 years of depriving African Americans of their rights. (2)Diplomatic Relations: 3 out of 5 Stars- Johnson was fortunate to have a competent Secretary of State, a carryover from the Lincoln Administration, William H. Seward. Seward negotiated the purchase of the land that is now Alaska from Russia. Seward also boldly enforced the Monroe Doctrine by forcing the French to leave Mexico, which they had been occupying since 1861. The final French troop left in 1867. (3)Economic Management: 1 out of 5 Stars- Due to his distractions with the impeachment proceedings and Reconstruction, Johnson made no effort to begin paying off Civil War debts or to address the faltering economy. He also approved $10 Million to purchase Alaska (4)Vision for the Country: 1 out of 5 Stars- Being thrust into the office of the Presidency unexpectadly, it was obvious that Johnson would continue the policies of his predacessor. However, he vetoed bill after bill which guarenteed the rights of African Americans. It was clear that he had no real desire for the country to recover from the war and no real desire to even grant African Americans Civil Rights. (5)Morality/Popularity: 1 out of 5 Stars- A southernor himself, its not surprising that he opposed Civil Rights laws and wanted to simply let the south slide , personally endorsing the Black Laws in southern states designed to deprive Africans of their rights. He was very unpopular, both with the North who wanted to see the South under stricter rule, and with his own party, who expected him to support Civil Rights. [Final Score: 1.4- 1 out of 5 Stars] Historians often rank Andrew Johnson as the worst possible person to have served after the Civil War. His obvious racism and commitment to obstructing political and civil rights for African Americans is directly responsible for the failure of Reconstruction to solve the race problem in the south, and perhaps in America as well.
