I'd put this as the #3 album ever (behind Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper). This is a brilliant collection of songs written by Brian Wilson, who at the time was bed-ridden after a breakdown. The harmonies and melody singing created are really unmatched by most. It is a look into the mind of a musical genius. It escaped the Beach Boys from their surf rock title. God Only Knows is in the opinion of Paul McCartney, the best song of all-time. Also, Wouldn't it be Nice is a wonderful song. This is a personification of the Beach Boys at their best.
