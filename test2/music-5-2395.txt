Simply, one of my favorite Petra albums. Petra never thought a Praise album would fly but this album got them many awards including a Dove and maybe (I cannot remember or not) a Grammy. I love both this one and their first praise album. The first one was more hard rock and this one is a little mellower but not much. Keep on rockin' guys!!
