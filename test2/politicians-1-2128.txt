Gray Davis is an embarassment to California. He is a leader in poor decision making. His agenda is to lower the quality of life here and provide for easy influx of people who will become government dependant, thereby securing the agenda of the socialist Democratic Party to increase the size of Government and the people's dependance upon it.
