The G.M. treats her crew and drivers like crap! She call them at home and "bitches" about the numbers, when in fact she doesnt seem to know how to schedule her labor out over the month, nor can she keep basic supplies in the pipeline, running out of napkins and packaged red peppers or cheese is nuts! PJ's San Diego employes an 18year old manager, who has not got an ounce of sence on how to be serivce oriented, she screams, curses and degrades the crew when things get missed up! Please, get her out of Ocean Beach....and the numbers will go up, the service will go up! Then, stop hiring unexperienced, immmature, naive GM's, and I'll eat at P'J's again!
