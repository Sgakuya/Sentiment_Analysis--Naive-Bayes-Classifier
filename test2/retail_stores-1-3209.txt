I used to rent VHS tapes from Blockbuster. In recent years, every other tape was so damaged as to be unviewable. I talked to my local stores and was told that when someone returned a tape that they said was bad, Blockbuster just put it back on the shelf to be rented again. One of the workers showed me the secret mark that employeer put on a tape known to be damaged. This helped me to get viewable tapes for a while. Now that Blockbuster has gone to DVDs, they care even less about the VHS tapes. They stopped even marking the bad tapes on their shelves. I finally threw away my Blockbuster card.
