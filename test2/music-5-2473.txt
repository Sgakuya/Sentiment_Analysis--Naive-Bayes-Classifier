With the horrible self-destuction of Brain Jones nearly complete, Keith "The Riffmaster" Richards and his partner in crime were leading the incredible Rolling stones into an ever bluesier, more hard-edged direction. Always darker realists when compared to the ethereal lightness of the similarly exposed Fab Four, the Stones brought many a hard reality crashing down upon a wide-eyed audience with gusto. These were pirate stories, told by the very pirates themselves. Mick sang of a world replete with murderous midnight ramblers, disheartened souls rejected by love, and shuddering refugees seeking shelter from the storms of life. To a planet being torn apart by war and social unrest, the Stones provided the soundtrack through sinewy guitars, precision drum beats, the occasional harmonica burst, and Bill Wyman's thumping bass lines. We were going down with the ship but the band played defiently on. Sneering at the process and defying the coming darkness. And nobody did it better. A true classic album from a band at the height of it's powers. The only addition this series (along with the previously released 'Begger's Banquet')of albums needed would be to hear them played live which is what the world got with the subseqent release of 'Get Yer Ya Ya's Out' recorded over two nights at Madison Square Garden during November of 1969. (The Stones best live album recorded during the bands most legendary tour.) Get all three of these recordings, listen to them in order, and you'll see what I mean. This is why they earned their reputation as the world's greatest rock and roll band. It's a title that they still hold.
