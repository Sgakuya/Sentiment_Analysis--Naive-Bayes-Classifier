I purchased a wedding set priced at $4,000.00, and it has been repaired over 20 times in 18 months!!! The stones are always falling out and it turns black(the gold). Currently, my new jeweler at Emerson & Farrar (the best store ever!!!)has informed me that the diamonds are of very poor quality, the repairs are a terrible job, and during the repairs, Crescent has chipped several of my stones. They have even replaced my center stone, a 1/2 carat diamond, with a 1/3, like I wouldn't notice!!!! It is sad that my wedding ring, which should be the symbol of happiness, is a source of total aggrivation. Not to mention, with all the repairs, they have my wedding ring more ofter than I do. I have requested a refund from the beginning, and was obviously told no, all the way up the corporate ladder. I have filed several complaints with the Better Business Bureau. The company stated, they don't have to reply to the BBB complaints. Never, ever, buy from them, I am not the only angry ripped off customer I know.
