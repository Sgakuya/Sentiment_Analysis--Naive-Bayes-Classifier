My husband bought my diamond engagement ring from Gordons (sister store) in 2001.It took them four times to get my ring sized correctly. After the ring was sized, one of the side diamonds fell out while I was at work. In 2002, the band cracked, so we decided to have Zales fix it because we didnt want to deal with the people at Gordons anymore. Zales fixed it for free after much complaining. Recently the middle diamond came loose, so Zales wants to charge us 14.99 per prong to tighten the setting. My ring has been sent away 6 times in less than three years! I dont recommend Zales or Gordons. Their expensive jewelry doesnt seem to hold up very well..
