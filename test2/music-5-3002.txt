This is my favorite cd and the only Beatles my wife will play because she wants to hear it. This is a fascinating musical dialog among the 4 musicians who took one of the most amazing magical musical tours ever. Dig the banter back and forth between Lennon and McCartney with some Harrison for what it's worth tracks and a couple of Ringo Lounge Lizard gems thrown in for good measure. Plus the only Eric Clapton I can stand to hear.
