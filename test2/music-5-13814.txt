I am not so sure that this should be classified as a Rap CD - Kid Rock is definitely diversifying his musi a little to move out of this genre. He is a cross between many different types of music. The CD is what anyone familiar with his music would expect it to be. Nice picture of the Kid as a kid inside of the CD jacket.
