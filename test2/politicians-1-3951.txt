This man can be packaged over and over. This is his best quality. Unfortunately, as fun as it might be to joke about ... this is the PRESIDENT of the US we're talking about. At best foreign nations will bear less animosity towards us as they become less insecure. If Bush becomes the president of the US, well, Americans couldn't be that smart after all.
