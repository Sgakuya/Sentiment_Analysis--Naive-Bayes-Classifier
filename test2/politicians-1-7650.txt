I used to like Jefferson a lot. IN the last year, I have read Bio's on Washington, Franklin, Adams, and Hammilton. I now see him as a guy who wrote the declaration(franklin eddited it) then disapeared during the Rev. He did not fight, in fact often fled in terror, then attacked Hamiliton (a war hero) on his war record. He acts nice in public and goes around stabbing in the back anyone who disagreed with him politically. the only good thing he did as a Pres was the louisanna purchase otherwise some bad choices. and to user Chagoth who said that Jefferson left Adams midnight packing of the courts alone.... umm justice S Chase was impeached but was not voted out, had he been Jefferson would have gone after Marshall. Thankfully he failed. He was a petty man who should have been better.
