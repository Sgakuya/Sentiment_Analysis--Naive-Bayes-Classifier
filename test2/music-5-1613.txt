This album hasn't left my cd player since I bought it. It's such an amazing mix of heavy guitars and haunting vocals. I know that's how it's often described, but there's a reason for that. The lyrics are beautiful, and the album as a whole is very cathartic. I think that anyone who gives Evanescence a chance will soon fall in love with their unique sound.
