OHHH man! Where do i start??? I noticed there were no comments for Dude Ranch . You guys suck. I'm going to assume that most of you jumped on the bandwagon when Enema came out. Anyway, these guys crack me up (Go Mark!). Anthem is the most awesome party song, while Party Song is the raddest song to learn the words to. (It's so hard to sing it all in one breath!) If you don't have it yet, Enema is a must-buy...plus (and this is for the boys out there) that hot chick Janine is on the cover..woo-hoo!
