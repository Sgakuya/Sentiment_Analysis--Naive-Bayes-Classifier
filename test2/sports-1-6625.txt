Get real. I'm not just hating on the little guy, but come on. They are the definition of fluke. Every year, some little team pops up that thinks it is here to stay, not realizing how hard that actually is. When the smoke clears, it will be UCONN, Carolina, UK, Dook, KU, Mich. St., etc., just like it always has been and just like it always will be. And this is a cliche, but who do they play. If they begin last season in the ACC, are they even over .500 by season's end? They gave their fans a fun season, but that kind of year will not be commonplace for them - maybe within their conference. They will probably get some pretty big programs on their schedule now, but that just means they will lose more often, thus keeping them out of the top 25.
