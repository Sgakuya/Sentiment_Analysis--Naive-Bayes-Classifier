Jesse Jackson is a racist idiot. I get so sick and tired of seeing his worthless hide! He hurts everyone in America, but especially hurts the African-American community. He cares only about himself and advancing Jesse. As far as the title reverend goes, he doesn't believe the Bible. One of my heroes is Oklahoma Congressman J.C. Watts. What a great American!
