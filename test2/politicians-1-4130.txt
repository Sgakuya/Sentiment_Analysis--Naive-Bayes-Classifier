Backed by one the neatest group of wacko s ever seen in decades, Ralph Nader campaigned to the best of his ability. I thank him every day for electing George Bush. If you are one of his supporters, just remember, your candidate ran for office fully knowing what the impact of his actions would be on this country and instead acted in a way that advanced his own personal agenda.
