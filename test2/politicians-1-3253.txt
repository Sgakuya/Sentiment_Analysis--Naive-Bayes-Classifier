Clinton has to be, by far, the lowest moral person who ever held office. Not only for disgracing the country with his sexual games, but for lying repeatedly about it. Not to mention all his other scandals. Whitewater, FBI files, Travel office, etc. For the record, the GOP passed welfare reform only to have Clinton repeal some of the progress after his 96 election win.
