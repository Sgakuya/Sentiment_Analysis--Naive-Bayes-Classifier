How can this double-album simultaneously be so satisfying and yet so frustrating? It s almost as if you can hear the spectacular talent of the Beatles as it starts to fracture and go its separate ways. The Lennon/McCartney dynamic, which produced some of the all-time best pop songs, spins out in our ears and results in the almost-all-Lennon ( Why Don t We Do It in the Road? ) and the almost-all-McCartney ( Blackbird ). Some of the songs are beautiful ( Cry Baby Cry ), others are angry ( Helter Skelter ), others are ugly ( Revolution 9 ) It s a hell of a mess. And still it s amazing.
