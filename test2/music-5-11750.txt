okay,i am a HUGE GC fan,and i am very happy about this cd of theirs!all of their songs are very good,and you can tell they put a lot of effort into it.it really helps me when i listen to it,because it reminds me that i am not the only kid out here that's different.the young and the hopeless pretty much is a punk/rock/pop cd,and has a little something for everyone!!
