I agree with Golden Bear and Willie A about the quality of Walmart assembled products. There has to be something wrong with it for the price to be so low! I once purchased a cd player from Walmart and with in a few months the damn right earphone stop working and then it stop reading the cds. I bought another one from Kmart that was not as cheap as the one from Walmart and it is still working great a year later! WALMART IS BEST FOR BUYING STUFF THAT ISN'T BUILT IN A FACTORY like cleaning supplies or food, but stay away from manufactured items!!
