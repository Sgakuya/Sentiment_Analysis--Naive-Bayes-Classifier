Has an athlete ever fallen so far so fast? It was only a few years ago that Kordell (as Slash) was a rookie sensation generating the type of excitement that Randy Moss did in his rookie year. Then, he became the starting QB and led the Steelers to the playoffs. Now, only a few years later, he is not only the back-up to Kent Graham, but he deserves to be. Kordell has lost all of his confidence and is just plain awful. I think it is time for him to reprise his old role and take advantage of his athletic skills.
