This is one of the best bands I've ever heard. What I can stand is the people that say there not punk because they aren't arrogant or sing about how much they don't care! Come on people! Where's your sense of humor?!?!?! The CD Young and the Hopeless is funny and serious at the same time. And it doesn't hurt that they're fine!!!
