Great myths of our time-Ronald Reagan ended the Cold War. Fact-the Soviet Union was dying by the 1980s and collapsed because it had run out of gas. Perhaps the Gipper's biggest effect today was that he probably armed the Taliban in Afghanistan when they were fighting the Soviets. He, Ollie North, and other collaborationists in the Iran-Contra scandal should all be shot for treason.
