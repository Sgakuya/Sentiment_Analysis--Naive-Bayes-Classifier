A delightfully frenetic retro offering, from the space-suited French House masters known as Daft Punk. More melodic than their first album, and infused with more emotion. (Interesting fact: Every track on the album gets a video in the extended anime-styled music video known as Interstella 5555, created by the legendary Leiji Matsumoto)
