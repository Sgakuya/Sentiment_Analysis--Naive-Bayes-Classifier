Arrogant, overstuffed yellow bellied jerk. Almost as bad as General Nuisance (Charles De-Galle), this pompous pumped up yo-yo is making a nuisance of himself that is bad as anything De-Gaulle ever cooked up. France is not an important country anymore and it just can't come to terms that it is not #1 in Europe anymore.
