He's a low-level, country-bumpkin doofus. Totally unsuccessful as the leader of the State of Alabama. Doesn't impress me as one who can walk and chew gum at the same time. On top of all of that, he's trying to balance the State's budget on the backs of the state employees. Big businness has scared him s**tless...because...he refuses to see that they pay their fair share of the tax burden. Gets on his soapbox about the sins and evils of legalized gam bling, but accepted over $300,000.00 towards his election campaign from an out-of-state gambling consortium. Go figure!
