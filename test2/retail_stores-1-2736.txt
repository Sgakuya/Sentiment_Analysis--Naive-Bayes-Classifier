Home Depot used to be my hardware store of choice. It used to be clean (no more), organized (never), good service (none), and a great place to check out new tools, appliances, etc. My last 5! visits to my Home Depot were awful. Rude employees, inaccessable merchandise, filty dirty, etc. Now I drive right past my Home Depot right to the Lowes. The Lowes is always clean, straight, and stocked. There lumber is better, their hardware is cheaper, and the place is a joy to shop. The only reason I gave Home Depot one star is because I couldn't give it no stars. Awful store and I will NEVER shop in one again.
