I hate David Ortiz because he defected from my favorite team, the Minnesota Twins, and went to the most hated team in baseball, the Boston Red Sox. What a coincidence he started hitting once he got to Boston, but couldn't hit worth a lick in Minnesota. I hope that double-crossing monkey goes down in flames! You suck Ortiz!
