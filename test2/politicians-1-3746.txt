I wish you could give no stars because he is not a good guy. He is inexperienced badly. I think he will win unfortunatly. I dont mind people winning the election but George W Bush is stealing it. The Electoral Colledge is worthless and it was made because our forefathers didnt fully trust the people. I want Al Gore to win but its not going to happen. GWB is not the choice of the people. The popular vote is Al Gores.
