Tonight, 3/21/01, on Hardball, hardly an unbiased info show, Cheney talked about how he worked as a young intern and made only $10 an hour, stating but, that was probably all I was worth. For those of you who think this man is honorable and respectful, may I respectfully suggest that MANY people in America today are making $10 an hour AND less and are most certainly worth much more. The Cheney's and Bush's of the world are greedy men who use terms like compassion and bi-partisanship to further their own agendas, in the media and with their wealthy pals. Sure, $10 is not good enough for Cheny but let the rest of the country suffer as he and Bush lead us into a recession JUST to get their wealthy pals a tax break. Haven't we had enough of being dictated to by the media and its owners; what are we afraid of: Democracy? Katie V.
