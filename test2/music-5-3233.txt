My feelings about this album have changed over time. It was my favorite when I was in 4th grade, bought a used copy from the coolest kid in my elementary school. Years later it sounded impossibly cheesy. Revisiting it today, it just stands out as an impossibly weird record (I mean that in the best way). From the very beginning ( hey hey mama... ), you know you're in for something over the top. And it never lets up. The drum sound on When the Levee Breaks is the greatest I know of. Misty Mountain Hop is as good as rock music gets. yeah this one rocks.
