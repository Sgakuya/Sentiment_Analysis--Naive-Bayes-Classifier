I used to like this man because he was a moral Democrat. However, I lost a lot of respect for Lieberman when during the Clinton administration he was criticizing Clinton for what he did, yet voted to keep him in office. To me, that is not sticking to your morals, he revealed his true colors. He showed he cares more about power than ethics.
