Catchy songs that rock. Okay, I know, not punk rock. My idea of punk rock is skinny, english bands back in the day. But who knows what music is classified as anymore. Everything is mixing. Benji and Joel write the songs according to things that happened to them when they were kids. A lot of kids are having the same problems. Their songs help people my age (15 - 18) deal with these problems. You know you're not alone. And it's okay to be a punk , freak , or one of those people. Not to mention the music kicks ass. GOOD JOB GC!
