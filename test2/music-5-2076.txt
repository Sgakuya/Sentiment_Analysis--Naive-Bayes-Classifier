3 Doors Down is one of the most amazing bands I have ever seen! Their cd The Better Life is awesome and ALL the songs are great!! It's hard to pick just one! Anyone who has not had the pleasure of seeing this band in concert, it's a MUST SEE!! If you haven't gotten their cd yet, I highly recommend it!!
