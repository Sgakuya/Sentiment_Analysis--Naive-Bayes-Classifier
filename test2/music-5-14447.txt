I loved this CD! I thought Colm Wilkinson is THE jean valjean! he is amazing! I also love Frances Ruffele i think her voice is gorgeous and powerful but at times can be sweet and sorrowful! She was a terrific Eponine! This whole sound track is gorgeous and the music is beatiful and an enjoyment to listen to!
