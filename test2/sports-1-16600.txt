He may still have a chance to yet succeed. But until then, Eli Manning deserves his notoriety as the player who picked the team he wanted to play for AND YET NOT DELIVER! Manning burned many bridges and alienated fans with his arrogance by refusing to play for the San Diego Chargers. Worse, Manning has not lived up to his promise as a great quarterback thus far for a team that is far more equipped for him to utilize his great talents evident in college. In essence, Eli Manning has backed himself in a corner and he must now prove his worth for the angst he has provoked early in his career.
