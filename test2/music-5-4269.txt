If anyone had any interest in the Beatles, this would be the album to start with. At first, I as a bit weary buying this because I nver did hear a good number of the songs on this album. However, my urge to buy a CD came in, and it was the best CD Barnes and Noble had for sale. Once I heard it, I now understood why poeple made such a big deal about the Beatles. Nearly every song on this disc is enjoyable all the way through. This was the greatest hits CD that finally did the band justice.
