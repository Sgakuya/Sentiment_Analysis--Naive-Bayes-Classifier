Our unelected RESIDENT is an ignorant, puerile, vicious CHIMPANZEE. He's dumber than a box of retarded rocks and totally vicious to anyone who isn't a member of the privileged, wealthy aristocracy that props him up and runs this country behind the scenes. He stole the 2000 election and his handlers have orchestrated his foreign policy gaffes into mindless political support from the mass of sheep that constitute the American electorate. Shrub is stealing from the poor to give to the rich, selling out our freedom to the military and the religious right and will soon manage to get untold numbers of our fathers, brothers, husbands and friends slaughtered in Iraq in the interests of his election in 2004 (it isn't a re-election because the swine was never elected in the first place). In a democracy, people get the government they deserve and Dubya is clear proof of that maxim.
