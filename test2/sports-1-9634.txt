No, no, I see nothing to worry about. The Heat have it all the way. Detroit or Indiana will have nothing for Haslem, Dooling, Jones, Laetner, Butler, etc. Right Heat fans?! Say it! I'm begging you! - say it! Say you can't be beat. You got it all the way, right? This is easy! Prince could not possibly keep Wade in check............. .......could he? And that frontline for Detroit is pitiful! No way they could contend with Laetner, Mourning, Shaq and HASLEM! No way. Oh, you guys are a lock for champs! SAY IT! SAY IT! SAY IT! SAY IT! SAY IT! .................... ........................................ ..............I dare you! The Heat suck. F%CK THE HEAT! 1 star. We already saw how little Detroit gives a damn about Shaq. IF they beat Indiana! - looking at the matchups, Indiana might pose more of a threat. And if you're saying, 'how could Indiana threaten more than Miami'? - I'm not talking about seeds, regular season records, rest, rust, any of that. I'm talking about BASKETBALL. It's not as simple as who has the best record. If I absolutely ADORED THE HEAT. IF I LOVED THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING ON THIS EARTH!........I can't see them beating Detroit. IF I DESPISED, HATED DETROIT! - this has nothing to do with who I like. Maybe I'm wrong, but if I were a Heat fan, I wouldn't buy my Finals ticket just yet. Again, I could be wrong, but smart analyzation says otherwise. I'll feel no shame if I'm wrong, I'll feel like Miami defied smart basketball thinking, and pulled off an upset.
