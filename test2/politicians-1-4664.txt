Why can't I vote zero for this beastly, power hungry, fascist corporate bandit of a politician??? I have never liked him, especially after he tried to cut Headstart. As a former Headstart teacher I saw first-hand just how vital this proven program is for low-income people. This guy is like a rabid dog so it's no wonder that someone as insecure as Bush would choose him as a running mate. Oh, and his health? Why, it's never been better he says! That's why he has medical care 24 hours a day. Hey Cheney- so did my grandfather. Right before he died in a nursing home.
