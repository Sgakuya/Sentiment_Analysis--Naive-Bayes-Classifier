I have been a loyal J.Crew shopper for ten years and will regretfully stop shopping there and encourage others to do so until they stop selling fur. In a civilized society, the barbaric act of killing animals for the sake of status is abhorrent. I would encourage anyone unfamiliar with the fur industry to do a little bit of research to see the conditions in which the animals are kept. With so many fake options out there, there's just no excuse.
