Amazing potential but what has he done? UPDATE: I want a Ron Mexico jersey. UPDATE: Falcons fans should play a tape that repeats the phrase "Vick fumbles" so they will be prepared for next year. He was suppossed to be the blueprint for the next generation of QB, but he gets sacked alot, makes bad reads, and takes off running at the first sign of trouble. No thanks.
