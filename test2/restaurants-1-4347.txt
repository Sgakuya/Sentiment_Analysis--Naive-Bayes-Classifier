I expected so much more based on what some people had told me about this place. OMG Crackle Barrel sucks!!! After getting through that cheezy store-front and sitting down to the most annoying of waiters -- who failed to even let us sit before he asked what we wanted to drink -- and then -- proceeded to OVER describe each menu special -- WTF -- I can read you freak! Anyway -- to the meal. Chicken and dumplings? My wife had about the poorest excuse for a meal in her life -- and my f-ing pot roast dinner was more like Carrots and a little meat. What a f-ing disappoint after my redneck friends pimped this place like it was the greatest place in the world. I should have known people who consider flannel a major fashion statement would have been wrong about food too. Cracker Barrel is Americana gone bad -- Southern Cooking perverted into some alien life form -- Crapper Barrel is off my list. What a waste of a hour and $25. Thank goodness it was only that amount. This place must survive on people who have little regard for their overall health and are missing taste buds.
