Taco Bell used to be good, back in the Bll Beefer days. Today it's downhill. That stupid dog only reminds me that their meat tastes like dog. Go to a Taqueria and you get a seasoned, flavorful meat, not bland ground beef with a packet of Safeway Mexican seasoning in it. Their meat is terrible. The portions are too small and it's not authentic enough. I'd rather go to a local taqueria than Taco Bell. Even though Taco Bell is cheap, it's cheap quality.
