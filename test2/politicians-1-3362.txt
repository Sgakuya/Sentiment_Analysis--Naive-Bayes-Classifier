Bush is a moron, plain and simple. His lack of charisma is only the beginning of his problems. He's a puppet for the Republican party, and he's more concerned about an alleged moral crusade than anything else. I honestly think that Bush owes an apology to all of the Iraqis who have it worse now that there are loads of jihads than before the war. He owes an apology to the entire working class for turning the cold shoulder when corporations refuse to give them the benefits and salaries they deserve. He owes an apology to the American people for being an oil man and still profiting while the rest of us pay insane prices for gas. And he owes the rest of the world an apology for acting like God or whatever deity you believe in put him in the Oval Office to rule the earth. Social Security is all screwed up, kids are getting dumber, there are more and more uninsured people who are being taken advantage of by corporations, and Americans, British, other Europeans, Australians, Iraqis, and other members of the Arab world are dying every day because he's too proud to pull out of a pointless war that he began just so that people would rally around the flag before the 2004 election. I didn't vote for this jerk, and neither did any caring, educated person I know.
