I can't think of the words to adequately assess this man's inadequacies, lies, and the hurt he has personally brought upon this nation. The people of this country in 1992 thought and stated that character wasn't an issue to be concerned with. Well, after 8 years, if they still feel that way, they are truly hopeless cases. Just look at what we are going through now with the election. Gore (Clinton student) is pulling a typical end run just like Bill would do. He's learned well from the master.
