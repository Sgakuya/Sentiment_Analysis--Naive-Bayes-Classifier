Yes. Yes, yes, yes. The best of the best of one of the best. There is NO denying what an amazing voice Mick Jagger has, and Hot Rocks is a terrific example of his skills, as well as Keith/Brian/Bill/Charlie/everybody else's amazing abilities. Ruby Tuesday, Paint it Black, Mother's Little Helper, 19th Nervous Breakdown---a few examples of the hot rocks on Hot Rocks.
