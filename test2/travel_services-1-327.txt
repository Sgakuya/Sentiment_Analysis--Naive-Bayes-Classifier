I don't know why, but I always get the impression that British Airways could care less if I'm a customer or not. I know it's not just British reserve because I'm british myself. Their competition is light years ahead of them. They should be following their lead, not trying to make things difficult for them. And those ads? That's First Class I'm afraid, why don't you show what it's like for the cattle in the back. I actually rarely used them in the last few years. Now because of the way the handled a recent routine inquiry of mine. I am boycotting them, maybe forever.
