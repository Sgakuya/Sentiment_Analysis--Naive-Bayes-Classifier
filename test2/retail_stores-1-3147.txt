These guys suck, but it may just be my neighborhood store. They put all the DVDs and games behind the counter, so you stand in line for awhile only to finally make it to the front and be told that the DVD or game you're wanting is not in (even tho a rental box is out on the shelf). Not even .99 coupons can make me go back in there.
