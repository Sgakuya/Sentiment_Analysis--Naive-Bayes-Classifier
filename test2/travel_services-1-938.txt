Moved from Colorado to California and have horror stories--They couldn't find a driver, or tell me when my van would arrive. When they finally could tell me it was arriving the next day, they called two hours later and said it was all a mistake, and they still didn't have a driver......There were surprise charges and damaged furniture and the movers had their girlfriends and toddlers with them! The movers were all fine, the disorganization and mis/lack of communication within Wheaton were unbelievable. Good Housekeeping take away the seal!
