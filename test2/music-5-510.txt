This was an extremely excellent album. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a great band, all of their CDs are good. This one is just better. I just love every song on this album. They're fun to sing along to, although some songs kind of have the same sound. I just think this is a hot band and they've been around for a long time, they've always been good and they keep getting better. They're also so good in concert.
