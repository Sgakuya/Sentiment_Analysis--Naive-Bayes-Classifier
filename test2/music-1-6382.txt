You know things are bad when even Alice himself admits that his singing is brutal. On this CD he is very Macy Gray like. For those that need reminding, Macy Gray is a screeching singer who's voice makes me run for earplugs! Alice Cooper is a rock man, and fails to keep up with the trends of the time. Fans that have been following him for awhile will like this new effort, but he fails to get new fans with his outdated singing!
