I love the song, don't get me wrong, i liked it by Roberta Flack, Al B. Sure, AND the Fugees... but i thought the video stunk and had nothing to do with the song. It just sucked to me, why were they in the theater? Eating up some greasy popcorn? That just ruined it, i was disappointed, the fugees are awesome and could've done way better... they're stayin alive kicked much more ass.
