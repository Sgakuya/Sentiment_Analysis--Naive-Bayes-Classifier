I love R.E.M. Out of Time is the first CD I bought with my own money. REM has created such a huge body of respectable work for many years and Out of Time stands out in my mind as a great album. It's very melodic and the lyrics are poetry, not cliche or superficial. REM is a group of true musicians and I'm proud to own their music.
