I've never had a good experience with Radio Shack. The instant you walk in the door someone asks you if you need help, and then when I DO have a question they can NEVER answer it. I've had the same problem at multiple stores in multiple STATES, so it is not confined to one outlet. They have decent commercials (TERRY HATCHER) and I'm glad they stepped away from having strictly Radio Shack brand merchandise (Tandy, anyone? blah). They still have a long way to go before I will set foot in one of their stores again.
