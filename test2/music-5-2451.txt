This album takes time to sink in. Once it does, you realize that if any other band yesterday or today came out with a record like this, they would instantly influence their time and place... and record industry executives just wouldn't understand the record's success. Revolver blends so many of the Beatles earlier style together with later developing styles. Its really the missing link. Many people don't understand this record. Its not made for your average Joe or the conformist pop rock audience. Revolver is not only a transormation for the Beatles, but also one for the technicians who recorded this record... they were experimenting just as much (like in Tomorrow Never Knows ). Their playing with 2-way stereo and the way the drums are recorded in Revolver is just one of a kind. George starts out the record with Taxman and Ringo and Paul (drum bass) create such a cool little vibe that even Beck has ripped off this beat in his New Pollution. The strings in Eleanor Rigby sounds so authentic that I think no string piece today can sound the same again because there are too many sound engineers nowadays who would just screw it all up. Ringo's drum playing is at its best in She Said, She Said . Paul's songwriting is probably at its peak in this record, and John's I'm Only Sleeping grows on you like no other song. I still can't beleive that in 1966 when Revolver was released Capitol Records pulled this song off the record for its US release fearing that it might influence kids to do drugs... oh, onservative America. Overall, Revolver is indeed pretty dark with moments of the early Beatles popping up in between. Revolver has been very influential among musicians... to me, it's the one Beatles record that was made for that smaller group of people who actually stop to listen to and appreciate music.
