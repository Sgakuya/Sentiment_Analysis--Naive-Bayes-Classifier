Long story short, I bought a GPS system, from circuit city in El Paso Texas. The sales man lied through his teeth, saying that if I was un happy I could get full return in 30 days. Before picking up the item, on the receipt I looked if this item was excluded, usually on the receipts they (electronics merchants) will disclose what item cannot be returned with out a restock fee), in the receipt all they said was visit circuitcity.com for details BASICALLY until you get home, open the item, surf the web and find out about their 14 days/15% restocking fee, you are basically left at the mercy of the sales man's lies because you cannot properly inform yourslef about the truth...this makes me irate. Anyhow, I filed a complaint about Circuit City with the Texas attorney general's office, and the FTC. I may take them to court. For other suckered comsumers,mad about unfair deceitful merchant practices here are the forms you should fill out, at least if enough people complain about how circuit city discloses their merchant sales policy, maybe the government will do something. here are the sites for the FTC: https://rn.ftc.gov/pls/dod/wsolcq$.startup?Z_ORG_CODE=PU01 for TEXAS only or if you bought in TEXAS: https://www.oag.state.tx.us/forms/cpd/cpd_getcounty.php hope this helps
