Congressman Condit should be thrown out of office not because he had an affair, you know how many congressman are having affairs at this current time! He should be censored and thrown out of congress for obstructing a missing persons case and putting himself and his career over the well-being of a missing person. His hypocrisy also amazes me. He goes out during the Clinton impeachment saying that the President should disclose everything he knew about the Lewinsky case, yet when it came time for Condit to disclose everything, he didn't. Horrendous!!
