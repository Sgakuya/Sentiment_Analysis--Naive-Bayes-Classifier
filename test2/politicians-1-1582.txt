bombing IRAQ will never be helpful because he himself does not care about his own people,they are starving, babies are dying, no medicine and most of all no freedom at all. BOMBING IRAQ is done by the U.S. with the support of saddam husein . if the u.s. wants to bomb someone or sdomething that might aswell be saddam himself . enough killing innocent men, women and children
