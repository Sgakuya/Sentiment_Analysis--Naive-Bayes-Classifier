Anyone seen John Kerry since he got the Botox injections? I always thought the mortician did a great job with John Kerry, I don't know that botox could mix with embalming fluid. Frankly, I like just the embalming fluid. It gives a nicer look. He used to look like Keith Richard's square brother who went to business school.
