Ever since the Fox group has taken over they have done very little that seemed to help the Dodgers.I hate to sound like i'm crying over spilled milk(Piazza)but when they continually make the same type of personell mistakes its hard to forget.Take the whole thing with Sheffield for instance, sure he probably shouldnt have mouthed off the way he did, but when you take into consideration that he came to a team where the fans were booing him because of who he wasnt(Piazza)and still batted over .310 while knocking home at least 36 to 40 homers, how dare the Fox organization for even thinking trade let alone letting it be known to the public.Then the guy says he wants to be a life time Dodger at a bargain rate and you still show no loyalty no commitment no intension on showing the team the fans and the players that we are commited to winning and willing to pay for excellance.Now there is one thing that i think they have done that was good and that was keeping the pitching staff in tact, but given there track record for bundleing with big players I doubt it will last.
