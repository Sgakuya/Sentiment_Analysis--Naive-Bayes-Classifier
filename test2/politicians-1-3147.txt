Worst president in modern times. Corrupt to the core, assuming he has a core. First criminal to be prez. The first anti-leader - Clinton governed by polls yet still managed to have the majority vote against him twice. Fought balancing the budget and welfare reform until the GOP forced both issues. Claims to greatness: Cleaned up Arkansas government by leaving the state, getting his successor Dem governor convicted and electing a GOP governor. Integral to the GOP taking Congress, ending 40 years of Dem corruption.
