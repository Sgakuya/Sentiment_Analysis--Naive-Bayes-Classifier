Talk About Recalling California Governor Gray Davis. How about recalling Clippers Owner Donald T. Sterling, and GM Elgin Baylor. Donald Sterling doesn't care about his team. Sterling is all about his multi-million dollar real estate buisness, and friar's club meetings. Sterling owns all these townhouses and apartments down L.A.'s Wilshire Boulevard, yet he doesn't give a damn about his team. I mean where was he when the Clippers bid farewell to the old Sports Arena, I'll tell ya, he was in New York City on a buisness meeting, and what about the playoffs, another buisness meeting. He's rarely at the games, doesn't and is willing to fire coaches, and cut players to make money. I ask David Stern, and the U.S. Supreme Court. Donald Sterling needs to sell the Clippers to a better franchise owner, otherwise, this team will continue to be a sour lining on Los Angeles's Great Sports History. IMPEACH STERLING!
