Big L was the greatest lyricist of all time and he made a huge contribution 2 hip hop. As u can tell i'm his greatest fan and i have a tribute in my room 2 him. this is a great cd which I recommend 2 anyone who likes good beats and amazing lyrics. Go cop it whenever he touched a mic he blessed our ears. BIG L R.I.P
