Poor Ricky. Talk about having no chance against a well-orchestrated, well-funded campaign organization. I felt sorry for him having to wage a spirited campaign against one of the most well-known figures on the planet. He really seemed like a genuine, nice guy, with a well-meaning campaign---until he stalked across the aisle to Hillary's podium during a televised debate, stuck his skinny finger in her face and demanded she sign an acknowledgement. The minute I saw that spectacle unfold, the New York State Senate race was all but over. I felt that he would have been better concentrating on his Long Island constituents. He certainly knew them better than anyone east of Mineola. He made only a half-hearted attempt to visit upstate NY, because he, as well as the rest of the Re-smug-licans, knew the score: he simply didn't stand a chance in a state that, for better or worse, is one of the more progressive states in the Union when it comes to diversity, education, health care, tolerance of minorities' viewpoints, womens' issues and is a bastion of liberal, free-spirited, tolerant views. Little Ricky did the smart thing and acquiesced to a strong woman who can help ALL New Yorkers, and not just nouveau-riche Re-smug-licans such as Lazio.
