As a new customer of Blockbuster, I was out of town and my adult daughter returned my video games for me. Unfortunately, she assumed they were from Hollywood Video. As soon as the employee got the games, he immediately called Blockbuster and told them what happened. The person at Blockbuster assured the Hollywood Video employee that there would be no late fee charge to us, as they were returned on time. When my husbund went to rent a video, to our surprise, they chaged us $20.00 late fee. My husband explained what happened, and what we were told. They did not care, and charged us anyway. That was my first time experience. It was also my last experience. I'll stick to Hollywood Video. Tina DaSilva Vancouver, WA
