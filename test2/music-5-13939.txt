This is one of the best albums they have ever made. They are still the greatest songwriters we have ever had. They are the only group to have six number 1s in the top ten at one time. Even the beetles didn't do that. Also, they have had two platinum albums in the 90s. How's that for staying power. MORE POWER TO THE BEE GEES.
