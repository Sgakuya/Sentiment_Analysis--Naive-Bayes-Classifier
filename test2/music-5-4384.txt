Oh, my god! The boss still has it! Talent, energy, good looks! This album is so much fun to listen to, just like all of the Boss's other albums! It offers a chance to lose yourself in great music and sing along at top volume (no matter how off-key you may be!) to every single song! I can't pick just one all-time favorite on this, although I do LOVE Born to Run (it never loses it's magic!) My Love Will Not Let You Down , If I Should Fall Behind , Prove it all Night , Jungleland , and Two Hearts . I must say, though, the one thing about this album that bugged me (other than the fact that it's not long enough!) is that in 10th Ave. Freeze Out, Bruce is doing this awesome gospel-style Rock and Roll Exorcism, Baptism, Bar Mitzvah, etc. but then he starts really flaunting his affections for Patti Scialfa. I mean, yeah, she's his wife, that's great, and I want Bruce to be happy, but it breaks my heart when I'm in the middle of a crush-fest, to hear that, y'know? But, it is really a terrific album, even if you aren't attracted to Bruce (though how could you not be?!). It belongs on the 'classic rock albums' list for sure, even though it's only been out a few weeks! It proved to the world that the Boss will never die, and only get better and better! Bruce, if you ever read this, know that I, along with every fan in that crowd, will go with you any time to that Land of Hope and Dreams, and we will love you forever!
