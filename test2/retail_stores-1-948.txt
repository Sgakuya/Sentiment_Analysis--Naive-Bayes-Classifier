Pure crap. They are clothes for big time preppies and that's it. With the exception of a few sweaters (that don't have A+F plastered all over them) it's hard to get any good things at all. The clothes are way too expensive. I mean, not many people, let alone teenagers, can pay 60 dollars for clothes. It's outrageous. If you want good clothes go elsewhere. Check out Old Navy, they're pretty good.
