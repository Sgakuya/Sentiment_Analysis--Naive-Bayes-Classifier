If Nader truly cared about the American people and the liberals, he would have STEPPED ASIDE. This election was too close for him to make his ridiculous stand. THANK YOU, Mr. Nader, for giving the country to Dubya so you can feel good about yourself. That was the most selfish, egotistical move I've ever seen a politician make- and that's saying a lot, particularly from a Napoleonic scholar!
