Clinton had the good graces and sheer luck to inherit the Reagan/Bush expansion and a Republican Legistlative branch but he also oversaw the most corrupt and vile corporate and political scandals in US history. At best he was an inept caretaker or a vile criminal who laid the ground work for 9/11/2001, Korea and China. His morality is what you would expect from a white trash Momma's boy without any strong male role model. God Bless GW Bush who is a great man in every way that Clinton isn't.
