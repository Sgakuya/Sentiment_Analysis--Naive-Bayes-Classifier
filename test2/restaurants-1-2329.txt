The worst of all the fast food chains. Highly overpriced teaspoons of three-day old leftover fish, dipped in tons of stale bread crumbs and fried to within an inch of it's life, this stuff barely qualifies as food. Most fish resturants would have an aroma of fish and the sea, but this place has an aroma of lockerroom and a pool that hasn't been cleaned in three years.
