.5 out of 5 Stars: Horrible-- Toxicity (2001) is System of A Down's latest album of derivative, monotonous, unstructured and unentertaining screaming sessions and simple, uninspired guitar riffs . System of A Down is merely, yet another nu-metal band in the same vein as Disturbed, Korn, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, etc. If you are a fan of the aforementioned, by all means, buy this album. As for people such as I who aren't selfless and mindless, and enjoy quality music, stay away from this album as you would with a Vanilla Ice/Larry Miller pornographic video.
