ben harper does in this cd as in all of his other ones play and sing with all of his soul with lyrics anyone could easily relate to giving you something to sing when you got the blues or are just as happy as a muskrat! i defenitly recomend this cd and all of his others, welcome to the cruel world, the will to live and fight for your mind, keep rockin
