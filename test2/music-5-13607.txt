I think this CD deserves a 5 because its got great beats and the lyrics are hella creative. It's not like any other hip hop or rap CD either. It has that different flavor that everyone's looking for. If you could look past all the stuff he says and see that it's not supposed to be examined so deeply-its funny and good rap all in the same.
