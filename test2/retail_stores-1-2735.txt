i agree with everybody who had bad experinces with home depot when you are in the store you cannot find nobody to help you specially when you want to see the manager(ex.BRIANfrom NILES,illinoios- home depot)it is never there and even if you're gonna live him a message he is not going to call you back.they lie a LOT and ...it is not good.
