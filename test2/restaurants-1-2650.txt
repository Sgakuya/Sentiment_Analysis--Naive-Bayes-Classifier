McDonald's used to be such a great fast food chain, with quality meals and other great items, but for years know the chain has really gone down hill. When I was young, I almost always ate at McDonald's, but now that I'm older I realize now at what has happened. They nearly always mess up the orders, burgers have no good taste unless you something on it, and most of the employees are just no good. Stay away for McDonald's folks, it's just a shadow of its former self.
