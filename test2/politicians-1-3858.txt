How can anyone believe that a failed businessman alcoholic can be a good choice for President. He is not trying to hide his alliance with the oil companies. He wants to save the rich at the expense of the middle and lower class. He cares nothing about the 99% of the people in this country, and only favors the rich 1% that he grew up with and funded his campaign. This is a RAT in sheep's clothing! Don't be fooled! Don't let this RAT take a bite out of you! DON'T VOTE BUSH!
