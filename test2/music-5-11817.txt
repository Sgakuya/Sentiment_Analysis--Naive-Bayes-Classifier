I really like this album. The songs are extremely catchy. I think this album is a little more deep than some of their previous ones. This album was written shortly after Tim's wife left him and if you listen to the songs you can hear him expressing that. Also, Rancid dedicated this album to the Ramones. Go out and get this album if you are a rancid fan. It is SOOOO good :)
