This is possibly the worst video I've ever seen. First of all Nelly's voice is like nails to a board to me and the lyrics are so incredibly stupid. Get on up on the dance floor, give that man what he's asking for (or something to that effect). Then like a broken record it's starts hick-uping It's getting hot in here, so take of all your clothes with some potential bimbo mimicing I am getting so hot I wanna take my clothes off (and mind you those women weren't wearing much to begin with). I don't consider myself a feminist but I'm still offended by this piece of rubbish.
