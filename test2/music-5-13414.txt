Nelly's CD Country Grammar is hot. Most of the songs have a phat beat and this playa has got to be the hottest rapper around. I saw Nelly in concert and he was blowin' up the place. He was the best act there. For all ya'll that be hatin' on Nelly and his phat CD all I have to say is ur makin him a bigga sucess by hatin- Real playas don't hate, dey understand.
