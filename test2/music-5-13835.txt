Greatest album ever made. That is the jist of it. No one could ever beat dead prez and no one will they are real they are good and they are classic. LEONELAYHEEHOO they do attack god but isnt that their right to not belive what you belive? And if they were arrogent would they give up money to help out the community? But anyway this albums kills everything breaks the rules of hip hop and is the greatest album ever put out. Dont buy turn off your radio it doesnt even compare to this. But thats next to imposssible.
