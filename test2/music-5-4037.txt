I have always loved this album. As a teen, I must admit to quite a crush on the Boss, too! But my sister just gave me the tape (since my record player is broken) and I was just floored to hear I'm Goin Down, Downbound Train, and Working on the Highway again! Every song is jam-packed with meaning and soul, and it's my all time hands-down favorite album ever! From the bittersweet Bobby Jean, to the rockin' Glory Days, this is a prime example of terrific music by a hot man!
