This team needs some serious help. Pierce is a great player, but he's not going to last long without some help. They have no consistency and no inside presence. I hope Danny Ainge can figure out a way to move Walker out of there and bring in some rebounders. As long as Vin Baker's contract is Boston's problem, making the playoffs will be their highest aspiration.
