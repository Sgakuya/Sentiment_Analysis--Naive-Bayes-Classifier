Does this ring any bells??? George W. Bush and BNL-Iraqgate. How about Jeb Bush and Broward Savings? or Neil Bush and Silverado Savings? Looks to me that GWB and his Republican friends would like to see this little matter of thousands of American votes as being left uncounted while he has an oh-so-narrow lead and swept under the rug as nicely as the alleged Bush family S L misdeeds were... I shudder at the thought of GWB possibly becoming our next president. Gore has every right to take the vote recount to court considering the narrow margin and the THOUSANDS of uncounted votes. Regardless of the outcome, as a voting American citizen I'd like to know that all votes were counted and our next president was elected based on all votes. I hope too that the election boards will do away with the crummy punch ballots after all of this!!
