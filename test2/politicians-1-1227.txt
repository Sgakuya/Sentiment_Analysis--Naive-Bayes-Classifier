Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians and the Arans and the UN believe in a Land for Peace solution in thye Middle East. I also do. Everyone should give from what they have extra and receive what they are lacking. The Arabs have a lot of Land but very little desire for Peace. Israel has a lot of a desire for Peace but very little land. Therefore the Arabs should give Israel land and Israel will give the Arabs Peace. This is the only Land for Peace scheme that will work.
