The team has gotten progressively worse each year he has been its head coach. The players lack fundamental skills and game situation knowledge. What I find amazing is the Davis defenders all point to his skills as a recruiter, while at the same time saying the team couldn't break 500 last year because of a lack of talent. You can't have it both ways... If there is a lack of talent, then Davis isn't recruiting effectively. He's already proven he's not much of a bench coach or strategist.
