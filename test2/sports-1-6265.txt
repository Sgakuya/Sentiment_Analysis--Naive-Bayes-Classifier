Sure dean martin was a great coach, nobody can deny that unc4me07, but coach K is much better. The job he has done with the team this year has been amzing, because, as anyone would tell you, the talent level of the 05 devils is not nearly as high as the duke powerhouses we have seen in the past. And Roy Williams is the worst coach ever. If Kryzewski got had the kind of players Williams has had to work with over the past 17 years he would have won at least seven or eigh titles already. PS. UNC is 2-14 vs. duke past five years. haha.
