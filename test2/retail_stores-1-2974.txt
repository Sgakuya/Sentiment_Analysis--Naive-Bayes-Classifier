Coming from a family of jewelers, I was laughed at when i showed them my Kay purchase. I was told they wouldnt sell it in their store for more than 10 dollars. I took it back to be repaired three times, the setting was crooked, and the opal cracked once, was replaced, and finally fell out before i tossed the ring in the trash can. You can get better rings from the toy machines
