The girl at my local Coldstone actually touched the ice cream a couple times. And moved the peanut butter cups around in my ice cream! Gross. My daughter who is allergic to nuts could not eat their ice cream because they mix all their food on a cold slab that is not safe. The line is WAY too long because it takes too long to get your ice cream made.
