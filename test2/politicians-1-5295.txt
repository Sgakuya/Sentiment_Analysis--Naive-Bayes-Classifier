I think the Gore and the entire democratic party should be ashamed of themselves. FIrst there was President Clinton and all his actions of immorality. And now this. The democratic party certainly is proving that what the people want does not matter. It is only about winning or loosing to them. They are teaching our future leaders this lesson and how to be poor sportsman. When all the scandals about President Clinton surfaced he taught our future leaders that honesty does not matter to this country. That promisses to the Lord about marriage and commitments to the country and marriage do not matter all that matters is what he wants at that time. This is now the lesson the democratic party is teaching also. They should be ashamed of themselves. Gonenor Bush is conducting himself in a gentlemanly manner throughout this entire ordeal and his party is doing the same. Unlike the democrtatic party, they are acting like spoiled children when they loose a game. There is proof that during the past two elections there have been votes discounted due to double voting and they were not protested. Why? because the democrates won the elections. Now that they loose they are acting like spoiled children playing a board game. Give it up already. If the people did not take the time to read the ballot before casting a vote that is just to bad. They also had the opportunity to check out the example ballot sent out prior to the election. And at the polls it was posted that if they made a mistake they could give the ballot to the poll representative and get a new one. Grow up you had three chances to get it right and didn't.
