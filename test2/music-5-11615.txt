Dude ranch is still the best blink 182 album. But really this is a fun little album to listen to. Blink is a boy band, but this is how all boy bands should be. There funny, they talk about real life, not about fake love stories like something on the disney channel. Blink isn't my favorite band in the world, but they make good music. There not as much punk rock as they used to be, but there not out to take over the world with this CD, there just making great music. I say more boy bands like Blink182, Cause if we have to have boy bands they might as well not act like big time rock stars like Backstreet. Blink is a down to earth band and there is a song everybody can relate to on this CD. This is what 16 year olds should be listening too, not NSYNC and Backstreet.
