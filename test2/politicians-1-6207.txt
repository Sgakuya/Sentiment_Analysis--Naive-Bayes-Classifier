Probably one of the most incompetent politicians in U.S. history. Made her name in Dade County prosecuting child molesters she knew to be innocent. Extended her moral and ethical pre-eminence by ordering the slaughter of women and children at Waco while refusing to investigate the blatant violations of the 1996 Clinton-Gore Campaign. All in all, a very tragic figure and a tragedy for this country. How much more do we have to endure in the name of feminism? In other words, compentent women are ok but don't force liars and murderers upon us because they pass a gender test. And, speaking of a gender test? Fuhgeddabutit.
