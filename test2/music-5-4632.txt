I have seen Bruce 8 times. He has never failed to put on less than a stellar performance. I have seen many great bands, including The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Led Zepplin, but no other performer puts it on like Springsteen. I recently saw the Reunion Tour, and they are still the best in the business, bar none. Great job Bruce and The Band. You touched us and moved us. Thanks.
