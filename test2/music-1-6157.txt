It's not rap or hip hop because it lacks consciousness. It's not heavy metal because each and every member seems devoid of musical talent. The alledged mixture of hip hop and Black Sabbath is really a mixture of Britney Spears-esque lyrical quality and Ruff Ryders-esque endless, cheesy madismo which could only be dubbed Mall Metal. So I guess it's okay if you play high school football, fear you might be gay, or have your mom drive you to concerts.
