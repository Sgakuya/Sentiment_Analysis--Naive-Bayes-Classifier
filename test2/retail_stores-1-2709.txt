Their customer service is non-existent. When I finally got ahold of someone (by phone to corporate) to complain about my problem, they were very condescending. I mean considering Kroger, HEB, and of course, Walmart are all cheaper than them, you'd think they'd rise a notch above in their Customer Service department. But, no. The days of the Onstead (previous owners) Randall's are LOOOOOOONG gone; it's clearly a Safeway now. I'm done with 'em. There is absolutely no reason to go there now. C'est la vie.
