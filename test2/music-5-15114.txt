I love this album! All of these songs have their own unique flavor to them coming from the crystal method. My boyfriend recommended me to get this album and I'm so glad he did. Hearing the Crystal Method was one of the first times which I started listening to Electronica music and hitting the club scenes. I would recommend this to anyone and I love all the songs.
