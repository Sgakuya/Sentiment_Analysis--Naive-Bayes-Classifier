Why the hell does everybody frickin love this guy so much? Excuse me for daring to say something bad about darling Ricky, but his songs are so increadibly inane I can't listen to them. Did anyone besides me listen to any of the lyrics to 'She Bangs'? I don't suppose so. You know, I haven't even seen this video and I know it sucks. Loaded? With what, crap?
