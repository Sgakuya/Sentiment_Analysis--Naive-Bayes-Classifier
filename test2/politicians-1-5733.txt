A creepy woman. Thank god I moved from New York years ago so I don't have to say she's my senator (although I now live in New Jersey where you can buy electons). Even her friends say she is power hungry and doesn't stop until she has it. Does she really think that those people with even half a brain do not see through her. She cares nothing for the people of New York and only ran so she could be a cool, hip New Yorker instead of a hick from Arkansas. Not to mention that New York is a very politically powerful state. Its a shame that she won over someone who had real accomplishments on his record and loved the state enough to live there his entire life instead of moving there a year before the election. Those of you who voted for her deserve what you get.
