Great album. I've always been a sucker for those albums that tell a story, and White City tells a compelling one - the story of apartheid in South Africa from various perspectives. Besides the big hits "Give Blood" and "Face the Face" there are some good deep tracks on here like "Crashing by Design" and "Brilliant Blues."
