Yet another 432 year old fossil clogging up the political/governmental process and underserving a most mentally retarded state, a welfare outpost with endless natural resources but a decided lack of brain power. This guy was one of the most undistinguished members of the U.S. Senate, yet somehow managed to wield considerable influence given the small and inconsequential constituency he represents. And the end result of this was endless pork barreling that taxpayers in the lower 48 subsidized with little or no return on their footing the bill. What is especially appalling about this bag of caribou droppings is his absolute disrespect for and antipathy toward enviromental concerns, which is totally illogical when you consider what Alaska is, namely one of the last frontiers of unspoiled natural beauty. With this nozzle's attitude toward Green concerns, he would be better suited as the Mayor of some faded toxic waste-infested factory town in the industrial wasteland of New Jersey. And with leadership like this selected by the voters, Alaskans are fated to their typical status in life: lowlife moochers trying to pass themselves off as the last noble examples of the pioneer spirit. What a joke. More like a cadre of boorish, loutish slackers being economically wetnursed by the rest of us.
