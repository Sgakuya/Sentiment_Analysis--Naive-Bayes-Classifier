I have to agree that Blockbuster Sux. I used to rent a movie and maybe keep it a day over then turn it in and just pay the 3.00 fee when I rented again no big deal. Well I didn't rent for a while and got a collection notice for 3.56 I could'nt believe this. I always pay for my movies and don't mind paying late fees I just was busy and didn't have time to rent for a few wks. I thought that was cheesy. I have noticed that they got rid of thier old movies and only carry new ones now. That sux because I like some older comedys and stuff. I now go to a nice little mom and pop store that has all kinds of older and new movies and don't come after me with a vengence for a 3.56 late fee that I will pay when I rent again. Plus to the employees that were whining on this page about how horible it is to stand at a register in an AC building and put movies back on the shelf, I don't really have to much simpithy for you. Welcome to the real World of Working. I really don't know to many people who like thier jobs or thier bosses.
