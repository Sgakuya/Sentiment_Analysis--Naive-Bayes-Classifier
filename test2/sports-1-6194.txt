overrated... ugly as mess... he can't even compete with sean... UPDATE! i could tell you whats wrong with him, but just dont feel like wasting my time, #1 rebounder in the acc? SEAN MAY! #1 defensive rebounder? SEAN MAY #10 free throw percentages... sheldon aint even on that list! UPDATE::: How can u call Sean fat after all the weight he lost? how many doubledoubles has sheldon got this year? idk bout u but Sean got 8 consecutivly... and who also had 26 pts and 24 rebounds against sheldon? that's right... Sean did... 2nd Team All-America... sheldon didnt make either...
