If you can't afford the Tracks box set, then you REALLY can't afford to pass this cd up! It's one of Bruce's most fun cds that also includes softer music to relax to. I love everything about it! I'm in the process of buying a new car (okay, it's a green ford taurus!) but with this cd on, It becomes a 'pink cadillac'! I'm having a pretty hard time of it with my family, but I listen to Janey Don't You Lose Heart and I feel soothed. When I just want to let loose and dance (okay, while I'm folding the laundry!) I put on Where the Bands Are Lion's Den and Seaside Bar Song . I listen to Loose Ends Sad Eyes and Hearts of Stone when I need to think, but need a touch of distraction, too. And when I want to remember just how incredible Bruce is, that he'll never let his fans down, since his work is our 'gospel', My Love Will Not Let You Down becomes an anthem! If you are a Springsteen fan, you must complete your collection with this, and if not, then have a listen, you might find your new favorite rock star!
