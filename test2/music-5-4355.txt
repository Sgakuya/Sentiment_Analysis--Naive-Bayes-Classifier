I love this CD! It is in constant rotation in my car (even though I had to record it on a tape to listen to it) and each of the songs are powerful and moving. Into The Fire tells the story of what it must have been like for firefighters on 9/11. You're Missing is a haunting song about a missing loved one. The Rising is a very spiritual song and Lonesome Day is phenomenal. Bruce has really outdone himself this time.
