Terrible...Terrible...Service. I stop there because it's on my way to work...I have had my order given to me wrong at least 1/2 the time. I drove thru today and heard the cashier cussing. They are always gossiping- Maybe that is why the mess up simple orders so often. I ordered a bean/ cheese taco...there was a smear of beans that just covered the center of the tortilla..WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES...
