2-1/2 hours of the best of Steely Dan--that's what you get with Showbiz Kids. I guess I hadn't realized how prolific SD was 1972-1980. Steely Dan did that? I found myself asking rhetorically the first time I listened. I think it's not so much my familiar favorites (Kid Charlemagne, Don't Take Me Alive, Peg, FM, et al.) that make this one of my most often listened to albums as of late, but the great music that doesn't get a lot of play on the classic rock airwaves (e.g., Pretzel or Bodhisattva). I should have realized years ago, when I first heard Rikki Don't Lose That Number, that I would enjoy other offerings from these great musicians.
