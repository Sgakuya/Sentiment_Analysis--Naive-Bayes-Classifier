I'm one of those people who would prefer a good, old fashioned love story to a gory battle epic. I thought the movie was sweet, and of course, the soundtrack pretty much makes up the movie, so I loved it too! Sparkling Diamonds Lady Marmalade and Your Song are my favorites. I've never heard Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor's voices, but darn can they sing!! I'm dying to get the soundtrack!!!(PS: Queen lovers, there's a reworking of The Show Must Go On . I don't know how you'll like it, but I thought it was sweet).
