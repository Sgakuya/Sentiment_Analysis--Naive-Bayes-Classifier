I went to the Menards store in Defiance, Ohio to make a payment on my Menards card and was told that the store can-not accept a payment on the card, that I had to mail it in or make a payment directly from a bank account.I went on line and found that In order for my payment to be accepted on that day I would be charged a extra $15.00. It is my suggestion that this is a realy bad way to run a company and that from now on we should all shop at Lowe's. That is what I am going to do.
