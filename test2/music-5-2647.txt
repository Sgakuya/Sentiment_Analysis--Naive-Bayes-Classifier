A masterpiece. I am not a very big Beatles Fan, but I still respect this album as one of the greatest. Mixed in among the heavy hitters (Come Together, Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Here Comes the Sun) are some real beauties such as Something, Oh! Darling and You Never Give Me Your Money. Definitely one of those albums that everyone should have.
