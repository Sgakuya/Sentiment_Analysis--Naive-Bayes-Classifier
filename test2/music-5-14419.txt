I really enjoyed this soundtrack. I found it unique, enjoyable and quite daring. To try and rework pop/rock classics and have your actors sing them is a risky thing to do. in my opinion it definitely paid off. Nicole Kidman showed a beautiful soprano, proving she's quite multi-talented and Ewan McGregor just blew me away. His vocal work was especially impressive. The songs are fresh, fun pieces with Elephant Love Medley, Your Song, and Hindi Sad Diamonds shining. I have always appreciated the music Baz Luhrman lends to his films and this is no different. A soundtrack gem!
