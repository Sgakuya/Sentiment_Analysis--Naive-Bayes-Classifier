The Libyan terrorist (murderer) who blew up the Pan Am flight in Lockerbee has one person who comforts him, advises him and defends him. That person is Nelson Mandela. That says it all. He supports terrorism as a political tool, he supports terrorists who kill Americans and Brits and quite simply hates whites or non blacks more than anything. It's funny to see the race card being played in the international political arena. If Marion Barry ever became the leader of a country he'd be Mandela.
