For a compilation release, Simon & Garfunkel's Greatest Hits is one of the classics that will please most any music fan. The track list covers all the hits from the duo's heyday from 1964 to 1972 (ie Mrs. Robinson, For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her, The Boxer, The 59th Street Bridge Song, The Sound Of Silence, I Am A Rock, Scarborough Fair/Canticle, Homeward Bound, Bridge Over Troubled Water, America, Kathy's Song, El Condor Pasa, Bookends Theme, and Cecilia). Unfortunately, however, some of the tracks are live versions. Moreover, as Greatest Hits was released in 1972, there are now better options for most casual fans, for instance Best Of Simon & Garfunkel (1999) which drops Kathy's Song but adds seven additional tracks (including A Hazy Shade Of Winter). Nevertheless, in my opinion, no greatest hits package should be on this list as these releases do not represent the concept of a full-length effort.
