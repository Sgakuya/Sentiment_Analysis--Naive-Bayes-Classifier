My experience on Friday afternoon was the worst that I have had with Olive Garden. We invited a friend out who has never gone and erevery disappointed in the service. In the end....we ended up with a new waitress named KAREN, and she made an unpleasant situation a 5-STAR experience. Many thanks to Karen at the Jensen Beach Restaurant. Thanks again Karen, but it wil be a while before I eturn back.
