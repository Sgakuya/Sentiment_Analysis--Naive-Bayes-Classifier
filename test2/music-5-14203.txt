This cd contains wonderful, rootsy music. It's great to see it become so popular because the music is pure, down-to-earth, richly textured and superbly performed. It is also unlike almost any other popular cd of the moment. Old songs like I'll Fly Away and You Are My Sunshine stand alongside newer compositions that have that same heart and soul. Especially good work by Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch. The bluegrass flavor is delicious.
