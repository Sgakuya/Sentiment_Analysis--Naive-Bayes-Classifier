A tremendous album,not only Bruce Springsteen's best but one of my all-time top 5;passionate,profound and poetic.This is music from the heart,enhanced by the magnificent E Street Band,with superb instrumentation,wonderful lyrics and-quite a rarity- not a weak track to mar the rest.Jungleland is majestic, monumental,Meeting across the River plaintively,exquisitely beautiful,Born to Run an inspirational classic,Backstreets and Thunder Road driving,uplifting..Whether you're a fan or not,this is one i'd unreservedly recommend.
