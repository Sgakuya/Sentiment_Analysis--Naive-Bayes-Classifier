A true genius. When everybody else was rapping in four four and sampling crap, he broke the rules with his syncopation and use of wonderful samples from seventies R&B. I like to think the average person can't explain why they like Snoop but they do. In my mind he is as important and influential to rap as the Beatles were to rock and Mozart was to classical.
