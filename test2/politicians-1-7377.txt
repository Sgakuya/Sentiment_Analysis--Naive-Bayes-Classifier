I'm not so sure that he's really dead, this ghoul might be walking around with a hockey mask- or perhaps the Eastern religions are correct- he's just reborn as a new scumbag upon death. Possibly the all-time vilest guy in 20th century American politics. Before he was this insane, sinister, hypocritical incarnation of evil, my best guess is that he was Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Confederate general who was one of the originators of The KKK.
