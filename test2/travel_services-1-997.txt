DO NOT Go Near THESE THIEVES!!!! We asked them for a quote from the Montreal Office and supplied a credit card number that they said was required to write up contract. The contract and verbal quote did not even closely resemble each other. We told them to forget it and they charged $1,000. to our credit card company the next day. This was last August and the credit card company says that they are unethical and refuse to return funds. We are going to have to sue. There are lots of reputable movers out there, these are not them!!!!!!!!!
