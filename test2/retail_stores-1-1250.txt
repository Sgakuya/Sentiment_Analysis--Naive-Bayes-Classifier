Poorly thought-out design (dinky electronics sections and haphazard parking lots); staggering array of plastic garbage made by enslaved seven-year-old Laotians; zombie-like stock clerks and butt-ugly cashiers; unwashed hulks shoving rickety, rusted carts in between garish, overpriced tank tops and sweater vests; off-brand groceries that can be had at better stores at better prices; entertainment censored ahead of time (for YOUR convenience); and a spooky geezer half-heartedly trying to get me to come back soon. HOW does this joke of retailing stay in business!?!?!
