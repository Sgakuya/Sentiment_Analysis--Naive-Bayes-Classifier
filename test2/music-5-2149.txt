For those of you who loved the movie Magnolia and throughly enjoyed the soundtrack (mostly done by Mann) then this album will not fail those who love to hear this amazing woman. Mann shows much promise as a songwriter with many of the albums sounds featured in the movie soundtrack. I thought the album was great for those long nights. Highly recommended.
