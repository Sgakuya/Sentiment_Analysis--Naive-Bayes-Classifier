This is my absolute favorite album of all time. The lyrics, though cryptic, are meaningful, poetic, and beautiful. The music is powerful, deep, jubilent, and sad at different points, and the almost seamless transition from song to song makes this almost a concert piece, yet one that can be broken down into individiual songs and still retain that sense of meaning. As a whole, this album translates to me, a representation of life. I'm not sure if that was the intended meaning, but to me, it'll always be a part of my soul.
