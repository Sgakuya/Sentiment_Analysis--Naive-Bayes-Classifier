I don't eat much seafood but if I did it wouldn't be fast food. Along the coast there are so many fine seafood restaurants that eating here makes little sense. Seafood of much higher quality for almost no increase in cost is easy to find. In places without an abundant selection of seafood restaurants this might be okay.
