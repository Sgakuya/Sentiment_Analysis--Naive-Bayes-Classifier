Don't use them! Gave me a four hour window between 8:00am-12:00. I kept calling and they never returned my calls. During the last call I was told they had my paperwork but I was never placed on the board. Therefore, no movers had been assigned to me. They showed up at 3:00pm and I sent them packing. Used another mover (and they were great)... I've tried to contact Starving Students Movers (company)in CA via email but to no avail. They don't give a dam/no response. Not a company to do business with! When I 1st called their 1800 number, the sales rep. was great-he sold me on the company! It's sad that the workers couldn't follow his lead...
