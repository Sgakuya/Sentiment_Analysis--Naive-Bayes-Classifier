I am not so sure how to give an unbiased review of this record. When you have liked a band for more than 5 years, they automatically get moved up at least one notch on the ratings scale. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (international call letters for YHF - you all know what that means, right?) is a creepy record. Pop Creep. Creepy pop that slithers its way through your headphones into your soul and cannot find a way out. Oddly misplaced and unintentional rings of family and patriotism give it a happy and proud appearance, but beneath that cover lies confusion and lack of faith the world that surrounds the individual. The songs are all catchy and they deal out some terrific melodies. Wilco has managed to transform from alt-country to a new sense of songwriting that will leave a nice imprint on our hearts when we think about the music of this time.
