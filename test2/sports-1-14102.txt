He played for a excellent team yet he never threw for 4000 yards in a season. He only passed for more than 30 TDs once which was 31. Plus he had Jerry Rice. Dan Marino is ten times better even though his team wasn't that good. Best QB ever- Dan Marino. Why did Steve Young get 4000 passing yards with the same offense. No matter what Montana fans say, Montana ranks 25th in the best QBs of all time and Dan Marino is the best QB ever.
