Underworld certainly have the potential to make roof-raising tracks that can create the feeling of a tribally gyrating, spotlight soaked rave right in the comfort of your own living room! Dark and Long and Cowgirl for example. Other highlights include the excellent Dirty Epic, garbling out lyrics against the pounding drum beat that evoke the singer's desolate view of inner city existence. Standing in stark contrast to the rave tracks are such peaceful and subtle modern day lullabies as the Tongue and River of Bass. An electronica classic from when Underworld were at their prime.
