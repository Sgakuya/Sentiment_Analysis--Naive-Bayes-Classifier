If there was a zero for star rating, I think I would chose it..unfortunately I have to put one star here. Nothing makes me more sickening than to see Belicheck on the top 5 ..much less top 15 of the coaches listed in the NFL. He may have luck..but he represents boston, where all those potato eating irish are..Red Sox are dead..and the Patriots will not be fed..Jets RULE!!
