I didn't realise it was a crime for one of the greatest bands of the 20th century to have a compilation album released so that the new generation could listen to it. So, are the people here saying that people such as Jimi Hendrix shouldn't have his material re-released? I doubt that it was the remaining band members of The Beatles who pushed for this to be done. The Beatles were fantastic and this album has been a sell-out over here (UK). And yes, they are far more orginal than most of the bands present today. They wrote all their material and could play instruments. The Beatles can't release anymore albums (and haven't done for years) as John Lennon was killed back in the 80's, so before you people slander them, please get your facts correct.
