Bob Stoops is the greatest... er.. wait.. is this that coach from OU who lost back-to-back chances at a National Title with the best players in the nation. Congrats on the Big 12 Title last year, that's about all you have to be proud of. But as far as your coaching style is concerned. It all goes down the drain come post-season play.
