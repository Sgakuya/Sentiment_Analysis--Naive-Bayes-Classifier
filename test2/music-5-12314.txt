how could anyone give this a rating of less then 5? firstly you cannot compare the two albums because they are so different and show how he has matured and experimented with the music. however, voodoo is no worse or better than brown sugar - they are both fantastic. the man is an extremely talented musician and songwriter as well as performer and no recording does him justice. it was an amazing experience to see him live and no other live performance thet i've seen can compare to it. voodoo is raw and funky, but smooth and soulful at the same time. i think that only shallow people who cannot possibly appreciate real music or talent would dislike this.
