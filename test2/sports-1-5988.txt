Ok, all you people who think J.J. is good needs to get a frickin life. All he can do is shoot the 3, everytime I see him play he loses the ball on the dribble, when he takes it to the hoop he gets it shoved right back down his throat. All you people who think he isn't rich needs to get a life. I'm from Roanoke, I know where he lives and it is a nice house, all he wears is the most exspensive preppy clothes possible and he goes to the most exspensive gym in all of the Roanoke Valley. Not to mention he is rude to possibly anybody that comes up and asks him for his autograph. So why don't all you dumbass Duke fans go get a life. You definitely know that when UNC comes to town Duke is going to get rolled over. Why don't y'all put that in your pipe and smoke it or better of yet why don't you go and join J.J. and do some good pot. Go Tarheels!!!! I also have a question for all you lovers of J.J., why does he were that gay shirt underneath his jersey? It looks like a onesy that his mommy would have to snap for him before all his games!!!
