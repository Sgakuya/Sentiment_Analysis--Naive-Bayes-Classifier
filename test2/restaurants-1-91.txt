the worst joint. on every street corner, like bums and business people. of course i dont drink coffe. why skizero, dont you drink coffee, you may be saying. well...i'll tell you. coffee is the drink of joe and joanne worker, it keeps them perky and doing their jobs like lab rats, or mice running around in the work meat grinder all day. also so-called artists think their creative juices are brought along by ole Java--gotta have my fix!! nah, you'll be seeing old Skizero drinking earl grey tea with a splash of whiskey in it.
