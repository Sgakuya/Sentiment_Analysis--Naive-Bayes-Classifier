I respected him until he threw a fit over a scene in Barbershop and even said Black people shouldn't say things like that!They need to respect Jesse Jackson! What a racist double standard. People don't have to bow down to any politician if they don't want to. All I see Al and Jesse doing is exploiting black people for profit and thinking it's fun.
