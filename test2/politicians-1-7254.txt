Dear Reverend Jesse Jackson: I have something to say in response to your not-so-veiled threat to provoke riots if the U.S. Supreme Court doesn't rule to your liking in the matter of the presidential vote count: Grow up, do something constructive with your time, get a life. This game you play -- shaking down the American corporate and political establishment by invoking fear -- is getting old. Your credibility -- if you ever had any -- is threadbare at best. There is a growing consensus in America that you are little more than a joke -- and this kind of political extortion will not work any longer. Even if this court rules against counting our vote, it will simply create a civil rights explosion, you said after leaving today's Supreme Court hearing. People will not surrender to this tyranny. This people will not stand by and accept this with surrender. We can afford to lose an election -- you win some, you lose some. You can't afford to lose your franchise. People will be fighting for their right to vote and for their vote to count. The same forces that were against the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ... seek to disenfranchise us in 2000 and do not want to renew the Voting Rights Act in the year 2007. We know what you are saying. We understand the code words. We all know what you mean by civil rights explosion. And it doesn't scare many of us. The real civil rights explosion would occur in this country if the Supreme Court bowed to your brand of coercion and intimidation. I hear from people everyday sickened by the way their votes are being stolen by courts, by voter fraud and by attempts to change the rules in the middle of the political game. I know you are desperate. It shows in the words you choose, in the hyperbole you invoke, in the intensity of the rhetoric you employ. You're right about something else: People will not surrender to this tyranny -- the tyranny you would like to impose on the freedom-loving, law-abiding, rules-respecting people of the United States. In closing, let me remind you of one more fact you seem to have forgotten. In suggesting those opposing your shameless, partisan pandering on behalf of Vice President Al Gore are the same folks who opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, please recall that Sen. Al Gore Sr., your favorite candidate's father, was among the many congressional Democrats who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Joseph Farah
