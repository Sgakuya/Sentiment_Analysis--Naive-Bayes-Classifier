Al Gore deserves about a minus 5. He cannot be trusted. He will take America where it does not want to go. His figures do not add up in health care, education, etc. He's right about one thing, you aint seen nothing yet! and you have not in 8 years and will not if elected. Al Gore has lost the election and is trying to munipulate the system and stuff the ballot boxes in order to win. What a man without honor. He does not care for this country, he sold it out to China. This man is a disgrace. He is destroying our country. Al Gore needs to admit his loss and move on. Will out country survive if this Florida madness continues? God help us.
