We've had a long cavalcade of truly lame Attorney Generals in this country over the past two decades, but Ashcroft is by far the weakest, least qualified and most dangerous. Firstly, any crazed, speaking-in-tongues Pentacostal should be disqualified from holding public office because the disturbed combination of church and state agenda of such people is decidedly Un-American. Secondly, the former Senator is so dreadful that the voters of Missouri turned him out as a One Term Wonder: in this, he couldn't win an election against a dead man. What was the reward for this relentless mediocrity? Being named by a brain-dead President to the highest law enforcement job in the country, despite the fact that Ashcroft never prosecuted a case in his entire sorry life. This guy has the most cursory understanding of the Constitution (i.e., his warped reading of the Second Amendment)and an evident antipathy towards the civil rights of the public-at-large (see his championing of that fascistic Patriot Act). I thought it was a panic when the ultra-prudish Attorney General spent the taxpayers' money on drapery to cover classically-inspired nude statues at the Justice Department: (1) Doesn't this constitute censorship and deny basic free-speech rights? (2) If those statures didn't bother anybody for decades, why are they considered smutty all of a sudden? (3) Isn't this another example of the GOP wasting our money for purely ideological purposes? (4) Doesn't Ashcroft's imposition of so-called morality play it fast and loose with the separation of church and state? (4) What gives this douchebag the right to impose his prudishness on others? (5) Why does this guy consider classical forms of art that have graced public places for centuries inappropriate in 2003? (6) Why does this dolt consider the nude human form sinful if the nude human form is something that God supposedly created in his own likeness? It all comes to this: Ashcroft is a prime example of GWB's bill of goods that he sold to the American public that was swallowed lock stock and barrel, i.e., that the imbecilic former Texas Governor would be surrounded by the best, brightest and most capable advisors imaginable. Well, the actuality is galaxies away from the advertising, and in this, Ashcroft's boss proved himself to be a bigger liar than Bubba Clinton, which is really quite an achievement.
