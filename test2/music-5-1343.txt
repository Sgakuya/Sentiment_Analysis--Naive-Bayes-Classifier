 The band has a murky edge on this album with a tinge of attitude that was not previously displayed. Second Guessing is a very bitter song about the media. "Why You try to second guess me?" "Who will be your book this season?" A very well written in your face song. Other songs are more cryptic and deal with medieval religious symbolism. Absolutely fascinating.
