Hey Snyder, It's time to unblacklist all the users who posted negative things about Walt Harris. You shouldn't keep them all banned just because they were all correct WAY before you, Steve, Joe Huber, and Dream (what a gay name). Everyone you blacklisted is just smarter than you girls. All of those people actually add value to your website. But, you want to keep them blacklisted just so you can live in your fake world of false (or just retarded) optimism. Do what you want, but you will never get your press credentials. Your life is a failure.
