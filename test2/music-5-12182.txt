OOOOOH!OOOOOh!OOOOOh! Carl Thomas is just emotional. He is not afraid to express his deepest feelings. He is masculine yet he can express his emotions in a manly way. I can't wait until he comes to the bay area for a concert. Every track on his CD is just beautiful! It is rare that an artist as talented as Carl can have wonderful album, not degrading women, but uplifting them. Especially, (Special Lady, and Your a Star), just beautiful.
