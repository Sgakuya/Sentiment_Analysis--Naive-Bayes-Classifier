Mad Season was the first matchbox cd I've ever listened to. I played it all the way through the first time. I can listen to every song on this CD over and over again and I do. It's one of very few CD's I've ever listened to and liked every single song on it the first time around. The lyrics are powerful and the music is excellent; Together they're awsome.
