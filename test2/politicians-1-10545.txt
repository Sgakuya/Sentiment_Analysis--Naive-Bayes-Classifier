George W. seems to think he can play cowboy on the world stage, pushing other countries around at his whim and launching preemptive strikes on countries that have shown no immediate threat to the USA. His foreign policy bites rocks, he's pushing the country into a war we're not likely to win without major casualties. I don't like him, I don't trust him, and I don't support him.
