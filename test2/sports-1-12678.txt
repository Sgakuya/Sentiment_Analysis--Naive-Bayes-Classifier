I hate one dimensional systems ... I hate schools and coaches and administrators who dont care about the character of the players they bring in...they seem to win national titles with players who spent half their lives in correctional facilities...CU has been dominating the big 12 in this century...NU is for the 20th century....CU is Gonna dominate this century
