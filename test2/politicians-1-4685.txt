I am not totally sure, but I have read various articles and looked at evidences, with important references and demonstrations... Dick Cheney, like other politicians, among them the Bush, and not only them, is badly implied in dirty traffics. He is, certain, like somebody else wrote here, a 'good businessman' and a fair speaker, but is he honest? Does he tell the truth or lies, when he speaks? The words and the facts have to be coincident, the only words (the facts are more important, if one saw them directly, less if one hear from the propagandas and the newspapers) do not count! Cheney is the vice president of the USA, but he manage some big companies, like the Halliburton Inc. and of the Brown Root. Only Oil interests for these companies? They have a very bad fame, in the sense they appear involved in dirty money games and drugs games too... Not only! The Brown Root is involved in many dirty actions worldwide, in particular, when one speaks of wars... Is it possible that, in the next future, there are some interesting bad enemy of the 'US interests' (some new Hitler?) in South America, maybe in Columbia and that this requests a military intervention. Why? Because we saw some similar events occurring in the past, particularly where the Brown Root established some big bases before (Bosnia, Kossovo, Cecenija, Ruanda, Birmany, Pakistan, Laos, Indonesia, Iran, Libya, Mexico and Colombia). I cannot give all the data here, but I can tell you you have to visit some interesting sites to grab some more data on Cheny, the Bush, and other particular names, organizations and situations... Symptoms of heavy corruption have to be examined and really investigated from the sane US powers, because they are building a really negative fame for this otherwise great country.
