I can't imagine a more enjoyable or exhilarating evening of entertainment than Clay Aiken's concert. I have been to one of his solo concerts and will be going to at least three more. Clay is absolutely the best performer I have ever seen. He truly enjoys performing for, and is appreciative of every person in the audience and that really comes across. The concert is a must see for everyone who loves good music, and lots of clean family fun. MaryAda
