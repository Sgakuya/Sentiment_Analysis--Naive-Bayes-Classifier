This is going to be a classic album in a few years, and will be in my collection when I'm old and gray. This album was big in that it was Dre's big comeback, and he had a lot of good MCs on this album, which made this CD a favorite. There was really only one song I didn't like, track #12 which has Kurupt on it. Personally, I don't like Kurupt.
