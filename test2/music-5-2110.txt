All you DAVEHEADS out there are going to be impressed as our hero finds happiness and a purpose to his life. This is not your typical jam album but look out for the concerts this summer to see some new improvision on these great tunes. The biggest upside which for some may be a down side is that we are going to hear more Dave Matthews on the radio than ever before and listening to this album I can see several releases that will be chart toppers well into the next year. So be prepared Billboard magazine this ones going to be around for a while. GREAT JOB DAVE
