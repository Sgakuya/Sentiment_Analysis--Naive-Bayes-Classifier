This album is really really good! It's very 'springsteen' in composition, but at the same time it's different from his other cds. I find myself listening to Loose Ends and hearts of stone whenever I feel sad about my parents divorce, and when I just want to let loose and have fun, Pink Cadillac, My love will not let you down, lion's den, etc. are lots of fun! I reccommend it!
