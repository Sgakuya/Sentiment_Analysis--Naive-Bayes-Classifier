Here's a quote from someone who ranks him a 5: That's what makes a great president, one who steps on a few toes to get things done. This quote sums up the Bushies. It's not that toes are stepped on that delight his ilk, it's the kind of people who have their toes stepped on. People unlike him. People who are capable of thinking for themselves. They've been idiots all their lives and this is their eight years of fame. This to shall pass. Sheep.
