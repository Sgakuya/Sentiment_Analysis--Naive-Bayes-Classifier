Thanks, Wince! You just helped us realize how much better off we are without you. The now Air Jersey (which sounds horrible, btw..Air Canada was way better) may be big in NJ now, but watch out - this guy is absolutely the worst player when it comes to patience and loyalty. I WAS a big fan of VC, but when you leave your team just b/c they aren't doing so well and claim to love the game, you're not worthy to be an NBA player at all.
