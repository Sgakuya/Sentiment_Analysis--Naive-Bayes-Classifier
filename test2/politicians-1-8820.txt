Awful. Lucky in that he came in during an upswing in the business cycle that had started to go down before he left office. Unprincipled, leaned wherever the politic wind took him. Remember his the era of big government is over speech after the Republicans knocked his party out of power in the House and Senate in 1994? Did NOTHING about numerous terrorists attacks on US targets, holds considerably responsiblity for happened on 9/11/2001.
