Released in 1973, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road could be considered Elton John's best full-length effort (and is his best in my opinion). (Though with four original vinyl sides with which to work, Elton and Taupin had plenty of opportunity to get a lot right.) The release starts with the slowing climaxing Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding and continues to include some of Elton's most well known work including the (often recycled) Candle In The Wind, Bennie And The Jets, Saturday's Alright For Fighting, and the title track. Of course the fun does not stop there as this release also includes some of his better, though lesser known songs, most notably Grey Seal, All The Girls Love Alice, and Harmony, (The first two of these lesser known tracks being my personal favorites.)
