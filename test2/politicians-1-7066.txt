How come newspapers, tv, cable, and other media sources have not properly covered the current Jesse Jackson issue. NOT just the issue of adultery but also that of misusing tax free funds that were to go for good purposes, but were used to pay his mistress. As a African-American I feel that the black community is sticking it's head in the sand and refusing to recognize such a big problem. I hope the issue of morality and honestly is greater than covering for our black leaders' crimes. I think Mr. Jackson is a very negative leader and uses negative comments to add fire to any issues he gets involved in. Also, how come he is always in a caddi limo, with $5000 suits, along with his many bodyguards, who also are flashing rolexs and thousand dollar shoes. SO SAD JESSE JACKSON.
