He's got that swagger like State is some kind of force,and that is terribly annoying. He's like one of these rejects with hair gel and a tight shirt that thinks chicks dig that. He's a castle peasent yelling, off with his head! He's a Tampa Bay Devil Ray that thinks they should take mercy on the Yankees. His attitude doesn't match how things play out. When he got in McCants' face, it reminded me of when Gerald Wilkins thought he was intimidating Jordan. He's silly actually. Oooooooh, I'm 4 for 13 with 4 fouls...................ooooooh, am I scary or what? Or what Julius, now shut up and make McCants a sandwich.
