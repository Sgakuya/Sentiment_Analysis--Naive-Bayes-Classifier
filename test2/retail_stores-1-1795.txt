Just awful ! Crowded, overpriced for the quality, never anything new, never enough cashiers to help speed up service, hate it when they always check my bags at the door with my receipt to see if I am stealing, an overall stupid store where I will no longer shop as of last week.....I am now loyal to Target, thank you.
