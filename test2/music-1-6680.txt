Major disappointment. I think Metallica tried too hard to get an album out quickly after Jamz got out of rehab and tried way too hard to make it sound like the old. If they want to get back to the way they were they need to dump Bob Rock. Ever since B.Rock started producing Metallica they slowly went down hill (Bob started with the black album). Maybe it's age or just the way music is heading, but I was not happy with St. Anger. I really hope this was the last time this happens. I don't even want to put this album with the rest of my metallica cds. I don't know how you can go from Puppets and Justice to this. Now I pretty much look towards Fear Factory and Mudvayne to give the great metal that metal used to be. Fear Factory - Obsolete and Mudvayne - The End of All Things to Come, are great albums, pick them up if you don't have them and you will get sucked into it right away. As for St. Anger...get a copy from a poor friend who bought it and copy it. Worth having but not paying for. I and alot of other people can only hope the next one is better. 'meatloaf921@comcast.net
