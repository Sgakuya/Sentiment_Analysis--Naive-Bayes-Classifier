Whoa. Whoa. I mean...whoa. What a terrific album. Behind Blue Eyes is one of the best ballads ever written. And The Song is Over is one of the greatest SONGS of all time! Plus, Baba O'Riley (and no, people, the song is not called Teenage Wasteland , even thought that's what it should be called) has an amazing synthesizer or guitar or whatever plays all those really fast notes (see, it's so good I can't tell what instrument it is!). An album for everyone who likes music, REAL music, not bs.
