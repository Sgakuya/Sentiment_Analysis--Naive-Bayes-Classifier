Not only does Aliyah star in the movie Romeo Must Die, she also gives us her angelic voice on the soundtrack. She has been gone for a couple of years and has not lost a step. Timbaland, a hip hop producer and rapper, also produced this album as well. The album is well thought out and has gotten major props from magazines and critics. If you like hip hop and r b, this is the album. I highly recommend this.
