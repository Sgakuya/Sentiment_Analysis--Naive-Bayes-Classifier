I think BlackRevolutionary is actually a white person. Stop playin yourself, your white hood is showing. I don't know 5 African American that even know who A F is. 98% of African American do not shop at A F, much less know who the hell they are. I only found out about this company when I was doing an internet search on apparel companies. I've seen there tired, cookie-cutter, overworked and uncreative clothing line and it leaves alot to be desires. I feel confident in saying that African American teens would definitely NOT be interested in rocking these cheap-ass, boring, goodwill looking, yard sale rejects, 70's throwback rags. African American will spend huge amounts of money on quality urban Apparel Designers like Sean John, Fubu, Baby Phat and Juicy Culture or on international designers like D G or Sports apparel. African American have too MANY urban designers and Music stars catering to their every apparel need to even be remotely interested in anything A F's could throw together with some spit, cheap fabric, and a few cut-rate buttons. Oh, by the way. The reason why the grown women who do shop there can't fit in their clothing is because they are using less fabric in an effort to cheat the consumer and putting a size 6 tag on a size 2 cut. LOL
