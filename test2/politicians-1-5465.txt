John Kerry can claim he believes life begins at conception but support partial birth abortion. John Kerry can say he owns a lot of SUV's in Detroit and say theybelong to his family not him on Earth Day. John Kerry can even vote for war and then vote against money to fund it. But one thing John Kerry can not do, is expect to be elected president. And no matter how many lies he tries to convince America is true, his record is always going to be there.
