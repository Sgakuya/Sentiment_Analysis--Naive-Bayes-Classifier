Ahead of Jordan??? Is this an absolute JOKE??? 4 people ahead of the greatest basketball player of all time... ok, whatever. Anyway, Wilt Chamberlain and Shaq are the most overrated big pieces of garbage that ever stepped onto the basketball court. Both can't shoot free throws worth a damn. The only thing Chamberlain knew what to do was... stay in the paint. Couldn't shoot a jumper for his life!!! I am sorry, did I see that right??? Chamberlain is 1st on RIA right??? BS!!!
