Carl Thomas emerges on the R B scene with a bang. This guy really impresses me. You can tell that he actually trained in order to sing, not just got a lucky break like most of these other no talent singers of today. I think he has staying power simply because he has his OWN style and he actually knows what he is doing. His album proves that when you take your music seriously, you will get a quality product from the work you put into it. Many singers such as 112, Next, etc. sound just alike and really have no musical ability whatsoever. They just whine and moan, and this sounds just fine to the ladies, but they actually have no talent. Learn from Carl; do your own thing and you will get much more respect.
