A hugely greedy and mean woman who's happily sat back on to watch the dosh roll in. Up until she accessed the throne the British monarchy paid tax. However, in a deal with the then government, they came up with a scam to let her off the hook. She's also cunning and has a system in place that no one person knows her exact wealth, only what certain elements are worth like her collection of rare stamps, her properties, her valuable works of art etc. She just does enough to make it look like she's working - e.g. shaking hands with some poor saps in Africa - but has never had to break sweat. At one time she pretty much said she rules by divine right. Worse still are the sycophants the length and breadth of the country that keep her on the throne. Halfwitted forelock tuggers who still believe in the Empire. These people make me want to throw up.
