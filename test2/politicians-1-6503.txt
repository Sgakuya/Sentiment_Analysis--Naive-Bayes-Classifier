Whenever I hear the name Tom Daschle, the name Nancy Peloski comes to mind. If I didn't know any better, I would swear they are related. Neither have any class and aren't ashamed to show it! Whenever I hear either one of their voices (on the television) I have a strong urge to run to my gun cabinet and take out my set!
