They have everything for cheap prices. Monster corporation taking over. There is places like Safeway who actually take care of their employees with good benefits and pay. This is why Safeway is a little bit more expensive. Walmart employees get paid mimnun wage and don't get benefits plus get treated like crap. Thats why its so cheap.
