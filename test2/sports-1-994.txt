The sad thing is that BALCO Bonds probably would've finished his career with about 500-540 HR's and 500 SB's without steroids. However, he's one of the biggest cheaters in baseball history and has dishonestly climbed the stat charts for reasons of personal glory. I hope MLB steps up and does the right thing: erases his stats from the year 2000 on, or just wipes out his entire career. He admitted to using super-drugs. Illegal drug use is criminal. Also, how can someone be so cold as to sit there next to their godfather and pretend to have accomplished those feats legitimately. He dishonored his family, the city of San Francisco, the Giants organization, and the game of baseball. What about those players on the all-time HR list that he surpassed who accomplished their feats through hard work? They got cheated the most.
