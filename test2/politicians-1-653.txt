He was a Communist tyrant who played with and was bested by better men and Woman: Reagan, John Paul II and Margaret Thatcher. I am always amazed that people who have very poor or little understanding of the operation of the former Soviet Union contiue to have such misguided appreciation for this man to the detriment of the leaders of the west. He was a close prot g of Yuri Andropov (KGB General/Secretary General) who was deeply involved throughout his career which the oppression of his people (68 Million murdered.). He is now hated and loathed by his fellow countryman and is unable to live there. If he were a National Socialist instead of an International Socialist and was involved in the extermination of Jewish people instead of Ukrainians, Uzbeks and Russians, he would have ended up at the end of a rope. He believed the division of public opinion in Europe in favor of the USSR and the creation the KGB funded Green Party was enough for him to attract foreign investment in the collapsing economy of the USSR to maintain his power. He was wrong and so is anyone who believes him to be a decent honorable man. He is a wretched thug overpowered by his betters.
