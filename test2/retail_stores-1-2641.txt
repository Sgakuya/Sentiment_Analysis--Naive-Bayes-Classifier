Hello, Let me tell about this expereince i had at kroger on edmondson pk in nashville, Tn #537. I was shopping about 2 A.M. in the morning and they had an isle blocked off for some reason. So i tried to find somebody to ask for help but i couldnt find anybody. So i went around it and got my juice. Then some cleaning lady cussed me out. So i decided just to take my stuff and leave. Then their was only one guy running the cash register and the person in front of me had like $270 worth of groceries and he wanted it paperbagged and i had to wait for ever. The next day i called the store and asked for the store manager (chris Smith is his name) and told him what happened and all he said was the cleaning crew is hired outside kroger so their is nothing i can do. This is the worst store ever and it is overpriced.
