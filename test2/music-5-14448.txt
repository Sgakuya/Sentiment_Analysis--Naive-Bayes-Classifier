Hauntingly beautiful with songs that stick in your memory for days. The show is phenomenal and the soundtrack captures all the emotion of the show. My favorite spot is when Valjean is kneeling over the still body of his adopted daughters lover and singing to the heavens, Let him live... Wow! Heartbreaking. Highly recommended!
