I wanted a 14kt bracelet and bought the one she showed me when I looked at the slip it said 10kt.The women said thats better because it's stronger so I kept it.16 months later it broke I have only worn it a few times.It just needs to be sodered but they want 25.00 to do it.I can get it done elsewhere for 5.oo.I will never shop there again
