Janet Reno has abused her power, trampled the rule of law, and committed treason on a grand scale. Her unconstitutional use of storm troopers to further the agenda of her liberal masters should scare the American people out of their complacency. If they can do it to the Branch Davidians, and to Elian, you'd better believe they can do it to you. The Founding Fathers must have imagined someone very much like Janet Reno when they passed the Second Amendment. My advice: buy a gun to defend yourself and your family if you haven't already done so. It's your right, and your responsibility as an American citizen.
