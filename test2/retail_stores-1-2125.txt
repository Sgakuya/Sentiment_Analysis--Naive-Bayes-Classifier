RadioShack used to be a great store for the electronics enthusiast, but not anymore. They used to employ knowledgable associates, who could help you with your electronic problems. At my local RS, the manager looks to be about 18 years old, and the last couple of times that I was there, all that him and his associates wanted to do was pester me about cell phones, when all I came in for was a few parts (which they no longer have much of a selection of) The other posters are correct about them selling used and returnes stuff. It is regular practice for them. I was going to purchase a telephone recorder, but when the salesman brought it out of the back room to sell it to me, it was obvious that the box had been opened, and when I requested another one, they offered me a double warranty. I'm sorry, but I am not going to pay RadioShack's high retail price for an item, especially if it isn't new. Stay away! There are much better (and cheaper) places to buy your electonics that have better help and a better selection.
