What has happened to Air Canada service? On my flight from Los Angeles to Calgary (3 hr flight), they served me one drink and a ball of tinfoil. OK, so there was something side the tinfoil, but I'm not sure what. A hunk of stale tortilla dough with a few smears of tomato sauce is not any kind of food I'm accustomed to. Revolting! They get a 1 just because of that!
