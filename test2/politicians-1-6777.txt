I agree wholeheartedly with abichara1882. We can't automatically assume that he had anything to do with Miss Levy's murder, but he deliberately obstructed justice in a cowardly move to protect his own career. It's just too bad that scum like this are usually caught by some random turn of events, like the unforeseen disappearance of an intern, and not because there is any actual effort to root out corruption.
