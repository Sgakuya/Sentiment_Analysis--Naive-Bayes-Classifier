If the Dixie Chicks were from New York, and announced to foreigners that they were embarrassed to be New Yorkers and linked to the people who voted Hillary Clinton as Senator (dumb c**nts), then I would nominate the Dixie Chicks for sainthood. But they didn't. So they should rot, along with Hillary the Horrible. This woman reminds me of all the pot-smoking Democrats I went to college with, who wanted a career in politics because they were desperate for control, and good at being phonies. Too bad our country is full of people who are too simple to see through that.
