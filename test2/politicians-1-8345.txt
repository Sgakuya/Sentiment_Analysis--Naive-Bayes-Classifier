I wish we could give a big 0 to Reagan. He was probably the most evil man to be president. What a slap in the face to name an airport after him. The man was a traitor to his country, had no respect for the constitution what so ever. He should have been impeached but for some reason people just turned their heads when it came to his dirty works in South America as well in Iran and Iraq-all over the globe. All he had to do was cock his head, give a little smile and say there you go again or I don't recall what a bunch of bull.
