McNabb is an incredible athlete, I will never try to say otherwise, and a fantastic quarterback. However, he is also a spineless hypocrite with very little to offer in an intelligent conversation. Take the Rush Limbaugh incident as an example. He acts shocked that race was in issue (although it truly wasn't if you read the comments in context)....when HE (allegedly) used race while negotiation is HUGE contract. Such hypocrisy is disgusting and the use of the race card deplorable. His criticisms of Brett Favre's comments about Javon Walker also show that he is a moron. How can the guy who ran out of gas at the Super Bowl talk about professionalism??? Brett Favre IS the Green Bay Packers, that is his business and he has the right to say whatever he wants about the tactics used by his teammates (and not the teammates themselves) that affect the team. McNabb on the otherhand sits around with his thumb up his butt without the guts to say anything about T.O. because he doesn't want to be called a homosexual when T.O. decides to leave the Eagles. McNabb is a cowardly tool who runs out of gas in big games.
