I absolutely love DMX... I think he is about as real and genuine as one can get. He already has hundreds of songs made from before he became famous...so he should keep on rolling in with the music. And not everyone wants to be like tupac! Don't get me wrong, i like tupac too...but i must admit i like dmx better!
