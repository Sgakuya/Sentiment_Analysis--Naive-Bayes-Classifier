Great compliation. If you like Top 40 music then this CD is for you. If you only like one or two songs from artists like Destiny's Child, Britney or J-LO, then you should also check out the previous editions of the Now! series. In Canada, these CDs are quite expensive and hard to find but are nevertheless better deals than buying the individual CDs of the all the artists featured in the series especially if you like only one or two of their songs. My fave songs on this 8th edition are AM to PM from Christina Milian, Crush by Mandy Moore and I'm a Believer from Smash Mouth. I highly recommend this CD as pop fans are sure to find something they like here.
