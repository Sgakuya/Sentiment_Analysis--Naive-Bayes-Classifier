Korns first album was downright kick ass, his second album was good, Follow The Leader was mediocre, and Issues is just plain out terrible. If you're seeing a pattern, its obvious...Korn has hit rock bottom, and it's going to take every ounce of effort to get them back to the surface. I think a good way to start is to stop writing songs about Jonathans feelings and his hurt. Uh, WHO CARES!?!
