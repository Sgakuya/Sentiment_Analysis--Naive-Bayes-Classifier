How convenient that Bush, Rumsfeld and Co. decide to take the moral high ground by liberating the people of Iraq. The only liberating Rumsfeld was doing in the late 80's was liberating US dollars into Saddams bank account in support against the Iranian Ayatollhas. Where were the cries against Saddams brutality then? A liar, a cunning manipulator of morality and a right wing facist...the Bush Administration has made America a laughing stock to the rest of the world.
