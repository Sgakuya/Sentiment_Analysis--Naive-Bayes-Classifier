This is one of my alltime favorite CDS ever! It is so great and outstanding... The electric of the guitar playing in the late 60's I belive to very fascinating at the time. Each song was very special and very uniqute in it's own way. It really made me smile when I had listened to this CD! Well worth of my time that is for sure.
