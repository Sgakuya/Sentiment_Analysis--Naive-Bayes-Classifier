Go back to Texas, cowboy. You are too simple-minded to be trusted in such a high position of power. You and your cronies are turning America into an antagonistic state. At least with Bill Clinton, he had a charisma about him that the international stage could respect and admire. In fact, Clinton might have been the greatest ambassador of America's gentler (more-likable) side to the rest of the world. Does it really matter if he wasn't the best family values role model? At least Bill didn't politicize national defense, 9/11 and foreign policy. What does it matter, China will be the next superpower anyhow. And two superpowers can only make the world balanced and right :)
