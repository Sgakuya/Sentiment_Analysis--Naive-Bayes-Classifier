SAVAGE GARDEN IS THE BEST GROUP EVER! AND YOU ALL NEED TO GET YOUR ACTS STRAIGHT AS TO THE COMMENTS YOU'VE BEEN MAKING. AND DARREN, IF YOU EVER SEE THESE MEAN SPIRITED PEOPLES RATINGS, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU SHOULDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! YOU ROCK!!!! {AND SO DOES BOTH YOUR 1ST & 2ND ALBUMS!} I ALSO SAW A CONCERT OF YOURS AND IT WAS THE GREATEST CONCERT I EVER SAW, DID SEE, AND WILL SEE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE! I EVEN GOT YOU TO WAVE AT ME WITH MY SEAT BEING RIGHT IN THE FRONT ROW! AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT DARREN, YOU'RE SO ...SWEET LIKE A CHICKA CHERRY COLA! THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH IT WAS I FORGOT TO BRING MY CAMERA, BUT OH WELL. LOVE YA LOTZ, BYE - BYE!
