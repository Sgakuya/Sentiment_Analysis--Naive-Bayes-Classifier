I ordered a wine stopper/neck set for an anniversary gift. Having not received it after 9 days past my order, I called. The owner answered, and made me feel as if he didn't have time for my nonsense, and that he would call me the next day after he had figured out what happened to the order. When I didn't hear from him, I called him and was informed that he had sent it UPS the previous afternoon. I asked him "So are you telling me that the item wouldn't have been shipped if I called yesterday?" he said I was being silly and that it was to be delivered EVENTUALLY. The site also charges a minimum of $8 for shipping! He didn't even have it UPSed for next day...just standard, meaning I didn't get it in time. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS GUY...HE IS UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE.
