Oh MY GOD!!! I wish I had found this website before I hired these movers. IT IS THE WORST moving experience I have ever had. They took more than 6 hours to move a 1 bR apt with not much stuff, and wasted so much time in the beginning complaining abt the staircase. Their corporate office is the WORST ever. They are so rude to the customer its unbelieveable. My move is happening right now but I am writing here to PREVENT any more innocent customers from getting cheated.
