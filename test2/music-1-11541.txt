CBGC's in like 1992 opening for pennywise in front of 300 people tops. they were awesome, noodles handed me a beer...i was 16. well, i outgrew pennywise 'cause all their cd's sound the same (unknown road still rules though) and offspring have changed into a band that sang pretty fly for a white guy which you could have confused w/ Sugar Ray or something. depressing and pathetic...kinda like metallica.
