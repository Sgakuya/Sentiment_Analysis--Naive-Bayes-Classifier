Marxist drivel. The title song is yet another misconstrued 'classic' that gets shoved down our throats any time something bad happens within the mass populace. Do yourself a favor. Imagine John Lennon never met Yoko, and imagine how much better the Beatles were because of Paul's pop craftsmanship, not because of John's depth.
