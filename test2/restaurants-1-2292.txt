ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! I have the missfortune of living in North Crapolina right now, i am planning on moving back to new york soon, but holy crap. This bojangles place is the pits!! Their biscuits CRUNCH!!! And there chicken is overly spicy and way to greasy. Ugh, KFC is 1000000000000000 times better, just not the one in Garner NC, they have horrible service there. But all bojangles establishments are the biggest redneck food joints i have ever seen. GROSS!!!
