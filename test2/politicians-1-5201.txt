Al Gore. I find your behavior in holding our nation hostage disgraceful. You originally conceded on election night. You now are trying to get elected by any means. For the good of the nation you must now conceed. You have lost and no tricks or ballot manipulation can change this. Do the right thing. Hang up and disappear from our lives. You have no chance. And even if by your tricks you were to become president, the nation and the world would turn their back on you. Good luck in your retirement. Paul
