A man whose crimes against humanity are so vast and hideous yet so well concealed it may take decades before they are fully realized. And such an inventive little despot too! Just a few days ago, I heard about one particularly gruesome way that he may have managed to utilize current technology. Word has it that he has come up with a very creative use for large industrial sized shredding machines meant to chop heavy plastic materials. Never one to take the easy way out, Sadistic Insane has apparently put these machines to work grinding up human beings he no longer needs. And he feeds them live - feet first so they can suffer longer. Truth, fiction, legend? Who knows? What we do know though is that he has committed all sorts of crimes against his own countrymen and that his focus has always been on his own well-being - period. Strange that the far left - the very people who claim every humanitarian virtue known - never quite seem to find the opportunity to mention this.
