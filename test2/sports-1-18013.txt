I'm from St.Louis, and I NOT a Rams fan. I am a die hard Cardinals fan. Yes the Cardinalas as a team are horrible. However the problem, is not on the field, but higher up the chain ofcommand. For any Cardinals fans out there, please perserve sooner or later (probably later rather than sooner), the current ownership of the team will fade away and the Cardinals can start playing like a real football team.
