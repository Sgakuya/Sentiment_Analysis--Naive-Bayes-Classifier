Truly a glaring example of someone promoted beyond his competence. Can't he at least stick to one lie? No WMD, quagmire in Iraq, Ship jobs overseas, bad economy, infringement on civil liberties, those are his high points. Let's not even talk about dirty tricks, Max Cleland, exposing a CIA agent for revenge, etc. How about a military draft in 2005? Lte's hope we have a fair election this time and send him a pink slip.
