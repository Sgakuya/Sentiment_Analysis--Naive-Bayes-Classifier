If Al Gore really wanted what is best for our country, he would face the fact that George W. Bush won and quit making a mockery of our freedom. He is an egotistical, selfish, jerk. I cannot believe there are people who actually believe his lies and think he will do what is best for the country. If Mr. Gore ends up being our next President, the fall of the government will occur.
