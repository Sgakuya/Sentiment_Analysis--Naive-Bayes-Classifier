The current Daschle Dictatorship in the US Senate is the most cynical, partisan, self-serving ploy memorable. Cynical because it believes the US people can't see through his blocking of federal appointments and much-needed bills. Partisan because Daschle requires a 2/3 vote JUST AMONG SENATE DEMOCRATS to allow any legislation to a floor vote. Self-serving because Daschle plans to run for US Presidnet and it keeps his name and face on television. I suppose Daschle has decided that the American people have become socialists overnight. Get this 2-bit populist politician off the national stage. Surely even the Democrats can find someone better than this to run the US Senate.
