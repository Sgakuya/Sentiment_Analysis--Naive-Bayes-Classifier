Great when I first heard it. I lost interest in this when I lost interest in pop music in general but that's another story. No denying that this is an awesome album. Daniel and Crocodile Rock are the most famous but we shouldn't forget other winners like Texan Love Song (Elton singing with a Southern accent) and Elderberry Wine . This whole record is full of good hard piano rocking. It's slick, it's pop perfection, especially compared to Elton's earlier albums ( Tumbleweed Connection ) as good as they are. Fun music.
