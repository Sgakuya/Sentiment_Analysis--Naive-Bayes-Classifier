I am far from a racist, but I never thought Jesse Jackson was so great anyway. A man who preaches the superiority of any one race can only be likened to Hitler. I am an Atheist, so I was never one to jump on Jesse's religious bandwagon anyway. And I know that no one is perfect...but if you are going to go out and preach your righteous ways to the world, at least be righteous yourself. Another reason why religion and politics should not mix. Try to keep it in your pants next time, Grandpa.
