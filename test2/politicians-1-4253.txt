Ralph Nader used to be a decent consumer advocate IN SPITE of the blank check he handed to trial attourneys (He's the trial lawyers best friend). As a politician, he's more of a Socialist than Bernie Sanders (The ONLY Democrat that's honest enough to ADMIT that he's a Socialist). As a candidate for U.S. President, he's drawing votes away from Algore, though, so he can't be all bad.
