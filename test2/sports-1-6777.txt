Punk ass bitch! Didn't he coach CleMPson, or am I thinking of that Texas pansy? Plus , he wouldn't play vinsanity in the all - star game , when the fans made it plain who they wanted to see . I don't care if he thinks vince sucks or not , the fans made it overwhelming clear who they wanted to see ! Wine and cheese is always better than bread and water !
