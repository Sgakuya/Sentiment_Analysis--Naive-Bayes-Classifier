Buy the book,listen to the radio play and enjoy the elements or chronicles.Stop trying to analyse it so much.Just listen and enjoy.The basic concept really is quite simple.The less you think about it the more you understand.But if you are resigned to never understanding Lifehouse,buy the Lifehouse elements anyway.There is some fantastic music on the album and it has to be said,Pete sings his own compositions alot better than Mr.Daltrey.
