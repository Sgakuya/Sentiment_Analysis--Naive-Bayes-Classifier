My experience sucked. These guys are not students, more like con artists. One of the tricks these guys use is their old and slow trucks. That way they can double the driving time which takes SO LONG because of their worn-out trucks. They also showed up late which is another trick so that you will hit traffic on the way to your destination. They took over 14 hours to move my small ONE BEDROOM house!!! One of the movers was rude and took so long to move my furniture. There were times when I wondered where the movers were (they would be gone for 15-20 minutes at a time) and I figured they were organizing the truck. NOT! I checked out the truck before we headed out and those dudes threw my furniture in the truck sloppily and with no organization. Another trick is their time tracking which is confusing to say the least. It is so illegal how they calculate the time. I have disputed the entire bill and these guys will not cooperate and I have to take them to court. I would NEVER, NEVER use them again and would not recommend them. My advice would be to pick a more expensive mover with reliable, newer trucks and professional workers who do this for a living. It is worth it.
