I can't stand the BJ's. I have never been able to cheer for this team, even though they try to appeal to Canadian 'patriotism'. Almost none of the players or management are Canadian, so they shouldn't pretend they're Canadian. If cheering for a team based in my home country were that important to me, I'd cheer for the Expos.
