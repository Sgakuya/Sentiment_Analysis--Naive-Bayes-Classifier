Carmen Policy is a cheater. Butch Davis lied to his Miami players. Top draft picks don't perform. QB controversy. the fans cheer when Tim Couch gets hurt. The fans throw bottles on the field. And now they're $25 million over the cap and have to release their star players. One wonders if they'll ever get it right.
