Clay Aiken was born not only to sing but to perform. He sings with his heart, his soul and his entire body. His voice, his emotion, and his gestures are captivating. The music just pours from him with amazing energy and clarity. With each song he sings, I can't imagine anyone else singing it better. The concert is fast-paced, fun, and Clay generously shares his spotlight with his backup singers, band members and the audience. I love the way he personalizes every performance with something a bit different. Hearing Clay sing live is a gift.
