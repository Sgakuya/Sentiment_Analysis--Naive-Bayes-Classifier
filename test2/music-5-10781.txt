Pink iz one of the best singers that I have heard in my life. She has her very own unique style, a great personality, and a voice that even God would be jealous of! But, one of the things that makes her so great is that she sings about personall experiences, not stuff that she wants to happen or something she knows nothing about. When she sings you can tell that she has been through whatever she is singing before because she put so much heart into her singing. She doesn't just say words to a melody.
