I helped start a new franchise, all I gotta say is you get what you paid for. The toppings are kept to a minimum, to keep food costs down, ie more bread to fill you up, less nutrients from toppings. I'm pretty sure their slogan is/used to be Great taste at a great price, which returns to the get what ya paid for, taste. Everything is bread and just enough taste to make you think you're eating something real. Do this, buy the buffet to go, you get 5 slices to go, pick any 5 slices, be sure to get some desert pieces too. Stick this box in the fridge and see if you wanna eat it the next morning like you can with good pizza. Compared to my other pizzeria experience, its better to pay more, simply because you get more.
