The father of modern day american socialism.We have nothing to fear but socialism itself with this character.His economics were bad enough but then his personal sex life made Clinton's look timid.He was set up to marry his lesbian cousin because he could not find a woman of his own.Talk about being spoiled and rich too,he was carted around in his own luxury rail car as a kid.How come the dems never crusify him when it comes to class envy?Talk about a racist too,can you say internment camps!Nowadays weenie Republicans like Trent Lott get the beejeesis beaten out of them for wishing an old bat a happy birthday but this guy got away with confining and plundering a whole race of people and not a peep from the dems.He wanted everyone in the same boat,a sinking one and I blame all the social ills in this country today because of his policies that discouraged rugged individualism.He taught people that big brother was the best relative to have and this shows up in a whole welfare class that has seen how profitable it is not to be individually responsible for their own behavior.He even diluted our currency by confiscating gold as to print all the funny money he needed to run his socialistic social programs.I have nightmares that I'm in some re-education camp to become his team player and it makes me puke.It's ironic how he met his demise thogh.God works in mysterious ways.Sometimes there is justification.I know I sound so cruel hearted but I see fit to hate a hater sometime and this is one of them.
