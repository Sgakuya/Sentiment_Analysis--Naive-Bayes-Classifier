I used starving students for my last move in November of 2003. They were 2 hours late for their arrival. They brought wardrobe boxes per my requested, however the were broken and could not be used. They kept falling apart. As for the professionalism of the movers, well that is another thing. The movers kept disappearing. When I would go look for them they would be smoking or just sitting. The move was estimated to take 5 hours. They were there over 8 hours and the move was not completed. When I complained they said if I did not sign the release form they would just leave all my stuff exactly where it was. The movers also kept complaining about the work. Also, they broke two pieces of furniture and stated that they were not responsible. Anyway, I intend to do all that I can to keep other people from going through this horrible experience.
