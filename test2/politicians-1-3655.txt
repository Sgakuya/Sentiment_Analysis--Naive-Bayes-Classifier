very angry-but not surprised by W's executive order to stop funding family planning in other countries.Guess he's just following in daddy's footsteps. discusted with Ashcroft nomination.It's an insult to many americans to suggest putting that man in the position of Attorney General. Why would Ashcroft want to be in a position to have to enforce d9o many laws he doesn't even believe in? BuSh is not my pres.Selected not Elected!!!!
