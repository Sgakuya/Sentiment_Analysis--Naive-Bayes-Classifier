I'm a life long Michigan fan and a 1976 graduate of the UM. I join in the call for the immediate firing of Lloyd Carr. In business, the CEO of a company is responsible for the performance of his company. And clearly, the UM football program, which generates millions of dollars each year for the UM Athletic Department, has failed to perform. Carr's record against Ohio State is 1-4 in the last five years. He has lost the last three bowl games, including the embarrassment in Texas last week. In big games, Carr coaches very conservatively, one of the reasons why he can't win the big ones anymore. My vote is promote Carr to athletic director and find a 21st century coach.
