Wish i'd looked at this site before i bought my jewelry. I bought a wedding ring from the roseville Ca. store. Its not a year old and one diamond fell out and the main one is loose. The store is saying im out of luck. I took the ring in and you can clearly see there is no damage,nothing has been hit or bent, its just falling apart. The store gave me a phone number that was wrong and they wouldnt give me the corp.number. Good thing i live in a small town.....the corp. number is 510-273-2514. terrible service so far but i'll let you know how this turns out. They are supposed to call back......im waiting.
