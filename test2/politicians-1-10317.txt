This president has truly been a complete failure. (Bush literally stole the election of 2000, using his Supreme Court buddies to stop the recount, in addition to doing other illegal things.) Bush is definitely the worst president the U.S. has had yet. He needs to learn that there will always be terrorists in the world, no matter how hard people try to stamp them out. In addition, he lied about Weapons of Mass Destruction, and seeks to take away our important civil liberties. Thanks to him, the environment will be all but destroyed in a few years. Lastly, it is obvious Bush doesn't respect the separation of church and state, one of the most important values in the United States. G. W. declared Jesus Day a state holiday as Governor of Texas. That doesn't exactly convey a message of religious freedom. Remember, America is governed by the Constitution, not the Bible.
