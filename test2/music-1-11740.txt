Ughh. Good Charlotte. Horrible, obnoxious, derivative crap that is specialized by pretty much every god damn modern band that heralds themselves as punk . Th songwriting, vocals, and musicianship are all abysmal. Don't buy unless you're a ghetto defect (who isn't in this era? ) that enjoys listening to run-of-the-mill, poser punk (i.e. Sum 41, Avril Lavige, Simple Plan, et cetera) or willingly submit to conformity.
