This is a perfect pop album. I am glad that it was so well recieved, but I think some of the good press was payback for the terrible way Paul was treated at the beginning of his solo career. RAM and McCARTNEY are classic albums that were killed by borrish, short-sighted critics. Today those albums have many admirers. Anyone who thinks BOTR is the peak of Macca's solo career should listen to those albums. Ram, in particular, is much more adventurous and interesting than BOTR. BOTR is, however, perfect Wings pop. The title track is, I think, one of the best ever recorded, and will be remembered alongside the greatest McCartney tunes. Jet is also classic, and 1985 and Let me Roll it are essential b-sides.
