For the dummy below, Bo NEVER owned the career college rushing record. He isnt even in the top 10. Herschel is the greatest physical specimen God ever created. Go look at Bo today, he's a 300 lb fat a$$. Herschel is still 225 without an ounce of fat on him and one of the fastest people around. Bo cant even spell his own name.
