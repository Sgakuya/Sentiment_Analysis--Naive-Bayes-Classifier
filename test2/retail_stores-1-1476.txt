Sure they have beautiful, stylish clothing. But how can you give it 5*s? It is so unaffordable for the majority. And in my experience, the salespeople are condescending. Overpriced and ridiculous..go there if you want to see what the latest styles are and then walk down the street to a friendly shop with the same styles and friendly service (and a whole lot more affordable!)
