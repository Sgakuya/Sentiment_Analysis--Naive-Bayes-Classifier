Derek and the Dominos, in my opinion, is one of the top five bands of the 70s. Layla Other Assorted Love Songs is an unquestionable classic that somehow manages to capture the intensity created by Clapton's drug use and completely screwed up love life at the time (he was in love with his best friend George Harrison's wife). The song Layla itself is one of the most powerful pop songs I ve ever heard, and Bell Bottom Blues is still one of my favorites. If you re already a fan of this music, don t miss the live Derek the Dominos double-CD Live at the Fillmore.
