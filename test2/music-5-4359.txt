I don't think it tops Nebraska, but 'Into the Fire', 'Empty Sky', 'Worlds Apart', and 'You're Missing' are some of the most powerful songs that he has ever done since Nebraska was written. 'The Rising' and 'Paradise' boarder on the edge of a true religious experience. Plus it has 'My City Of Ruins' on it, which I have been looking for since he first sang it.
