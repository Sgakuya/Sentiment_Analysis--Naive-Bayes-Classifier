Yeah, this is a great record. One of the sure signs of an album with staying power is when your favorite tracks from the album change over time. When I first burnt this CD several months ago (and i will buy it as well), my favorite tracks were War on War, Kamera , and Heavy Metal Drummer ... now they are Ashes of American Flags and Pot Kettle Black. In some ways this album reminds me of U2's Zooropa, in that it represents a dramatic shift in style. There is little trace of Wilco's alt country roots in YHF, and twangy guitars have been replaced by synthesizers and distortion. This is a tremendous CD and I could not recommend it more strongly.
