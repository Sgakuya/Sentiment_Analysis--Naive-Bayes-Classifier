Probably the dumbest man ever to sit in the Oval Office. His friends were a seedy gang of crooks who were so corrupt, the only thing they wouldn't steal was a red hot stove. He has fond of telling an anecdote in which his father told him that it was a good thing he wasn't born a girl because I'd be in the family way all the time, because I never learned how to say 'No' Great choice as a first executive. Ironically he did more to preserve the Constitution than any president before or since. He had the document taken out of the files of the Library of Congress, where it was steadily decaying, and archivally preserved under glass. LOL.
