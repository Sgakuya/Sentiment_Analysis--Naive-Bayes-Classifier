Beck rips it up on this one. He is funky and hip and disco all in one. This CD is nothing but fun! Turn off the lights, turn up the music, turn on the strobe and lava lamps. This CD could make anyone groove. Beck knows how to combine great lyrics with classic, funky, grooves. Beck is not afraid to tell about himself and his past relations with Hyundi's and Deborah.
