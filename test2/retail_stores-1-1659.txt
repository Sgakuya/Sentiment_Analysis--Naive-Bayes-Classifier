20 years ago this was a decent place to shop for various items. But like any good bully, Walmart crushed its biggest competitor first. Walmart may have killed off many mom and pop type stores but its coup de gr√¢ce was the complete destruction of KMart as a viable entity. KMart is in shambles and will likely never recover. Even late night comedians mock it.
