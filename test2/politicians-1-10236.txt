Our country has gone down the WRONG ROAD since this incompetant man took office! Just look at what he has done the last four years when he has had to worry about reelection in '04. God forbid, if he finds a way to steal this election too, imagine what he will do as a lame duck when he doesn't have to worry...SCARRRY!!! Oh and by the way, to all you ignorant- ( and I don't mean all of you, just the ignorant ones)- Republicans out there, pick up a civics book! This man has COMPLETELY DISREGARDED AND DISREPECTED the philosophies the Republican Party was founded on!He's no Republican, I assure you. My Grandfather was a REAL Republican...John McCain is a REEEAAAL Republican. Reckless spending, big obtrusive government, keeping people afraid so they forget to think, politicizing the biggest and most tragic time our country has ever faced!...he is an embarassment to his party. I feel sorry for all of you who blindly support him just because he has an (R) beside his name. Those of you who would support a sock puppet for President if you thought it was Republican. Wake up, think for yourself, and look closely at what is happening to this country. You might just be scared at what you find...
