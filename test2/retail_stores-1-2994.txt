TAKE MY ADVICE - STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS JUNK JEWELRY. Like the other comments, I too bought a piece of jewelry from these bozo's (a diamond bracelet) that broke six months after purchase. They would not honor any warranty or fix it without cost to me. This was my first shopping experience with them. I will never go back. Spend a little more and go to a reputable jeweler outside of any mall and save yourself alot of heartache and financial headache. My store was in Salem Oregon - Lancaster Mall.
