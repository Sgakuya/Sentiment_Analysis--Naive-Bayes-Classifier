The worst kind of politician. No morals. No sense of fairness. Will threaten, bribe, and extort by any means necessary. Has no honor, no sense of right and wrong, and lacks anything close to ethics. Jackson is the kind of politician that takes a controversial but solvable issue and makes it into an issue people will die over. Nothing this man becomes involved with gets better. Fortunately he is getting up in years and we may not have to suffer his presence much longer. The bad thing is he has left behind a legacy of deceit and SOP that will be copied because it was so effective. One of the worst things to happen in American politics ever.
