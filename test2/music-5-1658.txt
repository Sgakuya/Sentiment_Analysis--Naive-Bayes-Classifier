The second release of their Best Of collection. Another great collection of songs from albums Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Batman Forever sdtrk., Passengers, POP, and All That You Can't Leave Behind. Limited Edition 2CD has B-sides disk mostly with remixes but two new quality songs Electrical Storm and The Hands That Built America are on the disks. Another must have for anyone who appreciates any of their work in the 90s.
