I think they are resting on their laurels. The customer service is terrible, especially on the ground and on the phone. The seating, food and on board entertainment are inadequate. If ever I was tempted to use them to fly to London, rarely-they can't compete with Virgin or United, I just have to think about what it's going to be like leaving Heathrow. The lineups!. Nothing to do with 9/11 either. It's always been like that. BA it's your hub city. Get adequate staffing. I fly to London every few months but I would rather stay home than fly on this airline.
