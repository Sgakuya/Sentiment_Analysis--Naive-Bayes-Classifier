I think this is a great album... HE has great writing talent (Though, as said, some are duds,) and shows a sensitive side I think is attractive to women-look at your body is a wonderland. i think the songs are very diverse and he has a great voice. The song 83 is so true to life, reminescent and enrapturing. From the slow drive of St. Patricks Day to my favorite, Why Georgia Why , There is a great talent behind a wonderful record.
