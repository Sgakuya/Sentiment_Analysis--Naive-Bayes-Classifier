Ralph Nader doesn't care who is president?! Evidentally RALPH NADER hasn't suffered enough! Believe me I suffered through Reagan's and Bush's enough! Ralph Nader needs to drop out, NOW. Doesn't he care about anybody but himself? Poor people don't want to suffer anymore. They want to get educated and be healthy and have their own doctors just like the Ralph Naders of the world can !
