Satan on earth. Why doesn't this site allow you to give negative ratings? He could've at least made a gracious departure from the White House but couldn't even do that. And to think that there are people saying that his personal life is his business and people should stay out of it makes me sick. He is supposed to be a leader who has moral dignity and is supposed to set an example for our country. To those people that say his personal life is his business, let me say this: Is it his lying to the country part of his personal life? What about obstruction of justice? What about giving nuclear secrets to China? Or pardoning criminals that have wreaked havoc on our society? (none of them have wreaked more than him though) Or taking gifts supposed to be donated or left in the White House for himself? Or taking the W's from the typewriter like some high school kid getting back at his teacher? He treated one of the most famous buildings in the world that has housed many great men like a motel! Are all these just a part of his personal life? The only reason I don't want to list more crimes is that I don't want to be up all night writing about a person I loath. I hope whoever has even the littlest respect for Clinton will reconsider and look at all the things he done, in and out of his personal life. Democrats and Republicans alike deserve better.
