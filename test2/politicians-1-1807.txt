Raised taxes right off the bat, refuses to put limits on legal awards (guess he is paying his debt to the lawyer organizations that supported his election), Doctors are leaving the state in droves thanks to highest malpractice insurance costs in the country (see legal damage limits comment above), PA Turnpike spent tens of millions installing EZPass system and now is offering workers a no-layoff contract, instead raising tolls 44%, Rendell has had cronies hired by that same turnpike, who pays for Fast Eddie and his 100 MPH PA State Trooper driven limos? (Executive 1) Every PA taxpayer. He is killing the state.
