Well since im a McDonalds employee ill tell u the truth. McDonalds is about the cheapest company on the earth. The nickel and dime their employees to death. Iv worked for McDs 4 times now. I keep trying at different location, and it never matters. Thy dont want to pay if u get hurt. They dont pay back wages(im currently tryin to get my pay. Over 3 chks was shorted 170.00. They refuse to pay), etc. If u saw half of the things going on u would NEVER eat there again. Look at it this way. Probably 85 % of employess are teenagers...enuff said. Thy make messes, dont wash up, play pranks, iv seen som sneeze in food and serve...etc. Dont get me wrong, im sure some Mcdonalds are great. But in my exp. and all the others iv talked to, they are not.Anyway, Have a nice day and come back.
