Evan Bayh pumped himself up in popularity as governer in Indiana by creating a bubble of outside investment mainly due to legalized Horse gambling, riverboat casinos and a state lottery. He left as governer with a $1.7 billion surplus (money not spent on infrastructure and education as was needed) and smelling like a rose. He left, the bubble has burst, Indiana is bankrupt, our bridges and roads are falling apart, schools are cutting programs and staff... and Evan Bayh is long gone. Sunburn doesn't hurt when you're playing in the sun getting it. It hurts in the evening at bedtime when you are exhausted. Hoosiers have been burnt by Evan Bayh and they don't(nor does he, I believe) realize it for the most part. But we are starting to wake up. Bayh is bad for Indiana, and bad for America. He wash raised in DC as a senator's son, barely flanagled residency in Indiana to be eligible to run for Governer and has since received most (over 60%)of his campaign $ from outside Indiana. (see: http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.asp?cid=N00003762) I have been a hoosier all my life. Born and raised in Northeast Indiana. I have bachelors degree and manage a business employing over 50 people. Believe me, Evan Bayh does not represent Indiana, or even Centrist political views. His father, the ultra liberal Birch Bayh, was defeated as an incumbant senator by DAN QUAYLE! Now Evan has to suck up to the out-of-touch elitist core that his father runs with to generate the $ and political clout to make a run at the White House viable. He has quit representing his constituency in Indiana because he doesn't need them anymore. Please don't vote for Evan Bayh.
