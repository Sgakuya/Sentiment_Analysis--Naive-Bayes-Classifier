A sorry excuse for a human being. Had Obama stalked by a video camera wielding campaign worker and hired the man who slandered Max Cleland to do the same for Obama. Luckily his past caught up with him. So what does 04 Illinois campaign teach us? If you want to run for Senate don't beat your wife (thank you Mr. Hull) and don't coerce her into sex in public places. Ah Illinois politics- makes Louisiana seem sane.
