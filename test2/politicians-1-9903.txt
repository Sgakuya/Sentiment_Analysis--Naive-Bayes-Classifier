Franklin Pierce has no real legacy as he virtually sat his whole term doing nothing. Undoubtedly, his inaction ultimately led to the Civil War as he refused to face the pressing issues of his time. Pierce was probably the worst President there ever was. But most damaging to Pierce was his increasingly anti-Lincoln, pro-Confederacy ranting during the Civil War. On a sidenote: when did a bunch of conservatives try to put a positive light on this man- and how is this relevant to Barbara Bush being his descendent? No one would try to put a positive light on Pierce's legacy BECAUSE THERE IS VIRTUALLY NOTHING POSITIVE ABOUT IT. It has nothing to do with who this man is related to, good or bad.
