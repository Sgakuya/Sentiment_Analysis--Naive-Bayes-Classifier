Black-outs. That's what raydar fans get. To see the Raiders last year, have such a great record and still not sell-out was embarassing. The Raiders had one of the best, if not the best record in the NFL for a time, but did the fans come out and support? Nope. When they went against their division rivals, the Broncos, in a pivoatl game, did they sell out? Nope. The fans needed a large corporation to buy out the remaining tickets for one game. It wasn't until late in the season, when the playoffs were right around the corner did the fans come out. The black-hole? Never heard of them 'til that the playoffs. If those aren't fare weather fans, I don't know what is. My rating is not for the team, but for the fans in the Bay Area.
