The only consolation in this moron having secured the oval office is the fact that he was Selected, not Elected. Had a majority of Americans actually voted this lunatic into office, I'd be a lot more anxious about the future of America. As it stands now, the future's not looking very promising. The puppet Prince George has managed to do so much damage to our precious freedoms and country in just two short years, and the parallels between Prince Georgie's monarchy and Hitler's reign are frightening. Heaven help us if this maniac gets another four years.
