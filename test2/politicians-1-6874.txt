I've always thought Mr. Lott was a bad representative of our government, but after seeing a report on ABC News of his endorsement of cockfighting in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Lousiana (they are banned in all the rest of the states) I find him beyond contempt. Your holier-than-thou attitude is exactly why so many people are turned off by religion these days, which is a shame, because it can be such a great experience and a wonderful path for living your life. If the church would look at its own members, such as yourself, they would surely find the reason for their declining numbers. You, sir ,are one of the biggest hypocrites on this planet. Family values indeed!
