I love Josh and think that this CD is better than his first one though that one is very good too. There is great paasion and love in Josh's songs in his voice. Something that is really nice about Josh is still just 22 (almost 23) and he doesn't try to hide that fact. He sounds alot older but he looks 22 and still acts like it. He is very sweet, kind, funny has a smile to die for and voice that makes you melt plus very good looking. I'm a loyal fan of his for beyond the day I die.
