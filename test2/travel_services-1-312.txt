I honestly don't know anyone who would want to fly this airline if they had a choice except for some patriotic Brit. I've flown on British Airways twice not out of choice and that was enough for me. The seats are cramped, the food is horrid, their selection of confectionary is limited not to mention small portions of everything. I think the nicest thing about BA is their logo and that laughable horrendous individual pieces of art on every aeroplane fin.
