Think of this record as a postcard from the Summer of Love. Compared to the slick cynicism and mindless sappiness of today's music, yes Pepper may seem a little dated. But Pepper dazzles with its creativity. Pepper was one of the first concept albums, and its theme focused on lonely people hoping to connect and find meaning in life by using a variety of methods-by leaving home or by seeking escapism in drugs. While the protagonist of A Little Help from My Friends hopes to slide through life with the help of his buddies and with the hope of a future love, the narrator of A Day in the Life is more ambitious and wants to turn you on to his unique worldview.
