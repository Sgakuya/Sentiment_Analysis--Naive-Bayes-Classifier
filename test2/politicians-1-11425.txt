I don't think and person who talks about a country as he did and then turn around and wants to be the leader of that country is crazy. How could people even trust this man to love his job and do his best. He hated this country now he proud and wants it for himself. The ultimate Flip-Flop (Libs have no shame). I am from OHIO and I am proud of what they have done. Alright buckeyes showem what you got....anyway, Bush and Kerry plan this...okay
