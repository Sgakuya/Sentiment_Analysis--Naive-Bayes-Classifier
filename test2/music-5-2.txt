I think this was Uncle Tupelo's second to last album before they broke up. For all of you young hipsters who like Wilco, did you know Jeff Tweedy was in a band before them? Still Feel Gone is more of a alt country rock album than an indie album, but it's great. "Still be around" which is probably one of their best songs, is on this track, and "Gun" is also fantastic. Worth a look for you Wilco historians.
