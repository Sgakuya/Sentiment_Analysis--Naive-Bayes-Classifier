The CD is terrible but not any worse than any of the other albums going out of big record labels and corporate radio. What sets Britney apart in terms of me and others hating her so much is that while she is equally devoid of talent, she is constantly shoved in our faces and we're expected to do cartwheels over her. I fear that her ineptitude cannot be calculated with our current knowledge of mathematics.
