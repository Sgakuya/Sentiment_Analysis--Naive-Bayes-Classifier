My husband and I wish we had read these reviews before we employed Bekins to move us from Florida to Georgia in June. They were supposed to arrive to pack our belongings at 9 a.m. on the 21st. They arrived at 5:30 p.m. and finished at 10:30 p.m. (in the meantime we called the dispatch department several times to inquire as to when they would be arriving, and the woman was extremely rude and belligerent each time we called). I do commend the packers on a very good job of packing - nothing was broken or missing. The movers arrived the next day (22nd) only one hour later than expected, so that was acceptable. They put the base of our wall unit, which is 9 foot long, on a small dolly, and it see-sawed off in our driveway, damaging both ends of the unit. We saw it happen and the driver said You are insured, so put in a claim. We paid $453 extra for full coverage insurance, but Bekins will not compensate us for the damage. They arrived at 9 p.m. on the 27th (they had telephoned and told us they would be here at 3 p.m.) to unload our furniture and our dining room buffet was also damaged on the base. We pointed it out to the driver and he again said put in a claim. They finished unloading our furniture, etc., at 2 a.m. the following morning. We submitted our claim to Bekins, and today received a letter saying our claim has been denied with no exceptions - they gave no explanation as to why it has been denied. We are also submitting a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.
