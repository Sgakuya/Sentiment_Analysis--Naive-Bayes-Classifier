I was unsure who to support until I saw the debate last night. Now there is no question in my mind. Gore is a disgrace to the American public! After he and Bush set the rules of the debate (they were not set for them), Gore proceeded to totally ignore them. He constantly interrupted Bush, showing a complete and utter disrespect for his opponent. If he has so little consideration for someone playing a major role in his life now, how are we to trust him over the next 4 years?? I will never support him, and hope he is treated by Americans the same way he has treated Bush.
