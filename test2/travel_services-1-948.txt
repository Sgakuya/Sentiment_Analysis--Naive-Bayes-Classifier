We used Bekins (Boyer Rosene) to move from Chicago to North Carolina and it was the worst experience I have ever had. The load was underestimated and therefor split into two deliveries. The driver decided he wanted to quit his job before I stuff was to be delivered and so we had to wait 3 extra days, with two small children, to get our stuff back. The driver was rude and we had a lot of damage. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
