One of the best rock albums ever. Pink Floyd was at their best in this album, they were certainly a great group. This masterpiece (it is no LESS than a masterpiece) deserves all the credit in the world, while it may be difficult for some people to understand or care for, this album makes a person think. It makes you appreciate it, and I personnally do appreciate this album. It has changed rock and roll, it has sold so many copies, and STILL appears on the Billboard chart every once in a while. Time, Brain Damage, Us and Them, and the Great Gig in the Sky are incredible songs. This is a must own CD.
