I work at a Bob Evans. I am an educated women. I found myself in between job because of divorce. Here is most of a letter I wrote to them and it is to nice, put it that way. Im writing you concerning the added duties for the salesperson at Bob Evans. I understand that Bob Evans gives us a place to make a living and pays us $2.13 per hour. I just dont agree with the added duties we have. We already have to take an order, take out their drinks, their food, give refills, and suggestive sell (not counting cleaning and other duties such as carrying dishes, stocking ECT.) Now, we have to bus our tables and run every ones food. Please do not get me wrong I dont mind working, But the average breakfast and lunch tip is $1 per person (sometimes not even that). I do not think we are getting paid the right pay for all you are asking of us. When I can go work at a Wal-Mart and make around the same money. I would get breaks there, and be treated fair. I am not by all means the only salesperson at this location that feels this way. I would like to stay at Bob Evans but the duties that are asked of us compared to the pay and benefits are very unsatisfying to several employees.
