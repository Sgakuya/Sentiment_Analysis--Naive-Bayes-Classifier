I purchased my wifes engagement ring at Kay's. They told us that if we ever wanted to upgade, that I'd get store credit for the full amount.The example she gave was that if we wanted one that cost $3,000.00 that we would only have to pay $600.00(Her engagement ring was $2,400.00). Well, when we were shopping for her wedding set, we found one for $3,500.00 that we liked. At that time they told us that in order for us to trade up, the new ring would have to be twice the value of the original ring.I also bought a watch when I bought the original ring and got the esp on both items.An extra $150 for the ring and an extra $50 for the watch.They never told me that the watch plan covers batteries (first 2 yrs), and the one time I actually used that plan they returned my watch 2 weeks late with a dead battery.When we bought her wrap (we didn't end up purchasing the set) I bought another watch and when trying to sell me another esp I found out about the 2yr battery replacement. The funny thing is that the watch I was buying was a citizen eco-drive that gets recharged buy the sun and never needs a new battery!! All in all the jewelery is ok, but only the expensive stuff. But there customer service is definetely horrible and they do lie to make sales.Oh yeah, when we were on our honeymoon aboard royal carribean I bought 2 more watches for half the price they were at Kay's. Royal carribean makes money at that price so you can only imagine how much Kay's makes!!!
