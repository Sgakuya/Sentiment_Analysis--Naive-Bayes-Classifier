I think little 'pip squeak' and 'megs' should watch their mouths!!! don't know what they listen to but like everyone says - if you ain't got anythin nice to say, then don't say anythin at all , avril has a beautiful voice and really knows how to sing her songs!!! Are they musicians? probably not by the sounds of that. It takes a hell of alot to get a song heard and played all over the world, damn, i'm finding it hard just to finish putting a band together, then you have to write the songs, and good ones at that, and then you have to get producers attentions! Stop your critisism and get a life. If you don't like her songs then don't kisten to them! i'll do enough listening for the both of us!!! and everyone else for that matter!!! Avril, your beautiful, don't let any of these fools get you down, if they keep hasseling you then send them my way, i have a fan club here that will sought them out. Yours truly SlaveZero
