I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with the debut album of Carl Thomas. When he first came on the scene in Puffy's Been Around the World remix, I didn't know if he could do anything special, but I did notice the fact that the man could sing. Emotional is one of the best albums that I have heard this year. Carl Thomas is a real brother who is not afraid to let his woman know that he is in love. This album is excellent. If you don't have it, go pick it up! Carl, CALL ME!
