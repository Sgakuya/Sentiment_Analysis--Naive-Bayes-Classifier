P!nk is a great female artist. I love listening to her music as well as many others. I personaly think she is one of the best female artists out there. She has her own style and her voice is just terrific. I cant wait for her next CD to come out. I loved Cant Take Me Home but im positive her next CD will be even cooler then that one. Cant Take Me Home is the best CD out there. P!nk is the best!
