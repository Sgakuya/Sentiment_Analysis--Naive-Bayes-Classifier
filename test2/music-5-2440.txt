the beatles were revolutionary in the 60s and without them many of todays top bands would not exist. they made experimental music, clever lyrics and most importantly wrote classic songs. they were true originals. Revolver was the first of many beatles' all time greats and all three songwriters were on top form. Harrison churned out three songs, (his most on any one beatle disk), including the incredible love you too using far out eastern instruments and the simple and essential rocker taxman, McCartney probably had the biggest range for the album, ballads like here, there and everywhere and for no one were beatiful and melodious, the sheer joy of got to get you into my life and the sunny optimsm of good day sunshine cannot help but infect the listener. Lennon was being far out and experimental and thus supplied the albums more interesting and deep side. the groundbreaking tommorow never knows must have sounded out-of-this-world back in 1966, elsewhere john was writing great songs (dr. robert, i'm only sleeping) and rocking out (and your bird can sing, she said, she said) marvellous. to those of you who dismissed yellow submarine for being to childish is say this: whoever decided music had to be serious all the time? without stuff like this where's the fun? the joy? i doubt you'll find it anywhere around modern music. oh and i couldn't rate this album and not mention eleanor rigby, just an unbelievable song, espeically to think McCartney was about 24 when he wrote it.
