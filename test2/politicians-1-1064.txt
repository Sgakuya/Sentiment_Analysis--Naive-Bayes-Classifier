I'm no Israeli, but I can't see how you people can salivate over a man like Sharon. From what I've read, he's been nothing but trouble. Peace through strength? Come ON! It was because of him the whole trouble started in the Middle East. He KNEW that blood would be shed if he went to the temple, but he went anyway. Is this a man of peace? Yes, one must not back down to threats of terrorism, but this is ridiculous. And peace can come only if both sides coexist with one another, and that means concessions from both sides. Pride never solved anything.
