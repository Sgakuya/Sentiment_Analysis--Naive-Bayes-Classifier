I am not really that big of a girl... in fact, I'm considered average for adult women in the United States. I do have a D - DD cup, though. I can NEVER find anything at Victoria's Secret that will fit my bustline!! Heck, even if it did fit my bustline, it wouldn't be flattering, since most of their things don't fit the rest of me anyway. I guess some women (like me) are just destined for cotton panties and Platex full-figure bras! :)
