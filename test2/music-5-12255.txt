My gosh!!!! This is such a great album. You can just pop it in and not bother about what song comes next. Raphael's voice is just sooooo smooth and Dawn's is as fine as her En Vogue days and when those voices are put together, wow! Ali has ALL the beats and i just love this group. Looking for more from them. Best tracks: ALL!!! :-)
