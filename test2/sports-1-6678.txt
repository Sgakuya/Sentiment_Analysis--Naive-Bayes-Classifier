jesus, he has the easiest job in sports, and he has throughout his whole career. Here is the tough job he has had to do, first he told his team to pass to Jordan, and if he's covered pass to Scottie. Now, he tells his guys to pass to Shaq, and if he's not open pass to Kobe, i could coach these teams, and i'm being serious. He never even bothers to get out of his seat! he just sits there and tries to look interested. His idea of coaching is he whistles into his fingers and that means pass it to Shaq, wow, that's tough. The only thing he is good with is ego's, and that's only because he tells them the only way to win a championship is to make friends. Is there anyone on this board who couldn't take the Lakers to a championship?
