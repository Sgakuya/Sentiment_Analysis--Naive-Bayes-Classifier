When I first listened to this album I was totally amazed by it, because I had never heard anything like it. I couldn't understand anything the singer was saying, though I caught odd phrases like have another/coin a phrase, and the guitar work reminded me vaguely of the Byrds. This album is a work of genius because it is totally unique-nobody has ever made anything remotely like this creation. I still can't tell you what Michael Stipe is singing about on Murmur;all I know is that this album is a work of beauty.
