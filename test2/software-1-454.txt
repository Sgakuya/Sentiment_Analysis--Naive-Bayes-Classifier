It's too bad there isn't a rating lower than 1-Terrible! to describe this operating system. I could have pounded my keyboard in a drunken rage and farted out a better operating system than this pile of garbage. Thank god they had XP to follow in its footsetps or else Microsoft would have truly been done for.
