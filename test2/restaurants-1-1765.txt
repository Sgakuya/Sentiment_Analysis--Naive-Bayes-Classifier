Doesn't anybody notice that they just use the same seven ingredients, just piled in a different order? That's not cuisine, that's creative marketing. Their menu could be greatly simplified: hard shell, soft shell, or both? Anyway, I avoid it like the plague. My husband and best friend, though, sometimes wants to go, and it's two against one. If I go there, I need the hot sauce. And lots of it.
