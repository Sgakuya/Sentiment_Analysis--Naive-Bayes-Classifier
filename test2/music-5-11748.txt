This album is amazing. It has a song that almost everyone can relate to, from the more sombre bloody valentine to the more catchy tune of girls and boys its a easy listening CD that is perfect for every occasion. I have no idea whether Good Charlotte should be classed as punk, pop, rock all that matters is that they write they're own music fuelled with their actual emotions based on situations they have encountered in life, and I'm sure that alot of people who listen to the CD will find comfort in the fact that even though they feel it, they certainly are not alone. The group writes for its fans, and for itself. It doesnt write to sell records. All in all i would recommend this album to anyone (and i have been doing) who wanted a good CD that you can listen to in any mood.
