U2 sucks and has always sucked from their first stupid song Gloria to the crap they put out now. They are overearnest and self-righteous. They made a calculated effort to be more hip and ironic in the early Nineties, but that was disingenuous. I've seen them live a few times; Bono lost his voice one night, and I hate they way he moves around, likely squishy outmeal. Rattle and Hum was the worst movie ever made.
