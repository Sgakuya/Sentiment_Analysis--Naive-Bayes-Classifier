Being a person of mixed race, I find J.C. Watts disgusting. I think he forgot what color his skin is. If you closed your eyes, and couldn't see the color of his skin, you would think that you were listening to Jesse Helms with an accent. Why is it that People of Color feel the need to surround themselves around people and a Political Party that (behind closed doors) uses derogatory names to refer to them by. Like Colin Powell, I think J.C. Watts has forgotten where his roots came from. I think Maxine Waters needs to take a strap to his hide.
