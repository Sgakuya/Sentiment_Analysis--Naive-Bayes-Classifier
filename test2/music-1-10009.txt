I have a lot of incentive to lead a good life. Because, if I turn out to be a bad person, I know what Hell is going to be like. I'm going to be playing an endless game of bridge with my grandparents (don't ask - it's a long story) while a 3-CD player constantly rotates this Celine Deion CD, Cher's latest CD, and Kathy Lee Gifford's new CD. OK, there's probably going to be a lot of hellfire, too, and I imagine a lot of knives will be sticking in my gut. Not sure which aspect of the torture will be the worst.
