This album is a testament to the idea that all truly great bands move in an innovation seeking direction. Just as Led Zeppelin went Eastern, Pearl Jam goes spacey and atmospheric, away from the huge arena rock hits that lesser bands would fear to stray from. This album defintely has a melancholy, dark sort of feel, even the shifting punk numbers such as Breakerfall and Grievance.
