When I first heard this album, I thought I was listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Really annoying and obnoxious vocals. The songs are retarded, the production slick to the point of being unctuous, and the album is overplayed first note to last. The album was dated the minute it hit the stores. Besides that, it's great. These guys didn't have a clue how to put it all together, instead, they insisted on shoving their moderate technical proficiency down your throat. Total crap.
