Anyone who believes Shrub's performance at the convention is a fool. This new Republican party is a joke and a charade. Where were the real power brokers of the party? Armey, Delay, Henry Hyde, Bob Barr? Their evil is the real heart of the Republican party and anyone who thinks Shrub is sincere is a sound-bite fool and needs to do some real research on this evil moron. And why don't we hear more about his skeletons? Forget the drugs and sex, although that would be great to hear about also. Let us also hear about his involvement in the Texas psychiatric hospitals in which he was an investor and which through a series of shady maneuvers were driven to bankruptcy, leaving him and his fellow thugs richer. Let's hear about his family's involvement in the Gulf war in which Pere Bush conspired with and then doublecrossed Sadam Hussein into invading Kuwait. Bush's own ambassador to Iraq admitted that story. Then, of course, the Bush family and all their fellow scumbags benefited from the oil profits and the crap metal business after the war. I am sure there is more but the media need to get on their job and report all this to us. Let's get Cheney too. He also co-engineered the Gulf War and then became the CEO of a huge oil consortium as a reward. wake up, people. The evil Bush cabal is trying to hoodwink the American voters and they need to be exposed.
