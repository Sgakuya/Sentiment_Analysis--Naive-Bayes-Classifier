Closer is a wonderful effort by Mr. Groban and company. Groban has an amazing range, at least three and a half octaves when we include his gorgeous falsetto. The challenging music on Closer demonstrates this beautifully as it takes Groban's voice to places we don't usually get to go to with the typical comtemperary album. His tone is rather amazing. It's warm and inviting and doesn't crack in the lower ranges or go thin in the upper ones. Groban also demonstrates his remarkable emotional range as he draws us in and takes on a ride, not just with the lyrics but with the melody and nuances he uses as well. The instrumentals are very well done and the violin solo by Joshua Bell is particularly pleasing. Well done, Mr. Groban, well done.
