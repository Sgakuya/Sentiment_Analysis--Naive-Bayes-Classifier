What a great man. Just think, where would this country be without him? I guess I'm one of the few logical people in America. Say, could one of you help me spread this honey all over myself? - I'm going grizzly watching, and after that I have a bee hive to knock down. Now, where was I? Oh yeah. Anywho, I'm guess I'm just one of the few logical people out there.))))))))))))))))))))))) )))))))))UPDATE. Nothing gives off a more ethical, honorable vibe than seeing Bush meet with powerful Saudis in sunglasses. I saw that and thought, gee, I bet some honest, legit business that has nothing to do with my president's (and associates) bank account, is going on there. And I hope he hurries up and starts killing polar bears. Nobody goes to the Arctic anyway, right? And it could even reduce our gas prices by a penny or two. By the way, anybody heard anything about Iraq lately? I was wondering what's going on. Oh, nevermind, I remember, EVERYBODY IS DYING! One more thing. Anybody see Laura Bush on Leno last night? This is not a joke, she actually said this. She was talking about a Shakespeare program in LA that prevents gang violence. Jay said, really, young men in LA take to Shakespeare? She says, yes, Jay, you know boys - they love fighting, blood, violence, and those kinda things. So, they really respond to Shakespeare. I kid you not. God, she's a dingbat. ))))) ))))))))))UPDATE. this is ridiculous! Anybody that thinks this man is doing a good job is idiotic!, period. plain and simple. It drives me crazy! Americans can not be this dumb! What evidence are you waiting for? LOOK IN THE MIRROR, HONESTLY! And I don't mean to patronize or demean you. BE HONEST! You are not that dumb! We are all Americans, be honest!)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) ))))))))))))))))))))))))))))UPDATE: there you go, Georgie, don't say a word about it! Give him an award! We're all idiots and we'll never know the difference. What!? - they attacked London?!.............well, I gues I support you now. For safety reasons mind you. After all, you're tough, right? I sware, if we're still alive then, people that support this idiot now are going to feel so ashamed, stupid, and abused when historians start teaching of the Bush years. It's going to all come crashing down on you like a ton of bricks. An epiphany, to say the least. He is a FACIST. LOOK UP THE DEFINITION! I honestly would not be surprised if this administation just decides he's going to remain president after his term is up. This country is going to all to hell! That's right people, THE TERRORIST ARE MOST DEFINITELY WINNING! Not only is he not stopping terrorist or protecting free countries, HE IS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR THEM! He is perfectly suited to help accomplish their goals. THEY LOVE HIM AND WISH HE COULD BE PRES FOREVER! WAKE UP! Oh yeah, get Iran and Syria next! Then we'll stop the flood of enemies for sure! America, F YEAh! Comin' to save the motherF'in day, YEAH! WE RULE! How many dead tomorrow , MR. Bush? - 17, 18? We're going down people, unless us youngsters get out and vote in '08! 1,2,3, what are we fightin' for..........don't ask me, I don't give a damn...........next stop is VIETNAM............and it's 5,6,7,.................! Wake up! PS- check my new weblist.
