Spiritual Machines is a masterpiece, by far one of my favorite albums to date. I really like the concept of technology vs. spirituality, and the fact that the lyrics on this CD actually mean something, a rarity in today's music world. Songs such as Everyone's a Junkie and In Repair reminds us just how much technology has taken the life out of life today. But don't think that the album is entirely depressing! The message is one of hope and the music on it is wonderful as well. If you like the singles Life, or In Repair, you'll definatly love this album, its a total listen through!
