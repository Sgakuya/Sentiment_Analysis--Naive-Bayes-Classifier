 At about 9:00 pm on Fri. March 14th, 2003 as I was browsing at the B N in Santa Monica CA on the 3rd Street Promenade the store manager personally kicked me out of the store by coming right up to me and yelling LEAVE THE STORE NOW! His ID tag read 'Michael' and he is a dead ringer for Col. Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken. I called corporate HQ in NYC the next Mon. and needless to say.... SO GO SHOP THE COMPETITION!!!
