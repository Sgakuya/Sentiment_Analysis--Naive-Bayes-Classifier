Wish I could make my rating negative. George W. Bush is one of the worst presidents of all time. He tries to use Christian propaganda and oppress just about every minority out there. The conservatives of today have gone out of line. They are crazy and need to realize that society needs to progress and that relying on tradition will get us no where. Bush is an idiot and a real threat to everyone in this country. He lied about Iraq, he has gotten us off track, and he has violated our rights. Furthermore, the NEW WIRE TAPPING SCANDAL, HE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED FOR. This is a clear violation of the constitution. No American should have to deal with this sob...and in my opinion, his authority has validity in thsi country.
