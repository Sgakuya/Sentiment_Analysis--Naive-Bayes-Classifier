I have not eaten this product and will not based on the actions of the local site. We walk every morning and see the piles of trash they leave outside the establishment, we have spoken to the manager and finally called code enforcement to tell them to clean up their act. So far, it's better but they don't seem to understand that many people associate the filth outside with the conditions inside. YUK!
