Price chopper is absolutely awful. I can base this on pretty much everyone that i've visited while living in syracuse. I mean it's great if you like your grocery stores having only 3lines open w/everyone paying w/food stamps. I understand that people need food stamps but if they could just have more lines open then the rating would get bumped up to a 3. On the plus side, Price Chopper products are decent. Truly a horrible store that fails in comparison to wegmans.
