This global corporation had an almost virtual momopoly on the industry for way too long and clearly took many of its hard-working customers for granted, gouging consumers left and right nearly every chance it got. Though it may still do well in third-world nations such as Brazil, its days of dominance in the U.S. market have gradually been dying over the past few years. In sum, the advent of the internet has royally screwed Blockbuster's profit shares, just as Blockbuster had done to thousands of mom & pop video stores for 15 yrs prior. Ahhh, karma.
