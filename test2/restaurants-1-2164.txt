I am concerned about the unsanitary way in which you offer your contests - the roll up to win contest currently on is the one I am referring to. I feel it is very unsanitary for your employees to have to handle coffee lids that have been in somebody else's mouth. With the recent SARS scare, I would think it particularly dangerous for the general public for these lids to be circulating around. Not only do your employees have to handle them; they also have to handle food that other customers order. If churches are eliminating the wine from communion because of the risks involved; then surely a large company like Tim Hortons should also be concerned about the number of people they come in contact with daily who could become seriously ill from this procedure. Surely there is another way to win which would be more sanitary. There also seem to be a lower number of winning cups around this year. Last year, we won a small item on a very regular basis; this year I have won a doughnut and I am drinking more coffee.
