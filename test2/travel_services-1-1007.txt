I used this company to move cross-country from Ottawa to Victoria. Pickup was August 19; I wanted my stuff to be in Victoria on August 28, and we were told, no problem. When they finally arrived with my stuff, a week and a half late (it was in Dauphin, MB when it was supposed to be in Victoria), my joy quickly dissipated. It's hard to get mad when a truck covered in cute little hearts shows up, but looking at the condition of the boxes... Quite a few of them - especially the ones marked fragile - were in very rough shape, some had holes, some had grease stains, some were wet, and I had to laugh when the box marked Top with an arrow indicating which side is up (it's really not a hard concept) had the arrow pointing at the wall. It's a wonder any of the dishes survived in one piece (many didn't). My office chair also went missing - but I can't even claim it because of the $250 deductible. Even worse was that the staff seemed to have no training - *I* was showing *them* where they should sign (and even then still missed a few). To get my credit card info, they asked for a pencil so they could take a rubbing of it (just as kids make rubbings of pennies) but then it smudged all over the place and they had to write down the number anyway. Even if my chair was ever later found, there is no number connecting the inventory (on which the tag # is written) to the invoice (on which my address is written). In short, invest in a few extra bucks to get a reputable company and save yourself the nightmares.
