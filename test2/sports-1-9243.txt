Personal opinion: I hate this guy. I have this love/hate relationship with Chauncey. He has very good range, and a decent inside game, but I fail to see a spark in him. Chauncey always has this blank expression. He rigidly and methodically plays the game as though he had something more important going on at home. He's one of those players that brings the goods to the court, but never enough for the extra mile. I wouldn't even honor him by calling him an average above-average basketball player. He's just mediocre.
