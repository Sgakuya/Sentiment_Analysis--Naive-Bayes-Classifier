I'll go in this store for the occasional Happy Bunny item, but that's it! Their clothes are expensive...and they don't even look good! Everything is pretty much all black, with the exception of some of their t-shirts. At least at A&F, you come out looking good!! The reason Hot Topic is around is to cater to portions of teen popluations during their goth phase. They all claim to be non-conformist, yet they dress like each other! They'll get over it once high school's over!
