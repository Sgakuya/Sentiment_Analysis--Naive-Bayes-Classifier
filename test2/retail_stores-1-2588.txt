First off, I was humiliated in front of the store by the cashier for trying to use my Hen House card (which, by the way, works, you know...). Then another cashier 3 lanes away chimes in also. I will never, ever, step foot into Price Chopper again. Hen House is more expensive, but well worth it. Plus, the help is courteous and qualified. No more of the ghetto customers and white-trash workers for me!!!
