Hanson IS a very talented band. They write all of the songs themselves and deserve a lot more recongintion than they get in my opinion. A lot of radio stations now days refuse to play any Hanson. That is just not fair for them, or thier fans. Thier songs are very deep and meaningful and beautiful at that. Thier new CD's previews hint to be just the same beauty.
