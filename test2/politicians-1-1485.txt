It's not true that Pinochet made the trains run on time . The truth is that he almost destroyed every single rail road in Chile! Chile had a quite good rail road infrastructure under Allende's leadership, but Pinochet didn't want any of it. He was as ruthless with the rail roads as with his nation's people. It's easy to show your hatre against Pinochet, all you have to do is to become a member of Amnesty! :-)
