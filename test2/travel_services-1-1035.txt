The absolute worst moving experience I have ever had. DON'T EVER USE THEM!!! Horrible, horrible, horrible. They were supposed to be there at 10 they arrived at 2. My only request was for them to pack up a large antique mirror, which I was assured they could do. The movers knew nothing of it and broke a piece off the mirror frame. They were patronizing and rude, and wouldn't unload the mirror off the truck till I paid in full. In addition, they charge double driving time, which was not explained. What a scam!!!
