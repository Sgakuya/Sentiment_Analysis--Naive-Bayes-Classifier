Of course, I was a lot younger when this came out, and a lot less discriminating, but there were some beautiful and emotionally evocative compositions contained in this collection, as well as some diversity and experimentation with (for the time, at least) exotic musical genres, and was really the last time that John did anything that I would describe as "great". Certainly, it was the last time I bought any of his records. Not to say that he didn't produce an interesting song or 2 after this, but the bulk of his material seemed to become bland and boring. Maybe it was the cocaine...
