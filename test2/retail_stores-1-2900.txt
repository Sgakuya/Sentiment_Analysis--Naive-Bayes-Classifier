I am a former manager for Whitehall. Embarassed I worked there as long as I did. First of all, the employees there are MOSTLY unknowledgeable of the product. Those of us who know our product, especially reapir and diamonds, get tired of having to stand behind aproduct and a company that we don't believe in. NEVER BUY AN ENGAGEMENT RING ALREADY SET!!! That it my first advice to you. Each Whitehall uses independent jewelry repairmen...NOT employees for sizing, repair, etc...this can lead to loss, theft, and you as well as the employee not knowing the truth about your repair. A good jeweler has a jeweler do the repairs on-site, either during operating hours or on certain days each week. What you may not know is that there is a guy coming and taking your things somewhere else to do the work. My best advice, don't think you're getting bargain at Whitehall or their sister store, Lundstrom. You see lower prices, but you'll also see feathers, fissures, carbon spots, cloudiness, and yellow diamonds, and I don't mean the fancy kind. To the rater who said her ring was dipped in white gold, but was not white gold, the truth is that is how white gold is made. It doesn't exist naturally. It is covered with rhodium, a member of the platinum family. The quality of the process will dictate how long your ring stays white. With heavy wear, a jeweler would recommend a re-rhodium about once a year. It replenishes the bright white as well as takes away scratches. Ah, the price one pays for the beauty of white gold. Hope this helps!
