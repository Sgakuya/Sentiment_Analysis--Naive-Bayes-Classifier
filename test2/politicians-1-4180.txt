I was going to vote for Nader because I wasn't satisified with Bush or Gore. I started to listen to Nader more and realized I just did not like the way he came across. He got away with a lot. He constantly called the two major candidiates names, especially Al Gore. If he would have been a real contender there is no way he could have gotten a way with that. He really did spoil this election for Al Gore. If he is really passionate about his message let's what he is planning on doing the next 4 years.
