This guy is a huge wolf in sheep's clothing. This guy pretends to care for others, but he is really just out for #1. This guy is all about power, money, and being in the spotlight, and he'll sell out his principles in a heartbeat to get them (i.e. his flip-flop on abortion when he ran for President for the first time in 1984 after being one of the most prominent pro-lifers before that). He's definitely more than willing to kiss white liberal ass, and he's done it on numerous occasions. He claims that Martin Luther King died in his arms, when he wasn't even there when MLK died. This man has no shame - Lie, steal, sell out, kiss ass (white liberal ass that is), whatever it takes to retain his power and money. Martin Luther King may not have been a saint, but he was a hell of a lot better than this joker is. Jesse Jackass is an embarrassment to black Americans, and hopefully more black Americans will wake up and see Jackson for the race-hustling, poverty pimp, scumbag that he really is. There's plenty of good role models for black youth (e.g. J.C. Watts, Reggie White, Alan Keyes, Thomas Sowell, Condoleeza Rice, e.t.c.), but this assclown isn't one of them. He's done more harm to the black community than the KKK ever could. 'Nuff said!
