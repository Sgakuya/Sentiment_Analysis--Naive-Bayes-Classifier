He makes up stories out of thin air. When he was governor here in Arkansas, he lied all the time, and smirked about it and acted quite pleased with himself. He never seemed happier than when he was lying to us. He's a major smart-aleck who has utter disrespect for the people, and thinks we're stupid enough to believe his lies. I've known many politicians that I disagreed with more heavily on the issues...but I never saw anyone so thorougly dishonest as this man - and he's tickled to death to be that way.
