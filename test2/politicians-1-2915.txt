Gavin Newsom is the worst Mayor San Francisco has ever had. Fact: The SF Police force has one of the lowest morale in the country.Since Mayor Newsom took office San Francisco has more crime & violence then ever before in the city's intire history.It's an absolute shame Gavin Newsom has to use excuses everytime a crime happens instead of hiring more Police to help his already over worked Police Force.
