London Calling is an excellent album. The title track is awesome along with the cool song Jimmy Jazz. In Spanish Bombs where they sing in Spanish is so powerful. Wrong 'Em Boyo is also an upbeat, fun song to listen to. Koka Kola, The Card Cheat, they're all unbelievable songs. Believe me, it deserves every bit of recognition it receives. London Calling blends so many different genres of music together to form a distinctive, great album. It surely and truly is one of the best albums composed in the history of music.
