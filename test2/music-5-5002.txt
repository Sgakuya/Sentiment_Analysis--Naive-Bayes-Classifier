I hope you dance is the greatest song I've ever heard by Leann Womack, I went and bought the CD the first time I heard the song. I listen to it everyday, It does have alot of meaning, and it warms my heart, I dedicated it to my two year old son on a local country station. I sing it to him all of the time, cause I love him so much!!
