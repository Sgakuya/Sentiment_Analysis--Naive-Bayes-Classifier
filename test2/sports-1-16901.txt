This team is the biggest fluke of them all. They are such a joke. I agree with what others said about the weak schedules being a factor in their victories. Same with the two Super Bowls. Weak scheduling caused them to go on a roll while only beating one good team (my Indianapolis Colts), and hence won the superbowl. The Patriots are overrated, they'll suck this year, wait and see.
