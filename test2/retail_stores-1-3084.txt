Some of the most unhelpful nitwits in the world. I could write a book on these guys. Try going in and getting assistance. The most frustrating thing about it is that there's 12 employees standing around behind the counter making copies and they act like no one's even in the store. The problem lies with the fact that they have lots of side projects that they need to get done, but walk-in customers have to count for something. There should be at least one person who solely helps customers.
