Have to agree with edt4 man. Yup Baging another old lady on the dinning room table while his wife was sent off to another wing. The gall of the guy going after Hilliary Clinton during the Senatorial campaign, just goes to show how low in the gutter these republican scum really is. Aaaaaah! good old NEWT too was getting the old balls off on his desk on Capital Hill, and then turning around a calling Mrs. Clinton. Another loser.
