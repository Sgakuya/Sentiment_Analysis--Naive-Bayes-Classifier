This is a great CD. I'm not one for "live" cd's. However Tree63 are at their best when live. I've only had the CD less than a week and i have all the songs memorized -lol-. Their songs are original. If you're looking for a cd where the songs don't all sound the same, this is it.Very catchy. If you get the chance to see them live...GO!
