the backstreet boys are one of the most amazing and influential pop groups around. They are the best out of all the so called boy bands. The whole boy band phase will pass and the backstreet boys will probably, most definetly will be the ones left standing. No offense to all of the other pop fans, I just think that they are the best there is. The lyrics are thought provoking and meaningful to their fans, just as anything they do is meaningful to their fans.
