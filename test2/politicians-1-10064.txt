REVISED: George W. Bush is a piece of steamy dog s***. He is a terrible, horrible, unbelieveably bad president, quite easily the worst of all time. He is a liar, an idiot, a flip-flopper, an anti-Non-christian, anti-homosexual, anti-minority, anti-freedom of speech, Texan, war lover, anti-life president. He makes Warren G. Harding and Herbert Hoover look great. He has destroyed everything American. He has drawn us into a pointless war, cut taxes on the rich ONLY, deeply hurting our economy. He has destroyed our enviornment, has been cruel to minorities, is an ex-drunk/drug addict (unacceptable for a person of such power), has tried to make America a dictatorship and has opressed us of our contitutional rights. I don't know what kind of s***-pile America will be by 2009, and I don't want to know.
