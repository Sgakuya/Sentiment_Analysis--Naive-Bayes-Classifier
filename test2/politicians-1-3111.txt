All I have to say about this chump is to encourage you to read Dereliction of Duty, located in the current events section in Barnes Noble. Just when I thought there was an end in sight to the seemingly bottomless pit of antics associated with Bill Clinton, he yet again fails to amaze and disappoint with his wanton disreqard for the best interests of the United States of America. Slicky tricky Billy is a nothing more than an Oxford schooled snake oil salesman.
