This is not my favorite Wilco album and I do not think it is their best effort overall, however, there are a lot of terrific songs on 'Summer Teeth'. I am thinking that the low average rating here for the albume is from people who have not even listened to the record and are passing some uneducated judgement. 'Via Chicago' and 'She's a Jar' are some of the band's best ever and are a couple of warped love songs that explore the emotions that everybody has felt if they have ever been in a close relationship with another person. 'Candy Floss' and 'Summer Teeth' are a couple of bubble gum pop songs that explore the depths of being a person on their own. Wilco continues ot play around with some Beach Boys influence on a couple of songs, which is a nice change of speed. 'How do you fight Loneliness' is a beautiful commentary on most of our lives at some point in time. 'ELT' has the cheesy rock sound of 'Casino Queen' and 'Monday' from records past that you love to hate yet hate to love. If you have never listened to Wilco before, go buy their second effort - 'Being There' - that will give you some great exposure. If you have heard them before and like them, go grab 'Summer Teeth' off of the shelf and be prepared to hear a different album each time that you listen to it. The beauty is that the entire album and each individual song will take a different meaning on based on your mood when you sit down and drop it into your stereo to listen.
