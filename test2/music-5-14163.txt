Man, that's a great soundtrack. I could actually do without the movie bites, but they're not too intrusive to the music. I could listen to Dusty Springfield belting out Son Of A Preacherman anytime. A great collection for some badass surfabilly. The Statler Brothers' Flowers On The Wall is cool. I had been looking for a decent collection with Ricky Nelson doing Lonesome Town for quite a while...this is certainly it! I like it two stars more than the movie itself.
