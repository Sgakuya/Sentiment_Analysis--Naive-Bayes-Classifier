Chicago Jaheim is old school all the way. I don't beleive is he 23, he sings like he live in the 70's or early 80's. I feel he deserves the title Soul brother One. He is down to earth and I hope he stays that way. I agree with him when he said he is looking for happiness. stay up don't get big headed. love
