I once worked in a building where vinyl was heated and formed - and a silk screening area functioned in adjacent room. The fumes never completely cleared out. Only Walmart is able to match that odor - they must have enough plastic biodegrading on the shelves to keep BHT in the air for 50 centuries. I would rather by toothpaste and soap in a porcine crematorium. If Al Gore really cared, he would have Walmart's stores aired out. And for God's sake paint the bldgs and put in some windows - God, these are ugly places!
