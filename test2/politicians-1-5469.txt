Im rating Kerry as a Senator from my state, not his Presidential run. So far, he has missed 66% of my state's votes. He is spending more time campagining than actually trying to lead my state. He has the highest liberal voting record in history. Supported the Iraq war, now against it. Has voted for higher taxes over 350 times. Has voted against defense over 50 times. Supports higher taxes all of the time. Votes against tax breaks all the time. A horrid Senator. Resign NOW!
