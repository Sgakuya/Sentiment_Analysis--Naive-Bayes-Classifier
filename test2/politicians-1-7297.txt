i wish that jesse(and i would never refer to him as a minister) and all of his followers who think that america is such a bad place to live, would move back to Africa and start throwing spears like their brothers . Get your racist butt out of our country. one more thing, i am an american, not an indian-american, germans aren't german-americans, they are americans! you are BLACK. get it thru your dumb thick skull that you are not african-americans. most black people are good people. there are just a few of them that squeel over the fact that they are too stupid to fill out a voter card and they want to say that it's a race thing.jesse, you are a trouble-maker!
