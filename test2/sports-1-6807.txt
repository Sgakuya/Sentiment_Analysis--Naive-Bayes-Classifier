I've been listening to Doc Rivers on ABC for NBA finals, and I'm very disappointed in Doc Rivers. It almost sickens me to hear his commentary. He is not impartial at all. 95% of the time, he's trying to shine the LA Lakers. Even when they play horrible and make horrendous mistakes, he tries to portray that as something positive. I've never heard a more impartial analyst than Doc Rivers. I don't think he'll be able to compete against LA Lakers when his team plays them, instead he'll be sittig on the bench day dreaming about LA Lakers and how it would feel to be on their bench. Doc Rivers should not have been a commentator for the NBA Finals. He has done a dis-service to NBA and those people watching the finals. -M
