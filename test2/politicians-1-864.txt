The longer Jean Chretien remains prime minister of Canada, the less credibility we have. He is a disgrace to all of us. I disagree with Red240Z on one point -- I don't think Chretien is bad at being phony; I think he's very good at it. He plays the role of the little guy from Shawnigan , playing up his self-described man of the people image -- after several decades as a very accomplished federal politician. Now, his arrogance is without end; constant accusations of corruption haunt his administration and are only dealt with when no other choice remains. Is he the only thing keeping Quebec in Canada? I can't imagine giving Quebeckers so little credit; the people of Quebec are fully capable of making such decisions without a prime minister like him. I've supported the Liberal party since I first voted for Trudeau; if Chretien chooses to run again as leader of the party, I cannot possibly continue to support the party. Jean Chretien may have been sincere at one point in his political career -- in fact, I think he was -- but I doubt he can remember how it felt.
