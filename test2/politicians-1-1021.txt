This man is the cause of a large part of the evil in the world. His violently racist anti-Arab views have caused him to wage genocide against the Palestinians. He has agreed to dismantle the illegal settlements and yet openly advertises for contractors to build these settlements in Israeli newspapers. He is the main cause of the US's disastrous middle-east policies, as he somehow has his iron grip around Bush's testicles. His racism is especially virulent, and he is probably the one person in the whole conflict who is the LEAST interested in peace with the Palestinians. He wants them to just leave and go somewhere else, and if they refuse to comply then they must be shot and beaten and humiliated daily until they leave. The fact that his virulent hatred is the product of religious fanaticism makes this a tragedy of epic proportions. The existence of men like this makes me weep for humanity, for we will never be enlightened as long as we produce psychopathic killers like this one. He sweats hatred through every pore, and Bush called him a man of peace. This just goes to show how little a grip on reality the Thief in Chief really has.
