Marvin Lewis, please make me change my rating. I m a Jaguar/Buccaneer fan, but I would love to see the Bengals among the top rankings in 2 years. My friend and I always joked that the Jets would go to the playoffs in a couple of years after winning less that 4 games. Lo and behold they did. Maybe Mike will let Coach Lewis do his job and won't screw this up.
