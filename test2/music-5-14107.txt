Thoroughly enjoyed this CD. There isn't one dud on the whole album. The variety of style make it so interesting. From the rock sound of She Keeps On Coming Voice In The Wilderness to the cool sounds of Sacred Trust Loose Talk Costs Lives to Tin Pan Alley in Technicolor Dreams . There is something for everyone on this album. Good job Bee Gees!!!
