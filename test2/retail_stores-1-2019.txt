I came into the store looking for certain model VCR. The clerk instead of trying to help me find the model number I wanted was trying to sell me an extended warranty. He got between me and the displays and I had to physically push him aside so I could look for myself. I would have walked out except that I had store credit. When I complained to Best Buy via e-mail they defended his actions saying they are trained to assist the customer.Now when I see something in their flyer's I will check it out and then go across the street and buy it at Circuit City. Now there is a store that know how to treat a customer.
