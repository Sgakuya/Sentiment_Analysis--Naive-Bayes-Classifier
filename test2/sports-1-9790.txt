Most overrated team in the league. Shaq has the IQ of an ameoba and can hardly speak an intelligable word. Kobe of course is a criminal and should be locked up for life, and I've hated Karl Malone since he was on the Utah Jazz. It's also funny the most overrated team is in the most overrated state in the country, too. I don't think it's a coincidence.
