The worst subs I have ever had. I spent two years in Japan and one of the first things I wanted was a good old American sub when I got home. The first place I found was a Subway. What I got was such a huge disappointment that I just threw what was left away and went in search of a real sub. I have trie them a couple of times since then with zero improvement. This hole will never get another penny of MY money. The prices are WAY too high for what little you get.
