That song of his makes "Afternoon Delight" look like The friggin' White Album. Seriously, what was up with this guy? Forgetting about all of the questions about civil liberties or how much of a power increase the federal government saw during his stint as A.G for a moment, anybody have any adequate defense of Ashcroft's praise of the Confederacy for instance? I have no doubt that their leaders were, objectively speaking, accomplished men, Lee for instance, is probably the greatest military figure the country ever had but facts are facts- what they stood for was a disgrace to God AND Mankind, an absolute horror show, and I say that as someone of part Georgia ancestry. This is the 21st century, and quite frankly, I question the motives of people who defend these types of statements and beliefs. I've no problems with someone being a Republican, and frankly anyone of any faith or ideology can be prejudiced, granted. Hell, we're all prejudiced in some form or fashion, unless you are one of the very, very few truly great and wise people of history, such as Jesus, The Buddha, etc. You show me someone who's not, and I betcha you've just shown me a liar and/ or hypocrite. What irks me are people of any sort who try to sweep such ideas under the rug, or try to justify them. You can't. The people in this particular party, or any party for that matter, who say that these ideas and attitudes, or Bush's speaking at the disgusting Bob Jones U. were wrong, now that I respect. These types of things are not only in The South btw, you will also find them elsewhere in the country.
