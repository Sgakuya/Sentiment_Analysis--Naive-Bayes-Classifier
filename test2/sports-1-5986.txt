Personally I don't give a damn about Redick but I think it says a lot about certain mindsets when people use phrases like Christians jump to follow orders from the Fuhrer- I mean the president. I am a Christian and you don't know me. You don't know where I agree or disagree with President Bush yet you are willing to make a blanket assumption about anyone who holds a Christian faith. Once again, here is another stellar example of a liberal proving without question that their lack of tolerance for people who have different views is exceeded only by their arrogance.
