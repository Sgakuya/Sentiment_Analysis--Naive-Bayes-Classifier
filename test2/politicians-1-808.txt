Never seems to make an important foreign policy statement until he hears what Blair or Bush or Chirac or whoever's ass he's got his head up that particular week, has to say. Doesent like to offend his larger neighbours i.e. Most Irish people were against the iraq war but he refused to speak out against it, or the illegal use by the US military of shannon. On the domestic front, his Parties inability to run the country is disgraceful, the 'promises' made before the election last year and then flatly ignored is just disgraceful. 'We the politicians have yet again mis-managed and mis-spent your money so you the people will now have to tighten your belts' Thanks Bertie. But as for what ammalone said -Shameless Adulteror. This seems to be a typical opinion from the old catholic Ireland. The fact that he has a girlfriend is irrelevant. Focus on his ability to govern not his sex life.
