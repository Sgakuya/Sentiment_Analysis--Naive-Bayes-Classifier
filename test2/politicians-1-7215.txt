Jesse Jackson should never refer to himself as a Rev. or any other referal to a man of God. I have never heard someone spout such anger, hate and racism as often as possible when ever any will listen. He is dividing and discouraging America by leaps and bounds. Keep him off the airwaves for the good of the country.
