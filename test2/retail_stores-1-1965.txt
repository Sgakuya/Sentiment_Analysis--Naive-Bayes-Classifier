they try to sell you that extended warranty crap and for people that don't kno that you don't really need it, they get riped off. The person helping me trying to get a ccamera kept on telling me these bull stories of peeple who got it and were so so thankful because the next day they dropped their cameras but the warranty doesnt cover anything that's an accident.
