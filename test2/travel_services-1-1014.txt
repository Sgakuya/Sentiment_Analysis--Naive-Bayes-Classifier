Do not hire Two Small Men for a long distance move. Initially, the price was right compared to other companies, and they were quite friendly until they had my things - then they broke 3 delivery dates without notice. I tried calling almost every day and the only person who could help me was never in his office. Finally, over 2 weeks after the first due date, my stuff is due to arrive tomorrow. We'll see about that. Really, spend the extra money and go with someone more reputable.
