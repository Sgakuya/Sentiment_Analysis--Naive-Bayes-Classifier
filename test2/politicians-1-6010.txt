The Hero of Chappaquiddick lecturing John Ashcroft on the meaning of the Second Amendment? Unbelievable! I'm sure that Teddy understands that John Ashcroft was correct in stating that Americans' right to keep and bear arms should not be infringed so that they may defend themselves from a tyrranical federal government. In fact, the Founding Fathers said as much. Teddy's demand for an apology betrays his real agenda - to disarm the American citizenry. Teddy Kennedy is nothing more than a bloated, drunken murderer from a family replete with unsavory characters. Don't let the liberals fool you. The sole purpose of the Second Amendment is to guarantee the right of the American people to keep and bear arms so that they may defend themselves from a tyrannical government. One other thing - since when does a good Catholic support a woman's right to murder her own child? Teddy better pack some asbestos undies for the afterlife. It's going to be mighty hot where he's going!
