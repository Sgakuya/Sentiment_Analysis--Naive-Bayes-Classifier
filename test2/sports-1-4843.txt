Great to see I'm not the only one who thinks this guy is awful. When you consider the winning ways of a very personable football coach (Amato) compared to the rather stoic personaility of Sendek, there's an obvious difference. He can't relate to the media and he can't relate to those players. How many of his players have gone on to the pros. NONE!! He does nothing to nurture and build upon the talent given to him. Rambling ........ Where's Nolan Richardson?
