I'm sorry but this is the worst CD I own. Blue (the only good song) got played out and every other song on the CD sounds exactly the same as the last. At first (this is not a lie) I thought my CD player was broken and was just playing the same song over and over again. If you plan on buying this CD you better love Blue because you will hear it 14 times.
