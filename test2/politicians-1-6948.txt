Jesse Jackson...the ultimate house slave. For years the Democrats have been doing the same thing to African Americans; pull a couple out and treat them specially, then let the chosen one control the others. It worked during slavery, it worked during the days of Jim Crow, and it's working now. The Democratic National Committee pays this man a million dollars to further their surreptitious racial agenda, and he does marvellously for them. Anyone who would lie and say they held Dr. King in his arms as he died is disgusting. Any Reverend who has an illegitimate child should be defrocked. And anyone who wants to tell us out of one side of his mouth that White America doesn't care about us, then tell us out of the other side that we desperately need their help is monster. He's a true sell out, and has twisted alot of Black America's mind into ignoring the true enemies of freedom and equality: rising illegitimacy rates, crime, lack of self control, lack of education, and the lust for free money. Jesse Jackson promotes segregation, which is no surprise since his biggest supporter, Bill Clinton, gave the Congressional Medal of Honor to a segregationist. How could he work for the party with the worst civil rights record, a party who voted overwhelmingly to keep slavery and to prevent the passing of the civil rights bill? For the love of money....
