First of all, I would like to say that all this trauma he is putting this country through is a complete disgrace. Does he realize that every election tens of thousands of ballots get thrown out because people enter things wrong? Maybe we do need to get a new system, but you don't go for that now that you've lost and aren't happy about that. You bow out gracefully, like Nixon did because he wanted to protect the American people from the pain it would have caused. Obviously Gore doesn't care much about the American people. He is sworn as vice-president to uphold and protect the constitution. It looks like he's doing a good job of bringing it down now. Why doesn't he just burn a flag next? And I would like to make a comment to all you environmentalists out there. The real environmentalists are those that work the land - the farmers. Do you realize how many farms will go under if Gore is elected? They know how to protect the land and it's obvious it's not Gore's way because they all voted for Bush. So you city penthouse environmentalists need to sit down and shut up or go spend a year on one of America's farms and realize what it is really like. Gore would continue to be a disgrace to our country, just like Clinton has been. Has anyone realized that we are now an international joke?
