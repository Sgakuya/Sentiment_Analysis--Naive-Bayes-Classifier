I'm tired of Cowher and his ego-driven "Steeler Football" approach to the game. "Steeler Football" has resulted in over 25 years of failing to achieve the goal. He is nothing more than a motivational speaker that loves to hear himself talk. He can't game plan or coach worth a damn. The Steelers will never be anymore than a team with a winning record and no championships.
