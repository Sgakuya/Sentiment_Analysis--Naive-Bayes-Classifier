Spiritual Machines by Our Lady Peace is one of their best efforts yet. I am so proud of them. They have swiftly combined intellectual debates with pure musical ingenuity to create songs that will resonate through your brain well after you turn off your discman. Definitely shows the evolution of the band from Naveed to Clumsy to Happiness . . . to this. Amazing job:)
