Belly-up, FINALLY...THANK GOD!!! I got off to a bad start with Wards years ago when they called me daily at my place of employment harassing, insulting and threatening me about a past due account. Lil' miss hitler refused to even consider that she had the wrong number. I didn't even have an account with Wards, needless to say I never would.
