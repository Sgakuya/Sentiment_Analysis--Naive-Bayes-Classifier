One of the best from the incredible class of 1967, the Doors debut album stands as their high water mark before the group's collaborative efforts became watered down by Jim Morrison's ridiculous posing. Although I still love the Doors and their unprecidented musical stylings, much more has been made of this band than they ever deserved. The legions of youthes that have become (and continue to become) corrupted from Jim's murky alter ego (The Lizard King) makes me wonder if it was all worth while. The music lives and breathes it's own life however and this album still crackles with life.
