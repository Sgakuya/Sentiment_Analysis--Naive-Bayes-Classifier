I completely agree with Munson's assessment of George W. Bush's ability to be the president of the united states. Sure he may be a nice guy, but I don't think that our votes should be based on who is the nicer guy. My vote is decided on who can do the better job. I want a president with experience, which Gore has. I am scared as to what would happen if Bush is president. Would you want a commander-in-chief who's only military experience was in the National Guard--in texas?? Look at his record as governor and you will see that texas has been absolutely horrible in one the areas Bush claims to be his main priority -- education. Average scores have gone down, teacher salaries have gone down, and this was as governor when he had MUCH more power over the education system than he ever will as president.
