To whom it may concern: I believe the Govener is doing a terrible job. I just graduated and I got a Govener's Scholarship. Well, this being my only way to pay for school I was excited. Oh! Wait! Now I find out that the form isn't ready. Gee, must be from all those rolling blackouts. If he were actually doing something in that mansion maybe he'd get more than a one star rating from his constituents. Yeah, he's for the people. The only reason he got a one from me is because I can't give negative stars!
