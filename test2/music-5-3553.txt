The wall is the rock album equivalent of a literary epic like Milton's Paradise Lost or a classic Opera like Mozart's Don Giovanni ! It captures modern humanity's woes with painful accuracy, but also goes deeper, exploring the roots of the bitterness, helplessnes and depression felt by so many. Roger Waters shows us a semi-biographical sketch that is horrific, but also sadly beautiful and understandable. The music is skillfully but never gratuitously dramatic and David Gilmour adds a little bit of softness and melody to soften Waters' more rough-edged tunes and allows the listener to be more easily drawn into the emotion and storyline. The sheer enormousness of the album's theme and skilled artistry of its music and lyrics make this album a classic!
