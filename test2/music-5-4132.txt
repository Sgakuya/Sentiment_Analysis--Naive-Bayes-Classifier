This cd set affirms why I love Bruce Springsteen!!! I have never been touched by any performer or any album the way this box set touches me! From the moment that beautiful version of Thunder Road begins, to the gripping and every bit as beautiful and romantic Jersey Girl's final notes, this box set is a real treat! Everyone else who already said things about this album is 100% right! It really is an experience! The only thing is that it (at over 3 hours) is not long enough! I know that sounds silly, but if Jungleland, Dancing in the Dark, and I'm Goin Down were added it would be perfect! Actually, I take that back, if ALL of Bruce's songs were included it would be perfect! I really can't tell exactly what it is about Bruce, the band and this excellent collection of music that moves me so, but I think any true Springsteen fan knows what I am saying! When you look at the pictures in the lyric book with the lyrics to the songs next to them, you find yourself falling completely in love. Not neccessarily with the Boss as a sex symbol (although there are many of us who feel that way! Yes, PattiS I'm talking to you! I read your comments on dream date !) And I will admit it. The Boss is one FINE man, but that is entirely besides the point. Bruce stands for us and what we like. His music stands for our lives and the people in them. He has touched all of his fans very deeply. And all of you non-fans out there, Buy this album today. The price is NOT an issue! Even if you say oh he's overplayed, I'm so sick of hearing Glory Days...' You will change your mind after listening to this. Live 1975/85 is transforming causal music fans into Boss devotees. It's transforming casual fans into Springsteen Disciples, if you will! I read someone's review of his new album online the other day, and it said something to the effect of: either regard this album as a religious artifact, or see this collection for what it is It wasn't exactly a rave review, but that part about Bruce's cds being religious artifacts is not far off! And this cd set truly is at 'artifact' status. Buy it if you love Bruce, buy it if you want to get to know Bruce better, and above all else, buy it if you want to be moved and touched, and ready to rock and relax! Only then you casual listeners will know what I'm talking about...
