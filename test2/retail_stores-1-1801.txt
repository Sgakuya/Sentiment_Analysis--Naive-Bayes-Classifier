Screw wallmart, and their sub standard products,another great contribution to the world from the u.s.a., lousy service, min. wage, ugly buildings, fat customers who want the cheapest crap they can find. This company has been documented many times destroying towns, pushing out small bus. corporate greed in it's worst form.
