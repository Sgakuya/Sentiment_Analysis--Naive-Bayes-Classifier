Delta Airlines is my nemesis, and I have come to believe that they are they devil. They bump me from flights, they charge me random change fees even when I am travelling when scheduled, they casually void my tickets 10 minutes before I travel forcing me to purchase new tickets in order to fly. I despise them, and if I ever strike it rich, will devote a substantial portion of my estate towards their destruction. Death to Delta.
