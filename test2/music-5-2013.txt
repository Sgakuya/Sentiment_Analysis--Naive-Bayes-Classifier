If you say this is awful, that is your opinion. But if you like true music that makes you feel, that has real meaning, then you'll really appreciate the work that this band has made to help so many people who relate to this album. There are some of you so called rockers that like music that is heavy, with no meaning to the lyrics. Like take, Static X. I 'm not offending anyone, its just an example. But this album has a whole story to it. I say, thank you A Perfect Circle. And if you don t like them because they are anti-christian , that s not necessarily true. Because this whole album is about God. Take for instance, Magdalena , it is about Mary Magdelene, the lady that Jesus was really in love with, that helped him, but couldn t love because f Mary. (The Virgin Mary). And Judith is a song about when you feel like blaming God, when he wasn t there, but it was really your fault. So I think this album is better than Tool. It may not be heavier, but it sure is more meaningful.
