The Pistols are the fathers of Punk. Bollock's was an awesome album, despite the fact Johnny Rotten couldn't sing and Sid's previous bass experience was playing to a Ramones album for 3 hours they pulled off an amazing feat.The Pistols may not have invented Punk perse, but they defineatly brought it to where it is today.Too bad they were more into chaos than rock n roll though.
