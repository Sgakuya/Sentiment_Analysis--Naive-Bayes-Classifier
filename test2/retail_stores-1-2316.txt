The new store concept is a complete joke. Are you telling me that I have to give a 25 cent deposit on a cart, yes I know that carts are stolen, but let me tell you the cost of carts is part of the cost of having a grocery store. Yes we know shoplifters cost the store money too but does that mean that I have to give them a deposit when I go into the store and can have it back when I leave and haven't stolen anything. No frills doesn't mean that you pay for the carts, yes it's a quarter but it's the point. Why don't I pay their electricity bill too, or is that not built into the cost of products either. I don't shop at Food Basics or Farmer Jacks because obviously their management needs to understand what Operating Costs are!!
