His legacy: Teaching America's children that adultry is OK as long as you are President and it's done in the White House (even on the phone making important decisions for all Americans), it's Ok to lie if you are President. No morals at all. What a waste to the American people. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes on Judgement Day!!
