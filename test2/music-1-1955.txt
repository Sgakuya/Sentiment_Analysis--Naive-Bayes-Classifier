Please take this CDs high ranking with a grain of salt. If you click on the user names of the vast majority of positive reviews for this CD, you will find that A) most of them have not reviewed anything else on this site, and B) most of the reviews came on the same day. To me, this means that these ratings might be bogus / biased - either because the same person left all of the ratings, or because an Our Lady Peace fan club got a hold of this site. Buy at your own risk.
