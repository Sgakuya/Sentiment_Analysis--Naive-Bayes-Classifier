People who abominate the goo goo dolls are winners. Stop listening to the crap they write, becasue they are SELLOUTS, and a numbskulled band. All they are doing is killing rock n' roll and trying to be groovy by changing their music style from punk to the crap they write. Their hit songs are just plain commiserable and inadequate. I hate it when people say that their lyrics are consequential, because their lyics are crap about sex and drugs, common pop music subject matter. It is galling how people thing the goo goo dolls are great, when they are nothing more that part of the incommodious disco craze of the late 1990's and are a mediocre band that writes second-rate anthems. The Smashing Pumpkins have 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000X better lyrics, idiosyncrasy, vocalization, and overall sound. At least The Smashing Pumpkins can win 2 Grammy awards and the goo goo dolls can't. And The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan is magnificent, and a gifted musician. And at least he can play guitar better, sing better, is not a aficionado, and can transcribe better canticles. I can think of 50+ corroborations about how The Smashing Pumpkins are better than the goo goo dolls, but I will be cordial and not say them b/c it could hurt all of their annoying and repungent fans. Because of my saying this, listen to authentic and pragmatical music like The Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Madonna, Soundgarden, Led Zeppelin, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, or The Smashing Pumpkins. And I have a memorandum to adherents of the goo goo dolls: You liking this obnoxious and corrupt band must be some kind of agreemend with a treaty. I hope the US comes drilling into your head looking for oil, since brains are one thing they're sure to miss.
