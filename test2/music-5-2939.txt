If I could I would give it a 6. How can you say this album is over rated. Back in the USSR and Birthday are just two of the great songs on this CD. I actually own four copies of the White Album. Now side 2 of disk 2 is not quite up to par but there are some great songs on these disks and if you have not heard the album you should at least give it a listen. There are no bad Beatle CDs.
