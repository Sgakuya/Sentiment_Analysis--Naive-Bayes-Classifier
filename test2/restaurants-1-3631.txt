Order extra cheese..and voila..the same amount of cheese they normally wave over the top. Tasteless pizza. SPARCE ingredients. You'll be able to determine that a large black olive pizza, literally has ONE black olive on it..sliced up in 5 slices. Again, you order extra, and it's the same amount. Sauce is a salty disgusting mess. If this is what you want, spend 5 bucks on a frozen pizza, not 20 bucks on this slop.
