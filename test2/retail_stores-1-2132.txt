Radio Shack used to be such a great company. If you needed a part and couldn't find it locally, look in the RS catalog. Anymore, though, they don't carry nearly what they used to and the prices are extraordinarily high for what you get. The store itself seems to hire only salesmen who are there, true to nature, only to sell, regardless of whether they have a clue about what they are selling. I've visited 3 stores locally on several occassions over the past 5-10 years and have not once have I left happy with my experience there. Back when they still carried electrical components instead of RC cars and cheap casio keyboard knock-offs, I once applied to work there because I felt myself very knowledgable about their products and that I could be of great use to them. I actually walked out during the interview process because the interviewer was disappointed that I answered the question Would you ever lie to a customer if you didn't know about a particular feature but knew that you could make something up to get the sale?. My answer was heck no - I'd find the correct information for them. Apparently Radio Shack would have preferred that I had said that I would be willing to lie as long as I got the sale - looking up the correct information wastes company time. Oh my - how can you respect a company with that attitude? Stay far away from Radio Shack. And no - this isn't just a bitter shock statement ... that interview was 3-4 years ago, and that mentality has become more and more apparent to me each time I visit thier store.
