J.C. Watts is terrible. He lives in some sort of dream world- preaching on and on about personal responsibility while toeing the Republican party line on every single vote, destroying opportunity for normal people. The Republicans are losing their only African-American representative in either house of Congress, and it's unlikely they'll be able to find another one in the foreseeable future. Minorities saw right through the Republican National Convention in 2002- colorful faces on stage, destructive policies in practice. J.C. was there for the propaganda, but Bush Jr. got the lowest African-American share of the vote since Goldwater. Good riddance, J.C.!
