OK Computer is one of those albums that we will hear was way ahead of its time in a few years. This album is so layered that I swear every time I listen to it I discover something more to love about it. I have watched Radiohead evolve over the past few albums and saw them play at a small venue a few years ago but I really wish I could have seen them after this album, I bet it was an entirely different experience. I lent this CD to so many friends and they have all become big Radiohead fans as a result. What a great album.
