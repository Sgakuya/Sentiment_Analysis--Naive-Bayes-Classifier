OK - let's face it. Jason Williams is a media star for one reason. He is white. Could there really be any other explanation? This season, playing as a part time point guard (about 29 minutes per game), Williams managed 9 points, 5 assists per game - more often than not riding the bench for the fourth quarter. No one can argue that this is the statistical profile of a star of the NBA. (Travis Best, for example, a similarly flashy and similarly used guard for the Pacers managed 12 and 6 playing about 31 minutes per game). So why is Williams among the top 20 players on the RateItAll list and Best (rightfully) is not even listed? Because the media and Madison Avenue have decided that Williams' color of his skin makes him somehow more special than the Travis Bests, Terrel Brandons, Eric Snows of the world. IMHO - it's a load of crap. Williams does not have the game to receive the fame. Don't get me wrong - I don't blame Williams one bit - I blame the idiots, such as the majority of posters on this list, who are more dazzled by pointless behind the back passes, shaved heads, and tattoos than they are by basketball substance.
