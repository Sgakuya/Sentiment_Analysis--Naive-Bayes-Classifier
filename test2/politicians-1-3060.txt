A brilliant man who wasted his presidency. I do not like his political views but was a mover and shaker. However, his legacy is one of a philanderer who fiddled while we got burned. What a waste of talent and energy. We are now paying a stiff price for his neglect and bumbling of the Middle East. It is such a pity that a man with so much intelligence and ability wasted eight years. Could have been one of the best but will be remebered as the worst.
