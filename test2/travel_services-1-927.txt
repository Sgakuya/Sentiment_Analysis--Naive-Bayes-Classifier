Terrible customer service at the start of my rental, no instructions on how to operate/connect/disconnect equipment. The Truck had no features for a long trip, the steering wheel did not adjust, the mirrors were difficult to adjust and no cruise control for a 3100 mile drive. The car carrier was not inspected for tire wear adequately and I ended up with two tire blow outs on the same trip. The second left me on the side of an interstate in the early morning hours for over 7 hours with no help! Alot of excuses, but NO help. I was straned in the middle of the night for 7 hours due to the 24hr roadside assistant inadequate personnel manning the phones.
