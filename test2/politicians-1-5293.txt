I am so sick of hearing all of these politicians talk about social security!!!! I am paying into a system that will be bankrupt in about 30 years and no one is doing anything to save it. Why don't we do the math - about 45 people were paying into social security for every one person receiving it when it began. Within the next 10 years, there will be only 2 people paying into it for every one receiving. Oh....if only all of these millions of aborted babies since '73 could work...isn't it an irony. We would not have a social security madhouse! What we need is someone to come in and make some really logical, factual changes that will prosper our society instead of just a bunch of hot air like Gore. People do not need the government to take care of them...learn to make a living and provide for yourself. That is the only way to develop self esteem and truly feel at peace with your work life. If we are to vote in Gore....we will be in for the same 'ol...lest he find anything not a risky scheme.
