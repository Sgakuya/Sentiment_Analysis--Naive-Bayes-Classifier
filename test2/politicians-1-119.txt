He treated Diana like a step-child. He gets 1/2 a star out of me..because...truthfully..she let him. When she finally came to her senses, she died a few months later. She was a great person who was so in touch with us commoners. Any humanity Charles had, he got if from her. She is missed. He is a leech on the butt of the peoples of England. I think they need to burn him off! Had the audacity to rail aginst people who have gained much without hard work. The doofus didn't even know he was talking about himself. Is an avid polo player...but, what does that do for bettering the lives of commoners in Great Britain?
