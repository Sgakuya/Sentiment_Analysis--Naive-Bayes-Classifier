Bill Clinton is a draft-dodging, womanizing, rapist that has brought shame and scorn upon the office of the President. The trail of ruined lives and corpses behind him is chilling and I can not for the life of me understand how anyone could support him. He has continually proposed new government programs that suck tax dollars out of mine and your pockets and has re-introduced a Socialist attitude into this country. Doesn't anyone understand that this is a Capitalist society where people need to create moral and ethical companies that help people instead of relying on that fool to steal your tax dollars and create Government programs? That is ludicrous. I am certain you know how to better spend your money every week than that lying goal-digger does.
