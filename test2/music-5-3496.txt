Simon and Garfunkel's unique music is like bittersweet chocolate. Rich, their harmonies are as haunting as their lyrics. Very sing in the shouwer songs with unforgettable tunes is their mark. Some songs make me happy, some make me sad, but none make me annoyed. Very gentle but vigilant, like a beech tree.
