I don't like Best Buy. We bought a flat screen tv for christmas a couple years ago and didn't want the extended warranty, and after 4 months it broke and when we brought it in, they told us we didn't have an extended warranty, we told them it was still under original warantee and they sent it out and came back and told us it was previously opened, when it wasn't. So they told us that it would cost us like 400 to have it repaired.. when we only paid 250 for it. It was a total sham. They only will repair it if you have the extended warantee. We will never go back there, again. If it WAS opened, it was opened in the store, before we bought it.
