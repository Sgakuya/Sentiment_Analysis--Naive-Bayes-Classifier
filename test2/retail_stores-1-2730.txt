I work in the west windsor, nj depot and I can tell you this...it is the worst company to work for in this country! In the past 6 months they have removed ALL monetary incentives, including our meager Christmas bonus! Meanwhile, our butthead ceo has been placed in the top ten list for highest bonus of the year! That's right boys and girls, our ceo has given himself over 20 million dollars as an end of year bonus!
