 It truely is sad that people would vote this red neck into our white house. I would like him better if he worked more for our country and ran it like a president than let people run the country for him while he just stands at a podium and reads speechs he didn't write! I bet you he doesn't even know what he's talking about in those speechs. Oh well. A good number of people in my community had a campain for Bush and their main slogan was If you want to keep your guns vote for Bush. To me, I find that this is the perfect sumation of what bush stands for to most of the people in my town(and quit a few outside of it.) Something stinks and it's in the Bush's. What a dink.
