This president if you can even call him that would have drove this nation into poverty within another year if he had been re-elected! He was the worst president in the history of this country. How can you people vote him above president Bush? Atleast president Bush cares about the well-fair of the American people!!!!!! Do you people out there even remember that one of his last acts as president was pardoning killers, as well as other crimanls, because he was upset, and he wanted some last minute air space on CNN?!!!!!
