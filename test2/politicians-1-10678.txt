Watergate was just his highwater mark as a skunk. He got his start as a Red-baiting Cold Warrior who was first elected to Congress as a result of libeling his opponent. Later moved onto being a small time political grafter who got off the hook via his famed Checkers speech. Was very effective, working in concert with other crapbags like Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohn, in firing up public hysteria during that ridiculous and totally unnecessary Red Scare of the early 1950s. While VP, he stood around ghoulishly rubbing his hands together in succession anticipation when that other idiot, Ike, had his heart attack. Later as VP, insisted on engaging loudmouth Soviet imbecile N. Krushchev in a shouting match at a 1959 trade fair. The American public was spared this scumbag when Kennedy squeaked through in 1960, yet obviously didn't learn its lesson when it elected him in 1968 and then returned him to office by a resounding landslide in 1972. In this, the American public showed the world what an amalgam of touchholes, pinheads, troglodytes and douchewads it routinely is. While President, this birdbath didn't have a clue how to turn around a persistently sluggish economy, extended the very dubious Viet Nam war into Cambodia and Laos, ordered secret bombing raids over there that resulted in the deaths of countless innocent civilians, demonized those true American patriots who were against the Viet Nam fiasco, gave free reign to master criminal, paranoid snooper, noted drag queen and closet case, the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover, and achieved the very dubious accomplishment of opening detente with those vicious Red Chinese bastards. Quite a crappy record prior to that third-class burglary he attempted to cover up.
