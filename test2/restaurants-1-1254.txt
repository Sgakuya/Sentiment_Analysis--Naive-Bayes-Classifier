While visiting the arby's on tates creek road in lexington, ky last night I was sadly disapointed by the lack of service and incredible rudeness of the employees. (I understand that staff are not paid the big bucks, but there is no excuse for the treatment that we received. Before entering, there was an employee outside smoking, she said to be patient when we were inside, they were busy and she was going to take her break no matter what... When we entered, there was one other family in front of us. and a car in the drive through. (not overly busy as I could see..) The other employees were dismaid that this girl was taking a break when she did. Perhaps they were much busier than I could tell, It took over 20 Minutes for us to order and receive (most of) our food. When my father asked if he received a senior discount, they acted like he was stupid for asking. I was truly embarrassed for him!!! For a meal that cost over $28.00 we could have sat down at a non fast-food restaurant and enjoyed a leasurly meal. While we were eating, there were knats flying around us that we had to swat at Then, an employee came out to wash down all of the tables around us. The disinfectant that was sprayed liberally around on all of the tables filled the air. This added to this horrible meal experience. meanwhile, the employee that was on break came in and proceded to read hairy potter in the booth adjacent to us, braging about how she took her break even though she knew how busy they were. I might add that the kids that came in while we were ordering had no trouble asking for and receiving free food from their friend(s) behind the counter (while we were waiting for our order). I would like to add that I am not one to complain or make waves. I waited tables for many years while in college. I do think that you should be made aware of these points. I doubt that anything will be done about this, but I wanted you to be made aware of the situation. Thank you for your consideration Dale Randall 4633 Longbridge Lane Lexington, Kentucky 40515 n.randall@insightbb.com
