A huge let down from a band that sucks anyways. I sorta liked these guys when their original self titled c.d. was released and I was slowly converting from crap rock like Godsmack to music with more of a deptha nd overall creativity. At least on the first album the songs sounded a little different. On this album, each song is almost identical. The same vocals, the same guitar riffs, the same blah,blah, lyrics. Atleast with their first album they were pissed. This album they just seem to be whinning about how unfair the world is. The world really is unfair if you think about it. In a world were a band as intelligent,versitile,artistic and breakthrough as the Deftones has to open up for a radio friendly drone of modern rock like Godsmack, yeah, what this album is talking about makes sense. But it is also a sad reminder of how horrible the current music scene has become.
