Ill give them one thing, they know how to sale crap to people. By putting it right in the middle of the aisles and all over the floor. You trip over it and say Hey, I could use some of that crap. But dont try walking around in there because of this, cant get past the slow moving beast of people that go in there and work there. Dont ask the employees anything that might require them to think. They work at Walmart. Sure the prices are low, but at what expense? They bully their vendors, dont pay their employees a fair wage, and especially dont keep a tidy store which a person can enjoy shopping at. Good store, for me to poop on!
