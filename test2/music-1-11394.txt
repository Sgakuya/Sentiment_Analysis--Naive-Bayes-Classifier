J to tha Hoe is what the title should be. One man after another, and now Ben Afleck. The is what? Her third marriage. Funny how she can't get married until Jan 26th because she's not legally divorced from her dancer hubby until then, but she's engaged AGAIN, to be married in Feb two weeks after her divorce is final. What's the point? She's gonna be with someone else in 3 months after that? Maybe her next CD should be called I need to be married because I have low self esteem and I need a man to feel good about myself.
