After what happened Sunday, he deserves 1 star even though he's one of the top running backs in the game. But he's a selfish jerk. He finished 1 yard behind Curtis Martin for the lead in rushing yards and he said after the game that the coaches stabbed him in the back because they didn't give him in the ball and instead went with a QB sneak. What an ass. His team was trying to win a division and they thought a QB sneak was the best play at the time and all he cared about was leading the league in rushing. He would have prefered if they lost and he got the extra 2 yards he needed. I wouldn't want this jerk on my team.
