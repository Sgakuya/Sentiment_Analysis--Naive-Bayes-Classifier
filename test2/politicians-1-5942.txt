You people are kidding, right? I'm a democrat from Mass., not a republican, and even I am ashamed and embarassed by his personal life. A comparison to Laura Bush and the facts of Ted going off the bridge? He drove off a bridge with his pregnant girlfriend while out partying with her - as his wife slept at home. He then left her, alive - in the car while he went home and tried to convince someone else to say they were in the car instead of him. So as the Kennedys argued about how to handle it, she slowly drowned and they did nothing. At best he was drunk and paniced which caused his pregnant girlfriend to drown while the Kennedys 'managed' the story and then paid off her family. At worst, he killed her and is a murderer. I am ashamed of my state every time we vote him back in.
