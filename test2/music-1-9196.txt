OK, I like Britney and all that but there is such a thing as overexposure. Her latest video Overprotected is virtually indistinguishable from her previous videos. Same dance moves, same everything. Why does she keep releasing music videos one after the other without respite? It seems like only 5 seconds ago that I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet A Woman was first shown on MTV. Maybe she needs a break until she comes up with something new and fresh. Sorry Brit, I like you but frankly this music video bites.
