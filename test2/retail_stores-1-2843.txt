I happened upon all of this by complete accident while looking for Whitehall's website. My first thought was "Wow, other people having problems with Whitehall." Close on the heels of that thought was another: "If complaints are coming before the official website, something is seriously wrong." I took my engagement ring there a few years ago shortly after I received it to have it sized. The woman behind the counter promised it to me on that Saturday (it was a Monday when we dropped it off.) I called Saturday from work to make sure that it would be there when I got to the mall, as I would have to nearly break laws to make it to the mall before it closed. I was told that my ring was not there, and would not be there until Wednesday. After checking my reciept, I told the person on the phone that I was promised it by Saturday, and as they had screwed up and not fulfilled their end of the bargain, I expected them to decrease my fee for sizing my ring. Again, very nastily, I was told that they did not do that and I would be expected to pay the full price on Wednesday when I picked it up. Needless to say, I was not a happy camper. Apparently, I didn't learn the first time around, because I took them my wedding band to size last week. We decided on this so that in the event they lost their calanders or some stupid reason again, that there would still be plenty of time before the wedding for me to have my ring. Low and behold, the young man we dealt with was very nice and treated us like people, not nuisances. (Yes, we're 23, give us a break. Just because we don't walk around in $200 shoes and suits doesn't mean we can't buy jewelry.) I told him the story of what happened the last time we were in there, and I stared evilly at the one single person who has been there for as long as I can remember. They gave us a date, and we returned on that date. The ring was there, and it was sized. It was the wrong size. So this makes not once, but twice that these people can't get a simple task done right. At least this guy was very nice, he told me they weren't going to charge me for it because they screwed it up. I'm pleased about that, but I'm not pleased that I can't seem to get what I go in there for the first time around. I doubt I'll be back.
