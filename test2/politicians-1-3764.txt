George W.Bush is a good old boy that will lie to the American people just as his good old daddy did. Remember Read My Lips. It looks like George will do anything to win.Too bad you'll just be a lame duck president.It seems you don't want a recount because you know you will lose. Al Gore won the popular vote so he wins the hearts of America.
