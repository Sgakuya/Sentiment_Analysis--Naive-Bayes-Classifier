pbeavr, me thinks thou doth protest too much! Please! Has anybody watched his offenses? I mean, he is probably a very nice guy and all,, but he was a bad coordinator with NO head coaching experience. Let us see him win a game before we give him three stars. Want to bet he won't be there in three years? Carefull, if you take that bet neither of us will be allowed to coach at Washington. He certainly ain't his dad! Heck, Doug Williams would have been a better selection, at least he has been a successfull head coach in college, plus he won a Super Bowl as a player!
