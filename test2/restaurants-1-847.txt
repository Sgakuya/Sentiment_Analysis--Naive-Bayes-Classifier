My name is Sal,i'm italian, and i grew up in an italian neighborhood in the Bronx, NY. So, I grew up on very good quality italian sandwitches. I know good italian sandwitches cost a little more but it's well worth it. I just tried Subway's turkey & prolone because i was curious, and mamma mia, i nearly puked.The ''italian'' bread sucks it's more like a big hot dog bun, and the meat taste like crap and not freshly cut, i know it takes longer to slice good quality cold cuts, but good food is normally not fast. You're better off finding a good deli that uses boars head cold cuts or thurmans or more expensive italian imported meats (if you can afford it). And in about the same time it takes and subway, you can get a decent sub. But to each his own, maybe i've been spoiled by my italian heritage.
