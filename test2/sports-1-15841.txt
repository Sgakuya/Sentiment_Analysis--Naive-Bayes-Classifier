I would never do something like this, except everyone who can should send warren sapp emails and call his house and send letters telling him what a jerk he is on the field and off. He sexually abused watress staff this summer at the country club in Tampa, I know as I belong there, he pushed a little kid out of the way trying to get autographs at summer camp, and now his dirty playing on the field with dancing over a player hurt for life...he is a rotten person and dirty player who should be fined and suspended, but the coach encourages it....stupid player
