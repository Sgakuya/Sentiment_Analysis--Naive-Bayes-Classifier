What a dirty liar and hypocrite! The convention was the most sickening thing I have ever seen. He talks of being compassionate to gays, while the party votes vehemenent anti-gay policy into the platform. He talks of being compassionate to blacks, while picking a running mate who was in favor of South African apartheid. he talks of being compassionate to inmates at some Texas detention center, while he murders more people than any governor in the history of the country while state-sanctioned murder has been allowed. Compassion should never cross this evil, evil, mans lips!
