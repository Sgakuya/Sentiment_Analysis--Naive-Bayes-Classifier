My dad recently bought a diamond tennis braclet for my mother on their 25th wedding anniversary from Samuels for 400.00 so it should have been a quality piece. My mom wore it one day and it fell off and she lost it. Of course Samuels does nothing about this. Clearly their products are crap and not worth a penny of your money.
