Will inevitability go down in history as the most harmful entity to hold the office of President .I was extremely embarrassed to be a veteran.His total disregard of foreign policy ,his totally inept failure to make any decisions based on sound judgement for the future is simply appalling .Played dodge ball for 8 years ,left the office a shambles,tax and spend policies will haunt and degrade the middle class working for many years to come,not to mention his disregard of ethics and character.
