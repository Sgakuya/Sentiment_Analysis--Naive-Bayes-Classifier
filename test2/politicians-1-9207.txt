Jackson's era is often called the era of the common man, and indeed he tried to help the little guy. Unfortunetly, a lot of what he did led to recessions and actually hurt people. Not to mention the Trail of Tears and Indian removal. Of great note is that Jackson actually stomped all over the Constitution on that one: When the Indians in Mississippi appealed the move, chief justice upheld their right to live on ancestral land. Jackson said, Now let him enforce it! And ignoring the high court's interpretation of the law of the land, forced the Indians to move. No doube Jackson did some good things in office, but I still think he was one of the worst presidents ever.
