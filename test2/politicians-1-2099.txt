Here we have the next Michael Dukakis. He is a government loving automaton. People who call him a moderate have been mislead. He has positions on the environment and abortion which are pretty extremist. The electricity issue in California would be a non-issue today had Davis taken the leadership in California. He ignored the inflating deficit. When Republican Gov. Pete Wilson left the governorship in early 1999, there was an 8 billion dollar surplus; now under Gov. Davis, the deficit has ballooned to 18 BILLION dollars. The reason why? Because government spending went up 37 percent as a time when most other states kept spending in the single digits. That's only half the problem. The electricity deregulation problem also looms heavily over his head. When you deregulate the electricity industry, like any industry, you must release all price controls to spur outside investment. Gov. Davis does have a point that he did inherit the faulty deregulation program, but he was supposed to do something back in late 1999 when the problem became apparent. Always the commensurate politician, Davis decided that this was a hot potato and let the issue burn out; the only thing that burnt out was the electrical grid in California!! He was out fundraising and planning his run for the Presidency in 2004 while his empire burned. Davis found himself in a sinking vessel; he seeked to blame everyone for his lousy leadership, from the Texas energy companies that he received the majority of his funding from to the newly minted Bush White House, which had nothing to do with the deregulation scheme. Davis now has made a bad situation worse by making the state of California, already burdened with a skyrocketing deficit, pay for its own power. This is political expediency at its lowest! Now, Gray-Out Davis is running for re-election against Bill Simon, a political neophyte who happens to be conservative. Davis, instead of debating issues that matter in the long-run, keeps pointing out Mr. Simon's position on abortion, which is pro-life. Firstly, it's irrelevant, as much as Simon dislikes abortion, he can't do much about it because Roe v. Wade took away abortion as a state issue and turned it into Federal Law. This is merely a farce propigated by the Davis political team to turn the spotlight off of his pitiful performance as governor. If the voters of California re-elect this bumbler back to office, then they deserve rolling blackouts and a state government which is the basketcase of the rest of the country.
