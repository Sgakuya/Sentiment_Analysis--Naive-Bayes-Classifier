I hate Avril. Such an Anti-Britney, Britney could sing and write her own music. Avril can't. I mean couldn't at least write one measly song. Britney wrote EVERY song on her own album. And I saw Avril live. She lipsyncs. I saw Britney live two years ago, not one lipsync out of her. So which leads me to my final conclusion. Avril rocks! You go girl, from Jorgan Von Stingle.
