I am a current worker of JC Penney and have been for 3 years. It is the most horrible place to work. The customers that enter the store are horrific and rude. And the management bends over backwards to help those customers that harrass and return items that shouldn't be returned. In the end, JC Penney will put itself out of business because of it's poor managment and overstock of returns. Bankrpcy is approaching!!!!!!!!!!
