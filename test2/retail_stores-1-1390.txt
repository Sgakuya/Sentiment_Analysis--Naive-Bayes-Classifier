I don't have a Target near me but I have been there twice before. My main concern with the store is that they have plenty of registers to use but only open up 2 of them with lines that were going out into the aisle. A young employees asked the supervisor if they wanted him to open up and they told him in a nasty voice, "No go back to the electronics department with stocking!" I don't really have many opportunities to shop here but if i did I wouldn't anyway.
