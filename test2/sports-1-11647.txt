Mr. Pinkel has treated his players quite unfairly. In fact, his #1 running back quit the team he was so mad, and Pinkel doesn't let his #1 quarter back run free. He tries to make him a drop-back passer! Well, Mr. Pinkel simply instills such anger in his players and fans that a crazed fan attacked a Husker player.
