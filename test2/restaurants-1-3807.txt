I had a terrible experience at Chuckie Cheese's in Killeen, TX.on the evening of Dec.4,2004. 1. I am 60 years old and because of my background I did not want to be stamped as I considered it tatooing and labeling. I did not feel I should have to have a sticker either which is a tag. I have never had this happen at any other Chuckie Cheese restaurant in other cities only here. I fee they should insist that old people go through process. Think about it and you history Jewish people are offended having to be tatooed and black people cannot accept labels. I hate the treatment I received Dec.4 and I hope you give instructions to worker to not to force that issue if people have problems with markings. This policy can bring up old hurtful memories. Please stop requiring adults to be stamped or taged if they say no. I sure would like a letter that I can show the worker here so I can go to your restaurant and enjoy a wonderful Pizza. Thank you for your time.ML Turner-Grubb.
