Mr. Forbes 1 (referring to himself, and himself only) thought that a flat tax across the board would be beneficial to Americans of all stripes. Frankly, I have a hard time convincing myself that a man who was surrounded by wealth, status and privilege his entire life could even BEGIN to relate to the average Joe Schlub who either: works 1 or more jobs to maintain a decent standard of living (and everyone has varying concepts of what a decent standard of living is), is unemployed due to physical/emotional disabilities/hardships, is unemployed due to corporate and small-business downsizing, or is over-qualified for a job/career that (s)he desires. His paean that everyone working would contribute the same percent of earnings is disingenuous and vague at best. The Forbes 400 magazines only serve to highlight a standard of living that has been indoctrinated into the citizens of this nation: simply, rich is better, and if you're poor, well, too bad. This nation of ours is no level playing field. Certain people have positions of wealth and power that have been attained in several ways: inheritance from families from pre-Taft-Hartley days (Vanderbilts, Mellons, Morgans, Goulds, Stanfords, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, etc.), unscrupulous business dealings and intimidation of others to capitalize on peoples' fears and insecurities (Kennedys, the Mafia, Hearsts, Gettys, Gates's, etc.), government handouts and buyouts for big business---also known as corporate welfare (Bushes in oil, Turner in media enterprises, etc.), as well as the little people we elect to positions in government and law (who, eventually, become big people and forget their roots---people such as Tom Foley. Dan Rostenkowski. Richard Nixon. Spiro Agnew. Bill Clinton (from time to time). Bill Paxon. Newt Gingrich. Trent Lott. Carol Moseley-Braun. Pete Wilson. Tony Coelho. Connie Mack III. Dick Morris. Bernie Nussbaum. Colin Powell. Robert Torricelli. Bill Richardson. Bob Barr. Ron Brown. Jesse Jackson. Chuck Robb. Rudy Giuliani. The list seems endless. We are NOT a classless nation. Malcolm Steve Forbes underscores this. Forbes, like most rich, well-to-do, have scanty knowledge of what noblesse oblige represents. The wealthy of this nation should turn over their profits to others for a time so that there may be a true sharing of the wealth, as Huey Long, the well-meaning demagogue from Louisiana, so eloquently argued. Then the U.S. will become a level playing field for all people, and not just white, wealthy sorts like Forbes.
