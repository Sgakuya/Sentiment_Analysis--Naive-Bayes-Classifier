Ricky Martin's new album Sound Loaded is even better than the original English CD in my opinion. It is so much fun and has an amazing amount of talented musicians on it. The sound is so different from everything out there. I get tired of the same old thing -- copycat groups and the same type of songs. When Ricky comes on the radio I ALWAYS turn it up and I can't help but move and smile when it's playing. He's at his best live in concert, which I'm happy to say I've seen a few times already. I'll continue to attend them, as they are the best I've ever experienced. Sound Loaded is the perfect title for this CD, as it has so many different styles and sounds. There is something for everyone, and everything on here is MY style. I love it!
