I first heard this CD and could not stop talking about it. So, when Christmas rolled around, I was given this CD as a gift. I think that it is a great CD. He has various and numerous amounts of song artists. Dr. Dre was not discriminatory and put a lot of work. He definitely showed his strength and ability with the release and success of this CD!!!!! Buy it!!!!
