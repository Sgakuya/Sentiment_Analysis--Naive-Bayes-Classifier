Possibly the second-worst President ever, he is in the class of Nixon and G. W. Bush. Reagan destroyed the economy, and he did not end the Cold War. Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the sweeping reforms which ended Communism in the Soviet Union. Reagan also participated in illegal exchanges with Iran (the Iran-Contra Scandal). Everyone worships Ronald Reagan like he is some kind of god. He isn't. He is also definitely not in the class of presidents like Franklin Roosevelt. Historians will not consider him a great president.
