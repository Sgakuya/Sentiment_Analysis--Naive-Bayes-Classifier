This beautiful song is inspirational. I plan to buy 10 copies and request that when god takes me from this earth that my children play this song at my funeral and I hope that they fuly realize it's meaning. Time is always to short. So say what you need to while there is still time. To my husband (Rick), my kids (Marissa Ricky), my grandmother and my parents I will love you every day of my life.
