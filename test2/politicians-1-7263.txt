Mr. Jackson is a political hack, not a Reverend. His recent propaganda tactics have only contributed to the awakening of a sleeping Republican giant. If he continues to insist on creating a confrontational situation because he is not satisfied with a George W. Bush presidency; he may be surprised to find a VERY REAL confrontation that he did not want or expect. His rhetoric belongs to an age long past. The wheel has turned, and it's time for him to go.
