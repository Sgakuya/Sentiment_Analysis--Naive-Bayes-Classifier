The new airport is poorly signed, shortstaffed and confusing. They seemed to have spent moe mony on making it look modern (ie: plasma screen schedule displays) than on actual layout. When I got off my flight, there was a sign saying 'Baggage claim that pointed left directly into a dead end hall. The baggage claim was about 50 meters up the main hall, then left. I don't know if this issues have been resolved as of yet, but while talking to a staff member he told me that they had recieved thousands of complaintsabout the new signage and layout in the first few weeks of it.
