There's no hiding it now--Abbas hasn't changed from when he wrote his Holocaust-denying PhD dissertation, and is not willing to comply with the Quartet's 'Road Map'--as just 2 days ago, he came to agreement with Hamas and Islamic Jihad that they will not be disarmed, and a few days before he publicly praised the Gaza 'martyrs' (code for homicide bombers) for their 'patience.' So there it is, not even any longer pretending to be a peacemaker, yet still the US supports him.
