Do I even need to explain the rating. He is the leader in the Republican's war on the poor--so noted by the last minute provisions in the tax cut. His references to religion are appalling. Preemptive strike is the politically accepted term for Christian persecution. How can you be pro-life when it comes to abortion, yet willing to sacrifice innocent lives for unjustified war. They, or should I say we, will all pay dearly for this horrible offense. I can't judge his character because obviously I don't know him personally, but his policies swing too far to the right to benefit the common folk that are the majority of the nation's population. I fear that it will take his re-election just to show all of his mindless followers how destructive his reign is. Hopefully after Bush is done destroying the country, they will cease to blame Clinton for all of Bush's atrocities...really, it's old now, guys.
