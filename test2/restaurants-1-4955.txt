Well I had never eaten at a OG until today and personally I thought it was way over rated. The service was lousy and there was not enough food on the plate to fill up a baby. I paid 14.00 for a salad and a glass of tea. I would not recommend this Restaurant to any one. We had a party of 9 and our wait for our food was 1 1/2 hours. Way too long for a lunch especially when you arrive when the doors open. I would rather spend my money at Harvey's Rest. or Peppers any day. Much better food, service and the price is much more in line with the food that you order. Waste your time and money if you need but you have been informed about the Tupelo, Ms. store.
