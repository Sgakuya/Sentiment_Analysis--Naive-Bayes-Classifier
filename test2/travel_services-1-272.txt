Horrible lines at the airports for check-in, even at curb side. Flight schedules are often changed or not on time. Rude employees (I've actually watched flight attendants toss the brown bags that they call food into passenger's laps as they go quickly up the isle with the cart. More room? NO! Crowded and dirty. First Class is not much better - Rude stewards, dirty bathrooms and seats, lousey and minimal food (just try getting water out of these people), uncomfortable seats. I fly American ONLY when it's the absolutely only flight I can find. Their pricing is very good....but so are other airlines.
