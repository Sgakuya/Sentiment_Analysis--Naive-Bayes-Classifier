When I bought this I didn't expect to be so blown away, but it is IRRISITABLE! The heartache of songs like Hearts of stone Loose Ends and Born in the USA (like I swear you've NEVER heard it before, slower and very haunting) as well as the fun pace of Pink Cadillac Rendezvous , and I wanna Be with you just bring down the house! Even though it's NOT the greatest Bruce album ever, it is still SUPER! I know that may sound like a contradiction to some, but it's amazing! You'll love it!
