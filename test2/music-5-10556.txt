I bought this CD by the way as a Christmas gift for my sister who is a HUGE fan of Ricky Martin.I've myself never minded for him at all,never been a really fan of his till now.I am more in that kind of Enya music and thought Ricky's artistic expression is more for teenage girls and boys who want to spend great dancing night in discoes.But this album is a very good mixture of his best english songs and here I come,Ricky Martin,in me you have a new,devoted fan.
