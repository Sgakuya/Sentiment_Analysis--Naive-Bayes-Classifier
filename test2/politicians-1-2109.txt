It sounds to me that Rush Limbaugh has nominated Gray Davis as his new politician to pick on. (With good reason). If Gray Davis can't or won't do the job, then why doesn't he step down and let someone into that office that can do the job. He should stop blaming Bush for his own mistakes and sart working on fixing California's problems.
