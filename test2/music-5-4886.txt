 One Voice has so much meaning. Even though Billy wanted to base it on the number of school shootings and such, in the One Voice video, it was so much more. It had scenes of a couple fighting, and scenes of a child being bullied by others. It made me cry when I saw it. It's just too bad that everyone isn't like Billy, who wanted to acheive peace by doing his video. One Dream can Change the World. That's one of the lines in One Voice. Never have words been so true. Good job Billy, Keep it Up!
