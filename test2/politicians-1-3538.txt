I am ashamed to be an American with this INCOMPETENT, IGNORANT, REACTIONARY PUPPET in residence at Pennsylvania Avenue. Rant #1: Separation of church and state. Does it require an IQ in excess of 91 to understand this basic premise?? Obviously it does, as we know our leader stands firm at 91. Our country was founded on the basis of religious freedom, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO BE FREE OF RELIGION!! Rant #2: Environmental nightmare in progress. His record speaks for itself. Houston has bragging rights to the worst air pollution in the nation. Rape of Alaska, etc. (need I go on??). Now we have to hear this buffoon take credit for hydrogen powered cars. Of course, the bonehead doesn't reveal that Mercedes Benz has been SPENDING MILLIONS since 1987 developing fuel cells for automobiles which will hopefully be economically feasible within the next 3-5 years. Don't let the chucklehead fool you - he has the environmental awareness of a small-sized soap dish. Rant #3. NU-KYA-LER. OK, I admit when I was in grade school, I may have slipped and said something equivalent, and the teacher would patiently correct me in my pronunciation. THIS GUY IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE FRIGGIN PRESIDENT. GET A SPEECH THERAPIST! Rant #4. I just don't see eye-to-eye with this guy on ANY TOPIC. I count the days to the next election in great anticipation of SHRUB-FREE in '04
