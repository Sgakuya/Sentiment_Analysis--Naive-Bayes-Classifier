I give this album a bad rating not because of the quality of music. U2 is phenomanal in every way and every song is golden. I am just so very much against best of albums. If I were to become an overnight sensation I'd have my first album named Best of (whatever my band name is). If you like the band as much as you should, buy the actual albums.
