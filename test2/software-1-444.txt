I wish we could use negative numbers to rate Windows ME. Mine will sometimes lock up as it is booting up, will sometime lock up when it is shutting down, will sometimes lock up during normal use even when the RAM is not getting over-used, doesn't accept adding or removing of applications very well, rarely displays the task manager box when pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL once (like it's supposed to), will not always restart when pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL 3 times (like it's supposed to), and is sometimes slower in everyday performance than older computers with Win98 or even Win95. The only reason I switched from Mac to Windows was because--at the time--Mac was about to go down the toilet. My first Windows computer had Win98, and I was happy with it. When it was hit by lightning, I had to get a new computer. My next computer had WinME, and I get so frustrated with it that I have *seriously* started considering getting the new Apple iMac (now that Apple has redeemed itself in the computer industry). It's more expensive, but it might be worth it. With my current computer having WinME--and being around 2 years old anyway--it probably has little or no re-sale value. Microsoft really turned me off to Windows-based computers; at least Apple seems to care about their products and their customers. You remember the virus that was used to take out the mothership in the movie Independence Day? I'm pretty sure that Windows Millenium Edition was the virus that blew up that ship. UPDATE: I did buy the new 17 Apple iMac with OS-X operating system, and I love it. The computer itself is elegantly and conveniently built, and the operating system is nearly flawless.
