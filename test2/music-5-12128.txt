I like Ashanti's new album,it's her best album yet. Although, I like all her albums, Foolish, Chapter 2, and Concrete Rose especially. Ashanti really did her thing on Concrete Rose, the songs are right on point, the beats are rockin' and the album is just amazing. Ashanti out did her self on this one and I cant WAIT what she got instored for her 4th album. Good Job Ashanti.
