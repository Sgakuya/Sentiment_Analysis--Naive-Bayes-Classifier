I became a Roman Catholic 47 years ago when I was 19. I am very active in my Church. I am thankful that the people that I knew back then were not at all like Alan Keyes. I do not agree with Alan Dershowitz's skepticism about God but I find that he is a much more honest man than is Mr. Keyes. Mr. Keyes uses his religion to try to dominate others and make money. This is profane.
