The pizza business is very competitive. Other than the niche CPK filled this place is a joke. If your town has crappy pizza then this place may work. Or if you gave up pizza because you felt guilty then perhaps you will like CPK. Pizza here intentionally sucks. The great state of California should sue this business for damages of libel.
