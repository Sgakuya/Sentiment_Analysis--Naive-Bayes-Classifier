As a huge Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt fan, it took me a while to fully appreciate Wilco -- I mean, I bought and enjoyed 'Summer Teeth' and 'Being There', and certain songs from those records really moved me on first listen, but I never got the visceral thrill I did from UT or SV. It's probably in part because I've been prepped by the previous Wilco albums, but Yankee Hotel Foxtrot really blew me away from the moment I first heard it. It still doesn't kick me in the stomach through and through the way a more straightforward rocking album might, but it's so interesting and complex, with such a compelling mix of intellect and emotion in the songs, it's just a beautiful album. Oh, and see the movie I Am Trying to Break Your Heart . It's a well done documentary and an insightful look into parts of how the record came to be.
