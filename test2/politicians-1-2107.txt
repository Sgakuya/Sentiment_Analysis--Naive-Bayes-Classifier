I'm more than a little fed up. I'm tired of listening to our useless excuse for a Governor try to blame President Bush for California's problems. I just heard on KFBK that Gray Davis has received more money in campaign contributions from the Texas energy companies over the last two years than any other California politician. I find it disgusting that he tries to pin the blame for his own failures on the President, claiming that the President is in the pocket of Texas energy companies, while he's been busy lining his own pockets with money from the same source. Gray Davis has known that this crisis was coming for nigh on to two years. He's done nothing! He's been so afraid to do anything controversial, for fear he'd hurt his prospects for a run at the presidency in 2004, that he's dithered this state into crisis. I've also heard that we have enough generating capacity within this state to get us through this crisis, however, our own state laws will not allow this generating capacity to be used, for environmental reasons. That is garbage. I don't wish to pollute any more than we have to, but we're in a crisis. Let's use all the capacity we have now, while at the same time working on a long range plan to develop enough clean power within the state to prevent such a crisis in the future. Price caps will not encourage anyone to invest in California power generation. I've also heard that one of the main reasons some of these evil Texas energy companies charge so much per kilowatt hour, is again, our own California State environmental laws. These companies charge as much as they do after a certain point because they are using older generating plants, and they have to pay fines for exceeding a certain pollution level. When they sell power from these plants they jack the price per KW hour up to pay the fines they have to pay the state. I find it hard to accept Gray Davis' complaints on the price of power when a large cause of high prices is the Democratic Party's love affair with the ecology lobby. California authored it's own energy problems, and Gray-out Davis has been fiddling while Sacramento burns.
