Well it has been years, unfortunately, since we have boughten our diamond at Whitehall. Just having the ring reappraised, and brought to a REAL jeweler, come to find out the diamond is fractured, just what I wanted to hear!!!!!! Also it was set incorrectly with the wrong head to hold the thing in place. How disappointing!!!!! On their website they say they have a lifetime return policy on all diamond and gemstones, I wonder if this will hold true for the piece of c*** they sold us!!!!!! AND NOT CHEAPLY EITHER!!!! P
