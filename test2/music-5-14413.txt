This is one of those rare albums where all the tracks fit together (anyone who's listened to any other 'show'-tunes album will know exactly what I mean by this). These songs induce goose-bumps with their association with one of the most important and powerful episodes of any television show I've ever seen. No Buffy fan should be without it - anyone else will be totally clueless.
