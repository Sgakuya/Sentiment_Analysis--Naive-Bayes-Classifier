For the love of God, DO NOT USE THEM. They showed up for our move more than two hours late and worked very slowly. One guy barely left the truck - he was arranging it - so we had to help the other guy move everything. They were slow, unpleasant and rude. They ruined one of our night tables by putting tape directly on the surface. (We might have noticed, but we were too busy moving stuff.) The claims department is ridiculous and miserable to work with, especially Curtis Enay. He was very rude, did not care about our situation and is a complete a--hole. After this experience, we wished we had not hired movers and just did it all ourselves.
