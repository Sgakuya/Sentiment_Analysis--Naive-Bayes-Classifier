I feel really sorry for some people here who rate the artist and they even don't know his best and the most famous songs.How can they rate then his album The Best of Ricky Martin ? The album is the proof that Ricky Martin has achevied in his huge artistic time span/18 years/the planty of high quality music and he could easily fill at least three albums with it,not just two. Great work from one of the greatest artist of our time!
