UPDATE: My original rating on Internet Explorer was four stars, but now I'm dropping down to one. I just heard some disturbing information about it on the news, and I believe it's potentially dangerous to use. It leaves the computer open to hackers (and all sorts of things worse than viruses and worms), and can eventually destroy everything on the computer before the user even knows what's going on. And once its been destroyed, there is no way to fix it. Plus, Internet Explorer has been bugging me with endless pop-ups, even though I had them blocked. I don't know about anyone else, but I do not recommend Internet Explorer. I have switched to a different browser, and I have found that not only is it much faster than IE, but I get crisper and sharper images and I have not been having problems with pop-ups.
