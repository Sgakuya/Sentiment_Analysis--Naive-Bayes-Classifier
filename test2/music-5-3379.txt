This album represents an achievement of the highest order. Its greatness lies not in a single seminal song or a memorable riff (although it has both), but rather in a perfect realization of the seamlessness of life.....This album is 30 years old, but has been a hit with every generation from the late-boomers to Generation Z - because it resonates, rings true, and sounds ever-fresh!
