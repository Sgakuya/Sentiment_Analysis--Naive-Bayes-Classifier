Gilman is a very inspirational artist, espescially to me as a teenager, as he has proven that dreams can indeed come true. One Voice was an awesome depiction of modern society and the everyday miracles that come in forms unknown to us. Oklahoma was also a very good song. Even people I know who don't listen to country music normally bought this album. I'm waiting for his next album! God bless you Billy!
