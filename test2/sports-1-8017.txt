he's nothing but an average punk who would be in jail if he wasn't in the NBA. He publicly admits he doesn't practice in the worst press conference i have ever seen, he is an embarassment to his team and the league. Takes 40 shots a game, but as long as he gets his 25 to 30 points, that's all that matters to him. I hope he never dawns a Celtics jersey, i hope the next time he does something deserving of jail time, which we shouldn't have to wait long for, he gets the time he deserves.
