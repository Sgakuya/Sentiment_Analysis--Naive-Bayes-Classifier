SexyCramer, ExpressJeans and Vicky5(along with a few other names) are the same person. Does anyone notice this? I doubt that she/he's ever even heard a Beatle album, he/she/it is too busy listening to the BeeGees. Check out their other posts. Don't let the comments get to you - this person is obviously frustrated by the Beatles overshadowing their favorite group. Great album by the way.
