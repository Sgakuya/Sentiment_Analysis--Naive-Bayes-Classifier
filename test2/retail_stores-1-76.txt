Be careful! Prices are deceptive. I was in there today to purchase a book as a gift. The sticker price said $35, but was partially peeled back. Under the Borders sticker was the publishers list proce of $19.95 (I subsequentially purchased the same book for $13.50)! I will NEVER go back after that obviousy deceptive move.
