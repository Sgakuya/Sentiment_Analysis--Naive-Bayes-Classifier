AAAAh, what fond memories I have of this soundtrack. I was a Grease fanatic from the first time I saw it (I think I was 8 and saw it in Cape Cod at the drive-in..it was a double feature along with Urban Cowboy, thus my crush on John Travolta was born). Anyway, I fondly remember putting that 8 track into the 8 track player and singing every single song at the top of my lungs. I would put on some tight fitting clothing, ask my mom for chewing gum (Sandy was chewing gum in that last scene) and strut around on the sofa (pretending I was walking through the fun house) and sing you're the one that I want, you are the one I want ooo ooo oo.
