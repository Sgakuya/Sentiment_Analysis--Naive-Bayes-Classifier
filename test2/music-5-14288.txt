Okay so my last comments weren't very helpful, so I'll try and be specific. The Forrest Gump soundtrack is one in a million, it's rare when soundtracks are good from start to finish, this one achieves not only songs that generate enjoyment, reflection on years gone by, and the pleasure of music. If you like the music of years gone by, then I recommend that you pick up a copy.
