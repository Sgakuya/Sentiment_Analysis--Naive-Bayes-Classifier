I have been able to see him at 3 concerts, at numerous tapings and got the chance to meet him at Jimmy Kimmel. Clay is just as personable in person as he is on TV or at his concerts. I have met numerous friends and developed friendships by being a fan of his. Finally able to find a singer who my 9 yr can listen to and not have to worry about her hearing anything offensive or obscene. At last someone who takes being a celebrity and role model seriously and realizes that kids look up to them.
