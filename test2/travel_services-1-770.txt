I will never use Payless again. Had a guaranteed reservation-late night arrival for a funeral. Arrived to find they had rented my car away & did not offer help in arranging other means of transportation. Even though I had paperwork stating they were in the wrong. Not helpful, and obviously rent to a higher bidder when opportunity presents itself. NO THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
