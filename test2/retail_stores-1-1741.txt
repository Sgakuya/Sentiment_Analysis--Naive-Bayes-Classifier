I found it very very hard to get online and and very slow but my biggest complant is the customer service is very hard headed and rude when I went to cancel I know this company is AOL and my I feel the same way about them. They charge me 50.00 dollars to cancel my account with aol even thow I did it with in 30 day. Every time I called I talked to some one who sounded like they could not take no for an answer please avoid them if possible
