Plain and simple, Maxine Waters is one of the most divisive politicians ever. Instead of trying to promote personal responsibility and self-determination, she's continued to rant and point fingers at others (especially those who have worked hard to be successful- yet with lesser means at the beginning than those she continually defends), making stupid excuses for those who grotesquely ignore or evade the law for their own selfish purpose. Waters should condemn these wrongdoers, but she is either too stupid or too blind to do so.
