A complete disgrace to our great nation. He's totally off of his rocker by comparing the actions of American leaders to Pol Pot and Hitler and the actions of American soldiers to that of the Gestapo and the killers in Cambodia. Exactly when has a prisoner of ours been executed? And, did the Jews get orange chicken and a rabbi before being led off to be gassed. This goofball, who doesn't realize he's fueling evil abroad, should not only be made to apologized, he should be forced to resign in disgrace. This is the 2nd most powerful Democrat in the Senate--basically calling America a new Nazi regime. Simply digraceful.
