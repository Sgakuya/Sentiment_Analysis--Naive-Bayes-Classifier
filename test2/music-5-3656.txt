I constantly have Ripple stuck in my head. This masterwork by the Dead contains some of their most classic tunes: Ripple, Bot of Rain, Suger Magnolia, Friend of the Devil, etc. For anyone who wants an intro to the Dead, but is intimidated by their tripped out live stuff, American Beauty is mellow, accoustic, and just beautiful overall. A must have for any music fan.
