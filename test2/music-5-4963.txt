This song is so true. Everytime I hear this song on CMT (country music station) I have to turn it up as loud as my TV goes. I get chills listening to it... because the words in this song are so true in my life, and I'm sure in other peoples. Billy Gilman is extrememly gifted. At the age of 7 being able to sing like that, I wonder how big he will be in 10 years or so.
