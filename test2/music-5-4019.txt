Bella Donna is a great record. Stevie Nicks proved that she could be a successful solo artist and she proved that she loved Fleetwood Mac by staying with them after it. Bella Donna had it's rock songs with Edge of Seventeen and it's love songs with Leather and Lace/Don Henley and Stop Dragging My Heart Around/Tom Petty. All around a good album.
