Quite possibly the biggest hypocrite to get the presidency. Two cases in point: War on drugs, and modern day Jim Crow (against the 18-20 year group). Ideally a true conservative would have an ideology similar to Goldwater's: that is, reduce government functions except for the military. Reagan claimed to cut down government, yet he helped kidnap (aka. imprison) people who grow certain plants (aka. marijuana). He also went completely against any states rights by forcing the states to raise the drinking age. The untold pain caused by this president's action (along with the evil Elizabeth Dole) completely defines him as one of the worst presidents. Oh yeah, did I mention Iran-Contra? Or the fact that he divorced his first wife (Ah, good old GOP family values.)
