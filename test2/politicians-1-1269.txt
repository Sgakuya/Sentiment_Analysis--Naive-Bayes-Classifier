Why is this man still in power? The U.S.S.R. has been insolvent for a decade. Kennedy made the promise not to invade Cuba to the Soviet Union, and since that nation is no longer in existance, the deal is not applicable, and thus, there is no reason for us to tolerate this man any longer. However, I agree with X-D: Castro will be dead soon, and when he finally croaks, the United States should assist Cuba in developing a representative government.
