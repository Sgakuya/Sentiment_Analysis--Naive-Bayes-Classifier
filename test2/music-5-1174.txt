My first impression of this CD was that it was a very, very good album, but not their best. However, as the months have gone by, I am starting to realize that this may be their best effort to date - I mean it is a real masterpiece. From "She's a Jar," to "Via Chicago," to "How do you fight loneliness" - these are pop songs with an edge. As with everything that Tweedy has done, Summer Teeth is an album that you can play from beginning to end, and notice new things, new sounds, new words each time you play it. Highly recommended - and totally different from Being There.
