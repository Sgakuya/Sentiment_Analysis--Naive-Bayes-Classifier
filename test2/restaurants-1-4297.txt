IMHO, this concept is missing a vital ingredient - quality in the kitchen. We've eaten an three different MacGrills in the Denver Metro area and my wife has been sick every time. Is MacGrill's idea of a chef a high school kid who is taught to follow a corporate recipie. Please, you're better off at home, with a good Italian cookbook.
