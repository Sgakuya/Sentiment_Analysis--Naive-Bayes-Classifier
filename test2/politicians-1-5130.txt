The man has clearly shown he is unstable and has some psychological issues to deal with. The idea of this man as President is like something out of Omen III. Even if he feels he is right in the joke of litigation he has perpetrated, he should have had the decency to get out before he became a laughing stock. Those who still support him need to look at themselves and there own value system. It's very lacking isn't it? Right. Lie to yourself.
