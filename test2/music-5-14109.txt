The Bedroom Tapes, got its name because much of it was recorded in Ben Taylor's old bedroom and the play barn at Carlys home on Marthyr's Vineyard (Ben being one of her two children from when she was married to the singer/songwriter James Taylor). It is her most personal and intimate recording to date, and includes a song called Scar which is all about her fight with breast cancer. At least three more of the tracks are related to the illness and the depression that resulted from it. That being said it is not an album that will make you feel depressed listening to it! Quite the contrary in fact. Carly often writes her songs reflecting personal experiences, so that she can get them off her chest and view them in the third person. The first track on this eleven track album is called Our affair which you will find a remixed version of on the soundtrack for the film Bounce. Carly has not lost any of her magic, and if you liked any of her previous albums, you will certainly not be disapointed in this one.
