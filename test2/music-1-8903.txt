This really, really, really stinks. Pink is a winy little snob. Even the sound of the music is winy. The lyrics are even winier. All what she does is wine about all her personal problems. It's just downright depressing. A lot of critics call rock music depressing, but this stuff takes the cake. She has definitely made it...by mass marketing her problems to the world.
