JIMI HENDRIX IS GOD. And this album is absolute genious. There is not ONE song that is not perfect-well written, well sung, well performed-simply perfect in everyway imaginable. From the amazingly beautiful 'The Wind Cries Mary' to the energetic and equally amazing 'Fire'. His heartfelt 'Manic Depression' along with his song about drug dependancy Purple Haze' makes Are You Experienced an exceedingly personal as well as emotional record. The guitar rifts are stunning, the beats, the rhythms, EVERYTHING is stunning. This is my favorite classic album, along with Axis: Bold as Love (another Hendrix classic) and Stevie Wonder's songs in the key of life. Go out and listen to this. There is no human way that you can't fall in Love.
