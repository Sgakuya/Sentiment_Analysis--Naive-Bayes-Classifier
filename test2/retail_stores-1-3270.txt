this weekend we took movies out at the Blockbuster in middle river maryland and we had a snow storm that the snow total was a record for the state of maryland in some areas it was at least 3 feet deep and the governor but out a state of emergency schools and businesses are closed all week and blockbuster has the nerve to call and say they are charging late fees on our two movies that we return today. I can not believe that any store would have the nerve to cahrge customers late fees when they can not get out on the side streets.We were lucky we got out on Thursday and the first place we went was blockbuster
