I didn't think anything these girls could come up with to follow their premier album could beat it, which in itself would have been quite remarkable for a debut group. 'Fly', however, shocked me. Both its feminist attitude and in your face tone should pick up a few non-traditional ears-particularly the country twang sap be moaners. Warning though-we may all wish to kill wife beaters like Earl, it isn't practically recommended.
