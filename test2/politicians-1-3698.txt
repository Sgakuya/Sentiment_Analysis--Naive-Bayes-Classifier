Dubya and his radical right wing crazies have managed to steal the election this time but God help them now. When is the Right wing going to understand that the white, middle/upper class male is the MINORITY in our country?! The 2002 Congressonal elections and 2004 presidential election are going to be sweet triumphs for all those who were disenfrnachised by the Republican's, Supreme court, and Bush family's underhanded, evil theft of this election. No Bush-league president for me!
