I was actually a good Besy Buy customer and then they mislead me. I purchased a cell phone and they encouraged me to get a 2 year Gurantee. They told me that if anything broke on the phone they would replace it. The screen broke and they refused to fix it. They said the warantee was only good if the connection of the phone wouldn't work. I talked to the one of the mangers and he didn't seem to care about the situation. I will never go there again.
