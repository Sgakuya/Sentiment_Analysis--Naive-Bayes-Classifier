I first got this on Vinyl back in 1972, and then I realized that, for the longest time, B. B. King and his orchestra would do this show over and over again. First did it at Atlantic City in 1969 live, a near 100% redux of the Regal performance, then again in 1972, at the Fillmore East. It is a very focused, slick production with first-rate musicianship throughout. Does B. B. King, in fact, still do reprises of these performances? This is one of the slickest packages ever put together, and an absolute must for both his fans AND those who love blues guitar.
