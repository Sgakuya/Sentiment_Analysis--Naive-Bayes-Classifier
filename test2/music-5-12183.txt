I could tell that Carl's record is not for everyone,it is for those who have been through what he is talking about to understand.If you haven't been through the pain, the beauty and the irony, there is no way you can comprehend what he is taliking about.I'm feeling this record.I don't even think that it is a love making record,it's more for the broken hearted and those who KNOW they've messed up and trying to make it right.You GO Carl!!
