Self centered, eogtistical, maniacal Jerk! It is too bad he feels it is neccessary to enhance his great talent by juicing up on steriods, and then give some lame-ass excuse that he didn't know! His records mean nothing anymore. He's a cheat and a fraud. I sincerly hope he takes a high fastball to the head for a career ending injury during spring training so we can be free from this poor excuse of a human being.
