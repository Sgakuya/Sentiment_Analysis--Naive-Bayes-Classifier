The Waldens here is dark and dirty and the sales people refuse to come off from behind the counter. They are rude and can't be bothered most the time to see if something is available for order. It's well known in town that if you want service, friendly people, and a well ordered/well lit store, to go to B Dalton's .. you won't find it at Waldens
