I purchased a ring at the Beaumont Texas store at Parkdale > Mall back in February. Everything was rung up in the store.I tried to return > the ring back at the beginning of March. Melissa(mgr) told me I could not, > because it was a custom ring. She said that I would have to wait the 90 days > and then turn it in as a repossession (voluntary). I said ok, because I > couldnt make the pymts. I recently moved to Ohio, and Melissa told me to > bring it in to a store here and they would have to ship it to Texas..I > brought the ring in on May 16th. Jessica (asst mgr) at the Great Northern > Mall in Cleveland Ohio. asked me why I was doing it as a repo, and not a > return. She said that everything was rung up in store, so that is not > considered a custom job..She spoke to several different people (mgrs) and > they all agreed. But since now I was past my 90 days, I couldnt get it as a > return..I disagree with the way that Melissa handled this. She is telling > the customer service dept, that it wasnt custom, and telling me that it is. > The ring has never been worn, and I tried to return it within my 90 days..
