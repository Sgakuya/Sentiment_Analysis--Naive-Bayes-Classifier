Continental was the absolute worst airline I have ever flown. On several occasions I had to fly with them for business and experienced multiple-hour, unexplained delays, rude staff, and on one occasion a delay of over an hour sitting on the runway due to the fact that the steward/stewardesses were unable to coerce a tour group of 100 to actually sit down for take off. Don't fly them - they are abysmal!!!
