There's just something about the twisted smirk on this clown's face that I could never stomach. He reminds me of the guy Miles on that thirtysomething show who was always lurking in the background---omnipresent, who spoke only when he had to, and when he did, it was always in this sinister, ominous voice, as a portend of things to come. He communicates in only one message: big business. I don't want someone and his values superseding the little guy's voice and vote.(Look at what happened in Florida.) I think he's James Watt's fraternal twin, frankly.
