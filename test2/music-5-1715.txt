If your not a huge fan of the music radiohead are making at the moment (unlikely as it may seem, i know there are some of you out there) that's fine but there's no denying that they're one of the best live bands in the world today. This live album, while consisting mainly of songs from the albums 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' also has songs like 'true love waits' which is accustic and would probably apeal to a much wider audiance the thrir last two albums. There's also an excellent version of 'spinning plates' with thom on piano. If you really don't like 'Kid A' or 'amnesiac' i wouldn't recommend it, but if you do it's a must have!
