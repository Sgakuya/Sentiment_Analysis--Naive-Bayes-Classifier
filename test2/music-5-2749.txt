Though Highway 61 might be a stronger more compact effort, Blonde on Blonde is still my favourite because of its sprawling, fun strangeness. Tracks 1-8 are all strong but it starts to break up until the last two, which are nice numbers. The record has three large hits-- Rainy Day Women #12 35 (a.k.a. the drug song ), I Want You, and Just Like A Woman (I have to disagree with you Anduarto- I think that Just Like A Woman is the best on the record). Blonde on Blonde is a magnificent collection full of blues, folk-rock, and something else.
