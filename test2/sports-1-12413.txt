Ill go ahead and say im a florida fan so i could be biased. However Florida state is the cheatinest bunch of people ive ever seen. From the coaches and players right down to the referees. How do you recruit and get everyone of the best players in high school football to go to a now mediocre school? 4 words, strippers, beer, drugs and dillards.
