The worst President in American History, he represents the beginning of a very dark era. Not one positive thing can be said about his tenure, while the negatives keep piling up. Our economy is coming to a grinding halt and collapse, as well as an inevitable World War he is encouraging. He will either end up in jail, or be viewed as the American Hitler of our time. Possibly both, but he will not be remembered fondly by anyone. His cohorts are all greedy selfish criminals only out to get richer and destroy anyone in their way. What an embarassment to America and shame on anyone who voted for him.
