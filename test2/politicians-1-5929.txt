In this fuel crisis, and other exculating costs, Senator Kennedy has not done nothing. I saw a mild speach about the poor people in Boston, well how about the rest of the state of Massachusetts, it gets cold here too! You put more effort in bashing the other party than resolving the problems in Massachusetts, and our Country.Now you are making an appearance now that it re-election time.
