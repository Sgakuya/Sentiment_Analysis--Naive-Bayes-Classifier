One of the worst presidents ever. Ask the Nicarguans who were terrorized by Reagan death squads, they lived 9/11 everyday. How about Oliver North selling cocaine to pay for the CIA's little exploits, and do not forget Neil Bush, brother of the current president being forgiven of a BILLION dollar debt for mismanaging (robbing)silverado saving and loan. Ronny sure sounded good and patriotic but he undermined the hard working true americans. How much money did he funnel to the Ayatolla??? And how much money did Reagan buddys in defense industries make selling the weapons that are killing are American troops today. If you think he is great, you hate American and what is good about this country.
