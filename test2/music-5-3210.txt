Can folk, folklore, R&R and "magick" transport you to the land of hobbits and heavy metal? Hell yeah. Feel the superhero vibe of a confident band that captured rhythm, hook, emotion, technical brilliance and big-room production, conjuring up the mystical best of their best. Full of bombast and inhabiting a world of its own, it's almost a clinic on how to lay down a groove to a hard-rock riff. "Stairway to Heaven" is played to death but you can't overlook its impact. Take a nap "acemanly". You seem just a slight bit cranky to me.
