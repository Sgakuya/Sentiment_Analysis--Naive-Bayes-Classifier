Look at what the man has done. He has run the most secretive administration in the history of the country. He ignored the threat of terrorism until the tragedy of 9/11. He unilaterally declared war on a country and lied about why. He suspended many personal rights and freedoms in the name of patriotism. He gave huge tax breaks to the wealthy and screwed the middle and lower classes. History will judge him as the WORST president ever.
