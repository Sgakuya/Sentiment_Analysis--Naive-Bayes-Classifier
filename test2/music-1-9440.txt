Can you say lame,complete lack of any talent, crappy annoying song sang by a even crappier more annoying looking woman in this obviously set to be over hyped video. This video looks like the work of a Hype Williams wanna be on speed. What does the tattoo read on that girls arm? Does it say drug free? Just wondering. Oh, this video is pure fertilizer. In other words... poo.
