I was excited to see this weeks add for a computer, LCD monitor and printer for $349 after rebates. This is well worth the price. Actually, I am purchasing these computers win friends for a charity organization. When I arrived at the store, I was told that the computer was an HP and could only be ordered. Also, the shipping was an ADDITIONAL $99.00. BEWARE, their instore computer selection is horrible and their ads are misleading. We visited the local BEST BUY and they were more than helpful. I plan on staying away form Office Max in the future.
