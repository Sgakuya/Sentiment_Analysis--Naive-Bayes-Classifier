I can't believe 'Bad Lands' was his only hit off of this album! Songs like 'Promised Land' and 'Adam Raised Up Caine' should have been definite hit potential. And with songs like 'Working Life' and 'Racing In the Street'... man that is true, hard core, classic Springsteen. There should have been five or six hits released from this album.
