To whm it may concern, I'm just curious as to how 4 small democratic precincts can be left to speak for the whole nation! It could be argued that California and many or all of our other states should have the oportunity to revote or have our ballots reexamined! It is possible that we may not have been counted correctly either!!! What's the deal? Is that really what you can call fair??
