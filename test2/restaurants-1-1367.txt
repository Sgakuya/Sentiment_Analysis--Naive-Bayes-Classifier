Do not go to the sonic any sonic in Kansas if you want a fresh meal. Every sonic i have tried has been terrible! They will give you a hamburger that has soggy buns. They will give you a sandwich with sour tomatos, if thats what they want to call them. I have complained to a manager once they straight up didnt give a damn what i said. No apologies for poor quality food, nothing.
