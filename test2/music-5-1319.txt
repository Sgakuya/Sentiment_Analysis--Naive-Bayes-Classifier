only heard this album for the first time about a month ago but from the opening bars of the first tune, i knew this was for me. Then the descending drawn out vocal melody of the second tune hit and i was hooked. This is a must have for any fans of softly sang orchestral, folk and its influence can be heard today in people like Jim O' Rourkes most recent solo stuff before joining sonic youth, Elliott Smith and many melancholic singers.
