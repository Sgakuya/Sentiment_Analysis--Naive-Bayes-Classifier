This is just the greatest CD ever because I like each and every song, not to mention my favorite song ever is on this album (Slippin'- Track #10). I knew this album would go platinum as soon as I heard it, which it did 3x. It was an even greater success than his first album. This album is the reason I've been to both of his concerts, one of which I drove hours to get to.
