Ok....I got one thing to say....Never send Al Gore to do a man's job!! GO BUSH 2000!!!...oh and to all ya'll out there that are trying to say Bush only won because of Jeb, I think you are wrong. You democrats are just making up sorry excuses because you are all big babies who fall right into Gore's trap. He is nobody special so don't take his loss so seriously...Bush is the man ok!?
