I remember when i first heard Elliott Smith. Sitting in a theater watching Good Will Hunting was where I, and probably alot of others, got my very first glimpse of Smiths sorrowful voice and guitar. Though having released a couple albums prior, his work for the GWH soundtrack brought him an Acadamy Award nomination, and a performance at the awards show. Smith, since then, has released two albums , X/O and Figure 8. Many feel X/O is Smiths best released work to date and i use to agree, but Figure 8 has been quickly growing on me. His two previous albums, Either/Or and X/O, brought to him a dedicated following of fans hooked on Smiths melancholy, sometimes downright depressing, songs. Filled with lyrics that scratch at his relationships in life, not only with people but with places and himself as well, his songs at some point leave alot of people nodding and saying, yeah, i know how you feel . Combining his singing with some of the catchiest most beautiful music I've ever heard will leave the listener humming for days and popping off lines they can't seem to get out of their heads. This is still the case with his latest release, Figure 8, but changes on this album like the addition of different instruments and several upbeat, more Pop-ish songs, seem to disagree with some. To me X/O is a classic and Either/Or is only slightly behind it. Both albums will always rank high in my music collection. My only complaint with the this album is the way its structured. At 16 tracks the arrangement leaves the last hand full of songs feeling almost dull if you listen to to the album straight through. This is unforunate since several of the best songs are near the end of the cd. With that being my only complaint I have to say this album contains some of Smiths most beautiful work. If you've never heard of Elliott Smith....well, now you have so you have no excuse. Check him out, you might find yourself surprised.
