Read the New Orleans Newspaper about how Coach K got Duhon's mother a job. ABout Boozer's father getting a job. About players like Brand and Avery driving Lincoln Navigators for years as students. Ask him about Cory Maggette getting paid thousands of dollars by a convicted crack felon--thereby making him ineligible--yet Duke suffered NO NCAA sanctions or repercussions. One of the most hollow sham programs in the history of the modern world.
