This is the best country CD ever! I absolutely loved every song on this CD. This was the one that got me hooked on country. When my sister first played me his song, How Do You Like Me Now, I was just thinking, I don't want to hear about cows and farms, but I was wrong, it was extremely up beat and the lyrics were really original.
