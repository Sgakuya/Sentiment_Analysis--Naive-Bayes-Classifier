He is one corrupt individual. Albeit, I am from Ohio, and I have the comfort of dealing with Bush ever day, but I know with interactions between some friends in Canada that this man is a mess. He doesn't present anything new to a downtrodden economy full of dead end government programs (sorry Canadians, but it is true). He also banks way too much on his popularity, from what I can tell, he seems kind of paranoid when it comes to the polls. Overall, I am sure he is a nice guy, but definately not a good PM.
