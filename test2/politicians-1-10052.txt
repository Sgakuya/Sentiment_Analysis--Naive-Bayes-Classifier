What a horrible man. He twists inteligence and words around to create lies. This is the president that you people elcted? Someone that can hardly talk? This guy made us beilive that Iraq had threathned us! He made us think Iraq had WMDs! Now we are ignoring our real threat - Osama binLaden, did you forget about him? Wasnt he the one to start The war on terror? Oh wait, Bush mixed it up with The war for Oil And we still say we are liberating the people of Iraq. We are killing the people we are trying to say. Bush made a mistake of going into Iraq, We are supposed to be In Afghanstan looking for the murderer of over 3000 deaths! Bush is such an asshole, and you republicans bash Clinton for a sex scandal (which he admitted to, and apologized), while Bush here made a mistake that not just killed over 1500 U.S. solidiers, but tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis. Fine republicans lets talk about morality. I rate this liar terriable
