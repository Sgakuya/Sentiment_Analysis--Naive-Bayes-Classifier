In my opinion this is one of Mary's greatest album, in years to come I think it will become a classic or a dustie. when ever I am feeing down and upset over things in my life that don't go right all i do is play a song off of her latest album and i feel so much better. to me listening to Mary J Blige is like music therapy, she always seems to know how I feel and what to do about the situation. Mary j. music will always rock in my head.
