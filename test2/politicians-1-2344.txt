A quisling and a sellout. As a white voter (and a born-again Christian, I might add, in the face of the furious Bible-thumping from the right), I have infinitely more respect for Maxine Waters and Jesse Jackson and do not in the least feel threatened by their long-term, proud and vigorous advocacy for African-Americans and for all of the oppressed. Powell, Watts, Keyes, and all of their ilk -- front-men for the Republican enemies of the people -- are disgusting to me.
