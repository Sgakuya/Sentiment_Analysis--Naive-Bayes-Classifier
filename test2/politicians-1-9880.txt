Totally clueless in dealing with the dire economic conditions of his term office. Was in blunt denial of the peril, which didn't help things much. Later, he redeemed himself to a certain extent by humanitarian efforts, but he has to rate among the worst half dozen American Presidents. What's amazing about the relative success of this country is that it was achieved while so many dimbulbs have supposedly been in charge. Honestly, we've had over 40 Presidents and only about a quarter of them were any good.
