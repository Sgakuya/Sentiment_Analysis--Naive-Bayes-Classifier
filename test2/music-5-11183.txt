2.49 Rating?!!! THAT'S COMPLETE BS! Justified is a great album.I BET HALF OF YOU HAVENT EVEN LISTENED TO HIS ALBUM! Even though I'm a big Justin fan, his album def. surpassed my expectations. Most of the people on here giving Justin 1-star ratings are just jealous! People say he's not original. I think its obvious he's been influenced by Michael Jackson, but he's doing his own thing! His voice is distinctive. I love his voice. Listen to Gone and i'm sure you'll agree. He can def. Dance! I saw him in concert this summer and I thought he was great! NON-STOP ENERGY! I lost my voice because I was screaming so much! Oh, yea. Did I mention that he was hot?!!! Even though I like him with the blond curly hair or the cornrows better. DONT LISTEN TO THE HATERS JUSTIN! KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
