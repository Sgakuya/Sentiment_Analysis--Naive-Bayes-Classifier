I LOVE all the albums Lonestar has made. I think Richie has one of the most incredible voices I have ever heard. He is a wonderful person, a great and loving family man and a fantastic entertainer. I especially like the group since they now have only Richie McDonald doing the lead singing. I also think the group is made up of some very good instrument performers. I cannot understand why the group hasn't won more awards than they have. I think it is time for the Dixie Chicks to move on and let Lonestar have some glory!
