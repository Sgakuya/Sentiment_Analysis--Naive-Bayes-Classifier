how can you idiots even say he was the best back in the sec ever? When there are herschel walker, sean alexander, even the faulks at lsu. He is a mediocre back at best. He wasn't even the best back in the sec when he was playing. He didn't even come close to any records for rushing or scoring. He sucks, and is terribly over rated bottom line.
