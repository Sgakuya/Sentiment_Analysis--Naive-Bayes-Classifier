Lying corporate puppet scumbag. His first few months in office have been NOTHING but a payback to his contributors. Hope all you middle class repubs enjoy those crumbs his bogust back loaded tax cut for the rich gets you; we get the crumbs and his corporate tax cut gets his cronies millions. Of course his promise for a prescription drug benifit has been put on hold as one aid put it. Translation: his tax cut has made it impossible. and how are we gonna afford a new arms race his missle (payback to defense contractors who will buid it) shield will cause. The shield alone has a price tag of minimum $100 billion dollars. Scumbag, plain and simple.
