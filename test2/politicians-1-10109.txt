Smarter then he looks or comes over. And the latter is probably deliberate. George Walker Dubya Bush is a ruthlessly self-centered businessman who is primarily concerned with his own interests, financial and otherwise. Surrounded by a cabal of similar crooks, ranging from wealthy religious fundamentalists to unscrupulous corporate fat-cats. He has made himself extremely popular by one half of his country, and intensely loathed by the other half. And tough his 'war on terrorism', in which he alienated most of his allies in the westernworld with his blatant disregard for the UN and international law, has earned him some popularity in Russia, which itself struggles with terrorism. Most of the world despises, or at least dislikes him. A hero to bombastic right-wing youth, who claim loudly at every turn the superiority of the US and Capitalism. This man has used his country to start a war on a personal enemy in the middle east, over weapons of mass-destruction that are nowhere to be found, and managed to make it look good to his supporters. Many of which burst into a venomous petulance when their idol is in any way negatively described. Whilst the US actually has had worse presidents, such as Nixon. This one definitely belongs in the low end of the spectrum.
