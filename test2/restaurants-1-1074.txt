The A@W store paired with KFC on waterloo rd in Stockton, CA is the absolute worst establishment in your chain. Service is non-existant(people are leaving in droves because they are waiting so long...We did again tonight) The manager doesent care and is rude and curses at folks who complain. I and my family will never go there again..and we know a lot of people.
