Writer Christopher Buckley said it best, The Greatness That Was the Buchanan Era included Dred Scott, the economic panic of 1857, secession, and Fort Sumter. You have to look hard to find four more dismal nodes in American history. Open the Buchanan file to any random page and you'll find such accolades as: never regarded as a brilliant speaker, neither a brilliant nor visionary thinker, and even expelled from college. Ouch!
