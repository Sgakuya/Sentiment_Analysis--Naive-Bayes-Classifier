This clown was nothing more than an American CIA-sponsored right-wing thug who overthrew a legitimate, democratically-elected Chilean government led by Salvador Allende Gossens in 1973. All the American government, and a duped American public could see, was that Allende was a Socialist who advocated socio-economic equality for all Chileans, in particular the Native Americans and mestizos who had been (and still are) discriminated against by the peninsulares and European-born Chileans. Legitimate elections and peaceful transition be damned---the American government was, and still is, willing to tolerate dictatorships, violation of human rights (just ask Amnesty International), and other nefarious capitalistic eyesores and lack of consciences because that thug is a proud anti-communist. as long as it suits the CIA's purposes and doesn't pose a threat to American security --c'mon, people, since when has Chile ever posed a military or economic threat to El Norte/Los Estados Unidos? Some Americans don't even know that much about Chile! Canada has shades of socialism in its government---why aren't the right-wing wackos in the U.S. advocating total destruction of Ottawa? It's a good thing the Chilean military listened to the people and stepped aside, because they were keenly aware that there was international humanitarian and economic pressure to turn over their illegal government (witness Pinochet's martial law decree) to a truly democratically-elected government. Pinochet and his army were known to have tortured and killed many thousands of Chileans, in particular students, professionals, intellectuals, and Native Americans who he deemed a threat to his military dictatorship. We'll never know just how successful Allende could have been because, unlike Pinochet, he was genuinely loved by all segments of Chilean society, except the military, of course. I highly doubt Allende would have resorted to torture and murder to achieve his goals because he had won an overwhelming popular plebescite in 1970 and could have been one of South America's greatest leaders of the 20th century. Pinochet will go down in history as another typical South American generalissimo who just happened to be an average politician but a superb murderer and absconder of justice.
