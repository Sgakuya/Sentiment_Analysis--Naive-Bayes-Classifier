Boring, morose and overrated. What is so special about this dreary piece of crap? The lead singer's voice is nothing special nor are the instrumentals. I thought about giving them a two because they do have some interesting lyrics, but I couldn't do it just on principal. I am not one of those hypocritical people who heard the album once and felt free to write it off. I have been forced to listen to this album countless times, at various stages in my life, and I still despise it. I once knew a girl whose parents used to lock her in a closet and put on Pink Floyd for hours as a form of punishment. Sounds like pure hell to me. However, if you are a thirty-year-old redneck with the same wardrobe and haircut you had in high school then this is the album for you.
