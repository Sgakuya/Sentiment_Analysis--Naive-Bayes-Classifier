IT BAFFLES ME THAT GEORGE BUSH CAN GLOAT IN THE SPOTLIGHT AS PRESIDENT WHEN HE KNOWS DEEP DOWN INSIDE THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED. THE SMARTEST THING HE HAS DONE THUS FAR IS HIS SELECTION OF MOST OF HIS CABINET MEMBERS. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GUIDE THE CLUELESS ONE THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR OF HIS REIGN. HE'LL HANG HIS OWN NECK BY THE STRINGS IN HIS BOOTS. THE FORMER CHEERLEADER AND NATIONAL GUARD MEMBER HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF HAVING OTHERS DO THE DIRTY WORK OF KILLING FOR HIM...RAH RAH RAH...YOU HAVE BEEN BUSHWACKED.
