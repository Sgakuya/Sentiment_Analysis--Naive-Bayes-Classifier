The Rev Jackson is a publicity monger whose only source of income comes via his stirring up of perceived injustices, whether factual or not. He is devisive, self-centered, and does far more harm than good. He has a history of self aggrandizment ( Martin Luther King, Jr died in my arms.... ), as well as taking a kernel of truth and extrapolating it as far as he can in order to generate publicity, all towards the end of self promotion. If I criticize him, if I dare to say that he is wrong, if I call some of his views one sided, nay, even racist, then I am called racist. He can disagree with a reasonable person, and be called a leader. Reasonable people apparently are not allowed the reciprocal. We are better off without, or his political offspring.
