I haven't been to a McDonald's in years, so that should tell me something. Now that I am an adult, I look for a Wendy's for a hamburger, a KFC, BoJangles or Popeye's for chicken, or an Arby's for miscellaneous other. This is mostly due to the fact that McDonald's just doesn't cut the mustard for the adult palate. For children, McDonald's fits the bill nicely as they don't care as much about taste. It's a bit sad that such an American institution has fallen so low (in my opinion), but all things must pass (including food from McDonald's).
