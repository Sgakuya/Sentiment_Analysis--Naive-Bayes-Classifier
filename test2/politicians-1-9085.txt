Former President Clinton did great disservice to the country. I believe he sold out the country for his own personal interests. Time will reveal the extent of damage he caused the American people. He left the nation in a mess! The only programs he supported and promoted were the pro-gay and pro-abortion agendas. He did nothing for the economy, business, education, etc.Someday history will reveal the truth about his administration and his lack of concern for our welfare and future.
