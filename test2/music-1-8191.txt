alright, scott most definately has one too many god-like poses in that video. he is trying to be all religious and loving, but to tell the truth, he just looks like a moron. who cares if he is christian!? i happen to be athiest anyway, but even if i wasnt i wouldnt like creed. why do you people like then for their religion? shouldnt it be about the music? that man has the worst voice i have ever heard. HA! i dont care what you think, because creed doesnt rock nor are they spiritual ...its a nice try though.
