This team just sucks. I'm sorry, but there's no choice for me, they are. Nobody on that team can lead them to wins. Larry Brown as coach? Great, but you know he'll leave in a year or two [Lakers and Brown, anyone?] Isiah Thomas is not doing a good job with them. I see absolutely no positive changes for the team since he took over. The same players? None of them can win, so get rid of them. Has he? Nope. And if he does, he gets these crummy players in return! I ask you, what is Thomas' long-term goals? These guys are bad. Very bad. Now all they need to do is sit back and enjoy losing for the next decade at least.
