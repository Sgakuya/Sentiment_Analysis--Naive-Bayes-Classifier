I CANNOT BELIEVE THE REV JESSE JACKSON ACTUALLY CALLS/CONSIDERS HIMSELF A REVERAND. A TRUE REV WHO IS DEVOTED TO CHRISTIANITY WOULD NOT OF COMMITTED ADULTERY AND SIRED A CHILD OUT OF WEDLOCK. I AM ASHAMED OF JESSE JACKSON AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR. INSTEAD OF UNITING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, HE IS SEPERATING THEM UNDER THE FACAD OF RACISM! PEOPLE LIKE MR. JACKSON ARE THE ONE'S TRUELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RACISM BECAUSE THEY CLAIM PREJUDICE WHEN THEY DON'T GET THEIR WAY! DO AMERICA A FAVOR MR. JACKSON AND TEND TO YOUR OWN UNCHRISTIAN PROBLEMS BEFORE YOU END UP DRAGGING THE GREAT WORKS BY DR. KING THROUGH THE MUD.
