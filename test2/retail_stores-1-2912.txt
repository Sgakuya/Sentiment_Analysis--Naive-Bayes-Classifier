My boyfriend bought me a very expensive tanzanite ring for our 2 year anniversary, he did not buy it from Whitehall but we took it there to get sized. I went to pick it up and it wasnt ready, because the jewler noticed a chip on it. They replaced the stone without notifying me, and would not have told me if i hadnt persisted that they tell me why my ring was not there. I will never do business with them again, they wanted to replace my stone to no cost to me with one that did not have a chip in it. Why would they do that for me you ask? Because they wanted to give me a stone with much less quality. I wont be back
