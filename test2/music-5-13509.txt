you got to here it to beleive it. and if you only listen you will never feel what i do when listening to Dre3000 hit the guitar while Big Boi raps about growing up in the crooked up society that is America. When the Funk of Stankonia hits i swear you will never be able to look at life, as well as music, the same. i have seen George Clinton and James Brown as well as Goodie Mob twice. And what Big boi and Dre3000 are able to do is take what the greats DID and put with what the conjuer up in thier minds. They are not only standing on the shoulders of giants, they are Giants themselves. If you disagree go home and listen to YOUR backsYNC brittney bS and jgo kiss my but.
