An absolute masterpiece. Probably my favorite album from the late 90's, OK Computer will hypnotize you and leave you shaking. Karma Police is especially haunting, but you shouldn't get caught up in individual tracks, as this is a piece of art that should be enjoyed in its entirety, every single time.
