There is no equivalent or substitute for seeing the Barenaked Ladies perform live. They are simply the most entertaining and fun band I've had the pleasure of enjoying live. One of the highlights is the improv songs and lyrics that these guys come up with on the spot, often catered to the particular city they happen to be playing in. You can tell that they're touring and making music not because they have to, or for the money, but for the sheer enjoyment that they get out of it. A guaranteed pick-me-up. Check them out if you have the chance - if you like their music even a tiny bit, you'll be hooked after one show!
