I have moved across the country 5 times and Bekins and their agent, Dennis Moving and Storage in Portland, OR, were by far the worst. My goods were delivered late, with no notification. Customer service was terrible. I had numerous damages and actually had things stolen. I will never use them again and I recommend you don't either.
