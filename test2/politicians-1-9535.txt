Too dishonest to be President. If you ever get the chance, watch the debate between Carter and Reagan on CSPAN when it comes on again (they run them all every four years). It is hilarious. It is almost unfair how Reagan beats him. At one point Carter says that a tax cut like Reagan suggested would be inflationary. His theory was that excess aggregate demand from a tax cut would cause demand-push inflation. Reagan countered by saying something like, Why would it be inflationary for the government to spend the people's money but not inflationary for the people to spend their own money? Exactly! The questioner even paused as if to say, That's right--almost waiting for Carter to answer, but no answer came. Then he said, I guess that will have to be a rhetorical question. LOL! What happened when Reagan was elected? The Reagan tax cut. Did inflation go up like Carter predicted? No! Carter was wrong.
