You people must be visiting HIGH VOLUME Wendy's locations to give such high ratings. Food is always better at any FFR if they are cooking to order. As for Wendy's available in my area, the QVC is always marginal. The last time I went there; ordered a DCB all they way, with fries med. drink. Where should I start?? Bun cold not toasted, meat fresh from the warming bin and not fit to be used as chili meat, toppings on burger included un-ripe tomatoes, lettuce that had seen it's better days, 2 dill pickle slices (I though minimum was at least 4, i.e. a taste of each condiment with every bite), less than a teaspoon of catsup, same for mayo mustard, fresh sliced onions, and to top it all off, a slice of un-melted cheese between and on top of the meat patties. The fries were a combination of fresh cooked hot fries and lukewarm soggy ones. Luckily, I discovered all of this before I left their parking lot. This is NOT the Wendy's I remember (I am also an ex-Wendy's GM). Needless to say, I got a refund for my purchase and haven't been back since then. Also, as and added after-thought, Wendy's is supposed to be cooked to order, right? ;) That was the whole idea behind the Wendy's concept; that is until Dave resigned as CEO the bean counters took over...
