First off this is not Dubya's presidency. It is a continuation of his fathers presidency. The people around Bush are more of a threat to America than anybody else including Bin Ladin. If you don't think so look for pictures of saddam and bin ladin, none. Saddam and Rumsfeld, shaking hands. As far as the chemical weapons go last time I checked he has not used them since the 80's. Coincidence that Rumsfeld's picture is the same time period. During the IRAN-IRAQ war Iran made repeated calls for help against these chemical attacks from Iraq. So what do we do, shake their leaders hand! And now he is secretary of defense. It is there greed for money and oil that is putting Americans lives at risk. As long as they run are country there will always be a terrorist threat in this country and to it's people http://www.gwu.edu/'nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/ read this link (note the edu web address)
