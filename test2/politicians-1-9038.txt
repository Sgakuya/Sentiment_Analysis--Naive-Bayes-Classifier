The guy was a draft dodger and he literally got away with murder. If you go to any search engine website and type in Clinton Victims , you'll see how many people have suffered as being a friend or an associate of Clinton who had information that could've jeopardize his career, and they're now dead. It's amazing that he got as far as he did. He's gotten more people killed than Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, and Jeffrey Dahmer put together. I also didn't like him as president because he was so animated at functions and he sure did give new meaning to the word intern. And know, the corporate world is suffering because of his shenanigans. Thanks, Bubba.
