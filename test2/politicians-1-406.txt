Tony Blair is a whore and a shill for America. I mean, on the one hand it is admirable to take an unpopular stand based on principles, but what he did is nothing of the sort. He thought that he would leave a legacy where he would have brought Britain back to the forefront of the world stage. He thought he would be the next Winston Churchill. He thought that by joining the coalition he would be able to control its direction. News Flash Blair!!! America does not share power!!!! Blair is a complete whore and a loyal lapdog for a man who is by far his intellectual inferior. How can you follow after and wipe the ass of such a complete idiot unless you think that you're going to be made wealthy as a result. I hope the IRA take this pig down fast.
