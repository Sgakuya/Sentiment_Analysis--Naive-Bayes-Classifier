I don't think that any album at the time could compare to OK Computer.. Something about it just pulls you from this world and sends you to another. I love getting lost in this album and I think most other people will as well. There is no way to classify this album because it is in a category of it's own. Radiohead set a standard that not many could ever follow, if they dare to do so. One band that has stepped in that direction and conquered is OUR LADY PEACE. If you like this album you should seriously check out Spiritual Machines by OUR LADY PEACE.
