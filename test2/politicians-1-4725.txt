Dick Cheney would make a much better president than G.W. Bush, although we are all aware that it will be he running that office! I'm only sorry that he's sharing that title with someone like Bush....GOD H E L P America if anything happens to Mr Cheney! I'm praying tonite that the Fla Supreme court act in the best interest of us all and reject Mr Bush attempts in stealing that office!
