I didn't care much for Hanson before (I was one of those people who thought Taylor was a girl in MMMBop and didn't really change my opinion later) but after about 2 years, If Only came out in Australia, I began to love them! I first bought the single, then later the album and I listen to it everyday! They have definitely steered away from bubblegum pop and they have a more mature rock 'n' roll/pop sound to their songs as well. Their lyrics are also very inspiring. Overall, HANSON RULZ 4EVA!!!! Rock on!
