What IS it with guys named Kerry/Kerrey and the Botox? I saw this Bob Kerrey impersonator at the 9-11 hearings and couldn't believe it. Botox, brow lift and a Prince Valiant haircut. Do these smarmy old men think that gives them credibility? Oh, yeah, and he's a bitter partisan, too. Note to webmaster: I think this fool's name would be better placed in the 15 minutes of fame category. Loser!!!
