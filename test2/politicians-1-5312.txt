Al Gore and the Democrats need to stop whinning and accept their defeat in Florida and accept that BUSH IS going to be the next president of the USA. Bush has integrity and honesty...something Gore has no concept of. As for Rosie O'Donnell I am personally sending her a one way ticket to France!! Stop knit-picking this election and give Bush what he rightly has won and move on with it!
