Lenny Kravitz is definitely not one of my favourite singers. In fact, I absolutely detest his music. I find it annoying and boring. The only comparison that I can draw is to Macy Gray. Yes, Macy Gray, the one who makes me run for my earplugs. Goodness, Lenny is not good, but it's hard to rate him as low as Macy Gray. She's in a class of her own!
