Tony Romas on Freemont Street in Las Vegas, always one of our favorites!!! WHOA, but we went on Monday, January 9, and what a letdown. That will be the very last time for me. We had been to the one in Shreveport, and it closed down, and Freemont is next surely!! DO NOT go to the Freemont for dinner in Las Vegas at Tony Romas. Horrible. The service was the worst. The waitress worse than rude. The booth was in the door of the kitchen, and we could not even hear ourselves think!! The ribs were charred, then covered with sauce. We just wanted OUT!! If I can find a way to write the management, I have every intention of doing so. We did not complain, did not want comps, just wanted out of the place. STAY AWAY!
