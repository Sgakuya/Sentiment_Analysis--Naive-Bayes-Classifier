I like the groovyness of this cd it is a solid dacne cd that really sounds sweet. mandy moore's tracks are more candi-pop then brintey's and they are more of a driving cd then oops I did it again I take this cd for trips and it sounds good driving down the road and listening to candy when your driving down the freeway, another freeway disc liek the backstreet boys sel-titiled disc.I like the tracks' candy , so real and all the rest. it's one cool cd.
