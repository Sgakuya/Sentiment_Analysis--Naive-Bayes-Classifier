McDonalds is disgusting! There's animal fat in all their foods, INCLUDING the hamburger buns! So vegans like myself can't eat ANYTHING there! Most restaurants have at least one vegetarian or vegan option. Even Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers has a salad bar. McDonalds is the worst restaurant I can think of.
