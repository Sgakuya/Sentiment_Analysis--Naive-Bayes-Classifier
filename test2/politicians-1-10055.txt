At the root of so many of our nation's most pressing issues is the widespread acceptance of greed and materialism (what we euphemistically call - individualism). American overconsumption is at the root of our precarious energy situation, widespread feelings of disconetent and stress, the degrading of nature, changing of atmospheric chemistry and the feeling of inequity that spawns anti-Americanism throughout the world. If we are to have a devoutly Christian president, let's have one that challenges materialism and not fringe moral issues such as gay marriage and abortion. Wouldn't Jesus be more concerned with the shredding of the moral fabric of society by our crass consumerism than by a few gays wanting to marry? Maybe we need to frame it in terms this violence loving president can understand - a war on greed.
