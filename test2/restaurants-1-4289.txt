Macaroni Grill is one of the worst restaurants I have ever set foot in, in my whole entire life. The bread is hard and they don't have butter??? They don't serve butter with their bread??? Their pizza has this horrible gravy on it, and their spagetti has no spices whatsoever, and it's really hard and straight.
