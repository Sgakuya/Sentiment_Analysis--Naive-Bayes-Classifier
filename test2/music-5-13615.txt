The best Eminem cd thus far. Awesome songs combined with humor make this Eminem disc THE one to buy. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, of All Media Guide, says "witness the stunning oddity Square Dance." That applies to both this song and most others on it. Heck, even the edited version's surprisingly tight.
