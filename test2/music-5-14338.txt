I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson's taste in music, and the way he uses it in his movies. The Rushmore soundtrack remains in my regular rotation, and one of the reasons I was looking forward to seeing Life Aquatic was to check out the music. I was not disappointed. The soundtrack is dominated by Bowie songs, sung by Bowie himself, or covered accoustically in Portuguese by Brazilian singer Seu Jorge. Those that are familiar with Wes Anderson's previous soundtracks will recognize the Mothersbaugh instrumentals which provide nice breaks. But the highlight of the soundtrack for me was the use of Iggy and the Stooges' Search and Destroy during the scene where Bill Murray opens a can of whup ass. Awesome stuff in the movie, and the music really gets you going. Anyway, this is a fantastic soundtrack and is all over the place, with songs from Devo, Paco de Lucia, and above all David Bowie. Highly recommended.
