Incredibly good album. You can't find a half-bad song on here. Well-written songs, simple back-up instrumentation, perfectly delivered vocal lines by Joni. Gentle moods with River and Little Green , fun songs like Carey and California , and some introspective songs like Blue and Last Time I Saw Richard are all found on here. It's hard to find music this great sometimes. But when you do, something tells you you're into something good. I don't know how you could be disappointed with this- everybody could find something they like on Blue .
