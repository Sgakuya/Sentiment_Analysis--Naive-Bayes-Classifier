YUCK! It's greasier that KFC if that is possible. Last night I stopped at a Church's for the first and last time. I was the only white guy in sight and the girls behind the counter wouldn't even look me in the face. The service was fast but they just grabbed the money and shoved my order at me. I tried to eat it while driving but grease kept dripping on my shirt. I managed to gulp down a few bites but gave the rest of it to the coyotes (yes, we have coyotes in Alabama).
