Jeb Bush sucks. He has revised medicaid to kill people.....Some people have been certain meds for years and he goes and revised medicaid so you can not get them with no worning so if you need to be weened off something such as seazure meds.(because they decided to take it off the meds. list to pay for) forget it jest to save a buck for his campain and there is hardly any doctors that will take it know if you need a specialest in Florida forget it...I feel he has put Florida in the dark age.. the best thing could happen is the Bushes be voted out .....Florida is thev only state who has revieved medicaid this bad....
