Maxine Waters is pretty much the same as most of the so called Civil Rights Leadership in this country. They (Jackson, Sharpton, and Waters) are all demagogues. If they truly want to help out blacks and minorities, then they would tell them to get an education and they would advocate lowering taxes to they would have the ability to go to their neighborhoods to establish businesses. They continue the so called fight ; this kind of divisive politics only discredits black people even more and makes them feel like they are inferior. I just want to say that nobody is inferior, my Christian faith tells me that God created all in His image, we are all equals. Nobody will be oppressed or disenfranchised if they do not allow themselves to be. Unfortunately, no one in the Conservative-Republican side advocates this message. Maybe in the 1940's and in the 1950's, it would have been more difficult for minorities to make it, but today, there is no excuse. All of the doors of opportunity are open my friends, knock and you will receive. Don't let Maxine Waters or any of them get you down.
