Of course this one gets a 5 from me! It is absolutely PHENOMENAL!!! It was made to blast on the car radio in the spring/summer! I don't know how he does it, but the Boss keeps on turning out great albums, time after time! I wouldn't call this his VERY best album, but it is really good, so I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an amazingly wonderful good time! E Street Band forever!!!!
