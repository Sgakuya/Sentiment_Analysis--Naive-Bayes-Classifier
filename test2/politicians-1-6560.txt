Mr. Daschle. Isn't South Dakota a western state. You know. . . wide open spaces, freedom, independence and so on. Maybe the farmers put him in office I can't say, but whoever it was I'm sure a government handout was involved.Why is he so against George W. The answer is simple. . . our president is a Republican. You know the party that freed the slaves. Why wasn't Daschle so critical of Mr. Clinton and his good ol'e boy back woods political money grabbing tatics. Not to mention 55 dead people all tied to Mr Clinton some who were set to testify against him. Here again the answer is simple. . .Clinton was a Democrat. There's a pattern here and unfortunately Daschle and his partner in crime Gepharht are two peas in a pod. Make up lies and feed the media so the 2002 and 2004 elections sway back to our Democratic friends. It's sad.
