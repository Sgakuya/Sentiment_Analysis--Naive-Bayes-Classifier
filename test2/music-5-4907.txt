I THINK BILLY HAS AN AMAZING VOICE AND ONE VOICE IS A SONG THAT TOUCHED ME. FOR A 12 YEAR OLD BOY HE IS SO AMAZING AND GIFTED! ME AND MY BFF LOVE HIS SONG AND LISTEN OT IT ALL THE TIME. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT SUCKS HAVE TO REALIZE HE IS 12...I REALLY DOUBT THEY COULD SING ANY BETTER, BILLY IS AWESOME AND DESERVES EVERYTHING COMING TO HIM!
