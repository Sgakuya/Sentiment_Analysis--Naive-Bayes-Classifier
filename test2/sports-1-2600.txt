Ok, people let's get real. Bobby Cox has seen his day. We talk about thirteen straight division titles, wow. That's great, no one has ever done that before, cool. Let's win the big game, but I don't the Braves can do it with Bobby Cox. He has had great players and as soon as they are traded their game picks up. That tells me Bobby has a problem with talent and most likely in the areas of how to use it.
