I think Billy Gilman is the coolest. He has the most angelic voice that every song he sings lingers in your mind. One Voice was beautifully written. It makes you think about all the problems today and all the problems in your own life. The CD was superbly put together. I laughed at the Snake Song, cried at One Voice and Oklahoma, and can't help but sing along with Little Things, I Think She Likes Me, and Little Bitty Pretty One. Not to mention the fact that he is the cutest thing on two feet.I LOVE U BILLY!!!!
