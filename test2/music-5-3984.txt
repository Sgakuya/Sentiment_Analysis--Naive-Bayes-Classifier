This is definitely one of my most favorite groups. David Lee Roth made Van Halen a sensation, and without him they haven't been the same. 1984 brings back the best memories- all the songs are killer. I actually can't find this CD around anymore, I would love to buy it. Hot for Teacher, Panama, Jump - the videos are as good as the songs are.
