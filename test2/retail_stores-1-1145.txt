I absolutely hate this store! Their clothes are crap! Overpiced, very thin, and cheaply made! I once bought a pair of underwear for five dollars back in my teenybopper days. Three days later, their was a hole the size of my pinky finger in one of the seams! I've found better quality underwear at Wal-Mart! Stores like this are the reason I shop at AE or A&F!
