I don't like all of pac's songs infact I don't even like rap. it glorifies the wrong things about society; but pac did have a good message in a lot of his songs and he found a way to get it out to the urban masses, for those of you who don't know pac was an educated man, not the gangsta wanna be people portray him as. its too bad rap doesn't have him anymore cause the rest of it is crapy noise that brings down society as a whole
