You know, I have so much hate for this place that I could probably write a novel of reasons why it should not exist. First and foremost, why the hell would I pay so much god damn money for a peice of crap clothing that says the brand all over it? You seriously cannot and will not find a single article of clothing or anything else in that hell hole that doesn't say their name somewhere. Usually it's nice and big so everyone can see it, as if they will like you better because your cool shirt says Abercrombie. Come on, people. They should be paying you! Because of all the free advertising that people buy, Abercrombie doesn't even have that many adds out. Seriously, you never see a commercial for them? Why should they? They don't need to with all the idiots out there that pay to do something they should be getting paid to do. And don't tell me it's because you like their stuff...it's the exact same thing you can get at the gap without a big Gap label smeared across it. Ok, enough of that. My second reason for wanting them destroyed is for their promotion of eating disorders. What?! Yes, it is true. When a girl that can normally get a small or extra small at the gap has to get a large at Abercrombie, something is terribly wrong. When the pants racks carry nothing above a four with maybe one pair of 6 or 8's for the fat people that come in there, something is also wrong. You know, I go to the mall and see all these little 13 year old girls wearing it and it makes me sick. Soon, they will be forced to stop eating or they will not be able to fit into their precious Abercrombie. I could go on even longer about this but I won't. Put bluntly, it disgusts me in every way possible.
