no this isnt my favorite pink floyd album but it sure ranks high among them. if you have ever seen pink floyd live at pampeii the movie you would have heard the band talk about the making of dark side and have a better understanding of it. besides this is one of the best selling albums of all time almost two decades on the charts for this band. amazing.
