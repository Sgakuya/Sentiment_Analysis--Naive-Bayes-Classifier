My,my,my, How have the tables been turned!! Because Jumpin Jim had his ego hurt by the GOP, and took jumped ship so that he would be guarenteed a committe chairmanship with the Dumbocrats. Well, now that the GOP retook the Senate, he has been putting out feelers begging them to take him back so that he can keep his chairmanship. So much for standing up for your priciples!!
