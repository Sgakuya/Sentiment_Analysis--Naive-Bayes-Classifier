Rented a car for 3 days in Puerto Rico. Not only did they take an upfront hold on our credit card for $550 for a $150 rental, they barely spoke English. At the actual car pick-up place they gave us a car with 2 practically flat tires and did not want to do anything about it. After almost an hour of discussion, we finally got a different car. Very unpleasant people to deal with. Would never rent from Thrifty again.
