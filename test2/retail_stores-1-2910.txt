Me and my husband spent several thousands on my ring. I kept my end of the bargain by making sure I brougt it in for inspections. Well the first inspection the lady just took the ring looked at it and signed the slip.2 months later a diamond came out. Well I bring it back to the store and they treat me like some sort of criminal like I was inconveiencing them. anyway they said I'd get it back 6 to 8 wks. I finally picked up my ring 6/16/03 and here it is 6/19/03 and the diamond fell out again. Looks to me like it was superglued or something. I have never been treated so terribly and never been so disappointed in my jewelry. I will never buy from them again and I will certainly tell my friends and family to NEVER shop there.
