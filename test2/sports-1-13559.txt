he's not a one, but im just trying to bump him down a little. he's not good enough to be in the top 10 if he can't have more success with a guy like Payton Manning who regularly posts 4,000+ yard seasons, and Marvin Harrison. everybody talks about Manning still winless in the playoffs...maybe it's the coaching?
