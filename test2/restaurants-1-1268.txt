While I'm sure all Arby's restaurants aren't too bad, the one in Jonesboro, Ar. is the absolute pits! The food out-right sucks and the service leaves practically everything do be desired! I've tried it three different times, and each time was worse than the one before. I refuse to ever enter that particular restaurant ever again!
