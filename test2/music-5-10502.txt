I bought La Historia and that's the best move I \'ve made in months.There is no even one song I don't like in this CD.Great music,great interpretation,gives me optimistic push every morning before going to the work.I don't speak spanish so most of the lyrics I can't follow,but still can catch the emotions of the music through the Ricky's perfect interpretation. The best spanish album of the last year.
