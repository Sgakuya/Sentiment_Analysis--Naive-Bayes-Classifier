This guy shouldn't be honored. Instead, he should go down in history as a fool. His antics include cross-dressing, attacking referees, using profanity during public speeches and more. And, who knows how many millions has been wasted on hair dye. This punk isn't even as good as Joe Montana in basketball (and, yes, I know Montana was a football QB!)
