I'll let the owner of the Utah Jazz rate him for me. This is his actual quote that can be found on truthaboutduke.com........It is not good for a player to have more tattoos and earrings than he does points and rebounds, against some of the best power forwards in the NBA. )))))))))))) )))))))))))UPDATE. I know what went down...........he's an NBA flop just like MOST (most) other Dookies. I used to think he had game until I saw white Euros ripping boards right out of his weak hands at the olympics. This punk is one of the highest paid NBA players! It's a joke. What happened?......he stub his toe? PUNK PROS! Did anybody else see those numbers about how guys that spend 1 or 2 seasons under Coach K, are MUCH MORE successful in the NBA than guys that spend 4 years at Dook? COINCIDENCE?)))))))))))))))))))))))))))) ))))))))))))))))UPDATE. Works well the current Jazz team???? - they lost when he played, they lost when he got injured. NOPE, not quite Stockton and Malone! Not yet, not ever! You're talking about two of the NBA's 50 greatest! NOPE, NOT YET QUITE STOCKTON AND MALONE! - ignoramus. Let's see them break many individual records, and at least manage an 8 seed in the Playoffs before we even SORTA go there. Before we even have the SLIGHTEST thought of Stockton and Malone. Hell, can we at least wait to see if they ever even make an All Star game?
