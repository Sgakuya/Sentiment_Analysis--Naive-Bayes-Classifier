Walt Harris is the WORST COLLEGE GAME DAY COACH EVER. With descent coaching, Pitt should be going for its 3rd or 4th BCS game. Anyone can beat bad teams. They are the only teams he has beaten over the past 7 years. Once in awhile the odds are you will beat a good team. (very few and far IN BETWEEN). A schedule full of Temple, Rutgers, Syracuse, 1 or 2 Mid American conference teams and some other lower caliber teams = A WINNING SEASON AND A BOWL BID. I feel that he has too many goof ups to even try to mention. I must comment on the Notre Dame game at N.D. 2002. Walt punted into the end zone from the Notre Dame 25. If that was unbelieveable, try this, on the next possession he punted from the (I think) N.D. 26. Net gain 5&6 yards. With this kind of coaching, how can you win? We dominate the game 3-1 yards-but lost on the scoreboard.
