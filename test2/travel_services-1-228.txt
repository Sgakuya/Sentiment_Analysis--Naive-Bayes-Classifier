Why does anybody fly United??? They've got the worst on-time performance record in the U.S. airline industry (just over 50% on-time last year), they lose more baggage than any other airline, and they have some of the highest average fares in the industry. Throw in a few nasty strikes, some terrible hub airports, and you've got the makings of a horrible performing airline. THUMBS DOWN!
