Larry Coker was extremely fortunate to inherit a team loaded with so much talent and win the National Championship. As a longtime Hurricanes fan, it makes me sick to watch the team play. There is no intensity from the defense and the offense looks totally lost. I can remember when Ken Dorsey started his first game, yes he did lose to Washington, but after that game he was one of the best QB's Miami has had. Also, does the offensive line know what there job is. To give up so many sacks in two games is a joke. These guys play like a bunch of girls!!!!!!!!!! Whatever happened to the Canes of old??????
