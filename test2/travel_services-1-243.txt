Well, let's see. Fine if you're flying between Toronto and Vancouver or Montreal. Pretty shoddy if you're going anywhere else. A bar that closes every time you're thirsty and food that would sicken a hungry sow. They hire drunken mountain gorillas to handle your luggage, and chimpanzees to route it, with the result that your suitcase is going to be far more travelled than you are. Stewardesses (excuse me, Cabin Attendants) who are about as attractive as my mother, and about the same age as well. (I'm nearly 50 by the way)
