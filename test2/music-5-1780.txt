This is the album that got Wilco dropped from their record label, because they wouldn't go back and record a single...it wasn't commercial enough (and now Wilco has been screwed again by a different record label, who doesn't even own them). This is an outstanding album. Wilco really know what they are doing, and it shows. Ashes Of American Flags , Heavy Metal Drummer , Kamera , War On War ...what genius brilliantly ditched them from Reprise Records? The album has sold wonderfully for an undergound band, and they certainly deserve that. Take care, everyone!
