Man. 20+ years later and Van Halen still hasn't recorded a better album. This album is so deep. Everyone knows Runnin' with the Devil and Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love (which rule) but if you don't know it, get it. Check out I'm the One and Little Dreamer to get the full effect of most influential player in rock guitar (chronologically) after Hendrix until deconstruntionist grunge set in paired with the greatest American showman since P. T. Barnum.
