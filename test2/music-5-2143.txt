Thay are back with a record label! What a shame that they were dropped for a while when so many other crappy artists signed fat deals with record companies. I have heard a couple of songs from the new CD and I fully intend to buy it with my next music purchase. Check them out in concert if you get a chance, they are a fun band to see and they sound great live.
