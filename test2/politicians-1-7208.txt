As an Elder in the Christian Church I couldn't believe someone who calls himself a Reverend would say the things he said after Geo. W. was confirmed as president. Mr. Jackson, you are not teaching the things in the Bible and you appear to be a bigot and general trouble maker. The Bible refers to this as Factions. I would hate to be in your shoes when Jesus comes back to judge the world and we all have to give Him an account of our lives. Lord have mercy on you. Elder Rod
