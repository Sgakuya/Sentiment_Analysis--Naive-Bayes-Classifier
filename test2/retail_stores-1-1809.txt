I would rather have teeth pulled than shop at this hell hole. I don't need to save money that bad. I'd rather go to Target where the other customers aren't the scum of the earth like in Hell-Mart. Plus, Wal-Mart is notorious for treating their employees like dirt. My boyfriends brother works there. They lock them in untill all the work is done.
