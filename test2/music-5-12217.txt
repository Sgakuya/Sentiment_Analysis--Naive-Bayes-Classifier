I met Carl Thomas last night after a Concert he held at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. He is an excellent singer in person as well as on hid exquisite CD. he is very outgoing and sweet. I danced with him and gave him a hug and kiss. He was nowhere near stuvk-up and he loves his fans, He y=thanked everyone who brought his CD and those who did not. I love that Guy. I should have tryed to talk to him.
