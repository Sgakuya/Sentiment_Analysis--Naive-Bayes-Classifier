.5 out of 5.0 Stars: Horrible The debut from the one and only craptavagansa themselves, Stinking Fart. If you REALLY would like to know my opinion on this dreadful album, just read my review for Reanimation (2002). It is essentially just as accurate when applied to this album, since all of their albums are the identical annoying, repetitive crap. Do not buy this album unless you are an oblivious, selfless conformist that purchases anything that appears on MTV.
