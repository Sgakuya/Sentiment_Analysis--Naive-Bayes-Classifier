What can I say? At first I thought she is ok and I liked Genie in a bottle . But later on I realised why some people like her and what the words of some of the songs really meant-- You gotta rub me the right way , What a girl wants --both have strong sexual meanings, double meanings, come on people!?!. I turn to you is not a bad song, but coming from her mouth, without any feelings makes the song annoying and of course the CD isn't great either. And on top of that the way she acts and dresses are totally opposite from the way she says she is inside . Well now I know what inside she means...
