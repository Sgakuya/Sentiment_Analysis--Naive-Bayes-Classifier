This album contains three very important elements that are rare in modern music: depth: while Britney Spears may have depth in her bust line, real depth means creating a gorgeous tapestry where all the threads (guitar, bass, drums, lyrics) come together. Our Lady Peace is so successful at this that you can listen just to the drums, or just to the rhythm guitar, or to Raine Maida's chilling vocals for an entire album and never get bored! intelligence: again in a rare move, OLP opts to explore artificial intelligence rather than artificial breasts. Music that makes you think. What an anomaly!! impact: perhaps the rarest of them all...music that leaves you touched, inspired, and haunted for days. Unlike the cotton candy crud that we find all over, this album has to be digested. I guarantee you, you won't easily forget the eerie melodies, passionate lyrics, and energetic riffs.
