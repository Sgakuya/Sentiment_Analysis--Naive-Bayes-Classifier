This album is amazing. Hanson continues to grow and develop their musical talents, and they are on in full display on this album. As an adult, I thought they were 'cute kids' when Middle of Nowhere was released, but since purchasing TTA, I'm a bonafied fan! I am looking forward to many future releases.
