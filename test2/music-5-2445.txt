A true rock and roll and 20th century music masterpiece. Even the childish songs as Yellow Submarine are so well crafted that they reach the level of genius. Eleanor Rigby and Tomorrow Never Knows alone are the philosophal stone of rock and roll bringing together Dylan s lyrical influence, the Beach Boys sound effects experimentation and the outstanding Beatle melody and harmony in a truly organical way. More intriguing and dark than Sgt Pepper, more unified than the White Album and more direct than Abbey Road, Revolver is a classic that shows rock evolving into a true and complete art form.
