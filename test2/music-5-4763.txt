Words are not enough to describe how GREAT and important Phil shows are!!! Phil has carried the spirit of the Grateful Dead into a new phase that retains the musical AND spiritual intention of the band when it was first growing out of an even greater revolution in thinking. To add to Phil's gift to us, he also welcomed musicians from new and upcoming bands into his circle of friends and formed a bridge between old school and new school jam-based live performances. On a personal level, Phil has brought the magic back to me that I feared I would never experience again at a show. Thank God for Phil, and also for the family of the boy who gave his life to save so many on a physical level, and even greater numbers on a spiritual level. Still Grateful!!!!
