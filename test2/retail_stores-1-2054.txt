Circuit City's Service is horrible. I have a 43 inch TV that I cannot get anyone to look at for 23 days!!! After talking with 2 service people from India who I could barely understand, I was told that there was nothing they could do. I then went up to the store and was told the operations manager would be in touch with me and she never called. I called her and she was clueless but promised to research and call me back. She did not. I then called corporate and spoke to customer service and then was sent to the head of customer service who told me they could not help me, the service call was already put in, the servicer is a private contractor hired by Circuit City and they (circuit city) could not help me. Apparently, they were ok with taking my money for this service contract knowing full well that no one would ever be out to service my TV. Circuit City cares nothing about their customers and frankly does not care if their loyal customers start shopping at Best Buy, which is what I plan on doing.
