I love the red hot chili peppers and I always have (and always will) but this is my favorite CD out by them. I like every song on this CD and the lyrics kick ass!! All of the music has a great beat, great lyrics awesome Bass guitar by Flea. John and Flea are both really sexy and this is when John had his long hair... Oh meow!! So, yea, this is their best CD!!
