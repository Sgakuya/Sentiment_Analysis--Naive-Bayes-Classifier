My fiance bought my diamond engagement ring from a local Zales. We special ordered it in white gold b/c the one in the store was yellow gold. Turns out, instead of making it from scratch, the cut off the yellow gold band, attached a white gold band, and dipped it in rodium. After having it cleaned, it rubbed off and the yellow gold still left on the setting was coming through. I would have to have it re-dipped every 6 months for $40 b/c they made it wrong! We returned that crap and got our money back! Zales has made the engagement and marriage process a headache for me. Don't go there!
