NIMROD. JUST THE NAME OF THE ALBUM IS CATCHEY. THEN YOU HEAR THE MUSIC AND IT'S ALL-OUT ROCK. THE MOST KICK-ASS, BEST KIND OF MUSIC ON EARTH. I HAVE THIS CD AND I LOVE IT!!! IT'S GOT GREAT MUSIC AND GREAT LYRICS! I MEAN IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE SONG KING FOR A DAY, THEN YOU HAVEN'T LIVED LIFE TO THE FULLEST! IT'S A LAUGH-YOUR-ASS-OFF TYPE OF SONG! AND THE GROUCH! IT'S A GREAT SONG AND I THINK THE LYRICS ARE FUNNY, BUT I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THINK TAHT THE LYRICS ARE DISGUSTING WELL THAT' THEIR PROBLEM CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT THEY SAY!!
