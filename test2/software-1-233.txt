It was the Browser of choice in the times of Netscape 4.x because it was much easier to Program and more advanced. This has changed now. IE6 stood still for the last years. They did only implement non standard conform extensions weakening some official Standards like XHTML. Which won't be used because it isn't as forgiving as the IE but would be ways better for the Internet (i.e. wuality of Search Engines).
