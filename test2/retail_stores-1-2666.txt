Absolutely the WORST Grocery store you could ever imagine. The employees are so upset at their inept 'fresh from college' pimply-faced management staff, they dont even care about even doing their jobs properly. Go to Walmart, they may suck too, but at least youll actually find what youre looking for product-wise, and they actually stock product for their specials. Unlike K's false 'plus card deals' and specials they deliberately underorder product for. Avoid them, it's not worth the time.
