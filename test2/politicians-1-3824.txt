George W. Bush is not in touch with the youth and females of today. He opposes pro-choice which is utterly stupid. How would he like it if some fake politician was telling him what doctors he could see and what he could do about his body? And what about public schools? If you are giving vochures so kids can go to Private School to get a better education, don't you think something is wrong with the public school system? They are already underfunded and understaffed. Let's face it, the kids that are in those schools are gonna be running the country someday so why not help them? Just think about that before voting for him....
