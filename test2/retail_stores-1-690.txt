Old Navy on occasion has some okay finds, and prices are low, but their clothing mostly suffers from poor design, poor cut, and poor quality. When I try on Old Navy clothes, I always look like I am wearing straight pieces of fabric taken directly from a fabric roll and stitched together in box form. I look dumpy and horrible in these clothes. If you like the no-waist, unfitted look, this is a good store. At least the prices are cheap.
