I hate Christina Aguilera. HATE her. With the blackest hatred of my being. If I were stranded on a desert island with her I'd probably kill her and eat her, but I'd be afraid of catching some horrible disease, so I'd settle for throwing her to the sharks and letting them tear the flesh from her bones.
