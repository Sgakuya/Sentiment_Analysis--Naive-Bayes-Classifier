I used to work for a supermarket in Cambridge Massachusetts years ago. A supermarket that served liquor. And guess who was a frequent customer in my register? Joan Kennedy. And what did she always but, hard booze.. I also worked in a restaruant in 1986 with a neighbor of Mary-Jo and she told me that her parents were paid off $1,000,000.00 to keep their mouths shut. And they moved to New Jersey. So Teddy, you and your whole family dead or alive are nothing but scum! You cheat and beat your wives and leave people for dead.. MURDERER !
