This guy was a joke. An empty suit! Took credit for the economy despite having absolutely zero knowledge of how the success of the economy during this time was as a result of the rise of the dot coms. Also, Clinton had tremendous personal problems. A failed Presidency. Very comparable with Jimmy Carter (another disappointment).
