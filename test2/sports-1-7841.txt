The Los Angeles Lakers of 1999-2003 undoubtedly featured some of the most talented players ever to play on the hardcourt, one of which was DEFINITELY NOT Rick Fox. Rick Fox, when all is said and done, was a supreme moocher on a largely dominant team, and rarely was he a key contributor to the team's success. It was surprising this conceited moocher and prima donna had the gall to talk the most trash like he does (and yet can't back up anything BY HIMSELF). He ought to shut up and not get punk'd by players he considers himself superior to (like Doug Christie)- but in reality, all of today's players are far better than the ex-Mr. Vanessa Williams.
