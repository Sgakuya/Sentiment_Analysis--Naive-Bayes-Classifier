This company has neither the product or the service to stay in business. I reserved a SUV on their web site for their LAX location. When I arrived I was treated to a two hour wait. This is due to the fact that they never have more than two people working the 6-8 counters they have. I was first told, that I didn't have a reservation. So I showed my printed reservation with reservation number. Then I was told that I made this reservation on someone else's web site, and therefore it didn't count. I pointed out that their URL/domain name was on the bottom of the printout and I DID NOT use another web site, though even if I did? Finally, I was told they didn't have any cars left. If this all of this dodging wasn't enough, the customer dis-service lady addeded, it was my fault for not calling to make sure my car was here. Obviously, reservation means something different on planet advantage rent a car. Incredibly rude, incredibly shifty, willing to say anything to shirk their responsibilty. You do not wan to have anything to do with this company.
