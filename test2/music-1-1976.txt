Saw it here, went to the ourladypeace website to check it out. Sorry, don't like it. Sounds like an amateur new-age musician trying to play grunge. Too whiny, and the back beat is too shallow. Needs to add some tonal depth to his work. The lyrics were interesting, but not intriguing by any means; just shallow, like the music.
