If you have trouble getting into this recording it is only natural. Radiohead has sculpted a beautiful murky landscape that needs no traditional instruementation to help your ear lead the way through KID A. This album took me a long time to listen to and now I think of it as one of the greatest recordings of all time. I listen to KID A at least once a day and have so since it was released. Try to listen to one track at a time as if you were in a museum looking at a painting then put them all together and enjoy this masterpiece.
