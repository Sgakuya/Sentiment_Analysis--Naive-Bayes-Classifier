These guys started a revolution in rock with this CD. Look at all the bands derived from this album these days!! they were so creative and original, and sounded like noone else. Sort of what the new Finley Quaye 'vanguard' has done recently. These artists have saved rock and creative thinking from dissapearing.!!
