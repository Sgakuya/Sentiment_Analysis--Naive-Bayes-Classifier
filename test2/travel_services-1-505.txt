Terrible, terible, terrible. I am rating from this ariport, hijacking the high speed internet for frequent flyers from outside the lounge, some small solace for my unpleasant stopover here. The airport is all over the place, transfers are awkward and signs are totally counter-intuitive. Also, the staff are completely uncoordinated. I flew in from London, to transfer to the USA and I received no less than three different and contradictory sets of instructions from staff members on where to pick up my bags. Other staff members told me, with vacant smiles, to go down dead end corridors, fill out forms I did not need to. Very frustrating. They are rebuilding the place, I think, so maybe it will be decent in a few years.
