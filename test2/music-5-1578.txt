It's a great CD, depending on what kind of music you like. Although I was very disappointed when I accidently bought the piano CD of her album. I am not a piano fan! Some of the songs have a similar beat which gets a little irritating. The songs Bring me to life and My Immortal bring this rating to a 5. Great for people that love gothic music.
