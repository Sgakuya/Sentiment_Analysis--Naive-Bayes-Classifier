You want to know about Quizno's? I'll tell you: I use to work there (don't ask me why I was desperate, and it was a job) the preparation methods are sloppy and your food is handled by 4 different people, (unlike subway where you have one person making your food and you see it all done before you), plus the steak/beef/chunk chicken sandwich meats are dipped in this hot juice, which is not changed all day and if you get one after lunch hour I would not eat it. Yuck! Also, the quizno's i worked at was brand new, and I was treated miserably by the phony ass dreadlocked manager, who made me do all the sh*t work and then fired me for no good reason after I was working there 2 or 3 weeks( not including the month I waited between getting hired and starting the job- BS!) To top it all off, the guy cut me a personal check for a few hundred, and NEVER paid me a real paycheck. I never even got a tax form from these losers. He never even sent my w2 in, apparently. Sleazy outfit. Avoid!
