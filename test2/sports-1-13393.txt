bill is one of the luckiest coaches in history, he took over a team that had been groomed from the parcells era and got lucky. look at what he did to the browns?????????in 1993 when the team is 5-3 tied for the division lead, he cuts the starting all pro quarterback (bernie kosar) because of a "diminishing of skills", and THAT same qb signs with the cowboys because troy aikman got hurt and saves the season and the nfc title game for the cowboys? and what does he have for an answer after cutting bernie? VINNY TESTAVERDE?????????????? what a horrible move as we all know and the browns still havent recovered since that time! he left cleveland a toxic wasteland when all was said and done! bill is the most over rated coach in history. he was supposed to take over the jets after parcells and then he changed his mind because he knew if he didnt walk in to an already established team his coaching days would be over if he failed again like he did in cleveland, then he gets the PATS. HE IS CREDITED for putting tom brady in and giving him a shot at the starting position. HE HAD NO CHOICE!!!!!!!DREW BLEDSOE GOT HURT!! then when brady got hurt drew bledsoe won the afc champ game on a brilliant performance. drew bledsoe won games for that team too! drew could have just as easily gone on that run the pats have just like brady. bill isnt the genius you think he is.he is lucky. oh yeah ,his personality is to DIE for also, ive seen better press confrences from tarzan at least tarzan grunts loud enough so you can hear him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
