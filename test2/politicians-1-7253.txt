Jesse Jackson does more to disenfranchise blacks than anyone in America. His entire agenda revolves around creating legitimacy for his own position as spokesman for the black community. He thrives on pursuing an agenda of entitlements, quotas, and welfare rather than working with people to help them help themselves. He is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the truly great black leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Booker Washington, and Colin Powell. Jesse needs to get a job.
