So brought Peter Gabriel back to the forefront of the music scene in 1986 even though he had an earlier minor hit single with Shock The Monkey. This full-length release contained three huge tracks, namely Sledgehammer, In Your Eyes, and Big Time. Two of the other more notable tracks are Red Rain and Gabriel's duet with Kate Bush on Don't Give Up. This release is clearly Gabriel's most accessible efforts and remains the best place to start when considering your initial Peter Gabriel purchase.
