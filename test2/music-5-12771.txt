An excellent album. Almost poetry at points and the beats were so original. Too bad Lauryn thought she actually had talent and wasn't just a voice. Probably for the better, he Beyonce-esque attitude would have certainly ruined any further efforts by this group. As it stands this album will exist as one of the tightest, most original R&B pieces of our time.
