He kept his employment up while attempting (and failing) to do something abouth the unemployment. Actually more and more people are needed to keep track of the ever rising unemployment rate! I also fear that the German infamous angst of Auslander (foreigners) will re-appear because more end more of them are coming in. Put these 2 together and you got a problem...I am not sure whether Gerhard will be able to deal with this issue.
