I remember when I first heard this album back in 1995 or so, I was kind of embarrassed that I liked it. It was so catchy, so poppy, and so blatantly targeted towards the teenage girl market, that it just didn't make any sense that I liked it. Now, five years later, I still listen to this CD all the time. There are so many good tracks on the album - from the Sweater Song, to No One Else, to In the Garage - in it's own little poppy way, this album is a masterpiece.
