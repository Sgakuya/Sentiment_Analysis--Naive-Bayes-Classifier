This is by far the worst in the Final Fantasy series, and I have played them all except one. The game is way too easy, and it has a lousy battle system and a cheesy storyline. Each time you use magic you have to sit and watch the spell or monster go through their animation - this is fine at first but later on it becomes very tedious. A truly lousy game filled with uninteresting characters that are masked by excellent graphics.
