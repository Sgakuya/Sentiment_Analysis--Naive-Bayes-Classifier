They cancelled a flight due to a strike and didn't tell us. They made no effort to get us alternative transportation. Then they only refunded my money for that leg of the flight after months of effort. They claimed that leg amounted to only $40 for me and my wife combined. Meanwhile, we racked up >$400 in expenses to get to where we were going.
