The statistics that all you liberals despise so much DO NOT LIE!No matter what he says or the front he put on during the convention he will raise taxes, he is for abortion, he is for gun control and he is for gay marriage. He voted AGAINST the Laci Petterson bill.He is bad for the economy, bad for small business, and bad for families.America has no room for the 1# tax and spend liberal!Mr. Kerry needs to quit blaming Bush for sending jobs oversees and take a look at his lovely wife's business ventures!Update:This man won't even stand up and defend our flag!He voted to not allow a vote on the banning of burning our beloved flag!Update:Now Kerry is blaming Bush for the lack of flu vaccinations.There is one person that started this mess!Her name is Hillary Clinton.Her government plan for child vaccines failed.It tought US companies that there was no money in them so they went overseas.Kerry needs to tell the truth on this one.Bottom line thanks to Hillary the vaccines are now done overseas!Nice try Hanoi John!!Update:DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO KERRY WILL HAVE IN HIS CABINET???****Sen. John F. Kerry's grade average at Yale University was virtually identical to President Bush's record there, despite repeated portrayals of Kerry as the more intellectual candidate during the 2004 presidential campaign.Kerry had a cumulative average of 76 and got four D's his freshman year in geology, two history courses and political science.
