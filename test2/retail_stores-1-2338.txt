Corvallis store is filthy dingy and dark.The management and customer service are horrible.The checkers have bad attitudes.Produce is dirty and empty spacmost the time.Bakery is there one??????What a joke.Pizza manager has a nasty atitude I pity her crew.Then also all the things that brought us there is taking us away.Short or fast check outs now the orange carry baskets and the list goes on.
