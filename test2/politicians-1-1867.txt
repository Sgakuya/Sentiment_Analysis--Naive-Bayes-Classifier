One star is 4 points too many! How did Oklahomans vote in such a doo-daa? He looks like a little kid, has no personality and reflects the same damn good-old-boy image as other Okie politicians. No one even knows if he has filled all of his cabinet positions as of yet! What a joke! Oh well, we have our Dome! Another joke!
