ok, i'm not an american, so i can give it to you lot straight. evreybody hates you, America. everybody hates Bush. you, under the leadership of Bush and the american way, are destroying the planet and millions of people. all we hear aout from you are how evil the world is, and how could the barbarians of the rest of the world take these precious american lives. why are american lives valued so very much higher than people of another nationality. you know, america spends more on defence than the next eight highest defence spenders in the world put together, and if americans just used that money to, hmmm let me think, help people of other nationalities rather than bombing their countries into the ground. that might help. maybe realising that america isn't the master race, you might use your unimaginable wealth to help feed the people who really need help. america uses up more than 25% of the worlds resources, and creates 33% of the wrlds pollution, but has only 4% of the worlds population. remember: 1. saddam is not hitler, bush is not churchill, there is virtually no relationship. 2. there would be less terrorism if america wasn't so damn arrogant and uncaring and maybe tried to help the world, ie. go to the world summit, sign the kyoto trety. 3.Smericans could sleep a lot safer in their beds if bush wasn't president. 4. an iraqi/african/french/japanese/korean/human life is JUST AS VALUABLE AS AN AMERICAN LIFE 5. bush really, really is an idiot. and N korea wouldn't be developing nukes if bush had carried on the negotiations clinton started.
