Everyone is bad mouthing him and somehow he's still a 2.69 on this rating scale?!!? Isn't that just the epitome of his whole career? You think everyone hates him and everything he does is abhorrent and yet he manages to stay right about in the middle if not a little above average. Slick Willy it is! All I can say is it was bad enough when he was elected the first time but at least then I was able to spend most of my time out of the country, but the second time around it was just astounding. We're just gluttons for punishment I guess.
