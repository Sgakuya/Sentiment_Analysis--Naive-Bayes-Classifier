Cold Stone is the Hollywood of ice cream. All special effects. It is precisely those effects (the heath bars, milky ways, various chips and candies, etc., which distract the customer from realizing that the basic ice cream is utterly mediocre. I tried a simple scoop of plain mint, no chips, and actually got odd looks from the clerk (he was nice but almost seemed so brainwashed by the sales routines they rehearse, that any deviation from the over-the-top menu threw him off base). The ice cream looked more like green mashed potatoes and had a consistency of gum....not even very cold. I came to the conclusion after only a spoonful, that this company relies on it's fixings and fillers to do its work. Without the aid of all the toppings and edible bells and whistles, the product can't hold up to even the simplest of flavors at a Hershey's store, or the quality store-bought brands like Bryer's. A second trip proved just as lame when I tried the more promising Coffee Lover's cup. Loved the Heath bar crushed in it, liked the caramel sauce....but funny enough, the last thing I liked was the ice cream itself. That is like saying wow, great ketchup, hated the burger!! To sum it up: Don't be fooled by the Emperor's New Clothes of ice cream. No amount of in-store singing will have me singing Coldstone's praises. Good Humor, anyone?
