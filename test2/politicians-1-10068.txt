flack-looking for intelligent discourse? try getting off this message board and talking to real people. hmm, a well-thought out, substantiated criticism. this WILL be tough...but give me one minute. DOH! 1. used a national tragedy for political gain and in so doing completely erased a fountain of international good-will and divided a once united country 2. pandered to cultural wedge issues like 'family values' while systematically dismantling the middle class and the american dream (for a brief overview, read 'what's the matter with kansas') 3. encouraged anti-intellectualism movement while at the same time posing as an education president (see his statements on evolution, railings against 'elites' - which is rich for an ivy league MBA from a wealthy family, his childish pleasure on being a c-student, unwillingness to fund his education bills, or any public presentation) 4. Created the biggest govt of all time while blaming everything that is wrong on big 'liberal' govt 5. as far as positives, the only thing i can honestly think of is his initial response in going after osama in afghanistan - which i steadfastly supported. since then, he's botched just about everything, but hey, it's hard work, and we're working hard. there's more, obviously. but the point of the matter is, why are you conservatives still bitching so much? you have all 3 branches of govt and have had it your way for minimum of the last 12 years or so. Somehow though, you still feel the need to blame the vast left-wing conspiracy for the failings of your own hand-picked conservatives. at any rate, the conservatives are winning the culture war. sit back, enjoy the fruits of your labor, reap what you sow, but quit bitching at us when your own govt screws you.
