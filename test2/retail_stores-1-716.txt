Old Navy is horrible! Their clothes don't last for more than a few months! I bought a couple of polo shirts there about a year ago, and after wearing and washing them a few times, they shrunk up into almost nothing, the bottoms of the shirts curled upwards, and they faded all out. My fiance also bought some boxer shorts there, and they ended up ripping after a few months of wear. I know that it is suppossed to be a discount version of the Gap, but come on. I'm sure that clothes from Walmart would even last longer!
