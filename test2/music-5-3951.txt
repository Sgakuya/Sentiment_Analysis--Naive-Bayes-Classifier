Released in 1986, Graceland was one of the best releases of the 1980s and won a well deserved grammy for best release for that year. The South African influenced sound was unique and varied from track one until track eleven, experimenting with both mbaqanga and zydeco fusion. The release includes some of Simon's most well known singles (Graceland, Diamonds In The Soles Of Her Shoes, and You Can Call Me Al); however, my personal favorite track from this release remains All Around The World.
