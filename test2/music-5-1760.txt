This album has caused a lot of Radiohead fans to look deeper into their musical taste, forget the thrashing guitars of The Bends and what I consider a shaky change-over when OK Conputer was born. I wasn't keen on OK Comp, although a couple of tracks did stand out to be really good and those tracks were the hesitant start to really making music that makes sense. That is what Kid A does, it makes sense, but only if you can beat your prejudices and be willing to be moved.
