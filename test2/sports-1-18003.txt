Is this the worst team in the history of the NFL? Hell, they just might be the worst team in the history of Football. I would even go as far as saying that theyae the worst team in the history of sports!! What this team needs is to fire the OWNER Bill Bidwell. He knows nothing about building a successfull football team. In the time it took him to get a stadium approved (much less built), Jerry Colango built two stadiums, brought the SUNS to edge of Victory, brought MLB to Phoenix and won a World Series championship. It is a fact that if the Cardinals went undefeated for the next 25 years, they would still have an over-all losing record. Don't blame to coach, even though he isn't very good, and neither will be the next one, or the one after that, or the one after that. Compared to this team, the CUBS look successfull in terms of winning championships. Having this team in my hometown makes me sick. Hey, with any luck, they'll move to LA soon. I hear they are desperate for an NFL team. Well, maybe not this team!! My grandmother's nursing home team could beat these loosers, even playing shorthanded. Once, the other team was leading by 66 points and left field with 4 minutes to play in the game. The Cards scored 5 plays later!! And that was only a field goal!!
