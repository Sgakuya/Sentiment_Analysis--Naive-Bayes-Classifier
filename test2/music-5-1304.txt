David Bowie is one of the most talented people in the world, and this stage character (Ziggy Stardust) proves that statement. So unique, and brilliant it will never be forgotten. I have always been an outcast and I discovered I was not alone when i discovered him. So insperational, if i could give him a rating better then 5, then i would. And his music is just amazing. His voice is beautiful and his lyrics are meaningful and quite amazing.
