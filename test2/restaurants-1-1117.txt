Ate at the newly opened Popeye's in Rogers, AR. First and last time I go there. Floor was filthy, cleanup people used their hands to wipe off the tables, cashier put thumb in my empty cup as she handed it to me, employee uniforms were spotted with sauce, grease, etc... Where's the Health Department? The manager was there....yakkin' with the help... Lady in front of me was comlaining about her order... I should have gone across the street to WENDY'S.
