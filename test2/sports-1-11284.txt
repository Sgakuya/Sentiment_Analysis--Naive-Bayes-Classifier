WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????????? Chan Gailey?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Is this a joke or something. He hasnt won 8 games at GT and he is in the top 35? What kind of crackhead would rate him a 5 or 4 or 3 *s. Until he gets a quality win(preferibly wins) thenI will consider him a decent coach. Come on Tommy Bowden is better than this.
