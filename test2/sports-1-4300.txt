I just love Tubby Smith. I mean, when you've been coaching as long as this guy, you just know how to win ballgames. Sure, you may only beat Odom's South Carolina team by 2 points at home in Kentucky, but a win is a win right? Also, as a Tarheel fan I sympathize with Kentucky because I, like many Kentucky fans, also hate Christian Laettner. Do you know who else hates Christian Laettner? Jesus Christ. And also that rapper Jawz of Life. And Jamal Mashburn hates him too. Go Monster Mash!
