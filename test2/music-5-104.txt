One of the top three R.E.M. efforts (along with Murmur and Life's Rich Pageant). I remember in 1992 when this CD first came out, I listened to it constantly. I had just graduated from college, and the dark, mellow, brooding sound turned out to be a perfect complement to my confused state of mind at the time. The only song on the CD that I actively dislike is Everybody Hurts - it's overplayed and it's becoming progressively more annoying with age. Other than that, I think this CD is amazing and enduring.
