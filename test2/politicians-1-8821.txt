If you think Clinton was a great president, look back to 2000 when he was done with his 8 years, how was the country? Horrible, G.W. came in and got blamed for everything, Bill Clinton would have drove this country into the ground if he would have ran another term, John Kerry will do the same if he gets elected, DON'T YOU PEOPLE GET IT BY NOW, DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS WILL RUIN THIS COUNTRY!!!
