poor George, He's just not very smart and has a very short attention span and memory. His involvement with Funeralgate, Raintree, insider trading, draft dodging, drug abuse, adultery and big favors to those who donate millions to his political campains should be a cause for great concern to voters who are in search of restoring integrity and dignity to the White House. This year I will have to vote for the lesser of the two evils, Gore.
