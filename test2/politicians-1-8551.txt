Really one of the worst we ever had. EVERYONE is speaking out now about how we should bomb Afghanistan back to the Stone Age because they killed 6 or 7 thousand people, but very few spoke out when Reagan and his cronies aided in the killing of HUNDREDS of thousands of innocent citizens in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, etc. Overall, he was a simply horendous president in every sense of the word. Plus, flyme121-axlrod2003 is right, the great wall of China still is standing. (And you say I don't have a clue...)
