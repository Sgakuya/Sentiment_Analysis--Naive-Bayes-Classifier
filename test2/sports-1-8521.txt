MY my what progress we have made in the area of civil rights. Now, instead of white rednecks walking away from murder charges for hanging blacks every time they felt like it, you got prominent black guys like OJ nd Kobe murdering and raping with impunity and simply walking away from the charges, all because they have money. Meanwhile, only about one in 8 people on Death Row could be considered Caucasian in country where still over 75% of all citizens are white as wonder bread... See how far we have come... down?
