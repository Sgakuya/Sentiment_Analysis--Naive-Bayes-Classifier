In my opinion, Abbey Road is The Greatest Rock/Pop Album Ever Recorded. After raising the bar with Sgt. Pepper, they proved just how much they could do with this beauty. Come Together is a classic opener with John's charged vocals and Paul's chunky bass lines. Something, George's second best song (on the album, and overall), comes next- 'tis a wonderful melody, and I always love to hear George's voice. Maxwell's Silver Hammer is a blast, Oh! Darling is a fun tune, in which Paul promises he'll never whack her with any silver hammers and I'm starting to enjoy Octopus's Garden more and more. I Want You (She's So Heavy) is a great energized song which starts vamping until Here Comes the Sun, one of those feel-good songs that just makes you want to cry. It was actually written about freedom from so many Apple Records contracts, and I like to think the song is saying here comes THE SECOND SIDE. And the atmospheric Because comes next followed by the series of ingenius melodies that made this album famous. We don't know what they're talking about, but it's good, whatever it is. Golden Slumbers is wonderful, and in my interpretation, Her Majesty is explaining the whole concept of the album, and if you look into it, it could just be about a little relationship explained in this simple melody. And they left out the last low D. It blows me mind. A great piece of work.
