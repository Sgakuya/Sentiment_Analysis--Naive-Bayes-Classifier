When I found my diamond wedding band at whitehall I was so happy, that is until 2 weeks after the wedding the diamonds started to fall out... When i brought it back they replaced 3 diamonds when only 2 had fallen out and the replacements were yellow. Three times I had to go back, and my ring still has a whole in it... the management was rude and did not want to take responsibility for their product, now instead of something I am proud of i tend to hide my ring to avoid embarrassing comments.
