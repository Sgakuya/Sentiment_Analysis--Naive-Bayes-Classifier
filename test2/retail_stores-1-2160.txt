I can't get over how bad things have gotton in my area. My region has gone to hell. The stores are a mess, and all the veteran managers are not being fired, but quitting in a fit of rage! As far as I'm concerned, I really enjoy my job at the shack, as long as I can stay out of view of the bigshots (Jim Bradley) Cause all they want you to do is sell Phones and Satallite dishes. That's it. So to tell you the truth, I do things my own way. If your not in my store to A.)Buy at least 100 dollars worth of stuff, B.)Buy a cell phone, C.)Buy a Dish... Well than f*ck off and dont expect my help!!! Welcome to the world of commision. This is a great job, because no matter how shi*ty your personal life is, you always have the customers at your store to take it out on!!! You should see the way I treat the ones who are looking for fuses! If they want a fuse, they can go find it theirselves, or I'll just tell them that I don't have that one! This is funny, cause I am one of the top selling full timers in the whole f*cking district! I will continue to treat all the low paying customers like s*it, UNTIL JIM BRADLEY IS GONE! AND GIVES ME A WRITTEN APOLIGY!
