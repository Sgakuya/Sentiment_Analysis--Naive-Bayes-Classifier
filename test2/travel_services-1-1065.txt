I recently moved with Transit Systems across the country and had a horrible experience. They bill themselves as the "small move specialists" but have no experience to back that up. My move took over 2 months door to door, with a final price 2x the initial quote. If you are currently in talks with them, stop immediately. They are a 3rd party shipper that contracts your move out to larger companies that operate their own trucks like North American Van Lines, Beakins, and United Van Lines. To quote the driver who delivered my load, "my advise is next time go straight to one of the majors." I whole heartedly agree. You won't regret taking my advice.
