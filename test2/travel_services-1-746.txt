LAX is nothing but a hustle. Long, slow line. I listened while they tried hustling everybody into a more expensive car. We specifically reserved a convertible for our vacation. They tried hustling us into two other deals before admitting, after 15 minutes of waiting, that they didn't have our car. Offered us a 'luxury' car, then tried to slip in a different one when they didn't have that one either.
