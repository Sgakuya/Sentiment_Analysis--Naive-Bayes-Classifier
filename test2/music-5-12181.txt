I am a music fan and I would like to say thatCarl thomas is my man. That albulm is off the hook. I've got to give him his props I always listen to his album.My dad chipped it(he likes it too)but it's still hanging in there.I'm going to buy another soon. My favorite songs and rate Emotional Superstar **Giving you all of my love**( that song touched me) Woke up in the morning. If your'e reading this, just get the albulm. It was truly worth it!!! Sad'e
