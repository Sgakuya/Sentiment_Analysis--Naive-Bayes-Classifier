I'm a retired military manof over 22 years. My OFFICIAL TOUR in Vietnam was 366 days. I believe that was the same (minimum) for a few million other Veterans. Granted..AlGore went to the 'nam, because his Daddy told him to Get His Ticket Punched for future political insurance. Did he serve in combat? Was he placed in harmes way? Debatable. What has he REALY accomplished? He's been a politician ALL OFF HIS LIFE..except for that Summer Job on that Nashville newspaper.Does he know what thr REAL WORLD IS. And what about Social Security? I didn't know that is was GOING ANY Where!. What of the SURPLUS where did it come from? It came from cutting and not providing the benefits promissed to the military and the military retirees, and many other deserving groups. The Clinton addministration has only helped them selves and thier employees. The United Staes (which I proudly served, for over 20 years..does not deserve more of this socialistic addministration. Even some of his past surrorters admit that He ought to GIVE IT UP. George W has won the Electorial Votes. It's time to move on
