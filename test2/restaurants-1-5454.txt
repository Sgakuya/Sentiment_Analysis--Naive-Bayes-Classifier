One word describes this entire tired greasy-spoon chain very well - UGH! We have had fun counting them on I-95 on our way from Florida to Maryland (about 110, I think) and elsewhere, but that is about it. They are usually inhabited by creepy people nursing coffee all night long (bums?) and their menu is gross, just like their interiors and exteriors are similarly unappealing...
