The Rev. Jesse jackson is a racial bigot. He has always created racial conflicts, rather than approach the matter in a Christian manner. Where was he educated? The minorities are no longer minorities. He involves himself in matters that are best left to an individual who is not racial bias. He continually attacks individuals he believes are bigoted against blacks. He needs to look in the mirror. Many blacks believe him a joke. He wants a position of power, and I believe had Gore been elected he would have been named to his cabinet or as ambassador. He speaks of equality, but his words have a taint. He speaks of Christianty, but his believes and again words are shallow. He is self gratifying, power hungry, shallow, and of questionable accomplishments.
