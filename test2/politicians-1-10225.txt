What LaDeeda said times ten. Dubya's grandpappy Prescott Bush supported the Nazis, and apparently Dubya learned a lot from ol' Grampa. To everything LaDeeda already said I would add--Bush violated one of the most sacred tenets of Americanism by sanctioning torture of prisoners in Iraq and Guantanamo. Hey, southernwoman, if Saddam was so well supplied to make war and threaten the US, did it just like slip his mind to use it all when he had an actual war on his hands? Hmm, maybe he was just saving it for later, I suppose. Or, as Dubya and his cronies would have us believe, rather than use his weapons he hid them just so that America would look bad. George W. Bush reincarnated the Divine Right of Kings by claiming that God wanted him to be president. Well, I'm pretty sure that there was some sort of supernatural being involved, but I think it was the one with the horns. God probably would have done it the old-fashioned way--by having his guy get more actual votes than the other guy. Remember in November, it's time to G.R.O.W. America (Get Rid Of W)
