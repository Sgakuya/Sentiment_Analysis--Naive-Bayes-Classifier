We just completed a move to Istanbul Turkey with Wheaton. it was a horrid experience. We were misquoted for the door to door service. Experienced nearly $5,000 in cost overruns, incredible dammage to the furniture and lost items that were never received. The best part of the experience was the caviler attitude of Bud Cardone the Sr. VP in basically saying too bad! Now we are engaged in a wonderful experience attempting to gain compensation with the insurance carrier that is none to interested in helping. What an awful experience and one that should be avoided at all cost to anyone contemplating Wheaton ans their mover.The shame is that the web site leads one to believe that this company is a favored, professional company. Nothing is further from the truth!
