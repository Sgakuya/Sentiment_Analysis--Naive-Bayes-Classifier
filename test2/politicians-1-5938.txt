If there was ever any proof that american voters are morons it is Ted Kennedy. Specifically those in Massachusetts. How can those morons keep re-electing this loser? Kennedy hasn't had a clue what the average man is thinking or wanting since the the early 60s. He looked deep into the bottom of his bottle for decades and still hasn't found it. Since it is obvious that they will just keep electing this nitwit I can only hope for a heart attack or some other event that removes this dufus from our political system. Kennedy is one of those rare politicians that is SO bad ANYONE who replaces him is an improvement.
