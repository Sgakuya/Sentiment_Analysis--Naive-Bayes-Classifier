We live about three minutes away from the local Price Chopper. It used to be my favorite grocery store. It had great selections to choose from and the meats, baked goods, and produce were beautiful.The store was clean and neatly organized. The employees were very helpful and friendly and they acted like they actually wanted my business. I went there all the time to do my shopping. Unfortunately, in the past year or so, management at the local PC has apparently changed. The quality of the meats, baked goods, and produce have become very poor. The shelves always look dirty and unorganized. It's hard to find anything anymore. The employees are lazy and even downright rude. They never have any lines open. The last straw for me came about four months ago when an employee told my 3 year-old niece to Shut the f*** up, you stupid little b****! because she was singing to her doll while we were in line. I left empty-handed that day and have yet to return. I now drive the extra 10-15 minutes to the local Shaw's. They treat me with respect there.
