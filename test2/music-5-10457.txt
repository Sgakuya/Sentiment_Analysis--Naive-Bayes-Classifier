I had almost forgotten what a REAL voice was - REAL singing, until I was re-introduced to this young man's incredible voice on his PBS Special. When you hear - and see - him adjacent to other 'pop stars, there is simply no comparison. HE has a VOICE. He is very young, so I anticipate an artistic growth over the years to come which will no doubt bring us even more delights.
