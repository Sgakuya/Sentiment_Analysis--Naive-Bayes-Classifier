He cannot be honest with the American people, he is a horrible public speaker, a terrible example for today's youth, he sends American troops into another Vietnam and calls it the pursuit of freedom, he avoided vietnam like a coward, he has never worked a day in his life, and he is only president because his Daddy is rich and has many other rich wastes of life in high places. Other than that, I like oil for life president.
