The Clintons owe Ms. Reno. Here's the scenario. Step one: The Clinton's ( both lawyers ) do something bad ( laymen's term for illegal or just inappropriate ) Step two: They get caught ( Hey this tatic worked in Arkansas ) Step three: Reno's got to investigate, so she calls for all of the papers, computer files, phone logs, security logs, etc. Step four: Shred, delete and misplace evidence like the dickens. Taking several weeks. Step five: Filter evidence one more time before it goes public. Step six: Give information to Justice Department ( Clinton's now smiling ) Step seven: Review information. Step eight: Claim there's not enought evidence to warrant a continued investigation. Step nine: Call the media and collaborate your story ( That's the vast right wing conspiracy ) Reno needs to be tracked down and investigated. ( No shredding allowed )
