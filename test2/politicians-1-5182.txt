As a retired military man, Gore is just another example of non-existent leadership this country does not need. Eight years of a draft dodger and now Gore's slap in the face trying to throw out our absentee ballots. Gore and the rest of the Clinton-Gore brigade will not be happy until they run the entire country into the ground for their own personal reasons. They do not care about any of us regardless of party affliation. People just don't get it!
