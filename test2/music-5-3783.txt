A great album. One of Floyd's finest moments. Only four actual songs (one consisting of nine movements split into two halfs). The one factor that makes this album so great is the fact that it's an ode to a friend...Syd Barrett. The whole album was written with the former Floyd frontman in mind. You start by remembering the past ( Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pt.I - V), the trapping of music business ( Welcome to the Machine, Have A Cigar ), longing for a friend ( Wish You Were Here ), and future high hopes for a friend ( Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pt. VI - IX). Very soulful and honest! Great musicianship!
