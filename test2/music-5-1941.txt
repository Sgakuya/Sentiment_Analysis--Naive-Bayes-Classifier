Our Lady Peace's new album, while sounding different from Naveed, Clumsy or Happiness, is still one of the most amazing albums i've ever bought. Even though it's partially based on Ray Kurzweil's the age of spiritual machines , it still has a lot of elements that aren't from the book. best of all, it makes you think. it's also uplifting, even though it might not sound so at first-- it's all messed up, but we're alive.
