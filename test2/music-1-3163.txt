Soft-off mainstream pop garbage. Featuring clumsy ol' Mick, predictable Lindsay and menstrual Stevie. The album sounded like audio formica then, sounds like elevator music today. The songs have all the depth of a shot glass, all the emotional maturity of an autistic. This album was released in 1976, just a few months before the first mass-market records of punk rock and new wave hit the stores. This development, of course, made Rumours immediately dated, retro, old hat, corny and square. Interesting that there was no significant follow-up record to this release, which indicates this encarnation of FM shot its bolt entirely in less than 12 tracks. This is Bill and Hillary Clinton's favorite rock record, which tells you plenty.
