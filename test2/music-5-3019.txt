I read somewhere that George met his real-life wife-to-be whilst filming in the railway carriage in the movie (in which she appeared). The song in the scene - I Should Have Known Better - wasn't meant to be intellectual - it is youthful, energetic and fun, as is the album. Seeing the film when it came out in 1964 was a thrilling experience for virtually all of us back then. Doesn't this album's simplicity make you want to reach for your guitar, learn your 6 chords and start making music? It does me!
