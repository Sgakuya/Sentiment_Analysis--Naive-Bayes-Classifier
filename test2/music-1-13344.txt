You cant call this rap, hip hop, or anything positive. This CD is garbage.Im not hating at all, but Nelly lacks what is takes to be a true emcee..lyrics. The beats make you wanna jump up and down, but thats about it. He's original in delivary, Ill give him that. But overall, he's terrible. If you purchase rap based on beats and no talent, then this is the CD for you.
