Notwithstanding the suggestion that those who've weighed in with their negative impressions of Jesse are themselves ignorant, unchristian and poor spellers g ;---it cannot be denied that Jesse is a divisive force when used by the mainstream media. It seems obvious to me that Jesse is being used by them, and not vice-versa. That Jackson is considered by the Media to be a more legitimate spokesman for Black Americans than Keyes or Watts is revealing...and disturbing to many of us. But the blame cannot be placed on Jackson; it belongs on the powers behind that Media.
