On friday NOV 3 my 5 yr old niece went to a breakfast for Al Gore. Her mom,who is a student at Pen Valley Community college,got tickets. My niece was so happy when she was told that she was going to get to meet the vice president.She went to bed early so that she could get up yhe next morning before dawn.Now let me tell you what happened next. At 6:30am my sister and niece left the house so that they could go stand in line,they stood there for two hours in the cold with tickets in hand.Then, someone came out and said the place was full, now you would think what kind of idiot would print more tickets than the place could hold? You know that if it happened at a conceret,play, football game,baseball game, or any other event people would not be happy. But thats not what happened. You see, they weren't even asking to see tickets. 3 woman my mom works with went and no one even asked to see there tickets. It turns out that they only gave out tickets so that they could collect names and numbers of people. You see they need volunteets on election day. Why did they have to lie? Why couldnt they just ask for help? It would of been alot better than bringing a 5yr old to tears. So now she thinks that the goverment is full of mean unfair people. Thanks Vice president Gore for helping to make young people believe in the system.
