Carr needs to be replaced becuase the game has passed him by just like the rest of the Big Ten. He is out to lunch when it comes to getting his players ready to compete. 0-6 in road openers in the last 6 years. The play calling is terrible. vs ND the call sends a TE on a 4 yard out? Hello you needed 15 for the chains to move. He needs to go and Michigan needs to hire a new coach. The game has passed him.
