Emmit Smith isn't even near the best Barry Sanders was way better he retired early look how long emmitt played thats not the best yardage for how long he played People who just might beat his easy to beat records will be one of these people i shall list......Curtis Martin, Ladanian Tomlinson, and Clinton Portis. These people are all better then Emmitt Smith. If you want to see true greatness look at people like Dan Marino who even at the end of his career stayed an outstanding player and had good passing yards for how long he played.
