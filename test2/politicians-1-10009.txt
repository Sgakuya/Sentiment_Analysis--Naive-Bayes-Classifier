There isn't a star low enough to reflect how I feel about this man, I can't believe he was elected once, let alone twice with his history of cowardice with the VN war, his history with booze and cocaine, and yet Repubs worship this little coward!! I will believe in his lies about Iraq and HIS war when I see his daughters going to fight in the front lines, until then this is just a teeny tiny little man (where it counts) who is trying to prove his is bigger than daddys by taking out the man daddy did not.
