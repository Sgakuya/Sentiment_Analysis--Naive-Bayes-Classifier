The best coffee, still worth the trip!!! Since they changed the donuts to those prefab slugs of starch, they are just terrible. No flavour, texture, not even real. Especially the apple fritters. This was the reason I would come there everyday - great donuts; great coffee. Now it is down to great coffee, I don't buy their donuts anymore... I'll go to a real donut place for donuts now. Hope Tim's doesn't lose all their coffee business because of the bad donuts - I would miss their coffee too if they went belly up because of BAD IMITATION DONUTS.
