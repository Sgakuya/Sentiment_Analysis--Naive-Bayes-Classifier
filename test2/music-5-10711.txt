Hanson did a great job on This Time Around. They are the greatest band to ever bless the music business!!!!! They are very talented. I respect the fact that they write and play their own music not many people their age can say that. I think they are in the business for all the right reasons. I like the fact that they have family values. And not to mention the fact that they are sooooo SEXY!!!!! All three of them man. It should be against the law to look that good :) THEY ROCK!!!!!
