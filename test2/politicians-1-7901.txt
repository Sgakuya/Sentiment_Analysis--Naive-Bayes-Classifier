Truman is not only the most uninteresting US President but also a complete non-entity that was selected by Roosevelt and Prendergast for precisely that attribute. He became a member of wildly corrupt Democrat Machine after losing the family farm, a small business and being penurious for most of his adult life. We are told to suspend our disbelief and imagine that that failed scion of Missouri was incorruptible whilst he cavorted with the corrupt bottom feeding dregs that habituate the Democratic Party in every age. Please you can t want us to be that na ve in this post-Clinton world. Truman continued the corrupt alliance with the diabolically evil Soviet Union and lost most of Eastern Europe in the process while he protected and advanced Soviet agent to the highest ranks of our government. His lackadaisical security effort allowed the Soviets to steal the atomic bomb secrets right from under our noses. He went on to misinterpret the issues in China and failed to adequately support the Kuomintang regime against Mao while precipitating a war in Korean by misleading North Korea and the Soviets. He was a vindictive miserable hater who enjoys such a sterling reputation because he did so much for our enemies and the left unlike the right never forget a friend or forgive an enemy.
