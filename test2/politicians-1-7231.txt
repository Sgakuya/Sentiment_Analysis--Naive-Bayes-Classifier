It saddens me that this man of GOD has done everything in his power to make me racist. I am 31, male, white and college educated. This is the pool of individuals that Mr. Jackson claims are evil in this world. It is a shame that he can make a blanket judgement on all people who do not share his views. I am not evil, I am not part of the system that keeps blacks down, I am not a racist. If this man was truly with GOD, he would heal, respect, love and charish all people, not just his people. PS. Blacks are not Mr. Jackson's people, we all are GOD's people.
