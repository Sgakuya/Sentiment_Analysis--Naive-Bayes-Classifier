Good Charlotte totally rule this world they are the best band ever and will always be my favourite!! one thing i dont get is why are people labelling them sayin theyre pop punk or just pop or punk rock! it dont matter what they are theyre themselves theyre GC are they are the best! they write their own songs and the lyrics are brilliant you can totally relate to the stuff they sing about! yes joel is very very hot but thats not y you should like GC you should like GC cos theyre out there doing what they like best they have worked hard to get this far and they deserve every penny they earn and every word of thanx they get! GC 4eva keep representin!
