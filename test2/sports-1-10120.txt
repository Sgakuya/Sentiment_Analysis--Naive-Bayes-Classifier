A hard nosed defensive coach who didn't need to cheat to be great........but he did. Auburn's now infamous little black book filled with the names of Auburn supporters that knowingly contribute cash to a fund to buy players with was one of the worst instances of cheating in NCAA history. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were used to buy players from Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. See '60 Minutes' interview with Erik Ramsay and hear the tapes of his conversations with then Asst. Coach and now Troy St. Coach Larry Blakeny. Disgusting!
