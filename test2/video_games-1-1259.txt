They still have this game? The ACLU hasn't filed a lawsuit making them call it single working woman or aging alternative choice chick or something? Well, even if they did change the name, I still don't think I'd care for it. Seems like a game with a streak of mean - singling out one type of person to poke fun at and perpetuate the image that women who do not marry are losers. But, if you want to stick with that idea, how about Boring Married Guy Planted on the Couch - now THERE S a game title for you!
