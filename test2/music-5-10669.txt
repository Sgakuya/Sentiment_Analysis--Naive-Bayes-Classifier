This is a fabulous CD, and I'm 40 years old. What an old bag! Anyway, Crutch rocks. Reminds of some of that good old fashioned guitar playing of my youth. Mad Season is intriguing, and, of course, Bent pulls everybody in. It'll probably get way overplayed, but this is the best CD I've jogged to in a long time. Rob Thomas is a poet with a sexy, throaty voice. Maybe I'm going through my mid-life crisis. Oh, by the way, Rest Stop lyrics will really make you think.
