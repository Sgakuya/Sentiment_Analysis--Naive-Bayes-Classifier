I laughed out loud at Virile Vagabond's comment that all things must pass, including food from MacDonald's. In my experience, which is very very seldom these days, MacDonald's food can pass through you pretty damn quickly. UPDATE: Highly amused by the periodic comments on here suggesting this aorta clogging, colon plugging garbage is good for you. Stick another Big Mac down your necks, folks, you'll get more benefit out of it than a brisk walk. LOL.
