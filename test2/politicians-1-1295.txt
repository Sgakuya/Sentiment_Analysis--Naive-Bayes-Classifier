I am completely troubled by the comments pro-Castro. For godsake, read the Human Rights Watch and State Department reports--political prisoners are jailed and tortured. Those with AIDS are also thrown in jail. If things are so wonderful, why is it that he has to keep his people locked onto the island, drowning those who try to flee (see State Dept. report for details)?
