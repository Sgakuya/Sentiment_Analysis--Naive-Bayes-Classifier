Another lying, cheating sleazy politician. Is anyone really shocked? His wife must be a real fruitcake. That is the ultimate and most unforgivable betrayal.UPDATE: Any man who will lie to and cheat on his own family will lie to and cheat anyone.UPDATE: One more thing and then I will shut up. When we find out that a pastor/evangelist cheats and lies we know better than to believe them again. If we do business with someone who ends up cheating and lying to us we know better than to believe them again, but let a 'politician' get caught in the most disgusting acts of cheating and lying are we to act as if they are honest and faithful in all the other important areas? I think not.
