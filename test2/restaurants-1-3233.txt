Papa Johns Pizza used to be relatively great to order from. Great quality food, decent prices. So, what happened? Seems that the local shops aren't managed like they used to be. Quality has dropped so low that they've removed the 800-number from their website (877-547-7272 if you're interested - check out archive.org and see for yourselves). That number now goes to a box telling people to submit an online complaint form which, as we all know, is shrugged off without a second thought. Problems with our local shops? Numerous. Burnt/raw pizza and sticks, inept staffing, PRICE SWITCHING after the order is taken (confirmed on two separate occasions, the second one was changed BY THE GENERAL MANAGER!), and overall shoddy cooking materials. Plus, the price isn't what it used to be (even with coupons). In conclusion, pass on Papa Johns. You can do better - like throwing a frozen in the oven. Here's a few numbers I've gathered if the online complaint form isn't doing it for you: (502) 261-7272 - Corporate 888-777-7272 - Complaints (11a-3p EST - great hours!)
