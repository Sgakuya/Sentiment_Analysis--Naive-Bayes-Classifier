This song is ONE OF THE WORST songs I have ever heard. Not only is it discusting, but Britney is dressed like a skank and is dancing(if you can call it that) like a hoe in the music video. Oh, and the way she looks, thats original! Blonde hair and super skinny. There we go. That gives a good image to younger girls! Her music is very original to, all about boys and sex, where have I heard that before?!
