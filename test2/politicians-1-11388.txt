Let me start off by saying I am a conservative republican who lives in Massachusetts and all I have to say is this man does not represent me. He is a propagandist if there ever was one, no problem with social security? then how come every so many years taxes have to go up to pay for it? Now it is in real trouble with really not enough people to fund it. Iraq is no quagmire, the elections went very well and the council is beginning to write a Constitution. This guy needs to get his head out of the gutter and face facts, and get the bottle away from his lips and sobre up. We should enact term limits here in Massachusetts just to keep idiots like this from having their life-long profession be that of an idiotic senator.
