Quentin Tarantino came up aces with his choice of actors, his story, his movie and his soundtrack for Pulp Fiction. He has barely done anything noticeable since this movie and people still talk about him. The soundtrack plays a huge part in that. Choosing Dick Dale's Misirlou to open the movie during the robbery was genius! A great ride with great tunes! Bravo!
