Radiohead has done it again with this breathtakingly beutiful soundscape! I found it to be a bit more accessable than Kid A , that is I liked it a lot when I first listened to it, but perhaps I was more prepared this time around! Nevertheless, it still sounds better and better each subsequent time I listen to it. It contains some tracks that are just as jarring and unexpected (perhaps even moreso) as those on Kid A such as the Electronic gnashing and distorted spoken word on Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors , the techno/gamelan ambience of the opening track, Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box , and the backwards musical and vocal tracks on Like Spinning Plates . At the same time, Amnesiac offers slightly more conventional fare like the soothing and strangely optimistic (for Thom Yorke) piano ballad, Pyramid Song, which boasts a hummable melody and Jonny Greenwood's skillfuly dramatic string arrangement. The songs Knives Out and I Might Be Wrong offer dancable beats and more rock-oriented arrangements, but still sound far from passe or typical. Radiohead even shows some jazz influence with You And Whose Army and the closing track Life In A Glass House , a New Orlean's funeral march with wry, insightful lyrics. While not as thematically solid as Kid A , Amnesiac is much more diverse and even more creative. I think that it's Radiohead's greatest album so far!
