IF ANY CITIZEN OF THE U.S. HAD TO APPLY FOR A JOB THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE THEIR RESUME. wHAT i WANT TO KNOW IS WHY DOES Bush not have to give his resume? How did he do in college? What was his G.P.A? What is his history? What drugs did he take? What kind of man is he? Seems two-faced!! SHALLOW!! Expecting from others what he can't deliver! The rest of us can't get jobs without a resume, why should the future President of the U.S., not have to sudmit a resume??
