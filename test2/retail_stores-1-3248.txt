I've stopped doing with this company recently after they refused to refund my money for a defective video tape. The manager instead insist that I pay $7 for damage that is not responsibility. After about 10 years as a customer, they'd rather call me a liar and steal $7 from my credit card (at least the clerk theatened to do that) than give me the benefit of the doubt. Any company that stupid doesn't deserve my business and they are not getting any more of it.
