I am no doubt Nelly's biggest fan!I have a book with Nelly and the St.Lunatics with words that i took time out of my Nelly-lovin-life just to write.I never take Nell out of my cd player.I have a video tape of most of Nelly's appearences.Like i said I am his fanatic.And to all yall out there hating, saying that he just took a nursery rhyme cuz he can't make his own. why don't all yall mud duck motherf***ers go out there and go five times platinum or more in the time that he did,be great at sports, have a split home, and still be a great person on top of that!Nelly hasn't let the money change him one bit.as competitive as Nelly is even if you could do all that he would come right back and beat you, just to prove one point......NELLY IS THE BEST!!!
