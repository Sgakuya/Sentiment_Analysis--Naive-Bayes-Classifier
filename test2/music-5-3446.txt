Like seemingly virtually every other white male teenager from the 70's until apparently the grunge era, I got this when I was around 14, and played it every day while I illegally drunk beer in the woods or at parties and so forth for a long time till I started getting into other groups than the 5 or 6 classic rock acts that nearly everyone starts off with: Led Zep, Beatles, etc. The 2nd volume, called "More Hot Rocks" has less familiar tunes, but is far more quirky and interesting as far as song selection goes. This is ok if you're 14 or an extremely casual fan of the group, but the Stones regular albums are better for diehards and deeper music enthusiasts.
