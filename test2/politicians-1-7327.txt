Mr. Jackson needs to find a job. He is always fishing in troubled waters. Perhaps he has some type of wish to become his own story. I wonder why Mr. Jackson doesn't go over to the Sudan to help and assist the Black Christians there who are being systematically slaughtered by the Islamic Military? No TV cameras? Too dangerous? When will the black community in this country get wise to this individual? Who is bankrolling this guy?
