Very disappointed. I felt I owed them a try because they sponsored my favorite driver for a few years. Bad pasta, one breadstick per person at our table, slow service, skunky draft beer, no choice on the salad dressing. That pretty much covers it. Just a crappy restaurant which I will never again patronize.
