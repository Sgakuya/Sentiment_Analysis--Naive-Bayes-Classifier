I very much enjoyed my Clay concert experience. Great atmosphere, great audience, GREAT show. I have seen him in his solo tour, and he rocked out on some of his cover songs. He is not the pap creation from AI anymore. He has come into his own, as I hope his next CD proves to those that don't get it yet. His Christmas album was a vast improvement, much slicker production, and I hope the next CD show even more growth. I CANNOT wait for the next tour.
