The NY State GOP really scraped the bottom of the barrel when they came up with this idiot. I laughed by butt off on Election Night after watching the crappy and weak campaign he ran against the drooler-hated H. Clinton result in his getting crushed at the polls. Maybe the simplistic, reductive ideology of the GOP and the bullying tactics the rightwingers typically employ in campaigns work in the drooler states of the midwest, high plains, southeast and southwest, but here in the civilized northeast, the people have brains and recognize Lazio for the loser he is. American life would improve vastly if the morons in the rest of the country followed the lead of voters in New York State.
