I have been reading the comments, and the difference between rating Carr a one or four star is the experience people have with football. I played football for six years and was a student of the game the same as I was a player. Someone said Lloyd Carr is good because he won a nation title. The title was won with the recruiting class of the previous coach, not Carr. Also, as for injuries, they are related to lack of conditioning. It would be one thing if the injuries were torn MCLs or ACL, but they are all related to joints and pulled muscles. Being that I have an uncle and brother who are ortho doctors and that I have the experience from playing the game a long time, the injuries are related to not running in workouts, bad weight workouts, etc. They weren't conditioned and looked awful. Overall, its coaching. Who gets in trouble a company if something goes wrong? The CEO. Lloyd is the CEO of Michigan Football. He is responsible for his coaches and players. He is responsible for the recruiting of the players in regards to their character. When the players don't play with enthusiasm or get in trouble off the field or look and act like thugs on and off the field, it's Lloyd Carr's responsiblity.
