Kelly Price is a very talented person. Her music is tight!!! Her music never has a negative aspect at all. I especially like two songs on her latest cd, and that is You Should Of Told Me, and She Wants You. Man if she didn't sing them songs like her life depended on it. I give you major props. And to all you haters, yall need to quit jaking, cuz yall know she tight, and yall just salty because she got big faces in her pockets and yall don't!!!!!
