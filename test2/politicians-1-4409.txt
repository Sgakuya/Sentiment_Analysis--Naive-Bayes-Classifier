She's brutal. A white man in a black woman's body. The biggest sellout to her race, but an excellent example for her class. Yes she's intelligent, a great pianist and a doctor who speaks many languages. How many good things she could have done with her skills, she is, in every sense of the word.. Aunt Tom, if there ever was such.
