I own two versions of this soundtrack. One is the original Broadway cast and the other is from the 2000 version. Both are outstanding in their own right. I love listening to this soundtrack. THe songs are well written and melodic while telling the story. That's pretty good praise coming from a devout Atheist like me, don't you think?
