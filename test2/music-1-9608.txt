Greatest (released in 1998) is an update of Duran Duran's previously released compilation Decade (1989). Greatest improves on the prior compilation as it not only includes all of the tracks on Decade (eg The Reflex, Hungry Like The Wolf, and A View To A Kill) but also features the band's subsequent hits (eg Electric Barbarella, Ordinary World, and Come Undone). The only notable fault is that this retrospective includes a lot of single edits, as opposed to the full-length versions of the songs. Notwithstanding this minor complaint, Greatest is all the Duran Duran most any fan would want. Nevertheless, in my opinion, no greatest hits package should be on this list as a compilation cannot really be compared to regular releases and does not represent the concept of a full-length effort.
