Truly immoral, dishonest, and a disgrace to the Presidency (the first president that I can honestly say that is less intelligent and curious than the average American). Due to HIS failure (not Clinton people) to act against terrorists (as Clinton knew of the dangers of Bin Laden et. al. and was targeting them), we are paying the price for it now (economic and in lives) and will be for generations.
