Yet another unimaginative, depraved installment in the worst video game series of all time. Honestly, who buys this junk when Mario and Sonic continue rule the video gaming roost? And, now, it has been given the AO, Adults Only rating because of the contraversial Hot Coffee hidden mini-game, which has graphic sexual content. Take Two's (the publishing company) stock has plumetted because Wal-Mart and other retailers do not carry AO rated games at all and production on the game has been temporarily suspended!
