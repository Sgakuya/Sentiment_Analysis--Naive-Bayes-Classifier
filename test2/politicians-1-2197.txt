Why do people feel sorry for James McSleezey? His boytoy's lawsuit is the only reason he came out of the closet. It's not because he is proud to be a 'Gay American.' His supporters forgot that McSleezey opposed same-sex marriages and gave his boyfriend a $110,000 homeland security job.(A job that he is not qualified to do). His hypocrisy and corruption irritates me more than his sexual preference. On the bright side, I don't have to see those annoying vacation in NJ TV spots featuring McSleezy and his adoring wife. Good riddance to this hypocrite!
