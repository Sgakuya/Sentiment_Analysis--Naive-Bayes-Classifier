I've given DT a few chances now and the last time I got a DT bean burrito and a Taco Bell bean burrito and took them both home and had them side by side and I threw the DT away after two small bites and relished the TC one: that is the sure-fire test and I'm done giving chances to DT. It just had a kind of heavy, earthy taste or something-how I might imagine dog food tasting-seriously-but then what can one expect from a place serving Mexican and burgers/fries etc.?....
