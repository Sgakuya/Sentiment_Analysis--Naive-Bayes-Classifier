Animatronic dancing bears. This is a pizza place that happens to have animatronic dancing bears, and the last time I was there, an arcade version of hungry hungry hippos. Inevitably at the end of the day, some kid in your group will be crying and freaking out because he or she didn't manage to collect enough skeeball tickets to redeem for the 5 dollar transistor radio, and must instead settle for a rubber dinosaur eraser. Inevitably, it will be your fault because you didn't give him/her enough quarters or else you ate too fast or are leaving too soon to allow this child to amass the necessary tickets. At least one kid leaves screaming, every time. You've got to try to keep them in their seats long enough to eat enough crappy pizza to constitute a meal, and to top it all off, there's a band of animatronic dancing bears singing robotic versions of Raffi songs every 15 minutes. Check, please.
