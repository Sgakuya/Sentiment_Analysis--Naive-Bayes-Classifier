I think this song is great. Especially as father of 4 daughters ages 8 through 18. I live in Phila,PA the home of the Phila 76ers and Alan Iverson the so called rapper who is releasing a song about violence and saying if you pull out a gun be man enough to pull the trigger. I declare Billy the Anti-Iverson. The owner of the team is against his players song and I am e-mailing him to suggest he play One Voice before a sixers game to counter his players urban violence stance. The fans in Phila are up in arms about the song.
