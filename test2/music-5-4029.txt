Okay, see my screen name: Springsteen80sbaby? This album is largely why! I can easily say it is the greatest album the 80s had! I fell hard for Bruce due to this album (and of course those hot music videos!) and I, although partially blinded by love, found the music on this to be brilliant! It really is though, it takes you to so many special places in your life, your memories, and your dreams! There is nothing better than to cruise with this one 'blasting off the G-top' to quote Darlington County! I don't have one favorite on this cd, I love them all! So, I'll just say this: the 80s Springsteen was the HOTTEST and this collection of music is the BEST! Buy it today! and if you already own it, then crank up the volume and listen to it already!
