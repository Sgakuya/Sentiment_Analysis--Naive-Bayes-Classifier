I recently visited the CiCi's pizza in Beckley West Virgina, and they were very perverted and obnoxious. I felt very uncomfortable there with my small children watching every guy continuously "hitting" on me. My husband is in Iraq, and I am having a hard enough time as it is, I really didn't need this! If they want to continue their business there, they really need to hire people with some respect. And I am not the first person to have said this. When I mentioned it to another friend of mine, she was also a victom of the "CiCi's Pizza Perverts!"
