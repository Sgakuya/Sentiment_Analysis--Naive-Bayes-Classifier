This 2nd album of Nirvana is a great album which pushed grunge rock into the mainstream. With Nevermind, people became exposed to a new kind of rock, one which replaced cheesy crap from the 80's. With its grungy sound, though slightly glossed over through production, Nevermind sparkled the rock revival of the 1990's.
