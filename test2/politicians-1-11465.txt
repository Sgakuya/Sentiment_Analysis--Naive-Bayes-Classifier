Babs Boxer has been voted least intelligent Senator by Senate staffers, and consistently proves her worthiness of the award by her embarrasing performance on commitees and in speeches. Her latest move of voting (only Senator to do so in 100 years) to protest the election of GWB is pathetic and blatently partisan. No class, no brains, no reason that she should ever be reelected, but she was. Can CA Republicans please get with it?
