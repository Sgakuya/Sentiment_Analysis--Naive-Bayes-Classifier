As much as I might want to give Chaney higher than a 1 his career statistics just aren't good enough. I would not even count his division II record in an assessment of his ability. His NCAA record is not very good and boasts nothing beyond the sweet 16. It would be nice to see him win a chmpionship but time is running out and he doesn't have the talent.
