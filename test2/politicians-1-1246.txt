Once a terrorist and always a terrorist. It's amazing that all of the Arab nations back the Palestinians in their dispute with Israel, but none will give up some of their land for Arafat's people. The entire Arab world can only agree on one thing and that is too hate Jews and Israelis which is all the more reason for Israel to react as it has over the last month. If he can't control his own people now, why should we believe that he will be able to do so in the future?
