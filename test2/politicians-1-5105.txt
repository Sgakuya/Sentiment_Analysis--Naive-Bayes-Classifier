I just wanted to say that Im glad that Al Gore finally exahausted all legal avenues and gave up trying to steal the election. I think its a shame that there are eople in this country who actually supported him through this past few weeks. All in all I guess its alright that we had to wait three weeks for a president elect considering we have done without much of a president for the last 8 years.
