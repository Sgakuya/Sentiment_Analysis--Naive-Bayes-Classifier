There will always be different sides to a topic. In politics, we've put people into the Liberal and Conservative sides. Fine. Which ever side you may lean or fall to is your business, but whichever way, the leader must be able to lead. George W. Bush is NOT a good leader. In any arena, and absoluetly not in the position of United States President. He does not communicate well. He does not express his party's ideas, let alone his own, in any comprehendible form. He does not work to bring the two sides of the government together as he said he would after election. He has been disasterous to foriegn relations and the environment. I am a believer in small government and consider myself a mid-of-the-road voter of most issues. From wherever I stand, I can not see the president as being worthy or capable of leading the nation for 4 more years.
