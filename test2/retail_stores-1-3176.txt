A good idea that has gone bad in its efforts to stay profitable. The company has actually admitted to prioritizing movie delivery to new customers and those who rent just a few titles per month. The complaints have been pouring in as the delays between movie titles being shipped (as well as an ever-increasing number of titles which report as being available only after a long wait) increase. A comprehensive report of this activity is available here: http://dvd-rent-test.dreamhost.com It's actually amazing to see a new customer find a title available now while long-standing customers face a very long wait of a half year or more for the same title. It's incredible that a company builds a business plan on treating their long-standing customers like dirt just to attract new ones. No thanks.
