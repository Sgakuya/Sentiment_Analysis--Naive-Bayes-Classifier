There's a reason why the store is called Radio Shack. All it is is basically a shack, and when you think of a shack, you think of a filthy dilapidated place. That description best suits this store and the small variety of name brand(more like lack of) CPs, stereos, audio video equipment, etc. Of course, what would you expect from a store that's about the size of a swimming pool. I'm surprised that this store still exist. It's as bad as brandsmart.
