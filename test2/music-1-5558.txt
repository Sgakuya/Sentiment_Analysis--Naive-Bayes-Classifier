AC/DC's music is very simple, it does not really have much feel to it,the drums are so freaking basic,and if your considered hard rock why not distort the guitars properly,Angus Young does not overdrive before his amp and instead lets the amp give him a little edge, not really heavy at all though and I'm afraid the vocals come across as someone gargling while singing.I think the gentlemen in the band are really excellent folks but to me this type of music is sort of boring and weak
