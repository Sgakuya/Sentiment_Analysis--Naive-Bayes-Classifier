Years ago, I used to like Britney, but last year I realized just how untalented she is. Here are the reasons why she is a bad singer. 1) She LIP-SYNCHS! Most of us have heard about the Ashlee Simpson dance on Saturday Night Live. Guess what? Britney's lucky she hasn't been caught. I have seen a few concerts on TV of Britney not lip-synching. Hilarious! She sounded awful. 2) Voice enhancements. I know some singers use it for touch-ups. Even without it, they'd still do a good job. Britney basically relies on this for her voice, so I found the truth. She's fake! What if things like top 40 radio, MTV, and voice enhancements didn't exist? Guess what would happen to Britney's career? She would be walking off of stages, crying, because she would've sucked! Now I like real music-people who use real voices, write and sing their own songs, produce, and who even play instruments instead of selling CD's by showing their bodies or doing other bizarre stunts.
