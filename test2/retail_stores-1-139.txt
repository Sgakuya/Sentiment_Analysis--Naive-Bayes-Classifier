The only experience I ever had with these people was a nightmare. I ordered books, phones, and some other items from them, put in my credit card information...and four days letter got a response saying that they could not process the transaction, and couldn't explain why. So I checked with my bank, no problems. I re-submitted the order...same things. It takes four days for them to figure out they can't run an order, and then they cannot tell you why? I buy stuff on the 'net all the time, and I have NEVER had a problem with ANY other vendor.
