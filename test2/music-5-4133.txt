This is not just a CD, this is an experience! The next best thing to being at a Bruce concert! When I bought this, and listened to the very first song, Thunder Road, I wasn't sure I would like it as much as all of Bruce's studio albums, but When I realized that the whole song was just the piano and vocal (and that tinkling music box sound when it gets to the ...roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair... ) and I was in love! It was almost like a movie version if you will, like a poignant version I would listen to while driving down the very same streets where I once listened to the studio version so many years ago! Anyway, then there's Adam Raised a Cain , and Spirit in the Night those songs just ROCK and there is no doubt about it! Then comes Sandy(4th of July, Ashbury Park) That song is so beautiful, and the description of the boardwalk scene is so beautiful, I just can't get over it! Paradise by the 'C' is a short, instrumental piece that shows just how great the E Street Band really is! Fire is an atmospheric rock'n'roll piece that I'll never tire of! It's Hard to be a Saint in the City is super. Growin' Up (which is done in a smaller club on a very personal level) is one I'll listen to time and again! Backstreets sounds so good live, it's hard to compare the studio version to it! Rosalita (Come out Tonight) is so awesome, and I love to relate it to my own life, and I love the way Bruce and the band sound on it! Raise Your Hand is another fun small club one. When Hungry Heart comes on, and the audience is singing along, you really feel all the emotion that the fans do, it's like an instant connection, and I find that endearing! Two Hearts is a sweet rock song, and that just wraps up the 1st cd in the set! The second one is mostly more Nebraska-esque Cadillac Ranch You Can Look (But you Better not Touch) , and Independence Day are all great, and then you get to track 4, Badlands It almost makes the studio version look bad! Song 5, Because the Night is so electifying! I can't even begin to describe the feeling when you listen to that song! Then comes Candy's Room , a very well-written song that only could come after Because the Night ! Darkness on the Edge of Town the title song of Candy's album is on here too.CD 2 also has the Nebraska songs: Nebraska, Johnny 99, and Reason to Believe Somehow, that last one instills this small town pride into me, don't know why, but it does. Born in the USA is performed exactly the way a stadium version should be, and it rules! Seeds is another good song, and then we're on to cd 3! The beginning is Bruce telling a very moving story, and then launching into the River And it is full of so much soul, that whole track and it moves me every time! War begins with another brief addressing of the 'kids' in the audience, and then gives us the sound Bruce was born and bred on! 60s Rock n Roll! This cd has alot from Born in the USA from Darlington County and Bobby Jean to Working on the Highway and My Hometown ! I especially love Cover Me (the echo at the beginning is really neat!) and I'm on Fire Not to mention the awesome 'slow version' of No Surrender ! Bruce also pulls off a great version of This Land is Your Land . One of the things I love about the middle-and-end of this album is the way you can see how the fans just love him! When they play Born to Run and 10th Ave. Freeze Out , (on their USA tour) you can almost feel the audience thrilled that the band is playing their favorite song! And the grand finale, where you can hear fans crying We Love You Bruce! Jersey Girl , is so beautiful and an amazing way to conclude the album! If you are even slightly a Bruce fan, I recommend it. I got to the point where I bought it regardless of price, and I have NEVER ONCE regretted it. I apologize for my description of these cds, I alone could never hope to convey all of the great things about them in my own words! It must be heard to be believed!
