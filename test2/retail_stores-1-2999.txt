My son has an account with kay jewelers, they took a payment over the phone, then took the money from the wrong account. This was in July, it is now the end of august the fees are piling up and they are avoiding rectifying this situation. my son is a college student and can not afford to fix this, neither can I. If you are a college student, or anyone considering an account with a jewelry store, avoid this one at all costs, they will just do damage and then not take responsibility for it.
