This album is definitely a classic. It is one of those CDs that you can pop in and not have to skip any songs. I would describe it as feel good music. It's got the upbeat classic, Born in the USA but also includes mellow music like, Downtown Train. My personal favorite is Glory Days. Growing up, I listened to the album with my parents on a record and now I have the CD.
