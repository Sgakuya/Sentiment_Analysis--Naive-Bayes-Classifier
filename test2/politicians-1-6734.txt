What is this guy doing in the politicians category. Reverend Al SHarpton - A Man and his Mouth. Let's look at what Truthteller1 says: Too bad we don't live in the 1940s and 1950s anymore! Al Sharpton strikes a nerve in bigots when he talks. If you are not a racist dog, you won't get offended by what he says. I am not offended by what Al Sharpton says because of his race, but I am offended by it because of his lack of intellegence. Never - not even once - has the Big Bad Rev let the truth or the facts get in the way of his opinion. Does anyone remember Tawana Brawley? Can I give him less than 1 star????
