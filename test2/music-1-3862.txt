Hi we're Aerosmith. We never had any talent and totally lost our edge when we got of the drugs. We've got a pretty sweet deal with MTV to make boring, bubble gum rock videos for the rest of our boring middle ages. We promise to make every song as boring and painful as possible, include our no-talent daughters in as many videos as possible and milk Sweet Emotion (our only halfway decent song) to death. Oh yeah, and Steve promises to keep doing that predictable bit with the mic stnad all the time, we never get tired of that. Look for our next album, we want to get it packaged with a Hilary Duff album but her stuff is a little raw for us.
