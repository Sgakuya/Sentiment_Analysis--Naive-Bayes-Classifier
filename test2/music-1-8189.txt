I'm not a fan of Creed's genre or Scott Stapp's Vedderesque crooning, but I feel that Creed is a band that is trying to write songs and lyrics with a deeper meaning and honesty. It is unfortunate that their videos are so absurdly over-theatrical, commercial and self-aggrandizing. The cheeseball imagery and direction presented in this video undermines the spiritual message of the song.
