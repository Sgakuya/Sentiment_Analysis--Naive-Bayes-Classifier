Jesse Jackson needs the african american community. We don't need him. As long as he can create a situation which suggests that there is a racial divide, he has a job. What in the world would he do for a living if there were no more racial inequities? The man is a dinasaur. And he should face the fact that the only people he speaks for are either hoodlems or idiots. He no longer speaks for the mainstream african american.
