He gets one star, and that's a gift. I want a President to be a moral, decent human being because the way he treats his family and friends is likely to reveal fundamentals of his character. His treatment of his family wasn't too good, and so I conclude his treatment of the USA is equally as bad, only most of his supporters have been blinded by his charm, which I admit is considerable.
