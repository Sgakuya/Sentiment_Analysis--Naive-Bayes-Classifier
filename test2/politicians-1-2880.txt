Changing parties as a matter of principle is one thing. Doing it out of personal pique and having a hissy-fit with devasting consequences is a whole 'nother ball game. A bona-fide weasel. Being from NH, I can understand someone from VT going whacko. They're smoking a lot of that Maui Wowee and Acapulco Gold over there. I don't think that history will treat this man very kindly.
