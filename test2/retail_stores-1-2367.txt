I go shopping there 4-5 times a month and generally have 3 carts, full. My average expense at this store is $1,400 a month. Why can't they have someone help bag your groceries for bulk buyers like myself? The store always smells of mold and whenever I buy bread, it goes moldy within days. I have purchased bread from the day-old store which lasts longer than the bread from winCo. The store is cheap, but it stinks, selection is too limited and there is ZERO help.
