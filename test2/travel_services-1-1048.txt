I hope all who read this heed to my warning!!! Last year my husband and I settled a huge lawsuit with them. And I mean huge. They basically shipped are belongs to FL, charged us triple the quote, put our things in storage when we could not pay, would not return our calls to clear it up, didn't pay the storage company, and everything was sold or stolen. When I say everything I mean everything, kids pictures, wedding pictures, electronics, etc. They do not respond to attorneys, complaints, they are rude and ignore even the Calif. PUC. Check their website they CA PUC has another hearing for them. WA already fined them like $600,000. Calif. is next!! BEWARE!!!
