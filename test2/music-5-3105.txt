If I could pick a song to be my theme song or just something to get me moving in the morning, I'd pick I Feel the Earth Move Under My Feet. For some reason it just gets my self-esteem a-going. And it's a perfect kick-off song for this record. Tapestry is not a concept album or anything, just a good collection of songs. So Far Away, You've Got A Friend, it's all nice. Carole's voice may not be the best, but it is nice and smooth on this album.
