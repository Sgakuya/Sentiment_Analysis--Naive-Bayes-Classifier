Perhaps the worst resturant I have ever been to. The food was moderately priced, but even that was way to much for the quality of the food. It was bland at best, and at it's worse it was salty and dull. Their signature pie wasn't all that great either. The staff is friendly and helpful, but unfortuantly that is not enough to make up for the poor quality of the food.
