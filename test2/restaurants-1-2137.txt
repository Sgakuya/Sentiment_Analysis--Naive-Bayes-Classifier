I had my last cup of tea at Tim Hortons this morning. I have started my mornings out for the past 15 years with a tim's tea, but after having to drink a cup of the New steep tea. My mornings will never be the same again. That is the worst tea I have ever teasted. Thanks but no thank - Please go back to baged tea.
