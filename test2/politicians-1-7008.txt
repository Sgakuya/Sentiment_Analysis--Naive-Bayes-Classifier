As a Black man and a Christian, I have nevr seen Mr. Jackson as a moral leader or a representative of Black people at large. His political beliefs have nevr been congruenrt with the tenents of Christianity (i.e.his stance on abortion etc.) Now that the mainstrem has bears witness to Mr. Jackson's true colors , perhaps many in the Black community will begin to reevaluate his leadership position, and oust him.
