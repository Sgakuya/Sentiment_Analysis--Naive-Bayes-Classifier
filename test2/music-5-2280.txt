I really like to listen to music while I cook, and this is the ideal CD. It starts off with the fast-paced, upbeat Riding With the King, and what follows is a nice mix of blues and rock. Marry You and Days of Old really get me moving in the kitchen, and Worried Life Blues and Come Rain or Shine slow things down a bit. So pour yourself a glass of wine, put on Riding With the King, and kick it up a notch!
