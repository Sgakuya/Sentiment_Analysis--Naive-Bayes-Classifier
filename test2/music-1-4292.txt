It's amazing how people get suckered by artists and record companies. This collection of ditties is the up-teenth release for these songs, in one form or another. How many times can you listen to these same old songs? This group has been worn out long ago, just because it's the same thing over and over and over.... The Beatles are dead. Move on!
