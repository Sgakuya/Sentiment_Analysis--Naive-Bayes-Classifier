This album is outstanding, because three very different yet talented artists collaborated to make a unique, eclectic style. This album includes elements of jazz, blues, rock and roll, r b, and hip-hop. Additionally, Lucy Pearl is in itself a band, and all of their material, both instrumental and lyrical, is original. The mellowness of the album is appealing and enjoyable, no matter what kind of mood a person is in.
