Absolutely horrible! This is not real Mexican or Tex-Mex. For those of you that remember the real Taco Cabana (hello San Antonio)this is a far cry. The food is obviously frozen (fajitas), the guacamole is from a can and the servings have diminished considerably in size, but they did not forget to INCREASE the prices. This is another sad case of a great hometown fast-food place turned into a crappy, low quality fast-food chain.
