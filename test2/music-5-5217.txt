My husband is serving in the military. Right now is the first time that we have been apart for a long period of time. We have two beautiful daughters, and there are days that I struggle. Everytime I hear this song, it brings me to a sense of ease. It helps to reassure me that everything will be ok! That is exactly what my husband tells me. He is always in my heart!
