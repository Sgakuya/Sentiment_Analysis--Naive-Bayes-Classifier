I have had TERRIBLE experience with them. My husband bought me a ring in June of last year, however, i did not get it until August(when we got married). When i did get it two months later i noticed discoloration of the base and diamonds, i sent it in to get fixed and it came back with a shank 1/3 the size of a toothpick. I was very upset. After about a month or two they swapped it out for me for a whole new ring, same style. SIX months after having that ring the shank cracked. And right now i'm still in the process of dealing with them on this issue. I spoke with a DM and we'll see what he says, but I want my money back so that i can go elsewhere.
