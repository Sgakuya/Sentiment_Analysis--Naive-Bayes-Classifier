3 Doors Down is great. The Better Life Album is worth buying. There is not a song on it I don't like. They have the kind of music that you can listen to over and over, and don't get tired of it. Their music is really good and I can't wait for the next album. They worked really hard, to get where they are. Thier 2 singles 'Kryptonite' and 'Loser' are rising on charts everywhere, and they deserve to be #1!!!
