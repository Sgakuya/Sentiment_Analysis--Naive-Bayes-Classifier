Selena was an artist with heart and soul -- one who could infuse even a ditzy sounding ditty with such raw emotion and energy that she'd have everyone in the building on their feet and dancing. Her songs still sound fresh and inviting and I love hearing every single one of them. Do I have to pick one favorite??? Okay, I'll go for Amor Prohibido . It's a song that I think really captures her spirit, talent, and youthful enthusiasm! Definite 5-star material all the way!
