Without Shaq they're done for. They need to get rid of Kobe and find players who are dedicated to the team, not to self. [Hear that Kobe?] Honestly, apart from Kobe, who do they have? Even if they somehow pull it together and make the playoffs, they aren't going to go far at all. They don't have the talent for the title. It's time to rebuild and forget Shaq or Kobe ever were there.
