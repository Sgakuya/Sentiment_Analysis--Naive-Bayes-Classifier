Never got a call back from anyone local, now I call, and they say the truck was overbooked, and then they change the story saying that the brakes went out on the truck. I told them I reviewed issues like this on a consumer website (This one) and that it might be hours until she gets back to me, and I wonder if the same would happen to me. She said she will do what she can.
