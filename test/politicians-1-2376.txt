Move on folks, he's a careerist, nothing to see here. I saw him on TV a couple times, and I couldn't get over how sleazy I thought he was. He's an elitist black man. I know, I have an uncle who happens to be just like that. Always talking about the debutante parties and about how powerful he is. This guy is not what America needs. As a poster said below, a man who claims to be all things for the people is a man to beware of. Barack has the gift of the silver tongue. He is nothing but your typical crooked politician.
