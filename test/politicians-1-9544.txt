He's a really nice guy. But nice guys don't make good presidents. During his ill-fated presidency, I honestly felt uneasy about living in the country. I honestly thought the Soviets were simply going to come and take over without a shot being fired. During his presidency, not one enemy died. We did lose four of ours in the ill-fated Iran hostage mission. I remember everything being real expensive and all Carter ever offered was that we should use more gasahol. A real disaster.
