I feel sorry for the black people, I like them but I see the democratic party keeping them like they owned them and the Jesse Jacksons being paid big bucks to keep them in line so they will vote democtractic and keep giving the dems POWER. It's power they want, not you. Will Mrs. Clinton invite you over for tea at her new expensive houses that see is buying with money she has never earned? I think it stink. Black people Break Free from them, they are not out to help you, just keep you working for them and giving you promises of a better life,did Clinton help??They had 8 years to do it, well, you can't wait for them anymore, drop the HATE that Jackson wants you to hold on to. You were freed by a republican. The end of republican is I CAN, and you can too if you just don't listen to the demos any more.George Bush will help you break free if you let him. Give him a chance to make the US better for us all. We are one Nation under God and one people of many races. Lets Live together in Harmony and consideration for one another. Thanks for Listening.
