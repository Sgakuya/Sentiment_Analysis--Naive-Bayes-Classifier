I'm giving Kyi a 1 star rating because she's never had political power and has not shown her capabilities. Having said all that she seems to be a nice woman. However Than Shwe ruthlessly suppresses trade unions which means lower prices for Westerners such as myself. Could you imagine how Kyi woul act if a Western business wanted to build a hotel in a village where there are many people inhabiting it. Kyi on human rights grounds wouldn't give permission for building to go ahead but Than Shwe wouldn't have a problem. May the Slave Labouring Republic of Burma live long and prosper.
