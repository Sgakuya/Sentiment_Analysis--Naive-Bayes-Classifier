Let me tell you an joke that I heard, that I think gives a suitable opinion about Donald Rumsfeld. There was a Texan cowboy, an Native American Indian and a Muslim sitting on a bench. The Indian said to the Muslim, We were once many, but now we are few. The white man has taken and pilleged all that we had. The Muslim said, We were once few, but now we are many. We grow and prosper. Then the Texan cowboy said, Well that's because we ain't played cowboys and muslims yet. The resemblance between the cowboy and Donald Rumsfeld is somewhat uncanny. Don't you think?
