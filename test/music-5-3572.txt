Who doesn't love the wall? It is still to this day the best selling album in the world. With a new remastered live version of The Wall released in 2000, there is no reason you shouldn't own at least one of these copies. Since it is a double CD, there are over two hours of great music that's great for any occasion. Even if your just chillin' it's an awesome album to own.
