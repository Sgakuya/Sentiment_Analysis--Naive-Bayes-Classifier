I never go here anymore. The place is ordinary and boring. Once I was spoken to rather rudely by a salesperson because I was not in the right line or something. But the main thing is that their selection of books -- not anywhere near enough variety. This place is VERY chain-like. Even their window displays are boring. It used to be a favorite place years ago when they sold computer software and supplies downstairs. One other favorite thing was also years ago when they used to have this fascinating top floor with a bunch of unusual books.
