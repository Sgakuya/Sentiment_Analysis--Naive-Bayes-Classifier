Pardon me, but do you have any Grey Poupon? I hate to sound juvenile, but you all are truly ugly. Not even kidding. I'm not even trying to dis you. Seriously, from the bottom of my heart, people aren't just trying to hate on you - You are quite literally ugly. All of you. Well, most of you - I saw a Dook girl on Elimidate one time that wasn't too bad. I guess they don't quite make 'em in New Jersey like they do in the Carolinas, huh? UPDATE: New graduation rates for student athletes came out today. Dook did not do as well as one might expect a bunch of white bread, rich, precious lil intellectual angels to do. Needless to say, Carolina guys that leave early always return to get their diplomas, thus once again giving the boys in Carolina blue the highest graduation rate in the country. Take that , Poindexters!
