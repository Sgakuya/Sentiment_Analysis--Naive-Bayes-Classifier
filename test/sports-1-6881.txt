MK's blunders did not start with Shaq nor have they ended. His inability to improve the team handed to him by West is the worst failure. He claimed no one would trade. He got Isiah Rider and Samaki Walker to fill critical roles unsuccessfully. He never used the Ring guarantee nor the financial benefits of being in LA (media) effectively. His team does not speak of him affectionately. No player he brought in in his first 4 years survives. The best left. Keeping D George was the best idea he had for his salary. When the Lakers lost to San Antonio in 2003 he was clueless and had done nothing to address the decline when luckily Malone and Payton showed up. The one thing the Lakers have done decently is draft. As a GM he is a FAILURE. He might be a good scout.
