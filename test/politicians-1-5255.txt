Al Gore needs to be investigated. I think when your opponent wins 3 different times and you still feel like you should have been the winner, it sounds like something that happened when I was in grade school when my team didnt win the game in PE class. If this is the way our government is we all better be praying that God will heal our crooked land. If at least just our Presidents!
