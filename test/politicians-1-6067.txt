This guy completely lost my confidence when he was petty enough to have the statue covered up. It is an incredibly beautful statue, representing the incredibly beautiful concept of justice, but alas, the Attorney General had a hard time accepting the fact that the statue, the Spirit of Justice , had one bare boobie. So he became a boobie himself when he ordered curtains to cover it up.
