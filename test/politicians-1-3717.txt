As a Federal Employee of almost 40 years, I have watched the republicans, from Nixon to Bush (the other Bush) errode the benefits of Federal workers and relegate us to depenence upon the Social Security for a major portion of our retirement. Now, as I stare retirement and Social Security in the face.....another Bush comes along bent on taking or substantially changing what I have been told will be mine upon retirement. I feel disenfranchised from the government and, for the first time in my adult life, I feel as if the government is actively working against my wellbeing. Now I find that the Supreme Court is part of the Republican Good Old Boy network.....people get treated better in Iraq.
