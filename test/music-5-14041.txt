I admit I am an absolutely massive Sting and Police fan. I noticed one guys comment about how he should ask the other band members for him to come back - here's a few facts - 1. If it wasn't for Sting, the Police wouldn't have been so massive (he wrote all the top hits) 2. the Police dismembered in 1984 and they don't want to reform (so there isn't a band to go back to) 3. Sting decided to jack it in 1st and go solo and finally, if Sting is failing to grab the younger generation, then why does the international fanclub have thousands of young members? Lets face it, after 20 years of being in the industry he is coming up with truly amazing songs that grabs peoples attention. Oh yeah, he's done the best out of the three of them.
