I have seen several comments on the price increase surrounding Tim Horton's tea... first off, the new STEEPED tea is absolutely awful... it taste like the tea my mother-in-law leaves on her counter in her tea pot all day... secondly, I absolutely refuse to pay $1.50 for an extra large tea, when I used to pay about $1... how can tea go up 50% in price.. whoever is making these decisions at Hortons should be ashamed of themselves... from the comments I have read here, and the people I meet and speak to in general, you have lost alot of business because of your sensless gouging...
