Smooth, relaxing and absolutely wonderful. New Age - well, I guess whatever that is. To me it seems more appropriate to call it like Gentle Age or New Calm. Either way, it's something the world could use a little more of in this space and time. I never get tired of hearing Only Time . Enya's A Day Without Rain may be the first CD I ever wear out.
