I actually own three different versions of this soundtrack. One is the orignal Broadway cast recording, which is pretty entertaining, with a few songs that are left out of the movie. Then there is the Movie soundtrack, which includes all the songs from the movie. And finaly, the best soundtrack of them all, the AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION version, contain the movie dialouge, and the audience reactions, recorded live at a showing of the movie. Great movie, and a great soundtrack.
