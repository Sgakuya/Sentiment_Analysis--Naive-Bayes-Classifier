The store is great until you try and get them to honor their service contract! I bought a computer at the store in Mesa,AZ (Superstition Springs Southern) it makes a spuealing noise whenever the speakers are used ONLY while on the internet. I took it back to the store 4 times and their techs VERIFIED DUPLICATED the problem! They send it out to their repair center and 1st they reloaded the software, then motherboard was replaced, then the DVD drive, then returned it to me with NO problem found! I complained to the store manager he said he could not do anything, then i complained to the service manager and he said it was MY problem with Microsoft! I wrote to the Best Buy website 4 times and received a generic response ...thank you for writing to us, we will use this information to improve... Best Buy stinks! I have names documentation about this. Write to thirstybeerbeast@hotmail.com if you want more info!
