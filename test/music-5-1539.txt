An absolutely fantastic album thats doing really well over here in the UK. One thing that surprised me was to find out that these lads are from Las Vegas - I think most people over here actually think that they are British! There are some really strong songs on there like 'Smile Like You Mean It' and 'Mr Brightside'. If you enjoy indie music, check out this band and you shouldn't be disappointed.
