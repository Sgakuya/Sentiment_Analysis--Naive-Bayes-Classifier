I don't see this team going anywhere soon. Yeah, they got manager Willie Randolph and Carlos Beltran, but so what! This is not a team that's loaded with proven veterans that'll get the team to the playoffs. ... And their fans are pathetic. They talk out of their asses when the Yanks come to Shea. It's all petty jealousy. ... Christ, every year these fans cheer on the Red Sox when they beat my Yanks.
