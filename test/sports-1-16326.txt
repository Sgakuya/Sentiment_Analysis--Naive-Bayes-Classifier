The prick catches ONE game winning TD pass ( Against the Packers in the 1998 Wild Card game ),and he thinks it gives him every right , to be the worst egomaniacal ,attention-demanding ,get-a-load-of-ME ,media hound in the NFL - not even Ray Lewis tops him .No class.And ,unfortunately ,there were others before him ,and there will be many more ,after him.Wonderful ,isn't it?Brings so much excitemnt ,and class, and good taste to the NFL ,doesn't it?
