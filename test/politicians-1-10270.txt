Most irrogant president I've ever known. He doesn't deserve the job he has. Cheated during the president. They said that Florida's votes got messed up. They did something to those votes. Clinton was a better president. The government is crooked just like him. If any body think that ''Bush'' is a great president, They need think again. Bush doesn't care about nobody but himself. Bush is not running this country, his father is. He's doing everything his father tried to do when he was president. If '' Bush'' really cared about this country, we wouldn't be at war with Iraq. Soldiers get killed everyday because of Bush's war. Why don't they send his daughters over to Iraq to fight. He's suppose to be a good presiden, but his own daughters broke the law for drinking under age. He suppose to be running this country, but can't even control his own daughters. When Clinton was president, people didn't hear about Chelesa doing illegal things. I hope Bush doesn't become president again . Most of the people that want '' Bush'' president, are idiots and blind and listen to every little word Bush has to say about saving this country. I'm so sick of him and hate him and his arrogant family. His daughters are spoilded rich brats. Bush sucks.
