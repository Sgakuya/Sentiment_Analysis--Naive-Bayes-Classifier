You know this WOULD be a cool album if the girl could SING! I can sing AND dance better than her, and let's just say I'm not particularly great at either. She's a really cool girl, very nice, very down to earth, she's beautiful and dresses with tons of style, but COME ON!! She is so not deserving of the Princess of Pop title...in the musical sense. Sorry Brit, no offense, but you really aren't that sensational.
