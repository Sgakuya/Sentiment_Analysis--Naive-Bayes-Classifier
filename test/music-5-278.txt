This album basically warped them into the mainstream, as it should by this wonderfully-produced album by Rick Rubin (who produced Beasties, Run DMC, and Tom Petty albums). Great stand out songs like Breaking The Girl , Under The Bridge and Suck My Kiss . They cleverly combine punk and funk with this record.
