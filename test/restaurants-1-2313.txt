A long time ago, I loved Long John Silver's. When I was a baby, my mom used to buy fish from that place and feed some of it to me. It was excellent back then, but now that restaurant is horrible! The last time I went there, my fish was so greasy that I could barely eat it. I saw one of my mom's friends in one of the grocery stores in my hometown. She had two kids with her. That lady told Mom that one of her children got sick and was throwing up after she ate at Long John's. I told her about my bad experience there and she heard me out. I will not go back there again until they improve their food.
