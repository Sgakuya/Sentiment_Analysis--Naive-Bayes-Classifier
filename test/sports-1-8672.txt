As much as a raving lunatic of a Kings fan that I am, Chris Webber is a highly overrated, arrogant, ball-hog of a louse. No one seems to notice that whenever we lose my just a few points who it was that was losing those points for us. My mother knew him, too... he's not exactly a nice person off the court, either, to people OR his pets. They should definitely trade him.
