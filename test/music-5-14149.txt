This soundtrack is nearly adventurous as the movie itself. It goes perfectly with the pirate theme, and you definitely feel like you're at sea when you listen to it. And it's easy to visualize favorite parts of the movie when you're listening to this soundtrack, something that's not easy to do with many film scores out there. Definitely good for driving in the car -- particularly if you're feeling adventurous!
