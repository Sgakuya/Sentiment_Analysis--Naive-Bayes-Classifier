I thoght I would share my very true and yet very disturbing story with all of you...and perhaps this will shed some light as to why Kay Jewelers does in fact SUCK!! I work in a Mall in Western NY, (not for Kays) recently the Kays in the Mall in which I work (Lakewood NY) had a "new" associate added to their roster...or so I thought!! To my horror, I learned through a VERY reliable source that the new girl (Nancy) was the former Store Manager at another Kays located in Warren PA...seems that some of the Managers employees took offense to her having sex in the computer room with her Assistant Manager, while the store was open no less!! What kind of standards can the company really have if they allow people like this to work for them?? I called to complain and was told it was really none of my business since I was not really a customer...I WILL NEVER BE A CUSTOMER OF KAY'S!! God only knows what kind of bodily fluids could possbily be on their overpriced jewelery!!!
