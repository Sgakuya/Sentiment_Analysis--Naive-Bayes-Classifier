What has Bush done for this country? I'm sure glad i can say I'm proud to be an American but that doesnt meani have to use force and religious ties to justify my decision making. if W is re-elected than i dont see this country in a great place. the saddest part of all of this for me is that i am a texas boy, born and raised. i liked bush sr i thought he was a great man who understood some aspects of leadership and handles war very affectively, however, this war that we have spent time seeking terrorism is causing more and more violence. as an american citizen i upheld my resposible/civic duty to vote. and you know what i was a happy person to leave the poles knowing that i had voted for the lesser of two evils (kerry) bush needs his hand held during huge decisions and im reeady for change. so go kerry and edwards i hope you kick those halliburton lovinfg, profitting crooks out of your lives and that of the American peole. With all do respect to the President of the United States you need to step down, Taylor Nelson (a very concerned citizen)
