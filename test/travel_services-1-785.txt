took me 2 hrs to get to my pointless job today. best system in the world? not when it snows. heck the thing backs up when it rains. ask NYers why they walk everywhere. it's b/c of this garbage system. if it isn't the weather, the trains are delayed b/c of some lunatic. after work, it's so packed and horrid. that's just what you need after work, a packed train going back to Brooklyn, to make you fee good. if not that, there's a lunatic or some bum on every train.
