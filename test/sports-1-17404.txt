Firing Mariucci will prove to be the stupidest thing this organization has ever done. Dennis Erickson is the answer? I doubt it. Good luck trying to keep your offense competitive while rebuilding your defense from scratch (again). Mariucci led this club to a winning record during his years in San Fran when they were supposed to be rebuilding (read: crappy)... this is a reason to be fired? Walsh should just go ahead and coach the team himself again if he doesn't want to recognize talented coaches when he sees them.
