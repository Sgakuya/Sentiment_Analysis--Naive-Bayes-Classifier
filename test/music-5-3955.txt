There is so much that you can say about this wicked album. It goes beyond the distinction of just being an album that I can't even conjure up superlatives to describe it, it is a cultural accomplishment. Simon composed it after taking a trip to Africa and insisted on allowing them to take part in the production of the album. The Boy in the Bubble sets the tone for the entire album: These are the days of miracle and wonder, this is the long distance call, the way the camera follows us in slow-mo. Then the title track Graceland is really a catchy song that you can listen to many times: We are going to Graceland, Memphis, Tennessee. The next song is great to sing along to with I Know What I Know: don't I know you from the cinematographer's party? (and then a great line) Who am I to blow against the wind? Then is Paul Simon's favorite, Gumboots: I was having this discussion on a taxi heading downtown. The next song is, in my view, the best from the album, Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes. It uses the voices of the South Africans in a wonderful manner: She's a rich girl, she don't try to hide it, diamonds on the soles of her shoes. The next song is another one of my personal favorites, my name actually being Alex, You Can Call Me Al: If you'll be my body guard, then I can be your long lost pal. I can call you Betty and Betty when you call me you can call me Al. Under African Skies is an introspective look at Africa: Joseph's face was black as night, and the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes. The next song is Homeless, featuring the South Africans the most of all the songs with the howling of: Homeless, Homeless, Webada silale maweni. Crazy Love vol. II is an upbeat song with its lyrics: I don't want no part of this crazy love, I don't want no part of your love. Another upbeat song follows with That was Your Mother: I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette, State of Louisiana, wondering where a city boy could go. The masterpiece ends with All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints: Well, it's not just you and it's not just me, this is all around the world. A very brief overview of one of the best albums ever.
