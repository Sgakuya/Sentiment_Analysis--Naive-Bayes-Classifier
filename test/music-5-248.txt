I am a huge Pearl Jam fan and have seen them in concert 3 times. I own all their albums and out of all of them, Ten is definitely my favorite. Not only is it my favorite Pearl Jam album, it is also my favorite CD out of my whole collection of about 200. This is their first album and their best. My favorite tracks are Alive, Black, Porch, Release, Jeremy and Evenflow. There are so many good songs, you don't have to skip any, unlike some other Pearl Jam CD's. Every Pearl Jam fan must have this disk, and it is the perfect disc for someone not too familiar with Pearl Jam to buy and see how they like it.
