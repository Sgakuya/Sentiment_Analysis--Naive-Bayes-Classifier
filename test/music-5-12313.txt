I really surprised myself in liking this CD because I usually don't like R B artists. Although the track Untitled was the most popular song played on the radio, I bought the CD for the track, Up Down, featuring Red Man and Method Man. D'Angleo's sensual voice is perfect for a rainy day or late night insomniacs. His voice reminises that of Prince, yet he adds an individual funk that sets him apart from the rest.
