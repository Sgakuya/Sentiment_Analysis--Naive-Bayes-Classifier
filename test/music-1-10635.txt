Let me just say that I am sick and tired of this loud mouth telling the press and everyone how she's real and how she's not like Britney Spears. Avril Lavigne is just the latest in a line of opportunists cashing in on the anti-Britney/anti-teen pop backlash. Her punk style of music is of no greater lyrical significance than that of Britney or Christina. Complicated and Sk8ter Boi are POP songs not likely to be remembered five years from now. So what if Avril doesn't dress like Britney? It doesn't mean she's a musical prodigy. Yeah, the background music in Avril's songs are slightly edgier but the songs themselves are pure dribble. Trying to establish a name for oneself in the music industry by criticizing and putting down others shows a real lack character and self-identity. I see through Avril's tough girl act. She's really not that different from all the other pop acts out there, Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton and Pink included. Hypocrites!
