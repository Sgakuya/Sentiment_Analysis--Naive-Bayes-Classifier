One of the worst Presidents we ever had unless you were the rich. The so called TICKLE DOWN THEORY did not work, it did not tickle down to the middle class or poor. He was for big corporate america and the rich. He should have been impeached for the Contra Affair but he played dumb(which was not hard for him to do). He was not THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR as the press and the spin doctors would like America to believe. If you look closely he had an ear piece in his ear that told him what and when to say things. What a joke he was. WAKE UP AMERICA and see what a bill of goods we were sold with him and they are still trying to shove him down our throat. He was a poor actor when he was in Hollywood and a poor actor when he was President. He can't fade in History fast enough for me and most of the working class. He tried to destroy the union during the Traffic Controller strikes and take a fair living away from not only the traffic controllers but all the rest of the working class. HE WAS A PRESIDENT OF THE RICH FOR THE RICH, BY THE RICH. MAY HE REST IN PEACE IF HE HAS A CLEAR CONSCIENCE. WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND. LOOK WHAT IS ON HIS PLATE NOW. WAS IT WORTH IT MR. REAGAN?
