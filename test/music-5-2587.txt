Abbey Road, if you did not know, was the Beatles last album they recorded together, Let It Be was released later. It is probably one of the best packages of music ever put together, bar none. With tracks like Oh Darling, Come Together and Some Thing how can you go wrong. One of the best albums of the best band ever.
