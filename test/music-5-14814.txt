I never knew that a single soundtrack could inspire a person to make life more meaningful--that is, until I heard the Pearl Harbor soundtrack. This soundtrack is amazing, bringing me to tears every time I listen to it. Such moving tracks as Tennessee and Heart Of A Volunteer bring tears to my eyes and a shiver down my spine every time I listen. Beautiful soundtrack for a beautiful movie. Hans Zimmer really should get more recognition for his wonderful work on this soundtrack.
