It deserved it's extremely prestigious place on VH1's list of greatest albums. It was really the only socially introspective work that examined the ineptness of urban life in the early 1970s. He discouraged the unnecessary fighting in Vietnam to his fellow man and showed the unfairness of life in the ghetto with his last track Inner City Blues. The entire album has such depth and significance complemented by the heavenly voice of Marvin. Along with Inner City Blues, the title track and Mercy Mercy Me are both magnificent songs. Indulge in Marvin Gaye's greatest work and the greatest to ever come out of Motown. It will be an unforgettable experience.
