No matter what they do, or how many games they win, they will never...NEVER...be the team Kentucky is! There is a reason that 75% of the state of Kentucky cheers on the blue and white, and that is success. Oh, as far as that little 20 point comeback goes against West Virginia, call us when you come back from 31 like UK did against LSU in the 90's. Until that time comes, SHUT UP.
