I found this CD to be a surprising sophmore success to their first album, Tragic Kingdom. Although they really changed their sound, I found the songs to still be full of meaning, yet fun to dance to at the same time. My favorite song on the CD is Bathwater, because I really relate to it and I love the way it still has a fun tune with the horns in the beginning. The song is filled with meaningful phrases like, The bags are much too heavy in my insecure condition, my pregnant mind is fat full with envy.
