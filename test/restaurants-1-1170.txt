Where to begin....dirty stores, never get an order correct, and long lines. I watched a panel truck pull up to a dunkin donuts and unloaded crates of donuts. What happened to the guy waking up in the morning saying "time to make the donuts." What warehouse makes these. Yuck. I also love how the employees wear "sanitary" gloves and take your money while wearing them.
