Great debut for this hip-hop late bloomer. Very personal, provacative look into the madness and glory of being a mover and shaker within the recording industry. Actually rapped the song Through the Wire....THROUGH WIRES!! He shattered his jaw in a car accident and did the song with his jaw wired shut. Also the track Jesus Walks spoke more for Jesus than any T.V. evangelist or President that I can think of.
