Kobe Bryant. He may be the worst player to enter into the NBA. EVER! He is the biggest ballhog in the leauge NO DOUBT! And you say oh well he has 3 titles to back him up. Well without Shaq the lakers would be about as bad as the Grizzlys. And without Shaq they wouldn't have any of those rings on there fingers. AND.....Last years championship there latest one! They did not win against the Kings in the game that Robert Horry hit that 3 pointer to tie. Because what you may not recall, is that there was another buzzer shot in that game......Halftime. Samari Walker shot at the half time buzzer and made it. But the red light was on when the ball was in his hands. THAT GAVE THE LAKERS 3 EXTRA POINTS. The ball was in his hands when the buzzer went off, but the refs didn't think so, and since theres no instatn replay THEY CAN'T REVIEW IT!! So this means that when Robert Horry shot the buzzer shot that tied it up at the END of the game it means that the lakers should have been down by 6 intead of 3. SO THE KINGS WON THAT GAME!!!!!! But you say oh they would have won the game after that. THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A GAME AFTER THAT!!!!!! The Kings were up in the series 3 to 2!! That was the fourth game that they needed. That was the game that should have put the Sacremento Kings into the 2002 Championship game against the Nets. But since a couple of refs said that Walker got that shot off the Lakers were aloud to continue in the series. KOBE SUCKS HE WILL ALWAYS SUCK!!!! HE IS BIGGEST WHINE BABY IN THE HISTORY OF ANY SPORT!!! HE THINKS HE IS THE BEST WHEN HE BELONGS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, SO THAT HE CAN BE EDUCATED, AND LEARN THAT HE SUCKS. KOBE BRYANT WOULD BE SCHOOLED BY MICHAEL JORDAN ANY DAY. AND THAT IS THE TRUTH.
