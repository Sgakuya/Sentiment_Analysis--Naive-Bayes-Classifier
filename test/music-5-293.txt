When I was in the 6th grade, the only music I knew was R B and oldies. I tried out for a soccer team called The Chili Peppers. At the tryout, a girl named Stacey was shocked that I had never heard of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I felt embarassed so the next week I went out and bought their CD. I fell in love with them and they have been my favorite band since. Red Hot...have opened my eyes to a new realm of music.
