Yes, to be sure Jeremy Camp can have so-so songs, but Restored isn't one of them. It's actually one of my favorites of his, from any cd. 'You have restored me, from my feeble and broken soul, you have restored me'. Lyrics are very inspiring. 'Take You Back' is the best song [or close to it] on record, and the music video brings it to life so well that you understand the song better afterwards. It's basically about the prodigal son and being accepted back after sinning, and it's also a reference to all of us sinners being taken back by God after running away from Him. Late in the album, after a few OK songs, you get to another gem, 'This Man'. This is second only to 'Take You Back' in terms of my personal favorite, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. So, overall, if you liked Camp's previous cds, buy it. It is another solid effort from one of Christian music's most sincere and passionate male artists. If you want a record that is a refreshing change from the usual CCM fare, buy it, preferably on sale. It's good songs, like 'Restored', make up for any slow moments this record holds.
