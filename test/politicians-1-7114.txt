What a glorious day it was today to finally have confirmed that Jesse Jackson is a good for nothing. How dare that lying, joke of a religious leader and jobless man counsel Clinton (the other lying, joke of a president) on infidelity. I respect neither one of them...and I don't want to hear that they are only human ...PLEASE don't put them in the same category as me.
