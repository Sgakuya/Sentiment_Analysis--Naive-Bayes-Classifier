A little long-winded. Frontman Andrew Schwab provides intense, passionate rock, while the band's sound seems to be geared toward keeping you hyper at all times. Songs like Spy Hunter are non-stop scream-rock fests, while Safe Haven, while still pouring on the sweat, offers a slightly more key-ed down take on the chorus [a sung, not screamed, part by Schwab]. Say Goodnight To the Bad Guy is also a good song [Come one, come all, hey,hey,hey, whoever wants a taste of me, take it for free. Now everyone can say goodnight to the bad guy...] One of the absolute best and consistent Christian rockers available, Project 86 always brings fun and energy to every project they tackle.
