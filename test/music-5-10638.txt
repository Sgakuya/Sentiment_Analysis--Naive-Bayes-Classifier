This CD is excellent, a must own. Each song is well written and yet different from each other. Matchbox show off their range musically and lyrically. This CD is very different from Yourself... but you need to listen to it more than once to really get the feel of it. I think people do not appreciate how great this album is b/c they are trying to compare it to the first CD. Mad Season needs to be judged by its own merrits. If you just listen to every song, you'll agree that Mad Season is a classic CD.
