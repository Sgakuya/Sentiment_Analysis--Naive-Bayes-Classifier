Savage Garden has helped me in a way no one else could. See, I used to do nothing but sit in my room and just do absolutely nothing. I didn't have very many friends and used to get picked on constantly by people who thought they were better than me only because they were the kind of people who were popular-and mean. I thought I would never fit in anywhere. Then my mom bought the Savage Garden CD that came out in '97. I heard the song 'A Thousand Words' and realized, thanks to the line in the song ...A thousand words will give the reason why I don't need you anymore that I didn't need to be popular to be happy. so, after I got transfered to another school district, so I am now a high-school Freshman, and I couldn't be happier because if it wasn't for Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones, I wouldn't be the person I am today. So all you people out there who don't like Savage Garden, I hope my story will make you feel a little more open-minded about them :) And as for Daz Dan, if you guys are reading this, I love you and respect you for the wonderful people you are. Thank you for changing my life in such a positve way. I truly appreciate it. -Truly, Madly, Deeply, Nikki
