Most humans have evolved throughout history, adapting to changes in the climate, advancing foward, helping to create a better future, becoming more literate and gaining increased intelligence. The Bush family on the other hand, well, they tend to dissolve and revolve more than do anything beneficial to the environment, the American public, and America's children. Shame on him for poisoning the United States and the World.
