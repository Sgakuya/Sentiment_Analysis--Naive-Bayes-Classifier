Are you people all nuts?? I can live with you clowns saying Chi-Chi's is good mexican food and Little Caesar's has good pizza but this place is an abomination. In Japan, food not only has to look good, taste good and smell good it must be presented well and have pleasant texture once in the mouth. Get some good japanese food one day and you would be embarassed to go back into this place. In Japan, it would be paramount to sitting in front of the greasy, pimply teen flipping your burgers at McD's
