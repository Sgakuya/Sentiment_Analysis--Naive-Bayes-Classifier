Ugh...I can't believe people are so willing to ignore that the politics and political environment that led to 9-11 began with the Clinton Administration. Oh lets ignore that and pretend like he didn't screw over poor woman and children either...especially the ones he was screwing. His welfare reform, the way he sold out on healthcare, gays in the military and the environment. Yeah let's pretend like he wasn't a sleazebag because he is a liberal. I can't believe people voted for this creep TWICE.
