Like William Henry Harrison, this guy doesn't deserve a low rating due to poor performance: he has to be low-rated because he had such a short shelf life as President, and as such, didn't accomplish a whole lot. That's not his fault, and not reflective of his abilities or character, but just the way it turned out.
