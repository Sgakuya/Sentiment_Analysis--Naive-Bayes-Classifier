I think Carl Thomas is an extraordinary person. His sytle of music is superb. He is by far my favorite singer. Carl, if you just happen to read this, i would to get emotional with you in the summer rain and that is so real. BUT being real you have a number one fan in nashville tennessee and dont forget that sweetie and always keep up the good work. TAMIA/NASHVILLE
