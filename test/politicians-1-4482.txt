ALAN KEYES IS ANOTHER HITLER...I have read all 30 or 40 of reader's comments on Alan Keyes, and I must say I find them not very intelligent or throughtful at all. I have been a Conservative Republican Born Again Christian all my life, and have worked for all GOP candidates over the years. One thing I have learned is you have to separate the things a person SAYS from the things they DO or are likely to do. A man's integrity and character are much more important than merely where he SAYS he stands on this or that issue. Alan Keyes is first and formost a fanatical extremist cult member of that most cultic of all churches, the Roman Catholic one. He is decieving the American people, big time, by his dishonesty about why he is running for President. He is a Catholic troublemaker trying to destablize and destory this nation. That is why he is running. Now, I agree with a lot of what he says, and what Gordon Liddy says also, but I wouldn't trust either man to run my business or even to be a good neighbor. They are both semi insane Wackos. Add Buchanan to this long list of Catholic Wackos out for power for the Pope. Both are sort of mentally unbalanced. I don't mean in the positions they take so much as in their character. The are dangerous psychopathic nuts who walk around like deranged people with live grenades in their pockets with the pins pulled. It is what is called the Catholic sickness. If Alan Keyes was other than a destroyer he would have pulled out of the primary race and endorsed Bush BEFORE the South Carolina Primary to block that other psychopath, McCain. That is what he would have done had he loved America or the Republican Party. But no! He reminds me of another Catholic we all knew recently by the name of Hitler. Keyes and the Pope kill more babies with the Pope's own recommended baby killing method called The Rhythm Method than all the abortions in the world 5 times over. What hypocrites.... My God what hypocrites....Hell is not hot enough for either one of them.
