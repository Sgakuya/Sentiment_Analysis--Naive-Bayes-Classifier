Britain is a democracy. Tony Blair wanted to go to war with Iraq The majority of British people didnt. Tony made fake dossiers on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction and how they can fire within 45minutes! British public still not in favour of war. Tony Blair goes to war without Britich or UN support.
