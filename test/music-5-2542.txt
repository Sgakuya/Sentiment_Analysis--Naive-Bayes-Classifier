It took me awhile to really appreciate Rubber Soul. It has some of the greatest songwriting ever on it, though. All the Beatles material released between 1964 and 1969 is pure gold masterpiece work. Nowhere Man is and always has been one of my favorite Beatles songs and is so well-written. Possibly the best song ever composed is toward the end, In My Life. People should really begin to see the brilliance within the album. Why do you think that VH1 put it as #6 on its albums list? I sure think it deserves that spot. It is enormous.
