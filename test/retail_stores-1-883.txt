I am so disappointed with Lane Bryant. I feel that they are not realistic when it comes to the larger woman. They are frilly and lacy and you know what ladies sometimes big isn't always beautiful especially in one of their outfits. I also found that when you wash the clothes more then once they fall apart. The store used to be great what the heck happened? KellyA
