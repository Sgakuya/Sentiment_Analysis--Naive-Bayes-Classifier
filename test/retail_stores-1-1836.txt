Most of the products are cheap junk. People buy it, use it for a week, it breaks and they come back and buy more of the same kind of crap. Prices are low only until the nearby competion is out of business. (We had a little Mom Pop store that made its living with low priced cigerettes, Wal-Mart lower there prices only until they were out of business. I was looking for a camera once, they were two dollares cheaper, but when you looked at it closer it was a cheaper lens in there's, I got my camera at Ritz Camera. I bought a TV on sale at Ames (I consider them high priced) 2 months later Wal-Mart had it on sale for $100 dollars more then Ames, a big center aisle display and all. Ic ould write a book about them. I stay out of the them if I can help it.
