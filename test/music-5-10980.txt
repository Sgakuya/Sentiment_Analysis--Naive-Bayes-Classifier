I started out hating 'N Sync because they were just another boy band, but actually enjoy their music on No Strings Attached. The harmonies are great and the innovative mixes add a lot of fun. I am actually embarassed to tell people I enjoy this album, but 'N Sync rises above the other boy bands to create a sound I like.
