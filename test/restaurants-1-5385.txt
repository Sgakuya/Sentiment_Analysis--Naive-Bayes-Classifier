One of the most boring restaurants ever! Filled to the walls with useless 'country cooking' from yucky vegetables and silly steaks, this place has absoluetly nothing I enjoy. The service is slow, the internal structure is poorly laid-out, and of course the logo stinks. Nothing redeemable about this place, that's for sure!
