UGH!!! Even this rating is too good for this bug - But since Texas is the lone-star state I can excuse this one... Well, I'm from Germany and we've had a range of stupids in politics too but hey, we're living in 2001!!! No need to make mistakes again... Btw, one girl stated that she felt ashamed for having so. like Bil Clinton as a president and that all the world would laugh at us Americans now etc. But loha, wake up!!! You got so. like GEORGE BUSH now - does HE appeal you more??? I really liked that Billy-Boy and think that many Americans (from the land of the free , mind you;) are way too prude. Oh, wasn't it Bush's 19 year-young daughter who was caught in a bar, trying to get alcoholic drinks with a manipulated passport? Hm. Maybe it's because I'm foreign, but I must admit, I don't understand these republican-guys and their high morality standarts. Hey, I'm not even baptized and I believe in a way of ethical behaviour - (and I don't mean this don't drive drunk junk!) PS: Don't mind my grammar mistakes - I'm on holidays right now and school's so far...;-)
