Lucky bastard got Phil Jackson back, don't know what he was thinking. Phil, that is. Kobe thinks he's Jordan. I think he acts like Jordan. He sure doesn't play like Jordan, nor should he. In the NBA, it's always safe to bet on talented big men, and forcing Shaq to go has to rank in the top 10 of dumbest moves in sports history. Kobe and Phil better hope San Antonio is cracked-out enough to trade Tim Duncan and Tony Parker for Lamar Odom, Kwame Brown and Smush Parker, because that's the only chance they've got! I so can stand this guy, it's a shame he got his big-money contract before we found out he was another Penny Hardaway(read: SG who looks good playing with Shaq...Dwayne Wade..dum.duh.dum.dah.dum...;\ )
