Welcome to Voodoo2! In 1980 the first Bush called Reagan's tax program Voodoo Economics. When he joined the team with RR.the idea got lost. We got taxes lowered and also a 3 trillion dollar debt. The top 10% got the money and we got our pittance. Now that we have a surplus, George W. Bush intends to give tax money back to all. Money back to the top 10% and we get the debt again. Now we can mortgage our children and grandchildren to the hilt. WELCOME TO VOODOO2!!!
