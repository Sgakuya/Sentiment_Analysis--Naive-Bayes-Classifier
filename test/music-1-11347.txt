Her first album was bad enough. Her second was absolutely redundant all the way through. Now, she proves that not only does she not have a singing voice, but she can't even hire a good keyboardist or DJ (Let alone hired good musicians, or even take part in the creatve process). I hate to suffer listening to this CD while roaming around Best Buy. Lame beats, songs that sound the same lyrically and musically (musically.....WHAT A JOKE!)In short, another ass effort (Not even half ass....that's how pathetic it is) brought to you by today's teenie pop world!! I can ony hope that somehow and VERY SOON, the music will be rid of this black pague ONCE AND FOR ALL!
