Oh boy... Please don't get me started. This has to be one of the best CDs that has been heard by a good number of people and it is probably one of th best CDs that that group of people has listened to. Sure, it changed the tide of music in its time, but listen to it now and you will still be blown away. How does one group influence over a year's worth of music and introduce people into a genre of music, style and way of life. Who the hell even spoke of Seattle before Nirvana broke? Where were you when you first heard a Nirvana song or learned that Kurt had killed himself? I know where I was for both events and if you think hard enough, I bet you can recall your whereabouts. Pretty impressive to recall such events with distinct clarity.
