Joe spits an ear of soul that I've never heard before. Previous competition like jackie wilson, jon B., and babyface need to start reaching deeper into the realm of love if they want to have a future. I want to know is probably the greatest single I've heard for a long time with the exception of Jon B's Someone to Love . Keep up baby cause the future of soul has three letters. J- O- E-.
