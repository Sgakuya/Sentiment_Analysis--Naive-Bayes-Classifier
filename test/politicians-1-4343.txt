It's amazing what even a brief association with Bill Clinton and Al Gore can do to an otherwise apparently decent man. Joe Lieberman is supposedly the conscience of the Senate...big religious guy...high morals and such. Why, when offered a taste of self-aggrandizing power as Gore's running mate, did he summarily dismiss his morals and sell out just like Al Gore did? I recall a day when both of these men were Pro-Life. Exactly when did they decide it was good to murder babies? And why did they decide that? Lieberman has made arrogant and pious remarks lately stating how he is concerned with what Hollywood is putting into the minds of our children. He is perfectly okay, though, with abortion doctors putting suction tubes into the minds of partially born babies and sucking their brains out. Amazing. Lieberman is nothing more than an amoral sellout...just like Clinton and Gore. Lieberman is even worse, perhaps, because he prostituted his relatively solid reputation in his lustful grab for power. Clinton and Gore never had such reputations. Obviously, none of them have ever earned such reputations, and we have seen just how morally bankrupt and insidious these criminals are lately. Lieberman is a fraud.
