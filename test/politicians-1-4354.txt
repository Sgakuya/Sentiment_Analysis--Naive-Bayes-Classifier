Before Lieberman was Gore's running mate, I thought he was somebody with personal integrity. He continously diminishes himself. On the campaign trail he gradually kept diminishing himself and now I see no integrity at all. How dare he,in league with Gore, take away the right to vote from young military people, how dare he rape the vote of the American people. I can never see backing him in any political forum ever again. He has devastated me.
