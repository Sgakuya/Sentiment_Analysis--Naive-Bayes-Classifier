"Band With The Runs" is more like it. Virtually everything McCartney did after The Beatles sucked, fit only for 11 year old girls and grandmothers to listen to. No edge, no balls. Frivolous song concepts and dopey lyrics. Total commercial crap aimed at those of undiscerning taste and absent sophistication. "I thought the major was a flatus."
