This CD is a waste of time and money. Metallica-What a stupid move of theirs turning in over 300,000 of their fans. Pirated or not, their songs use to stand for freedom of speech and it is ironic that they-who got their popularity through underground bootlegging-are now turning on the system they rose from. Metallica proves not to be the Master of Puppets but puppets themselves to a giant RIA industry.
