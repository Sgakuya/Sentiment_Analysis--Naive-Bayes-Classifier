 zzzzz...Not only does this video make no sense it also is boring as a stick of butter. O.k. lenny is with gina gershon and the girl from the cafe? or does he want to be with the girl in the cafe? why does lenny think we all want to see him naked? why does he always look bored? does his music sedate him as much as it sedates me? Why do all the people in the cafe look at the camera? This video is dull and poorly made. The song sucks too.
