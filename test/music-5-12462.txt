The pinnacle of the Dr. Dre discography! This album highlighted the technical brilliance of Dre's production skills. It also introduced the planet to a young pup they called Snoop Dog! Dre's beef with his old N.W.A. co-conspiritor Eazy-E was also prominently displayed on this album....Good to see they didn't let it get out of hand and patched things up before Eazy passed away.
