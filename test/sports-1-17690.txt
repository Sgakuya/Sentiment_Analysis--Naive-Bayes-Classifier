If I were a Lions fan I'd be jamming tacks under my toenails right now. This has got to be the worst team of all time. They can't do anything right. Joey Harrington is a fruit fly with little talent, and they got the best receiver of the 2003 draft because how much the suck. I feel sorry for Charles Rogers starting his NFL career as the only player worth a damn on this entire team. If were him I would quit and join a monastery. Steve Mariucci must have been on crack when he accepted the coaching job here. This is really a black mark on his resume after some success in San Francisco. What an embarrassment this team is. They wouldn't even be favored against most college teams. I think a new method of torture for death row inmates is to let them wear Lion's jerseys and watch Lions games. They'd be begging for the chair.
