shack is the WWF with a basketball. how can anybody with even half a brain even think that he is a good player, when the average person can beat him at a game of h.o.r.s.e. Hell, my son who is only 13 can beat him at the free throw line. I cant belive anyone can think that shack, with his great range of 3 feet, is even an average player. There is a lot more to basketball than just dunking the ball.
