My name is Joe is the BEST album that I have heard in a long time. The songs on this CD are great for listening by yourself or with that special someone. It is full of romance with a mix of r b. I think everyone should have this CD no matter what your taste in music is. This is a great collect of love songs to share with the one you love.
