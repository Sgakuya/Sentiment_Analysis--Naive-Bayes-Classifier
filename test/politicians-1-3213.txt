He is only seen as being successful because he was fortunate enough to inherit an economy that was expanding, adopted enough of the popular Republican positions to be seen as moderate , had willing accomplises in the press so that he could claim credit for everything good that the Congress did and cast blame on them for anything he did that was wrong or blew up in his face. The worse example of a President there could ever be!!! He tore this country apart with his class warfare and divided us along lines of race, sexual orientation, religion (or the lack of it), and gender. We never need another Bill Clinton in our entire history!!!
