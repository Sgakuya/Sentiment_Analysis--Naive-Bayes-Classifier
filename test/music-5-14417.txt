I think this movie is not only lovely from a musical perspective, but also from an artistic. The dancehall scene is artistically perfect, with just the right camera direction and photography. The music itself was blended well for the movie, and I personally think Ewan McGregor's voice is not only talented and natural, but a breath of fresh air. Nicole Kidman did decently enough, considering she's an actress and not a singer (for which you have to give her props), but she did become rather weak during several songs. Generally, though, I'd say this musical (and the movie specifically) are very worthwhile.
