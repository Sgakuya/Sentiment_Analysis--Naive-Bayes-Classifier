Clinton is intelligent, loves attention, and has a great tv personality. He should have been a televangilist. Perfect for him. Not a President. People act like he accomplished something. He smoozed he is a good smoozer. He walked in the White house and reaped the benefits of Ronald Regans, Economic policies. The Media protected this man and made him out to be a good person, which he is not... Children were subjected to this presidents lies and his total disrespect of the Highest Office in the land. That makes him bad......America will continue to reap the horrible effects that the disrespect and lies caused. It is always about Money and Power....
