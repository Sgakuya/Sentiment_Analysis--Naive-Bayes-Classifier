 Stay out the Bushes! What the hell does that mean? This guy is an absolute moron. Pre-concession speech- Weah goin to mobilize. Bush operatives aren't goin to get away with this. Post-concession speech- Weah going to stand behind President Elect Bush. Get a back bone Jesse. Stay on TV though, I love the entertainment.
