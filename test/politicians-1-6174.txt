Shame on Newt Gingrich- he was the guy who pointed his finger at so called liberal culture for all of our problems. During what he coined the culture war , he admonished those liberals who's philosophy was if it feels good, do it! Personally, I have never met a liberal who believes this. Apparantley Newt does believe in this philosophy, after all he cheated on not one, but TWO of his wives!!! One wife was on her death bed while Newt was cheating, the next infidelity occurred DURING THE IMPEACHMENT!!!!! WHAT A HYPOCRITE. Newt Gingrich proves that Clinton supporters do not have some sort of monopoly on family problems, nor do so-called conservatives have a monopoly on morality. For this alone I am thankful for him.
