Pompous, pretentious, overblown, overproduced, oversung, juvenile, excessive, self-indulgent, tawdry, retarded. One of the crappiest bands ever, stroking themselves off into the faces of mindless douchebags having all the cultural discernment of a gnat. This album is probably one of the worst rock albums (if one can call it that) ever recorded. Total vomit from first note to last. A prime example of the self-impressed glam rock that became immediately declasse and outmoded when records like "My Aim Is True," "Howlin' Wind," and "Talking Heads 77" were released just a short time later. Dinosaur music. This is because Queen is unadulterated barf. Just listen to it today and you should, given that you're not a total clown or nozzle, feel shamefacedly embarassed for anyone even remotely associated with this cultural abomination. This is the kind of crap that gave rock and roll a bad name, an unsavory connotation, and heralded the end of the flatulent Big Hair music of the mid 1970s. Furthermore, Freddy Mercury sucked as a singer. Maudlin, whiney, overdramatic, wimpy, obnoxious.
