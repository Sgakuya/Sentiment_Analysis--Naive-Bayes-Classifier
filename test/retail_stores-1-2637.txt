I have extensive experience in the grocery industry mostly selling to Kroger based in Cincinnati Ohio, Safeway in Salt Lake City, Foodlion ect.... If you have ever been into Kroger's corporate offices in downtown Cincinnati the first thing you will notice is the ground shakes at lunch time, many many fat people. Lets get to the basics. Kroger sucks from the top to the bottom. Very self absorbing buyers. They cheat steal and get paid off for shelf space. Kroger is by far the highest priced retailer out there. Compare them with anyone else you will be amazed in the difference of price. Kroger is in the realestate business more so than being a grocer. They pawn on people who are too lazy to drive to a cheaper place too buy their groceries, they (Kroger) don't have to worry because they have a store right down the block! Nepotism amongst the buyers and suppliers is just starting to dominate the convention cultures. Yes people have figured this out. Walmart forbids this! Kroger has 15 more years tops before they get pooped out of Walmart's butt. Kroger is more evil than Walmart folks so don't feel bad.
