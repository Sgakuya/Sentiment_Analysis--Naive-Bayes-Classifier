Eva Cassidy is, without any question, one of the greatest voices of the last half-century though one which went mostly unknown before here death. I have played this CD for any number of people who, after a single hearing, have become simply passionate advocates for Eva. She seemed to be able to do any type of music well -- blues, jazz, pop, and popular ballads. Her version of SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW is now considered by many to be the most extraordinary and revelatory rendition ever done (and that comes from someone who adores Judy!) Purchasing this record is the easiest no brainer I have ever known...you will adore it. It is the item which I and all sorts of others now give as the best thank-you present to our friends. Enjoy!
