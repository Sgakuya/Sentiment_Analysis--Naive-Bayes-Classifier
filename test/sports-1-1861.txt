This is one bunch of disrespectful, arrogant guys. It's unfortunate that classy guys like Tom Glavine, and a few others, have to be associated with punks like John Rocker. I don't dislike them because they are good. Until very recent years I liked them because they are great. I dislike them because the, as an organization, no longer have much class.
