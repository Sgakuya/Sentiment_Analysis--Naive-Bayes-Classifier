Outkast is no doubt on top of their game right now. Stankonia is one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. Dre, and Big Boi ripped it as well as The Dungeon Family ( I love Killer Mike and I cant't wait to get Slim Calhoun's solo) They rap about issues that make you think. The whole CD is great, but these tracks stood out to me: Toliet Tisha , Gangsta Sh*t , Snapping and Trapping , and Stank Love .
