She was/is an embarrassment to America. Nowhere near qualified to be Secretary of State, making the US look (again) like a paper tiger in world affairs, attempting to look effeminitely tough but unable and unlikely to back any of it up no matter who attacked whatever target (WTC-93, USS Cole, Khobar Towers, etc.) It is hard to forget how fervently and sincerely she assured the American people Clinton was telling the truth about the Lewinsky situation and how after Clinton 'fessed up, she felt no apology or explanation was necessary. The Secretary of State, lied to by the President, her truthfulness and credibility on the line, no remarks whatsoever. Tell me they didn't all know the truth. Tell me again.
