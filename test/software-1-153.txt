Interview process through unreimbursed employee business expenses doesn't ask about proof of use for listed property, attempting to add information causes the return to be denied for e-filing because of overriding. The program (software) will not allow e-filing if there has been a recharacterization, the IRS allows it. There were enough problems that I'm sending in what I need to get a full refund, the program was useless to me.
