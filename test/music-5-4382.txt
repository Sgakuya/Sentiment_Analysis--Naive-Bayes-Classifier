My honest opinion: I love this cd to pieces! I can't describe what it is about the E Street Band that I've loved for all these years, but whatever it is, they've still got it!!! I love it very very much, but not quite as much as Live1975/85 but still! I can't get over this! I was knocked dead when I heard My Love Will Not Let You Down and Land of Hope and Dreams and of course all the other songs that it would take too much space to mention! I just love it to pieces! Perfect for cruising in the late afternoon-turning-into-evening! With the volume up LOUD! Love it!
