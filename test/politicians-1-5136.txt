I have continued to be amazed at just how poorly he views the intelligence of the American People. Perhaps it is because the people that he is used to speaking to-his supporters- are unable to read a ballot that he feels he should talk down to the rest of us. I cannot believe in his COUNT EVERY VOTE speach that he send out of one side of his mouth- and out of that same mouth-he supports the throwing out of the Military Ballot. Has he lied so much that he could actually BELIEVE this himself. What am I saying- he was taught by the BEST.
