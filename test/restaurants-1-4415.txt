Outback is a turd. I went on my lunch break to meet a friend and we ordered an apetizer to share and a sandwich. 20 minutes later someone came out to tell us they had burned our appetizer. After 45 minutes of waiting for a sandwich, my lunch break was over and I had to ask to have my lunched boxed to go and was still late getting back to work. I believe that the staff was smokn some wacky tobaccy in the back as the restaurant was half empty and it still took that long. I would describe the Outback as poop on a stick.
