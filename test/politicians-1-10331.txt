How does the American population let its government get away with the things that it does. Bush Jr. has decimated many of its environmental laws. Canadians got slammed for not joining in on the war on Iraq, we're getting slammed for our relaxed Marajuana laws gay marriages etc, but our government would have never gotten away with the things that the Bush administration has. I'll admit we aren't prefect but... well we'll see who comes running to us when they have destroyed their natural envronment. I do not blame the American population for how their evironment is being poisoned, I blame them for allowing their government to do these things for the sake of multi- billion dollar corporations. Why is it that the rich are getting richer and the poor are losing even more? Why is it that there was talks of impeaching Bill Clinton for his sexual relationships, but no word on impeaching Bush Jr. for his unfair tax laws and decimation of environmental protection laws? Why is it that during the last presidential elections in the state of Florida 56000 people lost their right to vote? I can answer that one, any fellonies on record loses the right to vote, however so does having a name that is spelled similar to an ex- felon, or anything that can connect you with one. Jeb Bush being in charge kinda makes it a bit suspicious. Many of those ex-felons probably were in areas in need of some funding that big corperations backing Bush wanted. Bush would have never gotten most of those votes. America for God's sake a whole hell of a lot of you didn't even vote for this guy and even more didn't vote at all (including those that weren't alowed)and he is destrying your country. Get him out for your own good.
