Definitely one of the best album's of the 90s. With this album, Portishead created a sound so original that it spawned off a new genre and countless imitators. The combination of obscure samples, minimalist arrangement, and Beth's voice are unparalleled anywhere else. A perfect album for those times when you are feeling down or mellow.
