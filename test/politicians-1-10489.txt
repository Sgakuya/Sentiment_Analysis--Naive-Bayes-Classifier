I believe that Mr. Bush's work both in international policy as in the domestic is much more less than insatisfactory. 1) He is about to start not one but TWO wars simultaneously, without having at least 60% of the Americans on his side. 2) His manicheism when expressing things as if you're not in favor of war, then you're with them , and his power (sic) to say who's evil and who's not, are arguments so directed to weak-minded people. 3) After so many years having the USA leading UN dictaminations, his comments regarding with or without the UN I'm gonna do what I want to are too arrogant. 4) He has disregarded all pre-9/11 agreements with other countries in order to focus in combating evil that now that he's asking for other countries for support, he's finding himself almost buying or blackmailing their vote, which is very shameful. 5) And seeing no reaction from him after having international polls setting both Saddam and Bush as the world's biggest threat (each with 45%), makes him get no less than an image of stubborn. And regarding domestic matters: 1) He's having one of the worst recessions in years. 2) His economic proposals are inexistent and/or totally useless. 3) He's got two years in a row the US under yellow alert: What for? 4) Playing deaf with politicians, opinion-leaders, musicians, intellectuals and et al, is instantly disregarding -as of we speak- his possibility to be re-elected. Definitely, the worst American president in years.
