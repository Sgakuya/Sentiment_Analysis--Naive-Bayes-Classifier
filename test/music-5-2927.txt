Why do all these people have something against the Beatles? I pity you. You must be jealous that your favorite group isn't as good or as legendary. I Need You is my favorite off this album. It's a masterpiece by George. He really shows here his writing ability. Saying the Beatles are shallow? I think your shallow, Lou. Anyone who gives this album less than 5 stars needs HELP! (a corny pun) I LOVE GEORGE HARRISON!
