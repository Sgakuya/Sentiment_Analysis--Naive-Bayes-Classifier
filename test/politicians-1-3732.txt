In a not so distant future the U.S. of A. can be proud to present Goofy as the first man. The sad thing is that this guy is nowhere near as funny as the Disney character. I am sorry for us all, we will have to sit through these next four years listining to his blunder and nonsense. Worse still we'll be looking at that indescribable smirky smile . Important decisions for business and the environment will have to be postponed. So we will all have to go to sleep and wait Bush out, I guess. It is so very sad...
