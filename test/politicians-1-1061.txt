Ariel is going to take his place in history along his fellow-men (Hitler, Staline, Hirohito, Napoleon, etc...) by depriving a population of its sovereign rights, and bringing peace in Israel by means of slaughter. It is strange to notice that 60 years ago jews were persecuted by nazis, and nowadays cannot find any other way to their problems than persecuting palestinians. Looking to their past, if jews are not able to learn lessons of history, then it means than nobody will be ever able to do so. I don't think that Ariel can get by weapons and fear what his predecessor almost achieved by hearing what palestinians have to say. By bringing such a negative message to the world, Ariel would deserve a 0 star rating if it was possible to do so.
