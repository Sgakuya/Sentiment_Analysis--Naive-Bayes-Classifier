I love Britney's new sound on this album. It's still pop no doubt but the songs are grittier and less saccharine. Oops! I Did It Again and Baby One More Time had some good songs and some not so good songs. On Britney , all the songs are great! I'm sure that this is just one of the first of many transformations we'll be seeing as Britney moves throughout her career. She's the next Madonna!
