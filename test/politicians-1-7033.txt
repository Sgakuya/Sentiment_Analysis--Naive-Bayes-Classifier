You know something? I really hope that this particular message gets to the good ole' Reverend Jesse. What a hypocrite you are... How will you talk your way out of the mess you have got yourself into now? I cannot believe that you cheated on your wife, humiliated her AND your children, and still continue to parade your whore around them. Excuse the french, but it is true. I lost all respect for you first of all, after watching the HBO documentary on the boy that was hung down south. The family came to ask for your support and you blew them off. You down right waved them into another direction. Guess the press coverage on another useless dead black male wouldn't help you out any, would it? Now, all of the ass kissing, and lieing you have done has come back to bite you, huh? By the way, I am a black woman. So you see, you aren't standing very strong with your own race anymore. Stop trying to be Martin . You should be very ashamed of yourself, and no repentence should allow your wife to consider keeping you around. After 30 something years of marriage, and tagging along as your shadow, this is how you repay her? Don't preach anymore. It would only make you look absolutely foolish. I am going to ask that all americans pass this site around so that MR. Jackson can come to see what we Americans REALLY think of his lies and fornication. You and Evander Holyfield.... preaching all of the time and then making babies out of wedlock. I feel sorry for your new baby. But her mother? She is nasty, nasty, nasty. On top of being downright ugly, she is just as conieving as you are. Bye.
