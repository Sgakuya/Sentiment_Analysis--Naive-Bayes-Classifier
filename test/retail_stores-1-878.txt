Their clothing has steadily declined in quality over the last few years. I have been satisfied with the jeans I've purchased, but everything else falls apart in the wash or shrinks, despite being washed according to the directions. I had a pair of dress pants come apart at the seams the first time I washed them. I had the applique design on a cotton shirt wash right off. I had two sweaters; one shrank and one totally lost its shape. They sell crap!
