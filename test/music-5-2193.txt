Just another great example of Creed's musical talent. It has the early release, My Sacrifice which is great. It also includes extreme heavy metal not heard from Creed before with Bullets and extreme slowness in Lullaby . Probably the best song is track 7, You Stand By Me which could be one of their best songs ever. And track 5 , Hold Me Now which follows at a close 2nd. This is a definite must buy, for any music fan, metal-head, Creed-lover, or just an average music listener.
