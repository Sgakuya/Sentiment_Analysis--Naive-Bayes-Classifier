All of the comments about the products being, for the most part, cheap Chinese-made crap have been done to death. Ditto the stores being understaffed by incompetent workers. The stores are also simply too big. It can be difficult to find a specific item. I will not ask an employee for help - my opinion is that if the store is (dis)organized so that I cannot find what I need, the store does not need to sell it to me.
