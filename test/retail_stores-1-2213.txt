Publix off of Kingsway and Windhorst is, by far, the worst Publix I have ever been in. Customer service in the Deli and at the checkout counters is non-existent. Why would the employee's be friendly when the front managers are horrible examples. They all wear mugs on their faces like I do not want to be here. I remember before this store was built, the closest publix was Valrico and the managers there were EXTREMELY nice...always smiling..even if they didnt want to be there, they never showed it... the cashiers were friendly...maybe they learned it from the managers. The only department that seems to be halfway decent at Kingsway is the produce department. With above average prices one would think that Publix would strive to compete by friendliness and customer service...guess it is hard times when you can't even get the managers to smile and be friendly....I have been in this Publix numerous times not just once...and this is a DAILY thing..not just one bad day...The only reason it beats out Kash n Karry is it is much cleaner...
