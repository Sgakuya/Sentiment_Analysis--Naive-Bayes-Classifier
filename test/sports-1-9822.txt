Shaq is the fatest POS in the history of the NBA!!!! NOBODY CAN DENY THAT!!! He is the fatest guy in the league and he charges everytime he touches the ball. Last year in the kings lakers series he fouled out in every game before the half, but the sorry refs wouldn't call it. The kings really won. Without Shaq their record is 3-6!!! 3-6!!! 3-6!! They need to have a weight limit now in the NBA. He's not a real player. Lakers have cheated into their championships. LAKERS SUCK!!!!
