Offspring is one of the worst, most annoying bands ever. They don't play music, they are like little toddlers who just bang and scream. It is so bad. Offspring is a pet peeve of mine. My little brother likes them and I want to scream when he plays their music. You might think that they would get better with each CD but you are horribly mistaken. They are just bad and will never get better. Horrible horrible music.
