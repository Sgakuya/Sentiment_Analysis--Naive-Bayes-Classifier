LeAnn Womack is my favorite country singer/songwriter. I love the song I hope you dance it is very inspiring and heartwarming it helps me get through daily obstacles. I love to sing karoake and I'm waiting for this song to become a karoake song so that I can sing it. LeAnn if you ever come to this site and happen to stumble across my entry please email me and say hi,that would be awesome. I really do think that you are great. I love your voice,and I myself do hope that someday I can become a singer/songwriter just like you. I'd also like for you to know that your song You've gotta talk to me is a song that I always, always sing at karoake, its dedicated to a friend of mine that took his life and is no longer in this world. Well I hope that you succeed in everything that you do. Kristy
