On this album Spice Girls prove that they can actually SING well, unlike other girl/boy bands. Forever is a great Pop-R B effort, recommended to anyone with a good music taste. Amazing ballads like Time Goes By and Oxygen , and catchy tunes like Right Back At Ya , Holler , If You Wanna Have Some Fun . 10 out of 10 is my rating.
