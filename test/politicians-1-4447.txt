Alan Keyes is an individual who wants to keep people from voting. He has thrown his support towards an act which would prevent people from electing their senators. I guess that goes to show he really wants job security for everyone, huh? Furthermore, Alan Keyes has been verified a hypocrite. In 2000, Keyes denounced Hillary Clinton for running for Senator in a state she didn't live in at the time. Keyes, a Maryland citizen, is running for Illinois Senate. He is doing the same thing he yelled at Hillar for in 2000. Alan Keyes is bad news for both Democrats and Republicans, and anyone else who believes in free elections and decent people in office.
