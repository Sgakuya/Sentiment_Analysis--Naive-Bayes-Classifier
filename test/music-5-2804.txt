Bob Dylan's trademark gravelly voice and stripped down blues folk/rock approach lend Highway 61 Revisited its rocking background for what Dylan really wants to get across. Songs like Tombstone Blues and Highway 61 Revisited show Dylan at his witty, quick blues guitar strumming best. This classic album from Dylan is anything but stereotypical folk. It'll have you laughing at his peculiar lines, thinking about his social criticisms, and most of all, groovin' to the blues.
