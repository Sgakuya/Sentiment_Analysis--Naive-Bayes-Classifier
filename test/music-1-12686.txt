DMX is not an artist. HE is an angry black man with no talent. Nobody wants to hear a man sounding like Scruff McGruff trying to rap. It really sounds like he's talking. HOW DARE ANYONE COMPARE THIS LOSER TO TUPAC. Tupac was a true artist, and to compare him to a duck like DMX is not only insulting to me, but to Tupac and his family. Trust me, in a few years, after all the retarded hype goes down, DMX will be a has been. DMX is not an artist.
