This is their best album (next to Californacation!). Red hot chili peppers are my favourite band. This album is so dynamic and each song is different. The lyrics are beautiful (as they always are) and the songs are great. You can never stop listning to songs like 'Under the bridge', 'Suck my kiss' and 'Breaking the girl'.
