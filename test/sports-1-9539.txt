Boo!!!!!!!!! These guys think they're as good as Detroit? Bullcrap. They won last year, sure, but they took seven games to do it. Ginobili is soft. If he gets injured he'll go to the bench. Duncan? Can't argue with his production, but as his stats in the Finals show, he's not too good under pressure like that. Parker is a solid point guard, but he's not the all-star some seem to think he is. That whole team is going to fall apart someday soon, simply because everyone except maybe Duncan and Horry are soft [and even Duncan is softer than a big man should be.] Spurs? Ain't nothin' but a joke.
