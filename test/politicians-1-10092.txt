I used to think Reagan was the worst we could get but, once again, events prove me wrong. Once again, the bar has been lowered. It's glib to call Bush an idiot, but he has to qualify as the most mediocre president we've ever had, without question. At least Reagan had a certain superficial charm that could make it seem as if he actually knew what he was talking about. This guy can't even make a convincing, coherent speech. It will take years, if not decades, to repair the damages that this guy and his cabal have inflicted. That is, if the damages can be repaired. We're in a situation where we need the most diplomatically adept, the most intelligent, the most skilled and briliant minds to deal with the explosive, complex problems that face us. And, instead, we've got...Bush, the reformed frat-house drunk, the Born-Again Christian, the man who takes pride in never reading a newspaper. Then again, we have no one to blame for this perilous, disgraceful situation but ourselves. People are dying in Iraq, billions and billions are being squandered, corporate criminals continue to rip us off without any restrictions on their thievery, the environment continues to deteriorate, and the American electorate is concerned about...2 gay guys getting married. Janet Jackson's naked breast on TV. Creationism in the school. Abortion. Not only is Justice blind...so is the American voter.
