if i could pick one album to listen to for the rest of my life it would be ladyland. Jimi expresses things that no mortal could or ever will. hes got jazzy rainey day to bluesy voodo chile to intense slight return and trippy 1983. there is no question that Jimi's gituar playin has no equal but hes also got lyrics in 1983 that Bob dylan on acid couldnt dream of writing. Who gave it a 1??
