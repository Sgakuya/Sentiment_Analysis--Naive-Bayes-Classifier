Selfish ballplayer. . .one of the worst assist-turnover ratios for a starting point guard. . .bad field-goal percentage. . .at best a mediocre defender. . .I don't know how his steals are. . .Most white guys with tatoos to me are posuers (can the barb wire around the bicep be far behind?). . .Williams will never, never be an accomplished ballplayer until he learns a four-letter word: PASS. How can people be so dazzled by an occasional sweet pass? PS- Madison Avenue (tried) to market him because he is white, plain and simple. J-Dub's numbers would make him nobody if he was black. (for the rec., I am a white guy.)
