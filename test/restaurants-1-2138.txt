I have worked at 2 Tim Hortons locations, the first being in Deep River Ontario, which I quit in the year 2003, and the second I am currently in the stage of quitting is in Brampton (near Bramalea Transit Centre) Ontario. To all of the people, especially customers who complain about the service, I say, let me see you do it. I work 2 jobs, one, at a law firm, and the other, of course, at Tim Hortons. The amount of disrespect one gets at Tim Hortons as an employee is DISGRACIOUS. The comments that make me want to quit most are from people who say.. MY ICECAP ISN'T CREAMY ENOUGH or NO OTHER TIM HORTONS EXCEPT THIS ONE SCREWS UP MY ORDER. We work hard, for shitty pay so you can get your cheap $1.00 bagel. I am sick of it. At 18 years old and a university student, it disgusts me at the way NORMAL people treat employees there. WE ARE HUMAN TOO, so shut up and eat your food already, quit complaining. Its a fast food chian for God's sake. Your complaining over a 2$ purchase. I have better and more important things on my mind to make sure that your bagel is double toasted for your pleasure, im in university sheesh. Don't you have more important things to do? I am soo sick of management, and cheap owners, and horrible customers (BY THE WAY, to the lady called SPRUNGBREEZE-I took your order and you were yelling at me, not politely asking me to put them in two separate bags you ignorant slob, i would lov e to see you do my job!) , that I am actually writing a book about it, so please, any employees that have horror customer and management stories, please write to deliriouspreview@hotmail.com. I would love to include them in my book. On one other note, some customers are wonderful, but they are rare... really rare.
