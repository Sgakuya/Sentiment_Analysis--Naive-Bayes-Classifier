The great black intellectual Booker T Washington said in the yeaer 1911: There is a class of colored people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs. There is a certain class of race-problem solvers who don't want the patient to get well. Is there any doubt he would (rightly) put Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton in this category?
