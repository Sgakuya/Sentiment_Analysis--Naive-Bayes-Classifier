My Name is Joe (Joe's CD) is great. Joe is really talented. He's having a concert and I look forward in attending it. I love all the songs on this CD, especially Stutter , One Life Stand , Peep Show , and Table for Two. Just put it this way: all the songs are great. I love them all. This is one of my best CDs.
