I wrote a note about my disappointing experience with Whitehall Jewelers back on 10/21/2005. Well now let me tell you what happened. The Lakeline store in Austin, Texas has gone to pots. I recently had my wedding ring checked and a loose stone was found. I sent the ring in to have the stone re-set, and two weeks after I got my ring back the stone fell out. Since I was so upset with the Lakeline store I waited 3 weeks to take the ring in. Finally, this Friday I took the ring in to the store and was told that I would have my ring back on Wednesday. Well today I received a phone call from the store manager, and she told me it would be 6 ' 8 weeks before my ring would be ready because they don't have the right size diamond. I decided to call the manager back and confront her because it is very apparent to me that the reason it will take the 6 ' 8 weeks is because she is still pissed off at me from the last incident (I filed a complaint against all of them with the district customer service office). When I asked the store manager she said of course that is not why it is taking so long (I could walk the ring to the main office and have it fixed in less than 6 ' 8 weeks). Whitehall's will not last long at this rate. I would not recommend shopping with them if your looking for quality or customer service.
