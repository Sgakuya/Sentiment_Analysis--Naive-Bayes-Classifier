I believe Al Gore is an embarrassment. He seems to be ill informed and cannot graceful admit defeat. He keeps stating that he just wants to ensure all the votes count. Then why isn't he working to get the military votes included in the count? The openly break election laws and common sense and want we the American public to back them. I've got a brain and I am positive I don't want a President who can't even run a clean race.
