If you ever crave being stressed out, entering an environment of absolute chaos, dodging screaming kids, hearing employees shout at eachother on the store intercom every 30 seconds and just really beg for getting the worst headache of your life then go to Wal-Mart !!! It's those reasons alone that keep me away from the place. I don't care how damn cheap it is and as if those wern't enough reasons the way they do business is beyond unethical. Wal-Mart sucks !
