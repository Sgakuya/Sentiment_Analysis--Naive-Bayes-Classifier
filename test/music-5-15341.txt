Well, though I rate all autechre music at five stars, I in no way recomend ae to all music fans. At first listen I was nearly convinced that I was listening to random noises. There is often some form of a beat, and then a bunch of static. After getting used to listening to ae, however, I have come to understand it much more clearly. In much the same way that Hendrix's solos blur into noise and lose the casual listeners, Autechre's melodies lose most. They are just too complex for most listeners. It's sometimes a struggle for me to find melody in the chaos, but just when I am about to give up, it creeps up on me. From that point forward I get it instantly upon playing the track. It's just background music, unless you're really familiar with it. If you are hearing an ae peice you hadn't heard previously, you have to put your full attention to it. What once may have sounded like crap, is suddenly revealed as beautiful landscapes of great diversity. If that interests you at all, give it a shot.
