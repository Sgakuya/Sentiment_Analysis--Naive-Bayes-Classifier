There never was or will be a singer as able to bear her heart and soul as Janis Joplin.This woman had MAJOR pipes and was absolutely,positively 100% REAL- no gimmicks,no posturing,no B.S.!!! It's a sin and a crime that her music is robbed and raped for use in advertising today.Boycott any and every offender and make Janis smile in heaven!
