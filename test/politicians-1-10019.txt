Sheesh! Well Bush has really dropped a dime on us poor working folk. He wants to import cheaper labor into my job and put me on the street. What is up with that? He wants bigger government, higher taxers and my first born. Between the damn democrats and the ridiculos republicans, those of us in the middle are being squashed. There is no party that represents the people.
