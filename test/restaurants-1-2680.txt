TRY to get a burger that looks Semi-appealing like on the menu. Not gunna happen! This place USED to be a good quick-stop maybe in the 70's or 80's.

They serve as a prime example to never again raise the minimum wage. The gimmicky advertisement for the latest Disney movie or summer block buster is out of control. The All Amercian Burger Joint has turned into a commercialized Home of the Loser.
