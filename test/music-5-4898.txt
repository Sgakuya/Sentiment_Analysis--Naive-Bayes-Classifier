As a young girl of 13 years old, I love Billy Gilman. When I have a crush on a singer people are like Yea, he's 10 years older than you! and it really sucks. But then Billy came along and I fell in love. I only listen to 2 CDs,One Voice and Billy Gilmans Classic Christmas! I LOVE YOU BILLY!!!!!(And hes so cute too!!!)
