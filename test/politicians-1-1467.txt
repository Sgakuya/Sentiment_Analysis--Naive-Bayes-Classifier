I absolutely despise China's communist regime. They're unbelievably backward and have no regard for freedom of any sort, whether be personal, cultural, political etc. Those bastards attacked and invaded Tibet and are slowly ruining that country's culture and yet would like the entire world, including Tibetans, to believe that Tibet is and has always been a part of the People's Republic of China! People's Republic indeed! What's interesting is that the government has managed to brainwash the majority of the Chinese population notably students. University students in China approve of their government's policies regarding Taiwan and Tibet and believe China should lead the world! As much respect I have for Chinese culture and tradition, their world view stinks! China should not be allowed to host the 2008 Olympics because of humanitarian reasons. Their version of nationalism is simply appaling.
