The stores near Salt Lake City, Utah have a good selection, a great shoe department, and reasonable prices. Unfortunately, I will no longer shop either location. In the shoe department in Sandy, Utah, I browsed nearly 30 minutes without being approached by a sales person. The four employees were sitting (yes, sitting) around the cash register laughing at and joking about a pregnant customer near the shoe department. Two other customers were also browsing and being ignored. After discussing this with one of the others, I walked up to the resister to ask for assistance. A young girl rolled her eyes and reluctantly helped me. Another employee laughed and rolled her eyes as well. The second employee was the manager! I sent a complaint letter to the company (discussing this and other customer relations incidents). Six months later I have not received a response. I value quality service as well as quality merchandise. I now shop where I can receive both...Nordstrom.
