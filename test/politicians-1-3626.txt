Why is it all these Bush supporters spout a lot of crap about the bible and decide to give up punctuation? Hmm...I sense a connection. I'm extremely gratified that the Clinton Show has been covering the news lately, because seeing Dubya referred to as President Bush inspires nausea in me. Apparently, though, some bizarre people consider him likeable. I find him repulsive, of course, but that's just my preference for homo sapiens, not just any primate.For those of you who find him charming, I say, fine. Hire him for your kid's birthday party or something. But for President, in these turbulent times, that's a little far to go for someone who is warm. My main problem with Bush is...lack of integrity, apathy towards any one with a differing opinion, and..oh yeah...his stance on EVERY SINGLE ISSUE.
