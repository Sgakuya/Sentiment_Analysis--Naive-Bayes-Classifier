There is nothing like the energy at a Creed show! Everyone sings every song, and you can really see the band's passion and commitment (Scott works SO hard, and he's not afraid to connect personally with the audience). Sometimes, Mark really shreds during the solos to mix it up, and the FIRE! Wow! Poor Flip is right next to the things! Lol. Before the encore, when the lights dim, the crowd cheers, stomps, screams, and whistles for minutes on end until they come back again! I'm telling you, you have to experience the power and unity of a Creed concert. It was the most awesome experience of my life.
