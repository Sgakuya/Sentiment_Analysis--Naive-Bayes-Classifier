This man is a hate-monger who seeks to gain support through playing on our unreasoning fears and prejudices about those who are different from us. This country has millions of people, with millions of differences. Our strength lies in our ability to work together in spite of those differences. By trying to undermine that, and set us against each other, he is doing a terrible thing. And in the end, if we allow this to happen, we all will pay.
