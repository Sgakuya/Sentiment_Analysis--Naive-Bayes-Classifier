I didn't think anyone or anything could ever make me prefer Bill Clinton, but George W. Bush is getting me there. However, that's just testament to how bad Bush is, not an endorsement of Clinton, who was an absolute disgrace to the presidency. He was a master of deception and deflection, the most accomplished liar I've ever seen. The ultimate used-car salesman. No conscience whatsoever. He never took responsibilty for anything he did if there was someone else to blame or some way to twist the English language to squirm himself out on a tortured technicality. This is a man, after all, who tried to parse the word "is." The man who smoked but "didn't inhale." He's like the slimy lawyer whom everyone hates in the courtroom because he splits every hair and exploits every loophole to help his guilty-as-sin client beat the rap on an outrageous technicality. The man was an empty suit who stood for nothing but himself. Every policy in his administration was poll-tested rather than a personal conviction, because (1) power was all that mattered and (2) he HAD no personal convictions, other than getting ahead at any cost, and at anyone's expense. As Jesse Jackson once said of him, he was nothing but appetite. Just pure, unadulterated lust for power. Unfortunately, he was slick enough to fool Americans into thinking he was a decent, down-to-earth guy whom you'd love to sit down at the corner bar and have a beer with. What they could never figure out is that he'd sell them down the river if it meant boosting his own poll numbers. He was also a disgusting womanizer. I don't understand how any woman -- especially one who calls herself a self-respecting feminist -- could ever support this man. (If he'd been a Republican, the legions of hypocritical feminist "leaders" who turned a blind eye to Clinton's victims would have been screaming bloody murder.) Nor did I ever understand the constant mantra of "leave him alone; the economy's good." As long as people had food in their fridge and money in their wallet, they seemed willing to excuse any kind of behavior from this man. His personal life was none of our business? Please! The way he conducted himself in his personal life -- without shame and full of deceit -- was a reflection of how he governed. How could anyone honestly think that a self-absorbed con man with no sense of decency, dignity, or self-restraint in private affairs would then govern with honor, integrity, and trustworthiness? It's sad that so many people failed to hold their president -- the leader of the free world -- to a higher standard, and that they failed to see beyond their own immediate self-interest when backing this disgraceful blot on the presidency. You almost thought that if the economy was perking along just fine, people wouldn't care if they had a pathological liar or a sexual predator in the White House. Oh, wait. They did.
