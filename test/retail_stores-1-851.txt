Unethical sales practices. Example: Sales promotion for fall 2005 said you would receive a $25 'fall savings card' when you purchase $75 worth of merchandise. They then mail you the card. When you receive the card the fine print says you need to buy another $75 worth of merchandise in order to use the card. So, in reality you're buying $150 worth of merchandise before you can use the $25 savings card. Very deceptive, and it shows disrespect towards customers. Sizing is another big problem - moreso than any other online retailer I buy from. Some items run HUGE, so you never know which size to buy. You could order the item you want in a couple different sizes, but then you're spending a fortune on shipping and returns (and their shipping charges are already terribly high). Some (not all) of the customer service reps, when you call in, are very rude. More often than not. I'm going to boycott Eddie Bauer after this latest 'fall savings card' incident.
