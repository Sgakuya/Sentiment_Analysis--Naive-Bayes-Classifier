This company doesn't even deserve the default one star! I purchased a box link chain necklace, wore it twice and it broke mid-chain while I was turning the clasp to the back. Unfortunately, by this time it was months down the road, I had thrown the receipt and the phone number for the store listed on the corporate website was out of service. Grrr! Normally I wouldn't be caught dead in a mall jewelry store* but since the purchase was only $50, I caved. Stay away from this bomb! *Cross the mall hall to Bailey Banks and Biddle - they provide excellent product and professional service worthy of a private jeweler.
