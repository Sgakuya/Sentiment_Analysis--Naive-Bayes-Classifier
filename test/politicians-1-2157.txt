Got to thank you for helping to ensure my Grandparents developed cancer and died, mostly 'cause he helped overturned environmental protection laws that outlawed the use of many carinogenic chemicals, only to expand on that poor legacy in the Oval Office, where he's helped to poison millions of Americans across not just Texas, but the entire nation, helping to poison future generations of citizens across the world with poor domestic, foreign, and economic policies.
