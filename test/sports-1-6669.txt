This guy is the biggest joke in pro sports. His fellow coaches have little respect for him because he's backstabbed his way through organizations, first undermining Collins in Chicago and then West in Los Angeles- The media fawn at his feet because he has had the access to the NBA's superstars- Listening to him yap cause me to puke-This guy couldn't coach a turtle out of its shell....
