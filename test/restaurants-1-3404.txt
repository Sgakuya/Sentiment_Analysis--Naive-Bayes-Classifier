I wouldn't be surprised if every ingredient in this crap is fake. They have to rely on promoting gimmicks like Dipping Strips (pizza cut into dippable strips) and cheese-stuffed crust, because the actual quality of the pizza sure as hell isn't going to sell it. And their ads were annoying even before they added Jessica Simpson to them.
