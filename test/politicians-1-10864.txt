What a disappointment he is. I thought he was a principled person who voted his conscience, but in fact, he's a sleazy pol who votes for political expediency. In voting against Condi Rice recently, he sucked up to the left wing fringe of his party and betrayed his constituency. Evan, you can suck up all you want to the Dean wing of the party, but you aint' gonna get the '08 nomination!
