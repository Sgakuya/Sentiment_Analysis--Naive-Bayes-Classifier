Went to Las Vagas for a convention the other month and walk over to a Papa Johns down the street. Boy was that bad. First I ordered the large Pepperoni with free cinnabun for $9.99. After 20 minute of waiting (no other customers) they charged me $12.99 and gave me the Pizza, no cinnabun. Oh, you have to wait another 15 minutes Yeah right. Got back to the convention, and where is the Pepperoni????... all hiding underneath the cheese!!! Yikes!! Uncooked Pepperoni??? How many did they put in there? Probably so little just to save $$. Have anyone really eaten good pizza before they give good ratings or are you just stuck to a few chains a matter of choice.
