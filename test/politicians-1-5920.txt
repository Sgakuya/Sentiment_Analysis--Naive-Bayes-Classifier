A hipocrate of the highest degree. Is the perfect image of why the Dems suck. He was, as we all know, a KKK member. He is a bigot and hate mongerer who has deceived to get his base of power. what I do not understand nor will I ever is how the Dems act like the party that liberated blacks when the Rep's actually did the deed while guys like him hated them. How could any black walk lockstep with the Dems when history proves they are the party of hate. An active ex KKK meber!!! Think about that. The best indication of one's future performance is their past performance.
