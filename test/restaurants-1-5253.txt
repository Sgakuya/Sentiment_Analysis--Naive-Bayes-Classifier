Right down there with TGI Fridays and Outback Steakhouse as far as usefulness goes, Don Pablo's is just boring and bland. This includes their food--which pales in comparison to Taco Bell's delicious Chicken Soft Tacos, for example. Of course, the prices are too high. The internal design is extremely dark and uncreative, compared to the bright pastels and open windows of much better fast food restaurants. They also serve alcohol, which is an automatic minus.
