screw dook the heels are underrated. we lost our top 7 scorers and still beat a regular season team by around 50. THAT is amazing coaching. not coach k. all i hear is coach k. i live in durham. coach k's overrated, too. the dude's got his own satellite radio show, all his commercials, everything. its clear he only wants to make money.
