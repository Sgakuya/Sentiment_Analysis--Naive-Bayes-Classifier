Man what a suckhole team! These guys are close to the worst team in the league! Poor Byron human sandwich Leftwich got thrown into the lion's den because Brunell can't get it up anymore. Where the hell is Jimmy Smith and Fred Taylor? For crying out loud, help this kid out! Leftwich is getting creamed every game! When you look at him at the end of the game, he makes Patrick Ramsey's uniform look clean! The defense couldn't stop a junior high team from Montana, let alone an NFL-caliber one. Jack Del Rio was put in a bad situation, and it's getting worse by the week.
