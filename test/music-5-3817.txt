One of the best records of its era. Mainstream rock that's commerical enough, but not dumbed down to the lowest common demoninator. Excellent production values and well played/sung. "Refugee" is lightyears better than anything ever churned out by douchebags like Bruce Springsteen, Freddie Mercury and Stink, er, Sting. "Here Comes My Girl," standard rock ballad, makes "Rumours" sound like the soundtrack for the Girl Scouts of America. This is serious, mature rock and roll, not the typical mindless warbles designed to get the attention of pimply-faced adolescents.
