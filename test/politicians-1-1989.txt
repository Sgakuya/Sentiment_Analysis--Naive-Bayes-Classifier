I have never voted for a Democrat, but I will vote for whoever runs against Mike Huckabee. I just saw on the news how he's going to grant clemency for 3 more murderers. This is ridiculous! Not only that but he continues to raise taxes--food is not exempt from taxes here in Arkansas, because the store owners are too stupid to figure it out (this according to Huckabee--my translation). Get this idiot out!
