Nelson Mandela is a terrorist, elitist and racist. He uses his color to attain high political stature, while his people suffer in misery and crime, much of which he contributed to. He has committed many acts of murder and terror and has left many children orphaned and homeless. His politics are communist, and he has destroyed the economy of the only country in Africa that actually worked. Radicalsim and racism are bad, even if they come from black people.
