I love this band and all their many efforts! I just saw them in concert March 28, 2001 and it was one of the best shows I have ever attended! I have never seen so much emotion poured on to a stage in all my life! The album is a masterpiece and should be regarded as such! Raine is a suberbly talented musician/lyricist. OLP is a wonderfully creative band! I love this band and this album! Everyone should have one!
