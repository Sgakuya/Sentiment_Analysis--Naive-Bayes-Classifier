A great pioneering Christian metal band. The tragedy: they got blasted by the Christian community for publishing a non-JesusFreak album, which led to this terrific band's dissolution as a group and passage into history. That secular album, Against the Law, was probably their most mature work. As a consolation, one of the founding members, Michael Sweet, has been performing solo and is still producing Stryper-like music.
