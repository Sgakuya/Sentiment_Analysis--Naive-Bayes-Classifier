We had our ring custom made with Fred Meyers. We have had to take the ring back every month since we have had it.They have scratched it, gave us the wrong diamonds. Forgot to put a prong on it, and the management wouldn't respond to a letter we wrote. They ignored us and did a horrible job. I absolutely would never recommend them.
