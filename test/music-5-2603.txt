Simply one of the greatest albums by The Beatles- Abbey Road is the definition of Masterpiece . There's not one song on this album that I skip through. Everyone is worth listening to. My personal favorites being Something, Here Comes the Sun (Being written by my man-George!), Sun King, She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, etc. They're all great! Every single person should purchase this album-Beatle Fan or not-it's enjoyable for everyone.
