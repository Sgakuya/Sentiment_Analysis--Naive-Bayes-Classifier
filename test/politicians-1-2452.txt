This guy was so lame that most New Yorkers were left feeling nostalgic for the days of Ed Koch, which is pretty sad. Guiliani doubled the city debt to $40 billion, left us with a $4 billion budget deficit, hired 10,000 cops it turned out we didn't need, and provided no tax relief for working New Yorkers while he doled out hundreds of millions of dollars in tax forgiveness to the corporations year after year. His coked-up, racist thugs on the NYPD proclaimed it open season on African-American men under the age of 50, hassling, shooting and raping citizens who were guilty of little or nothing more than having dark skin. Despite all his insincere lipservice to this issue, Guiliani had absolutely no problem with this. In addition, our infrastructure problems went begging during his reign of terror, as did our sick joke of a school district, and this twerp trampled on the civil rights of freedom of speech and assembly again and again. He tried to sell New Yorkers on the idea of a $1 billion stadium for his beloved dickweed Yankees, and when the public told him to drop dead he turned around and spent something like $150 million on two minor league stadiums we didn't need or want. He set himself up a a Morality Czar and protector of that criminal conspiracy known as the Catholic Church, but had no problem parading around his old whore, Judith Nathan, like she was the Virgin Mary or something. Current Mayor Bloomie inherited a plethora of problems resulting from Guiliani's idiotic policies and lack of action on critical issues, which indicates that our former Mayor wasn't so great after all. Seems like the people who have the highest opinion of Guiliani are the rightwing droolers who don't know any better who live out in the economically, culturally and socially deprived backwaters of this country, while his former constituency sees him for what he is: a headline-grabbing, hypocritical adulterer who polarized this city along racial, social and ideological lines, and failed to address several major needs of the citizens while ushering other problems of his own making. In this, he is possibly the most overrated political figure in this country, which, after all, is noteworthy in its overpraising and hyping up of the thieves, scoundels, charlatans and clowns who are called our leaders.
