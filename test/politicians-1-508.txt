How the hell can this guy be at the top of the list? He is a socialist. He says if there is any country in the world who has committed unspeakable altrocities it is the United States. Not Lennin, not Stalin, not Hitler and definitely not Saddam Hussein. What a dimwit. Remember, it was us who was attacked at Pearl Harbor where 2600 US servicemen died. Don't even get me started on September 11. Remember what the Japanese did to the American POW's before we nuked them? Oh, I guess that was inhumane to do. Every country seems to be crucifying the U.S. for bombing Japan except Japan. Gee...I wonder why considering what we did for them afterwards. Bush just pledged $4 billion for aids relief in Mandela's country knowing that he won't be thanked for it and Mandela continues to rip Bush a new one saying he has no business in Iraq. Hey, we have a right to protect out citizens at home and abroad. We don't need UN approval to do that! He also says that the reason there hasn't been a third world war is because of the UN yet every time someone takes up arms the UN runs and hides behind the United States and expects us to do the dirty work. What a coward.
