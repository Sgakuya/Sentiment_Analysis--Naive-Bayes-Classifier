Not a bad airport facilty but it is famous for having so many delays. One time I was stuck out on the runway in the jet for 2 hours simply because they had malfunctiong radio aircraft control. Sitting stuck out on the runway with seatbelts fastened and no beverage service for 2 hours sucks !!! In the future I will try to avoid connecting at this airport and I reccomend you do too if you can help it.
