A leader is someone who takes a little more than his share of the blame and a little less than his share of the credit. By this definition, Mr. Jackson is not a leader. He is a phrasemaker. Now he is trying to spread at least three myths about himself: Myth # 1 he fessed up. He kept his daughter a secret until she was 20 months old and a supermarket tabloid was on the verge of letting the cat out of the bag. Myth #2 He has been providing emotional support. How much emotional support can you provide to a child living thousands of miles away and which you are trying to keep secret? Myth #3 He has been providing financial support. It smells more like hush money! That $35,000.00 came from Operation PUSH. Whoever heard of a non-profit coughing up that kind of sevrence pay? This is more reminiscent of Benjamin Chavez and the money he got the NAACP to pay the subordinate HE had been using sexually. During the period he was conceiving this child, Jacson was counseling President Clinton on his sexual indiscretions and piously talking about the sacred relationship between priest and President. Jackson has made a career on blaming white racism for black poverty. Research shows that poverty (and many other social ills) are linked to the father being absent. Face it, Jesse, you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem!
