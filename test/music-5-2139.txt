Once again this rock n roll band has done a good job. I recently went to the concert in Rome, Italy. I really wish this band would get more publicity here in the states besides NY. They are big in Europe. The drummer Fab Moretti seems to be getting the most publicity, I guess Drew is helping him out. Singer Julian Casablancas needs more exposure. I think his voice is great.
