My son loves football and loves this team. I generally loathe sports and particularly dislike football. Greenbay worship brings me to the point of understanding that much of America simply adores gladitor spectacles mixed with beer-swilling fat people who look like their brain function stopped at kickoff. I believe the three worst things to happen to America are Miracle Whip, NFL football, and Pee Wee Herman. Somehow I wish we could mix all 3 in one event - I might pay!
