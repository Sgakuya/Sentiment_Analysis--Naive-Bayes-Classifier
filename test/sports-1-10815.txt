I love to see Spurrier do his temper tantrums on the side lines then throw that visor to the ground. He does seem to coach well enough to get his team to bowl games. What makes me sick is to see him get a break in a game when a BAD call goes his way then he gets that smurk on his face like the Grinch, you all know what I mean. GO VOLS!!!!!!
