The war in Iraq is lost. Osama Bin Laden is laughing at us because we have made fools of ourselfs. Bush is not the only person to blame. We, the people of this country are allowing it. People who say that they hate Bush are just sitting back letting some guy do whatever he wants. We are all the blame for the war. I hope if people are truly against the war that they will rise up and do something about it. I don't think that people that are against the war know that doing nothing is what he wants you to do. I'm sure I could have a good time grilling a steak with Bush at his ranch, but he is not a good leader. He promotes ignorance, which is Americas biggest problem. Bush absolutley refuses to look at the REAL problems and his supporters are even more ignorant, dumber, stupiter, then this guy is. People are against Bush should be made at the people who voted for him. America has made a fool of itself and we are to blame. I hope people open their eyes and try to learn more about the peoples lives were trying to change in Iraq. I hope people relize that other's are not the enemy, ignorance is the enemy.
