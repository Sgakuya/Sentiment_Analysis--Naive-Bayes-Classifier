Strom Thurmond is one of the most bigoted politicians of the 20th century. There really is no issue of states' rights anymore. The guy is a freakin' nut. As has been mentioned, this nut job is older than dirt. He hasn't obviously had coherent thought ever since he maybe ran as a segragationist in the 1948 presidential election. Now Lott's views are coming to light after saying that the country would've been better off in the area of race relations if this now senile wack job got into office. It thoroughly angers me. I thought that racist would've died so long ago. It especially disgusts me that he still has influence when his views were the norm in about 1830!
