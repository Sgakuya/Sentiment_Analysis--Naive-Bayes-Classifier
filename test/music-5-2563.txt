In the recording industry certain albums are milestones that forever change the way music is made. There is no way I can over exagerate the influence this album had on other artists when it first came out. Many artists, including the Beatles, changed the direction they were going, and tried to keep up with the genius of Brian Wilson. In this universe, once in a very great while, everything just comes together and you get perfection.
