You know who the hot team in the big 10 is every year, because they start their season off by beating Michigan. This is a man who loses to Northwestern, then doesn't make adjustments, and loses to them the following season. Ditto Iowa. Ditto Illinois. He let Jim Tressell call his shot by coming into the big house and beating UM in his first year. He let Michigan suffer their worst home loss EVER against Iowa, because they kept running the same screen pass for 30 yards a pop the whole game, even after halftime. Nice adjustment, Lloyd. This a the coach who had a 6'6 quarterback in John Navarre, who had his passes batted down consistently for four years. What did I see in the Notre Dame game? Six passes knocked down against Chad Henne. Great recruiter? Who's the last great player Michigan has had on defense since Charles Woodson? Miami has had Jon Vilma, Sean Taylor, Dan Morgan, and many more. We've had Dhani Jones. This is not the NFL, where every team has close to the same level of talent. Michigan winning ten games a year should be a given. They are no longer even competitive against Notre Dame, Ohio State, or in the Rose Bowl. A great program with tremendous tradition, run into the ground by a mediocore coach. Fire him, Bo. Fire him and get Kirk Ferentz or Urban Meyer in here, and let's restore order.
