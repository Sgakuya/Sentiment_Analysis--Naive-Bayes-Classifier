Wrongly charged late fees. We rented a video's Dec 28th for a week. They were Tale of Two Towers & Fellowship of the ring. They claim one of them was returned nearly a week and a half late, but the other was returned on time. Funny thing was that I returned both at the same time in their drop box after we saw Return of the King Jan 1st. I remember very clearly since we had a blast at the theater and it was late at night and very cold and I hate the cold. (I had been looking forward to the movie for a long time too) Now how could one of the videos be late but not the other if both were placed in the drop box at the same time. Yet somehow I am at fault and owe $35 in late fees. Additionally, we found out about the late fee while trying to rent another movie 6 months later. There were no calls from Block Buster, no postcards....nothing. Since we are planning to buy a house soon we are VERY careful to pay all our bills. Blockbuster personell say that I have received the calls and postcards and that their system works fine. They are wrong. The fact that only one of the two videos I returned at the same time showed up late is proof.
