1star for being a dookie but i do not hate the kid . I feel too confident in North Carolina to hate anybody thiis year. It seems redundant and silly to go on how you hate somebody over and over like some on this site do, when there is no real threat. Tarheel fans, you are giving this kid too nuch credit. Hate the guy on the team that can possibly beat us. Hate Paul or Luther Head or some player. Who cares about dudes on teams that it would be an upset to beat us? let him hit ten threes - we have 5 future NBA'ers. Who cares? That is like if Mike Tyson felt threatened by Screech. This year anyway. Feelow Heels, they almost lost to Clemson at Home. F Redick.
