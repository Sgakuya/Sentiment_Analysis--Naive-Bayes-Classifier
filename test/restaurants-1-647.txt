Krispy Kreme makes you appreciate Dunkin Donuts so much more. I've heard of people driving long distances just to get one, and I really don't get why. These donuts are not great, in fact they're horibble. I don't see why people are so in love them. They overdue it with the glazed which makes the donuts TOO sugary. There is more topping than there is donut itself. There selection really sucks and they don't offer anything other than coffee and donuts. I'll stick to DD!
