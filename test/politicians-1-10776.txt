James Buchanan was elected President just as the bloodshed in Kansas was raging and the nation was on its way to Civil War. He made no secret of his feelings on slavery- he believed it to be a states' rights issue. His predacessor had made the same mistake, and lives were lost because of it. (1)Crisis Leadership: 1 out of 5 stars- Buchanan was just another one of those Presidents in the 1850s who did nothing to stop the war. His narrow-minded views on slavary brought us even closer to Civil War. The battle raged in Kansas, and Buchanan, in a narrow-minded move, begged Congress for Kansas's admission as a slave state. This failed and the issue of slavery in Kansas would not be resolved until 1861, when it was admitted as a free state. He also sided with the South when he offered a reward for the capture of John Brown, a black abolishionist who had been murdering pro-slavery advocates in the South. Brown's execution angered Northerners everywhere. The South, also was angered because it showed that the North was willing to end slavery by murder and bloodshed. The President did nothing to appease the North, simply because he was fearful of provoking the South. (2)Diplomatic Relations: 2 out of 5 stars- Buchanan continued the efforts of Pierce to annex Cuba, but was blocked by outcry from abolishionists. He did however, manage to warn the British off from pursuing its interest in Central America. However, due to the conflict at home, he was unable to stop the conflicts in the Rio Grande Valley, where Mexicans were still killing American settlers. (3)Economic Management: 2 out of 5 stars- Much due to the actions of his predacessor, the economy had fallen into a recession and continued to do so throughout Buchanan's term. (4)Vision For the Country:1 out of 5 stars- Buchanan had absolutely no vision for this nation. His Presidency, like that of his predacessors, simply marked another stepping stone towards war. His Presidency marked a period in which the South was appeased and the North basically ignored. (5)Morality/Popularity:1 out of 5 Stars- He was extremely unpopular when he left office. His behind the scenes dealings with the Supreme Court helped influence their decision in the Dred Scott Case. He also sought to again appease the south in the John Brown Rebellion and by pleading with the Congress that Kansas be admitted as a slave state. [Final Score: 1.4] In the final analysis, Buchanan simply stood by and while making efforts to appeal the South, alienated the North and further divided this country and brought it to the doorstep of Civil War.
