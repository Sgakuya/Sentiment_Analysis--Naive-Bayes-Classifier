I'd like to add my 2-cents worth to this discussion about Whitehall. I have been in the retail jewelry business for over 40 years. I was a store manager for them for 2 years and have never seen such a deceptive, low-class outfit. I know some have had good service from them, but I dare say not one of them has gotten either what he or she paid for, or what they THINK they got. By this I mean their ridiculous 50% off scam! I was a manager, and as such, manager's were able to purchase items for personal use at 50% of the SALES price, which means a ring marked $1,000.00 was sold to the public for $500, but a manager could purchase it for $250. In November of every year they had a period where employees got extra discounts, and this same ring was offered to managers for an additional 20% off. that means that a manager could purchase a ring "referenced" for $1,000 for $200!!!!! And they were STILL making a profit on it. NOBODY in the retail jewelry industry LEGITMATELY marks their merchandise with a five-time markup and stays in business! This is a scam! Special orders sometimes took up to 3 or 4 months because they had to wait for the piece to be be made in CHINA!!!! The quality of their jewelry was the lowest I have ever encountered in over 40 years experience. You'd be better off buying something from Walmart! Not to mention they are the most unethical company I've ever seen. One of my employees blatantly stole from the company, and complaints to the district and regional managers fell on deaf ears because she was a "Chairman's Club" member, which means she attained the highest sales goals possible. So they were willing to keep dishonest thieves as long as they produced high numbers. The company is garbage, and if you're happy with them and have gotten good service from them consider yourself lucky. But a word to the wise....sooner or later you'll see what a scam piece of garbage this company really is. My advice, find an independent jeweler, preferably AGS certified, and forget about the chain stores for your jewelry needs, and especially forget about Whitehall. P.S. Everything I've said about Whitehall goes double for Lundstrom!! At least Whitehall knows it's as second class outfit and doesn't try to act like they're some fine quality high class operation like Lundstrom. The jewelry is identidal, the prices are the same, but the employees think they are God's gift to the jewelry industry. All 3 of their brands....Whitehall, Lundstrom, and Marks Brothers are one and the same.....low quality, low class GARBAGE!
