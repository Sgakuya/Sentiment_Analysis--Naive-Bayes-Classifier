Rumor has it that he has enjoyed the company of men. Many presidents have, although some more than others. I do not support this belief at all! IT IS JUST A RUMOR I HEARD. THAT'S IT. I will not cite the source of this rumor due to his embarrassment at this confession and also due to our Lying--COUGH--I MEAN WONDERFUL PRESIDENT. NICE! Also, the low rating was because he opposed slavery. WHY!?!?!?!?!? THE ENCOMIENDA SYSTEM RULED!
