Hey, I'm getting sick of all these comments on music and junk. I'm not a little 15 yr old teenybopper, I am, surprisingly a metal head from hell. But if you want to not listen to her, turn the radio off moron. She isn't a Britany Spears wanna be. She has a body and should show it. (well maybe a little, you know like belly and stuff) but not like Spears. She is One of my Fav singers in the world. I love her. I hate teenyBopper pop but she is something else. I am a collector of her music and merch. Metal for life, with a huge love and much respect to Mandy. If you ever read this Mandy, send me a message and I Love you.
