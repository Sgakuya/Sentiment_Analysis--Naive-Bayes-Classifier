Pink's album is beyond words. I love it, she has her own style that is mind blowing. Its one of those CDs you can't take out of your CD player, you just keep playing it over and over again. CDs like hers are hard to find. You can play this CD all the way through, all the songs are awesome! Its definitely a 5-Star CD and a must have!
