Dillards is the worst department store to work for period. They have very stupid rules for employees that make no sence at all. The corportaion is running all of their employees away and they do not care because they will replace them with anyone. Dillards workers should uninte and go on strike. Do not allow yourself or anyone you know to work at ANY dillards store. They are slowly killing their business by treating their staff like garbage.
