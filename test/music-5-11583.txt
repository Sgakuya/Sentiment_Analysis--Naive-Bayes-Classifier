Even though I haven't listened to all of their CDs, this has been my favorite out of all of them. Surprisingly, I like all of the songs on this CD. That hasn't happened to a lot, but this is one of those CDs. I could rock to this CD for, like, a long time. Love the lyrics(even the cussing) and love even more the guitar and drums! This CD rocks!!
