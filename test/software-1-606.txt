Talk about bugs .. this horribly conceived product must have been invented by sadists with nothing better to do than frustrate users with repeated crashes, random error messages and functions that simply refuse to work for no particular reason. Unless you want to spend hours of frustration, I suggest staying away from this product. Here's an idea -- if you LIKE to be frustrated, save yourself some money and watch a few Bulls games on TV.
