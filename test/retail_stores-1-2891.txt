My daughter bought me a blue topaz and diamond pendant in 14K White gold for my birthday. I loved the pendant, but the chain was too small. I bought a new change and when I went to put the pendant on, the stone slipped backward in the setting. I was able to move the stone back and forth since it was set on just 2 sides (bar type setting). They had suckered my daughter into buying the extended warranty on this necklace so I took it in the next day to find out what to do. The first thing they asked me was if I had the extended warranty, which I did, but my question was Why do I need an extended warranty on a piece that hasn't even been worn? The manager of the store had to butt in and try to fast talk me. They wrote it all up (it took about 30 minutes) and then told me I'd have to come back 8 days later to pick it up - they do not call you when something is ready. Before the 8 days were up, the store called my daughter and told her there was a chip in the stone and that it would cost her $40 more to repair it - how do you repair a chip in a stone anyway? She became quite upset with them and called back to the sales person she liked. That woman apologized to her about the way the other person approached her and told my daughter she would find a new pendant in another store to replace this damaged one. Well, another week went by and guess what - they couldn't locate another pendant like the one I had. The one good thing is that they did refund her total purchase price including the price of the warranty. We will now shop elsewhere for another pendant.
