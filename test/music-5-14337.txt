For any soundtrack fan like me, this album is a joy. Alsion Krauss' voice has never sounded more pure or beautiful than on the tracks 'My Ain True Love' and 'Scarlet Tide'. Both of which were nominated for Academy awards. The music is haunting and sentimental. Plus, the album boasts the other great talents of Sting and Elvis Costello.
