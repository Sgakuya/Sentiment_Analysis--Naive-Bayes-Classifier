My husband put a ring on layaway in the Visalia, CA store. We put money down filled out the paperwork and watched them put it in the safe. We went back 3 weeks later to get it and they sold it to someone else. Then to top it off they wanted to take the remainder of our balance and order us another ring. We didn't give them the money but we told them to order our ring. Our ring came in 6 months after our wedding in the wrong size and now they want to charge us to size it. My advice to anyone who is thinking of going there is RUN RUN away from that or Crescent Jewelers as fast as you can. I can't even get anyone to give me the phone number to their coporate headquaters. Very bad customers service, I got married without my ring and now it's the wrong size that was suppose to be the easy part of getting married buying the rings....
