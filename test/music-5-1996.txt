As im writing this, im listening to this album! I have rated about 25 albums in this catagory so far, and this one is deffinately the best one I have rated so far. The bass is great! plus, they have a great varity of music. Some music is accustic, some is hard rock. However, after hearing the album, Its amazing to find out that there were no computers, or anything in making the album, and only TWO people play the insturments. HIGHLY reccomended-Whatever your taste of music is!
