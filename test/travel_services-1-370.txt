Stay away from US Air's travel vouchers! They're bogus. What they don't tell you is, they are only good for a promotional fare class, like mileage seats, and once those few seats are gone on a given flight, you're out of luck. Free travel within the 48 states and Canada means travel on US Air's terms and at US Air's convenience. Keep your seat!
