Rest In Peace Joe Stummer (lead singer) he died at the age of 50 from a heart attack just after Christmas. The Clash were an absolutely fantastic band. Meant to be absolutely brilliant live (my mother saw them in the late 70's and loved it) 'London Calling' is such an anthem, especially to me as I live in London. Its one to sing/shout to. Me and my other half usually sing 'I live by the canal' instead of 'I live by the river' as the band lived in camden, which happens to have a canal running through. I totally agree with Shafty with listening to 'Story of the Clash' and you also get to listen to great songs such as 'Rock The Khyber' Legend of a band.
