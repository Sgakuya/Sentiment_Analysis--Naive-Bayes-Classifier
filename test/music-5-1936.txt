This album just shows what an amazing and talented group OLP really are. I personally have been a fan of OLP since their first album Naveed. Their music has always been there for me when I needed it and has helped a great deal. I am a devoted fan to this band because of how mind-blowing they are. It is really hard to find a band that you could even slightly compare to OLP because they just simply don t exist. Obviously there are many talented bands out there but not the extent of OLP. OLP were able to release another album only a year after their third album's release and were able to make this album sound unique and amazing with a completely different sound with out making another album with the same sounding songs like some bands do. They have a huge fan base of people all over the world who the band them selves treat like people and respect just as much as we respect them. The drummer Jeremy Taggart is extremly gifted and really knows how to make a distinctive sound for the band. Mike Turner the Guitarist is remarkable; the talent he contributes to the band is evident in this album and in all their albums. Duncan Coutts is the bass player and he just plain out Rocks!! Raine Maida the vocals and guitarist is an exceedingly talented person. The lyrics he writes for the band in this album are thought-provoking and lead the listener to see beyond the music and think about issues that are going on and the future of this world and trying to make a difference, if not for the whole world but a least inside your own head. Also his voice offers a distinctive sound for the band that you can easily separate from all other bands. And they of course there is Jamie Edwards who joined the band during their third album and has joined them again for this album and is now touring with them. Even though Jamie is not an official member he still contributes a lot to the band and to this album. Most bands out there now are not able to do what this band has done. There is just far too much crap out there that doesn t know what music is all about. What music is all about OLP have done! They push the boundaries and make their own rules and don't copy what other bands do or say. They are truly exceptional and have managed to stay true to their fans. They are a band that will never stop touring or putting albums because they know what their music means to their fans, and not only that but music is their life. They are not in it for another reason except for the music. They have just done it again. Every album they have released have just raised the bar and shown the world what rock music is all about. They are with out a doubt the most talented band to ever come out of Canada and the one of the most amazing live bands ever.
