Al Gore is nothing more than a radical, would-be tyrant. Americans should thank God that he did not get into office. His complicity in the ongoing slaughter of the unborn will land him in hot water in the afterlife. He should be put on trial for treason for his complicity in the selling of nuclear secrets to Red China. His statements regarding gun rights to the effect that he would respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen should give Americans pause. The purpose of the Second Amendment is to enable American citizens to defend themselves from a tyrranical federal government, if necessary.
