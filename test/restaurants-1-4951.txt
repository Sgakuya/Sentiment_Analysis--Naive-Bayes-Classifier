As I understand it very little food is actually prepare at the location. It is my understanding that every thing is re-heated. The LAST time I was there I order Minestrone soup and what I got was hot water with a bunch of beans. I really do not understand why this place is so popular. Find a local Italian restaurant you will be much happier.
