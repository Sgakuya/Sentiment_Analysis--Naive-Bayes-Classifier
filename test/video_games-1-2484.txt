Whoa! This isn't like Nintendo at all. Starting out as an innocuous 3D Platformer that looked to be pretty good (from the makers of Banjo-Kazooie and Diddy Kong Racing no less!) and then turned totally evil. A rated-M game published by Nintendo. Now, I've seen everything. Again, thank goodness Rare is gone. I can even tolerate the loss of the enjoyable Banjo-Kazooie franchise if it means no more Conker and Perfect Dark junk to taint Nintendo's name.
