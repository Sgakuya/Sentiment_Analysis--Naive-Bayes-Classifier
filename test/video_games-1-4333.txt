What ? You call this an RPG game ? And PC RPG ? Are you crazy ? I wonder if those Japaneses know something about what RPG really mean ! You control the guy (note the ), go there kill that, chose yes/no , no dialogue options, no free will , kill bad guys, save the world clich . If you like this game for a RPG, you seriously need to go out and find a definition of RPG. This is a typical console game, action to dead, extremly linear. I say we watch this game instead of playing it. Want a true RPG ? Go play Fallout and BG series or Torment. Let's call it stupid-jap-so-called-RPG, but not PC-RPG for the sake of RPG .
