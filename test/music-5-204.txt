A masterpiece. Great album from beginning to end...and what an ending...Garage is my favorite song on the album...I can listen to that track over and over and never get tired of it. This album is timeless. "I've got an electric guitar I play my stupid songs I write these stupid words And I love every one Waiting there for me Yes I do, I do"
