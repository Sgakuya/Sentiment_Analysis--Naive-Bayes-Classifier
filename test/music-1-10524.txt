I just love Gloria Estefan. She's so pretty and....Oh wait, this is Ricky.. I get the two confused, they look so much alike. Looks like another fan club has struck again. I guess they all got together over a bowl of cocoa puffs and plotted for supremacy of shallow crappy pop. For that they must be commended but might I mention that a Saved by the Bell rerun is playing so you might want to catch it and leave the music to those who do more than shake their little tushy.. Summation: Ricky sucks !!
