Paper Mario is a total let down. This game is stupid. I love Mario and always have. I grew up with the dude for crying out loud. Truly, I thought that Paper Mario was against everything that Mario stands for. The format of this game went from a very present, immediate challenge to something much more like the original Zelda (i.e. when you run into the enemy you have to switch realms in order to fight him). I am TOTALLY unimpressed by this game, and find it hard to believe that the creators and editors thought this to be an acceptable concept for Mario in the year 2005. However, I think that the graphics are pretty fun and the music is not so great.
