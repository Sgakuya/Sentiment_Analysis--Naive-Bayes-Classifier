This is by far the BEST cd that has ever been made in the history of rap and hip hop. I got this cd like....5 years ago...i listen to it to THIS DATE. There are what...13, 14 songs on this cd, every single one is better than any other song made since then, without doubt. This cd made me look at rap in a different way...anyone out there looking for a hip hop or rap joint...get this oldy, you'll be happy no doubt.
