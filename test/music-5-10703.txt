This album isn`t good, `cause it`s amazing, great and outstanding. I`ve been listening Hanson music since 1997. It still goes on. It will never stop. And I`ll kick your ass, if you say that they make bad music. Millions of their albums` copies are sold all over the world. It really proves that they are genius musicians. Positive energie, good sound, truthful songs! What else? I think they`ve got everything to be popular. They really need it. They deserve it!
