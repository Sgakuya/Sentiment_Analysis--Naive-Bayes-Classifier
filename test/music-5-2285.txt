10 bucks. That's all it costs to pick up this amazing cd. Latching onto the mold of female-led rock bands like Evanescence, Flyleaf nevertheless adds something new to the mix. Lead singer Lacey Mosley can be haunting and insightful, ala Amy Lee, but she can also throw in a little screamo for good measure. I haven't heard a female singing screamo in forever. The cd is self-titled. It is rather short at only a half hour even, but it holds your interest throughout. 'Cassie' is a haunting look back at the tragic Columbine shootings. 'Breathe Today' is the best song on the record. The music video for 'Breathe Today' can be found free at yahoo.com if anyone wants to check that out. Seriously, listen to all the songs. 'Sorrow is one of my personal favorites because it has great harmony on the chorus and just seems to evoke feelings from me very well. BUY FLYLEAF before they break out and the price goes up. When they do and you haven't gotten their cd yet and have to pay more money- don't say I didn't warn you.
