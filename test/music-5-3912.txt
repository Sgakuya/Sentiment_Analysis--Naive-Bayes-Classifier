A brilliant album by a band that was very popular in the U.K., but never made it in America, though they got great reviews. Contained future ELO guys Roy Wood, Jeff Lynne, and Bev Bevan, though Lynne wasn't with them yet at the time that this album was being recorded. IMO The Move are much, MUCH greater than ELO,don't assume that if you hate ELO you'll hate them too. Released in early 1970, its sales were poor, though reviews were generally great. This album contains three originals on side one. "Hello Suzie" is a heavy metal pop song, with phenomenal drumming, that Wood had given to Welsh hitmaking band Amen Corner a year before. "Beautiful Daughter" is a sad ballad with gorgeous strings, and "Cherry Blossom Clinic Revisited" is an epic, ear shattering remake of a song that appeared on their debut record in '68. This marvelous tune incorporates classical standards by Bach and others, but not in a dull or pompous way. Side 2 has three long covers. The first is" Fields of People," a baroque/ Indian music version of a song by the obscure New York band Ars Nova. The second is "Don't Make My Baby Blue," a heavy rendition of a hit by The Shadows. The third is a loud version of "The Last Thing On My Mind," an incredible song that was originally a self-penned Tom Paxton number. Although the tracks are long, and there's only 6 of them, this powerful album has acid rock, proto heavy metal, jazz, classical rock, folk, pop, Indian music, and more. Brilliant album, one of my all time favorites.
