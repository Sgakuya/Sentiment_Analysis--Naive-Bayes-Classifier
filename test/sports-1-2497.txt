LOL. I am so proud of everyone for rating the cubs so low. These notorious losers have the worst fans in the world. I don't live that far from chicago and have gone to many cubs games and these freakin fans suck. They spend all their time buying souvenires, getting drunk and acting like complete aholes. Half of those people don't even watch the game. They suck almost every year yet the somehow believe that the next year will be their year. LOSERS They will not win the world series this year or any year. MARK MY WORDS
