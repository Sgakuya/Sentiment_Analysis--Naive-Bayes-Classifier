Dead because they were friends or associates of Clinton that knew too much Bubba that would've destroyed his political career, a career that was so disgustingly overrated! This guy got away with murder so many times. Plus, it made me sick seeing a president on TV at the same time when a ticker tape on the bottom said, parental discretion is strongly advised. He's supposed to be a leader of the free world and an honorary statesman, and seeing that ticker tape at the bottom of the screen during the Lewinsky scandal just told me the truth. His administration was explicit, not to mention a downright joke. God help us let there not be another one like him. Satan will see you in hell when your time comes, Bill.
