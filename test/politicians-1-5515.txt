Kerry as president is scarier than Gore as president. He doesn't have good looks to fall back on. I guess his only claim to fame is the ability to attract rich women. Is this a quality we want for president? As a middle class taxpayer I have several concerns. I'm not sure how Kerry who lives off rich women can truly understand what it is like to have to work for a living. I'd also like to know how much money was spent removing the fire hydrant in front of his Beacon Hill Mansion. I sure hope the voters wake up.
