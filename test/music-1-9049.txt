We are supposed to rate the video right? well what the hell is going on in it? The girl dies from something and is alive in the end. Did the main guy dream this up or something? And even if that is what happens how does that tie into the song? The video makes the lead singer look really ugly, which he is but this video really makes him look scary. He should put out a Halloween mask.
