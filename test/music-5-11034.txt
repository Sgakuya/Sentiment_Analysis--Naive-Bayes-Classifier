One of the best CD's I own.Very good music and lyrics to all the songs on the CD.I was very impressed when I got it and listened to it and after that I was hooked.Now my t.A.T.u. collection has grown to 11 CD's and various items. My love for the music and girls has grown to the point of me actually wanting to go to Moscow.That should show you somthing. If A group can actually get you to go to a different country then there pretty damn good. Way to go Yulia and Lena keep up the good work!
