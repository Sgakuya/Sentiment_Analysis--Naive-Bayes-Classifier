The worst franchise in sports! In 33 years, they have only made the playoffs 3 times and won a grand total of one playoff series...as the Buffalo Braves. They have made terrible draft choices in year's past, and the few good players they do get end up leaving because they want to play for a winner (on a side note, free Elton Brand! He doesn't deserve this!) Donald Sterling only cares about lining his own pockets, yet he lucks into sharing the Staples Center with the Lakers. Talk about undeserving! The red-headed stepchild of LA is going nowhere so long as Sterling owns the team. What a joke!
