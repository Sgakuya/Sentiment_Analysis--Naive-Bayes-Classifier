Andrew Jackson was by far a terrible president. It's not just because of the Indian Removal Act either. (that of which he completely and publically defied the supreme court chief justice john marshall by continuing.) Andrew Jackson allowed his private thoughts meddle with his ability to govern a nation. Not only that, the way he got into office was terrible. It wasn't even necessary to win the Battle of New Orleans, and i think quincy was much more suitable for the job. also he tried to shut down the national bank. he was a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE president.
