I cannot even ENTER this store! Why? The music is blaring so loudly that I can't hear myself think, and the perfume smell is so overpowering that I get an instant sinus headache. What clothes could really be worth all that trouble?? Besides, I never see anyone wearing this label who looks particularly good, so I assume I'm not missing out on much, (and I'm probably saving loads of cash as well)!
