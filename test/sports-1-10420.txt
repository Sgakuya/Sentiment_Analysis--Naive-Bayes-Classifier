No way today, cannot creat a team that run, pass or kick anymore. The truth is he is now too selfish putting himself ahead of the game, his program and players. Shame one of the best in history, but in the future, they will say, I did not want to go out like Joe Paterno did, not knowing when to retire for the program he built up.
