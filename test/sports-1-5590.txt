If the guy can score at will as UNC fans claim, why do they lose to Santa Clara? A guy can have all the talent in the world, but if he's going to complain about how nobody loves him and nobody understands him, he'll be nothing more than the next T-Mac, not the next Jordan. T-Mac collects scoring titles, but Jordan collected trophies. How many championships has McGrady played in since leaving high school? Same number as McCants. 0. And oh, by the way, you-cantrunwithus, who exactly can't run with you? Travis Niesen?
