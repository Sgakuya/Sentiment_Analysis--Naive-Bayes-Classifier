Quite possibly one of my least favorite presidents in a long line of stinkers, George Dubya would probably be a much less obnoxious person if he held another job (I dont care what the job is, as long as he can't in any way affect politics.) Despite this, Istill consider him to be a considerably better politician than Pat Buchanan or Jesse Helms. Still, Al Gore in his strong environmental and economic concerns (he's no Clinton, but he'll do) would make a much better president than Mr. Bush.
