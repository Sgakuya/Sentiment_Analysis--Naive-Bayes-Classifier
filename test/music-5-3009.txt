This review refers to the British version of A Hard Days Night, which is currently available on cd worldwide. Other albums by The Beatles may have been more innovative, but for me, A Hard Days Night is the most fun to listen to. To the band, this was a soundtrack to the movie of the same name (my 2nd favorite movie ever, by the way), but if you look at the state of pop music in 1964, this album was a huge leap in quality. Everyone else had to play catch-up after this was released. In the scope of music history, this album is very underrated.
