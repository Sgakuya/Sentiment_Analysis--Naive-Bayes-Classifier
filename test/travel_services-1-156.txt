I booked my flight for a visit to Anchorage, AK back in July 2005. That was the worst flight I have ever been on!!! On my way there I had a connecting flight in Atl that left about an 1 1/2 late due to "take off and landing traffic". From ATL to Anchorage should have taken 4 hours....well needless to say we had to land in Minneapolis, MN to refuel because we had been redirected and flying in a circle for about a hour. Once we landed to refuel weren't allowed to leave the aircraft, and how could we parked in the middle of the tarmac. We were told the refueling would take about 30 min well were wre there for another 2 hours because they discovered a "mechanical problem". I was due to arrive in AK at 9 pm we arrived at 2:30am. Now on the return we were a minute away from missing our connecting flight in Las Vegas. We made the flight but our luggage didn't! It took 3 days for them to deliver my baggage to my home....In short NEVER AGAIN WILL I FLY DELTA!!!
