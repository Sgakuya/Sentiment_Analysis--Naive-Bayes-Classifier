You're kidding me, right? One of the reviewers here calls Brutal Planet the best hard rock album I personally have ever heard. How many hard rock CDs has that reviewer heard, then - two? And was the other one New Tattoo by Motley Crue? Brutal Planet is like the rest of Alice Cooper's music - loud, inane, over-hyped crap designed to appeal to adolescent boys. Cooper, like Motley Crue, put out this CD because he's running out of money and wants to cash in on the 80s nostalgia. If you want to help pad his retirement fund, go ahead and buy the CD. If you have any sense in your head, avoid it.
