I'm surprise this place (whose name sounds like foul language if you ask me) hasn't one negative comment yet... until now. I don't like the idea of having to walk up to the counter to get your food... I want my food served to me, thank you very much. And the food is very average... and the restaurant is very dingy and dirty... makes Shoney's look like a 5-star place. I hope to never have to go to this place again! And also, it's so lovely when they give you a medium-rare hamburger when you asked to have it EXTRA WELL DONE! I can see how that's confusing ^_^
