Just as the average Iraqi citizen what they think of Saddam and his criminal regime. I can understand why some people are against this war: they thing that there are bigger fish in the sea that pose a more dangerous threat to our national security. But when the anti-war people start denying that this man is a terrorist or a criminal, then they are crossing the line. Perhaps it is a double standard on our part, considering we put him in power, but anyone who doubts this man's affiliation with terrorism is smoking something. Maybe he was not involved in the 9/11 attacks, but the War on Terror is not just about 9/11. It's not just against Osama Bin Laden's cronies. It's against all terrorism, and that includes nations that harbor terrorists. Whether you're against or for this war, at least acknowledge that this man is a terrorist criminal who is the epitomy of cruelty and evil.
