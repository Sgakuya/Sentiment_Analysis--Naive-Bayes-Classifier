I'm from Massachusetts and I am horrified this man is running my state. I told people to vote for Shannon O'Brien, but instead we got a quack who's so anti-everything that's a tad bit liberal. Mitt Romney does not believe in individual freedom. He believes we should own up to whatever his government says. I can't stand this dope for the life of me!
