She's a big time racist and sexist and even admits to it in interviews (don't tell me she was misquoted...it is all over the place...damage control only goes so far when you really meant things in the first place). Buying the CD condones her racism and sexism. Too bad the media won't call her on her racism and sexism, but she gets a free pass because of her skin color and being a woman.
