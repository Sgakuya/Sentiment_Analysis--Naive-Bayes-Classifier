CARL THOMAS IS A GREAT ARTIST TO LISTEN TO. I JUST LOVE CARL THOMAS! ALL I CAN TELL THE LISTENERS TO DO IS BUY THE CD AND JUST SIT BACK AND JUST LISTEN TO THE LYRCIS. IT'S A GREAT CD. MY TOP 3 FAVORITES OFF THE ALBUM ARE: EMOTIONAL, I WISH, AND SUMMER RAIN. JUST GO BUY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF...PEACE!!!
