THIS IS FOR JOHN CONYERS AND ALL THE DEMOCRATS AGAINST NADER. IF AL GORE WAS SO GOOD THEN WHY DID PEOPLE TURN TO RALPH NADER? NADER DIDN'T TAKE ANY VOTES AWAY. FACE THE FACT, HE JUST PLAIN WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.SO LEAVE THE GUY ALONE, IF YOU START WITH BULLY TACTICS OR THE COLD SHOULDER YOU WILL REALLY ALIENATE PEOPLE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. SO SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND GET OVER IT. MY FIRST CHOICE WAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TILL GORE STEPPED IN. SO SHOULD I HAVE VOTED FOR BUSH. I THINK NOT.
