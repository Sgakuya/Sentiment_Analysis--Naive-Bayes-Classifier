Clearly, anyone buying this crap isnt aware that nearly everything Westlife have done are 5th rate bland cover versions. There isn't a single scrap of originality in anything they've done. They are a cruise ship cabaret group that have by some freak of nature have been very successful in the charts. In summary, gutless and putrid drivel for tweenies.
