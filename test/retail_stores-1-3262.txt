As a blockbuster employee, I must say that I agree that employees are undertrained. The corporation has such greed that they try to get you trained so quick, they expect you to be ready and proficient in less than 2 days, with emphasis on register operations. They also push those stupid reward sales, and if you don't meet your quota , you get a nice little happy chat from the SM (store manager). Plus, I know this for a fact, but headquarters will never admit it, nor will any manager or anyone face to face, but I've seen how much they make on late fees, or as the corporate monkies want to call them extended viewing fees , and it is nearly half of all thier rental revenue on any given day... but you didn't hear it from me. A little advice to anyone returning a rental in on the day its due: Turn in the movie before you go to work in the morning, cause come noon time, the checkin computer will be ringing like a vatican priest on crack sounding the bell for mass.
