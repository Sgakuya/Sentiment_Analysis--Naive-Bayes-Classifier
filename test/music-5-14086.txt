Even though Paul isn't my favorite Beatle, he did have a great solo career. This album is one of my favorites. There are so many songs I love on Wingspan. I mean, it's got, Silly Love Songs, which is a great song in itself, My Love, which I plan to play at my wedding, Band on the Run, Another Day, Maybe I'm Amazed, Uncle Albert, it's just a really great cd set. I really enjoy it.
