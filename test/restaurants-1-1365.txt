Beware of the Sonic Drive-In on Rock Rd in Derby, KS. Their computer does not compute the discount correctly when you order a combo meal. It is also common for the staff to supersize your meal without your permission and charge the higher price. Most customers don't realize they paid too much until after leaving. Complaints to local management are useless. Even corporate is unable to fix the problem.
