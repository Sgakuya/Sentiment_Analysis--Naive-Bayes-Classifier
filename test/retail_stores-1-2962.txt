We purchased a diamond ring from these people. We had it three weeks and it broke in two or more places. It broke across the baggetts and the main part of the band. The ring almost fell off my finger. They will not honor they're 90 warrenty. They are also saying I broke the ring by not wearing properly. I thought you put a ring on and wear it. They say I caught it on something that causded the bank to splilt in a zig zag fashion. To break like this I would have had to hurt my finger in the process. My finger is not hurt and kay is horrid. I would tell person to stay away. The ring cannot be repaired accordig to them. So don't wast your money.
