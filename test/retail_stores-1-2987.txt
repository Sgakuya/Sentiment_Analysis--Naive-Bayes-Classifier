I had taken my wedding ring in to see if I could have a band made the manager at the store John (GENNESSE VALLEY MALL FLINT MI) Tryed to talk me into a nother ring for the weekend. HE said I could pick up my ring back up on monday and when I went back to the store my ring was no where to be found . He told me to come back 2 day later which I did and my ring was still no where to be found 1 month later I get a call from the store saying that my ring was found that I could pick it up I get to the store and the ring they give me is a pricess cut loss stone and yellow gold band I told the lady that was not my ring she then kept telling me that was my ring buy this time I was yelling and telling her that my ring is a emerald cut and has bagettes and that it is yellow gold a platnium . I finally left and got a hold of there home office and the lady there finally told me that JOHN had done the wrong paper work and that my ring had been melted down . My ring has been discontinued and the cant find another store with one it has been about 2 years and they still wont help me out with this I paid 4999.00 for my ring and all they are ofering me is a store credit for the value. That are not ever offering me anything for my time and my lose I will never do business with this company again . And new buyers beware This company dose not care about you as a person The John that was the store manager has now moved up higher in the compnay so that tells you that if they do something that big thats wrong they almost get credit I have told this company that bad word of mouth travels faster the good word and if they keep treating customers like this they won't have a company left.
