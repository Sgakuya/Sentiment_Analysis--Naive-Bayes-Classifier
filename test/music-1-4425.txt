To say this is the worst offering by Aerosmith would be an understatement. I'm a fan of old and new Aerosmith (Most of the cds I have from them are the late 80's and 90's era) so I have just cause to say this. This may not sound right a t first, but when you listen to the cd yourself, you'll agree! The cd Is half rave and techno/tron intro's, beats, and voice cracks(Cher - 'Believe'), a quarter country, a few balads, and possibly......streching it.... 2 maybe 3 rock based tracks. Also, I think Joe Perry has now completely ignored the art of a guitar solo. What's the matter Joe? It sounds like you let Steve mumble over your 2 bar solos. Aerosmith have gone soft, and have gone 100% corporate. They target audience today is the trendy...yet stupid music fan, and no longer care about they hardcore fans despite what they may say differently. They have left a 'Hole in my Soul.' Whatever you do, do not subject yourself to the painful torchor of this release by Aerocorporate.
