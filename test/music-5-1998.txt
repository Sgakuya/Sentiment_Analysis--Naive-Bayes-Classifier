An excellent album held together by Maynard's superb vocals and cryptic lyrics. My favorite tracks are 3 Libras (an all-time classic), The Hollow (some great harmony), Rose, Orestes, and Judith. The song Judith may rub devoted Christians the wrong way, but it may go down easier if you know the story behind it: Judith is the name of Maynard's mother, who died of cancer shortly after the album came out. She was a devout Christian and Maynard simply couldn't fathom how God would inflict such a fate on her. He expressed his fury in the form of the song Judith. I'm not saying he's right to blame God for his mother's death, but it definitely puts some of his lyrics in perspective.
