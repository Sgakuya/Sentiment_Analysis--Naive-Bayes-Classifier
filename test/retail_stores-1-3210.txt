Well, I previously wrote a review condemning Blockbuster for a practice that is no longer in place. But now, it seems the no-late fee policy is leaving store shelves empty as people are keeping them for a month. Methinks this is just a ploy to buy out Hollywood Video for the last time. They will probably succeed now, and Hollywood will be screwed. However, it's more than likely Netflix will be the one that survives this World War at the end.
