Same old same old. More flatulence from the most pompous blowhard in the history of rock and roll. Only this time, seeing that his career was beginning to skid, he went for the most transparent and obvious populist approach available: appeal to the jingo nationalism of idiot faux patriots and drooling ideologues in the rock fan base. At least in his early records The Wuss attempted to sing from time to time: on this waste of studio hours, the only time he stopped shouting was to moan in that spoiled brat manner of his. "Cover Me" was predictable, "Downtown Train" was a song that he recorded several times before under different titles with slightly different lyrics, and the title track is something that a-holes who voted for Ronnie Rectum and George Douche might consider Music To Whack Off To. I thought this guy totally sucked long before this record came out: once I listened to this farting with a backbeat, I had to reach for the air sickness bag. It's amazing that he's even made worst records than this, like "Nebraska" and "Lucky Town" (perhaps the crappiest record ever made, in any genre).
