We placed an order for an item over the phone only to find out the next day that the item was not in stock. Why we weren't told this when we placed the order, I do not know. The order was canceled the day after it was ordered. Six days later, our credit card was billed for the canceled order. Two weeks after this, the delivery company called to schedule a delivery, we refused delivery because we had bought the item from a store that had them in stock. So, 9 weeks after the original order date, our credit card has still not been reimbursed!
