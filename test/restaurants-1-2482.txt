Oh, how soggy is this chicken? The chicken here is practically drowning in grease... much worse than at KFC. The soggy chicken has a bland taste to it... no special recipie like KFC, and no overload of spices like Popeyes. There's just no real reason to chose this place over Popeyes or KFC. And the biscuits... they are strange indeed! They have a weird honey-taste to them. It's awful. Perhaps the only upside is some people may like them, seeing as how the biscuits are not as dry as at KFC, or as greasy as Popeyes.
