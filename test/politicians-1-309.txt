Charles I was notoriously stubborn and strong-willed, much like his father. Ascending to the throne following the death of his father, Charles I was intent to continue and carry out his father's policies. The continuation of those policies largely led to a showdown between Charles and Parliament, which would ultimately lead to civil war when Charles attempted to declare his authority absolute over that of Parliament. Overall, Charles' accomplishments as King are near non-existant, and his continuation of his father's foolish policies destroyed political stability in England and divided the kingdom.
