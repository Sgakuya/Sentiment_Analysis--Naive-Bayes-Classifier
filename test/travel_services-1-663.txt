An awful airport. Always chaotic, huge hikes to get everywhere, crazy security lines, and you'll find major airlines that make you check in at one terminal, and then hike two terminals (or take a bus) to get to your gate (see American Airlines). The recent shootings make it an even less attractive place to travel from, to, or through.
