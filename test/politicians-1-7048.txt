This individual was once the country's prolific fighter of the unborn children by calling abortion Black Genocide . When he became a presidential aspirant, he changed and now is solidly pro-death/abortion; despite being a Southern Baptist who are against it. Perhaps with his new found sexuality outside of marriage, a way out was important for him!!!
