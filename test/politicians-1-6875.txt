I watched with disgust today when viewing a report on ABC news that Trent Lott blocked a bill that would have outlawed the sport of cocokfighting in the U.S. When offerred an opportunity to respond, he declined comment as is his consistent and shameful pattern. It is inconceivable that the leading Senator of our Legislature would condone/support the violent and barbaric display of human beings training and forcing animals to fight to the death. That this man would abuse his authority of office to withold an opportunity to debate even the merits of such abhorrent behavior, speaks volumes regarding his consistent and arrogant attitude towards the people he has sworn to serve. Mr. Lott, I have had the pleasure to know a few good men, and you sir, are NOT one of them. You are a disgrace.
