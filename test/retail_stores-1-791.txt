the only thing about Guess clothing is their shoes and their shirts. Their jeans and pants are a poor excuse for designer clothing. The quality is poor and you do not even have to wear them for them to look worn. I bought 500 dollars worth of guess jeans and each pair had flaws in them. One pair had unfinished stitching, another had bleach stains, another pair was too short, and it doesnt end there. Customer service gets an F! If you can afford it guys, I suggest you try the Versace Jeans Couture. They are a little more pricier but they are worth it and they last.Putting your money in guess? is like holding your wallet over toilet and flushing every dollar that falls into it.
