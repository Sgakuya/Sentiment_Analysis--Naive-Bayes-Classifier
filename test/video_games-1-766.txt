This game got old after awhile. I like trivia, don't get me wrong; however, I kept getting the same cards and by the time 2001 arrived, the questions seemed a bit dated. The creators got inventive with Junior Trivia, Baby Boomer Trivia, Trivial Pursuit II, etc. My wife says I am a font of useless trivia, which doesn't bother me, but truthfully, I don't like making people feel bad when they can't win and I invariably end up answering all the questions. That's no fun and it only breeds resentment. People take these things way too seriously! I won't even watch Jeopardy! or Millionaire because of the trivia trauma I put myself and other people through.
