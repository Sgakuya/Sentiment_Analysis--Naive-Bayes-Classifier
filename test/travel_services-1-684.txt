I rented a car from Enterprise couple of weeks ago. While driving on the Expressway I had a flat tire, Ok this could happen to anyone, I go open the trunk the was no spare tire!!!. Ok I guess someone made an honest mistake. I called there so called 24 hour road side assistance for which I had to pay for and never got the promised refund. I had to wait 1:45 min for the towing truck to get to me. and now the worst part they send me a $400 bill stating there was a dent on the door(which was never there at least before it got towed). I hope my experience will stop you from renting from these rip-offs.
