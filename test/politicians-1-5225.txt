I don't know how anyone can vote for AlGore, he's a product of the Clinton administration who's only goal is to become President of the United States no matter what it takes. This even means breaking the law and disregarding our constitution. This man is dangerous and does not deserve to hold a public office, he has no respect for our country or the will of the people just himself. Somewhere on this site I read where a brainwashed democrat who lived in Iowa said Texas had the lowest wages in the Country-must of received that info from a Gore study! I beg to differ, I live in New Mexico, where it is a majortity of democrats and New Mexico has the worst programs for education, teen age pregnancies, welfare recipients, unemployment and the lowest wages in the country. Looks like we need more republicans in office here, but then again if we get more republicans they won't give out as many freebies. Keep in mind why our fore fathers came over from England, if Gore gets elected we will go back 300 years in time with taxation and ruling of a King, which is what AlGore wants. The Democrats have split this country in two and the time is coming where there is the possibility of a civil war. Don't laugh, I'm not a radical and I hope a civil wars never happens in my life, but it has happened in this country once, it could happen again. We've counted the votes twice in Fla., the Democrats have had more than there fair share to cheat, which I am sure they have, yet Bush has still come out the winner, get him into office and get the Anti-Christ out. The only way Algore will get in to office is by taking it to court, getting the constitution and laws changed after the fact to benefit him and winning by once again being a proven liar, cheater and sore loser. ANYONE WHO VOTED FOR ALGORE CAN KISS MY BLACK HAIRY ASS.
