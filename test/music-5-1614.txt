I think the best description for Evanescence's music is rock opera . There is so much going on with the songs on this album, vocally, lyrically, and musically, so many layers, that it is much like an opera. Evanescence does a great job of leveraging their interest in classical music with their love for some decently hard rock. Each song on this album is heavy on the classical strings and piano, with a particularly poignant cello solo on Hello and some very sweet violins on Tourniquet leading into Imaginary . But the classical sound is not buried in the screaming guitars and crashing drums. I think it's a great mix. Add to that the vocal genius that is Amy Lee, whom I think has the best female voice in rock today, and the result is some pretty enchanting stuff. While I love the band and their sound, I just can't say enough about Amy - she's only in her early 20's yet she composed the choral arrangements on this album which are hauntingly beautiful (check out Haunted and Whisper ), and her voice resounds with the experience of someone much older. I think she's going to be a huge star. I read an interview in which Amy listed one of her favorite pieces as Mozart's Requiem , and if you go back and listen to Requiem you will definitely see how it influenced this album.
