As a former sales associate of Dillard's in Topeka, KS, I can relate to Lovelylady's comments. The upper managements shortsighted employee policies make working there a miserable experience. They expect employees to keep their sales up, while defeating the ability to make it with high sales goals, hiring too many people in one area so you find yourself in competition, and at the same time having to do markdowns and new stock to put out. New policy has been put in place recently. If you don't secure a certain number of filled customer credit card applications within 3 months you are fired. Overall, my impression is that the management has little concern for the future of their company because they truly do not care about what matters most to a customer, to be able to come to a store and receive help from employees who are concerned with making the customer happy because they are valued for their hard work and loyalty. Neither hard work, loyalty, dedication matter in that place, only numbers.
