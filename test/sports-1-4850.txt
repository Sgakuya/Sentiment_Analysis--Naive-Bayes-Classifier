we have been patient long enough. i used to have at least some hope at the beginning of each season, before being let down in the end. but this year, i couldn't even get up the heart to go to the games. i am an alumni and a diehard fan since age 12. herb is a very nice man who has reached his peak of coaching. but nc state can do better and should do better. please, fowler, get us a new coach and make us excited about basketball again!
