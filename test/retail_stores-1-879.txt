Please read this in its enclosed form to see the process and what happened. It is all well documented.I urge everyone to NOT shop at Lane Bryant. I have taken my last name off for privacy reasons.But I present to you the actual emails that occurred.Read for yourself how I was treated and the completely inadquate responses I got when I got a response.- Sandra B. in CT.*Beth, Waiting to hear what?To have what I said validated by the person who treated me like this?I have never received an APOLOGY from your company in shape or form. Today,I am not surprised.Your company lacks professionalism towards customers.I am totally frustrated with this kind of response. Please, don't email me again. I have no interest in hearing back from you with this kind of wait to hear back from the person who did this attitude.Sounds like I am not being believed.Do you think I would waste my time doing this if it has not indeed occurred?As I said I won't be returning and I will be following through with my complaint further up within your company and your lack of apology will be included. This is so utterly ridiculous.I now regret not remaining silent and just taking my business and money elsewhere.I have been astonished at the lack of response and the ineffective response I have received from your corporate offices.Perhaps I should not be surprised.-Sandra B.

I will email you then.--Beth Original Message-----From: Sandra [mailto:Sent: Wednesday, June 23, 2004 10:53 AM To: Bfolz@lanebryant.com *Beth, Here is the email I sent to Dorrit last Friday after getting no response from your company.In May, I got a email advertisement from your company and I sent a reply stating my problem.No response came from that email and it was not bounced back to me as undeliverable. It was a few weeks later that I went to your web site on June 11th and attempted to send an email only to have it limited to a 1000 characters. I believe there is nothing you can do that will bring me back to your store again.You have lost me as a customer and I am talking with friends about my experience with your company. See below.--Sandra *********
