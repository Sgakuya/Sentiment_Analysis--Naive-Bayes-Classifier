Here Goes, THE MOST HONEST REVIEW YOU WILL EVER READ ---- 1. OVERPRICED PIZZA, OVERPRICED GAMES & OVERPRICED EVERYTHING, SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE A BUCK, SALAD IS OK, if the people dont put their hands all over it 2. VERY AVERAGE OR GRUMPY EMPLOYEES THAT DONT REALLY WANNA WORK HERE and dont even look like they wanna work here, 2. AVERAGE OR MIDDLE TO LOW AVERAGE ENTERTIENMENT, NOT EVEN ANY COMPARISION TO DISNEY or anything entertaining. Just a little kiddie facad of lights. 3. IF YOU WANNA SAVE A BUNDLE AND STILL HAVE A GREAT TIME, GO TO A MCDONALDS WITH A BIG PLAY AREA OR GO TO A NATHANS WITH A BIG PLAY AREA, you can enjoy the same thing for about $4 DOLLARS THAT you have to pay $30+ dollars at this grumpy old place run by grumpy old staff that really dont wanna work here that are flipping out out of box pizzas for over 30 dollars a pop TO HUSSLE PARENTS into an extremely average place. chuck - IF YOU READING THIS - get your act in order, ramp up your place LIKE DISNEY, then you can charge disney prices, OTHERWISE, you are selling freebee MCdonalds and nathans rids for $30 BUCKS A ripoff to parents. parents - UNTIL CHUCK LIVES UP TO ITS DEAL, better off at mc d'S or nathans, HAVE JUST AS MUCH FUN FOR LESS PRICE AND HAVE IT ALL ANYWAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!! TRUTH OF LIFE!
