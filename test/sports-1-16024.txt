Currently, I don't know if I'd put him as my dime back yet alone a nickel back. He's not the game changing player he was back in the day. Hell, he's not even really a player anymore. Get over it. Even in his hayday I'd say there were better corners out there, like James Hasty. Top that off with the FACT that he's not a good leader and is horribly immature, and you realize what his effect on the team really is.
