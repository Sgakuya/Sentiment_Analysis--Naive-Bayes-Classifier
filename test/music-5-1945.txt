Just when i was beginning to think that all music today is being manufactured by old,fat men in business suits and geared toward an audience of those who live off of their hormones, Our Lady Peace has come along and once again restored my faith. With their latest brillant album, Spiritual Machines, OLP continues to break the music mold. Their music is original, inventive, and most of all, thoughtful, which is a characteristic that is hard to come by nowadays. There is something for everyone on this album, which i feel is one of the best albums i have bought in a long time. This album is more than just catchy songs though. Raine's lyrics are once again heartfelt and thought-provoking, with lines such as I believe in yesterday and what it means to bleed and know that you're ok. This is one album i promise you will never get sick of, but after all, how is it possible to get tired of great music?
