My lovely Man is such a wonderful tribute to their original guitarist, Hillel Slovak, that you almost feel that he never died. Too many great moments to mention (Mellowship Slinky in Bmajor has to be one of the greatest titles not to mention funk songs to come around.) Great holdover until the mighty CALIFORNICATION!!!!!
