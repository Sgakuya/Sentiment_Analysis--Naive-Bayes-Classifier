He is okay. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, I wouldn't go so far as to say he is as good as Herb Sendek at State. That would be a little bold, no? HA - HA! I have to say, I agree with some of the other raters - there is definitely something a bit creepy about this guy. I do not just say that because of his politics and where he coaches. If this were some average Joe bagging my groceries, I would notice his creepiness. I sure as hell wouldn't let him babysit my kids. He is good though. But not as good as Stan Van Gundy, or John Calipari, or Pat Summit for that matter.
