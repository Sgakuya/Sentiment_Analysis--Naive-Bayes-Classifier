This cd is great! you can listen to the cd all the way through and not have to skip songs. Theyre awesome live, and theyre all-around nice guys (ive met them and they were really cool). I would definately reccommend this cd to anyone who enjoys this type of music. i've gotten alot of my friends into stroke 9 already! give it a chance, you wont be disappointed!
