At first, he was a good president. Firsts 4 years he govern in coalition with catalonian president Jordi Pujol, and he was so good but... when he was reelected he had majority of votes, and no needed coalition. The years 5 to 8 where the worse years i can remember. It's true that he made spain was opened to the world, and everybody knew us, but a good president never forget that first thing is the people, and second the image. He only worked to have a good image all over the world, and people who lives in spain was completely forgotten. No politics of work, immigration, security... those are things we were preocupied, and he didn't listen the people who had voted him. For me, he is a loser and a non sense person, but i think too he's so clever and lucky man, he have a good work, everybody wants him (out of spain), and with a bad work as president he win all things i'll never have. Poor idiot!!!
