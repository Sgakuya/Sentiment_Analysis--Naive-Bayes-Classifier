Before the cardboard box houses the legions homeless created by Reagan commonly called Reagan Ranches, there were Hoovervilles. When will people ever learn that these republican fascists are only out for one monied group of WASPs. Today it's the gluttonous Bushes salivating over expanding their oil empire for self gain and at extreme risk to the greatest nation on earth. Hoover should have beent tried for treason.
