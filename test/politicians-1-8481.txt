Ronald Reagan brought the fall of Communism?! Republicans will say anything these days. Anyways, it wasn t Ronald Reagan, it was really political and economical instability within the Soviet Union that brought the destruction of Communism. It was also the Soviet s former president, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Russia s former president, Boris Yeltsin, who both pushed for democracy and private ownership. And it was Bush, and Boris Yeltsin that signed a formal statement declaring an end to the Cold War in 1992, not Reagan. Ronald Reagan, however, did make some contributions. Inflation decreased from 14 percent in 1980 to 4 percent in 1988 and unemployment declined. However, large budget deficits resulted and the national debt climbed from $900 billion dollars to a whopping $4 million dollars. Bill Clinton later cut the federal budget deficit in half. The sad thing is that Reagan s economic plans were better that his foreign policy. Reagan supplied Saddam Hussein with WMD including Anthrax and now we were in this war trying to find these WMD, or at least this is the reason that was given to us. My conclusion is that, although there was temporary economic relief during the Reagan presidency, there was also long lasting negative effects on the economy as well. Reagan brought us into an international mess and to say that Reagan was a great president is an overstatement, I think he s one of the worse along with Richard Nixon and Herbert Hoover.
