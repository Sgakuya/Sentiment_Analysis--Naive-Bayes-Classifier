The Reverend Jackson has outdone even himself this time--calling for civil disobedience in order to delegitimize Governor Bush. Jackson is a foul race-baiting opportunist. The liberal white establishment is too scared to stand up to him, since they can't win an election without his followers. It is up to reasonable members of the black community to stop him. When will that happen?
