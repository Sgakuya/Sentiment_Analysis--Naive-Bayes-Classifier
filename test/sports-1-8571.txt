Kobe sucks. He shoots all the time and misses them all! If it wasn't for Shaq the Lakers wouldn't be nothing. He sucks and will never be like the other greats like Mj,AI, T-Mac or KG. He thinks he is all bad ass becuase he scores all these points. I wish someone told him to shut up and pass the ball to his teamates. Plus he has never won an MVP. All those people who think hw is good, they should shut the hell up. He will never be like MJ. TMAC is way better than he is. Also how come the don't give TMAC,AI,KG that much credit as much as they do to Kobe. Kobe simply sucks!!!!!
