Blessed with talent. He has the potential to be the top shooting guard in the NBA. With that said he has MANY FAULTS. He has shown he is not a team player. He has NO loyalty. All he cares about is himself and his bank account. He has NO class. This guy is probably one of the most hated players. He should have attended college to learn some ethics and educate himself so he doesn't say something dumb every time he opens his trap. I can't till things go sour in Houston.
