I'm unfairly biased, because Jimi Hendrix is my favorite musician. I started playing guitar when I heard him. I just had to make a guitar sound like that. This is an especially good album because not only does it showcase my favorite song, All Along the Watchtower , it also has the tour-de-force Voodoo Child . Wah-Wah is where it's at. Definitely a freakin' great album.
