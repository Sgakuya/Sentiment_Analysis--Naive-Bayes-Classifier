I think that it is great that black americans have someone to stand up for them, the problem is that the only requirement for Jessie Jacksone to stand up for you is that you be black. It doesnt matter if what you have done is wrong or not, just that you be black. I think this increases the divide between black and white americans, and is a disservice to all people. To Jessie, and all democrats it seems like to me, AGENDA is everything, it makes me proud to be a republican. But it is not just Jessie, Hillary and the National Organization for Women can be lumped into the same pot. The reason that republicans are losing some seats in the House and Senate are that we do not allow anyone to make up our minds for us, this is not to say that the extreme right wing doesnt embarass me with their agenda, but I think they are forced to take a page out of the Democrat book, which is by whatever means necessary to win for your cause. I believe that it is time for sensible people to come together, be they Republican or Democrat, and meet half way on all decisions. I also believe that should have the right to choice on the abortion issue, but I also believe that there should be a form filled out and signed by both parties once they have decided to have sex, and if the male states his intentions are not to have a child, and the women gets pregnant, the male should not have to pay any child support. America is the only country in the world where the local government requires more information about your financial situation to get a dog from the pound than they do for you do have a baby. We do a lot of things right in america, but unfortunately, due to the political system those things are limited. I hope that during my lifetime I see americal come together, for my grandchildrens sake.
