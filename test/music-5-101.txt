I can't agree with all the comments below. Soft rock can still be good rock. This album touched the minds and hearts of so many. I remember living in Iceland, 'Man on the Moon' was the number one single, and 'Sidewinder' replaced it at the top spot as soon as it was released. Few bands can lay claim to creating that kind of universal magic. And underneath it all, 'Everybody Hurts' is still a great song. Blame Aaron Spelling's team for ruining it by playing it incessantly whenever teen love went sour on Beverly Hills 90210.
