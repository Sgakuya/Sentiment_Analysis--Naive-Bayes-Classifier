Tunnel of Love with Born to Run are Mr.Springsteen's best recordings to date. Softer than most of his rock-based efforts and less brooding than the acoustic ones, ToL shows yet another dimension of the man's talent. The River, Darkness on the Edge of Town, and Nebraska are all close runners up, but these two CD's come as close to giving you a comprehensive look at Bruce Springsteen as any two CDs can.
