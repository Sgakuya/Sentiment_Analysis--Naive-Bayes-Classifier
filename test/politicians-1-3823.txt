how could i possibly vote for this man. He is anti-labor, anti enviroment, anti-middle class, but obviously pro drugs and alcohol. As far as his knowledge of foreign affairs he only apes what his advisors tell him. If you want the U.S. to be just like texas be my guest. I wonder how such a man could be accepted by an educated nation such as ours. We need to see who we really are not what we want others to see us as.
