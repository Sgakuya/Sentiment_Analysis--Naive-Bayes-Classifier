Well, here I am at 2:00pm waiting for the movers that were to show up at 9:00am. No show and no luck locating them. Have made 5 calls to the Vancouver office with no luck. They really don't care. I read these reviews after I booked them and so I am not at all surprised by this but was hoping I would have a different experience. I have a back-up mover booked but now I need to get my deposit back from these scam artists and book a new flight home which will all be an added expense. But I will only chalk it up to listen to my gut and pay attention to negative reviews when they make up the majority. I highly recommend that you do not give these people your business with all of the choices out there.
