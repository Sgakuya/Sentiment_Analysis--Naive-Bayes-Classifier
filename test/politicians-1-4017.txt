The only reason the Kerry camp chose Edwards as the VP nominee is because Edwards off sets Kerry's disgusting personality. Edwards is an unexperinced pretty boy who cares more about his political career (which is almost non exsistent) than helping America. UPDATE: scarletfeather, I know John Edwards only wants to further his career because no responsible VP candidate (republicans included) would accept a nomination for such a high level position with so little knowledge of goverment, because they could hurt America with their inexperince. But Edwards couldn't care less, he just wants to become well-known. 2ND UPDATE: gmanod, you claim that Bush (who was a governor) was inexperinced and therefore had a awful adminstration. So your answer to solving this alleged awful adminstration is by bringing in ANOTHER inexperinced person to replace it? Gee, it looks like your the ignorant one around here.
