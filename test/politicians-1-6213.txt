What planet are we on that we would consider this woman governor for anything? She thinks she can alienate every hispanic in the state of Florida by sending a child to live under a communust dictatorship and then expect to be elected in that very state? Maybe Jeb isnt all he is cracked up to be...but Reno sure isnt the one to replace him.
