Regarding there credit department*****BEWARE******** I recieved a statment from Home Depot indicating I owed $42.23. I had some returns totaling about $40, so I did not send a payment. (It's tough getting a credit refunded). I returned the items. The next month, the statement showned a $25 late fee. There was a $3.21 balance after credit for the returns. I called the number on the statement and discovered Citicorp Bank handles all credit iusses for Home Depot. After explaining what happened, the customer service representative said if I paid the balance right then, he would wave the late fee. I agreed. After I gave him the check information for the payment, he said I owed $9.95 (for the immediate payment). When I demanded to speak to a supervisor, he waved the $9.95 fee. Plus, if you charge something, why do you need the reciept to return something. Their computers have records of your charges. Or maybe they want you to lose the little plastic card they give you for store credit. Only good, large home improvement store is Dixieline.
