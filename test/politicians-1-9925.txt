I was looking in the cheese section and this guy was in there, so I have to comment. I can't describe in words how much I despise this horrible man. I hate using the "Hitler" comparison because it's becoming so cliche', but it's such a fitting comarison. He is responsible for thousands of deaths, he sides with religious fundamentalists, he's against women's freedom to choose, he supports violating peoples' civil rights with the Patriot Act, he works against the middle and working classes, etc., etc., etc. He has got to be the worst president, ever! He needs to be impeached and Congress needs to vote for his removal. He's not a man...he's a monster!
