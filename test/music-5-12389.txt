T for toni T for truly a great cd! The solid hit he wasn't man enough.. is the best toni braxton song yet. I live the urban beat to it and I love it. The song the heat is a cool summer jam. I also find the track never for a ring to be really beautiful and perfectly arranged. I also like the song maybye and it has a really good beat and arrangement, could be a tad longer I also like the remix that's no totally dance. The song be a man about it has the rap flava and features DR Dre!!! I love dr dre! I love this cd!!!
