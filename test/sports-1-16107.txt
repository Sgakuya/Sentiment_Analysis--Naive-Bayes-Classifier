The guys is so soft it's pathetic. He is constantly getting hurt and then won't play when he's hurt. His "big" rib injury that had him on his knees on the sideline acting like a little pussy turned out to be nothing! Did you see him before the Chicago game all bundled up like a little schoolgirl because it was too cold?!? Puhlease...this guy is the most overated player in the NFL. Matt Schaub is a better QB than he is.
