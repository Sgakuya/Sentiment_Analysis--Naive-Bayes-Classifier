 REM curtails the jingly jangly guitars to further explore and effectively execute their latent 60's pop folk tendencies. The background vocals of Kate Pierson prove to be an excellent contribution. Shiny Happy People is a great regardless of what anybody says. Country feedback is superb. Even the KRS-One raps on Radio Song are great. Radio Song has proven to be quite prophetic as commercial radio has only gotten worse since this release.
