Please. If you want to be famous, go and either a)be a model or b)do some outrageous self-publicity campaign but don't pollute the airwaves, please! It is not just ear damage which is a matter for concern but the perpetuation of the blonde anorexic pre-pubescant idolatry which is doing irreparable harm to young girls and boys all over the world. Leave music alone and don't abuse it and sing the sexist fantasies of middleaged corporate music execs wrting their paedophilic lyrics while counting their greasy money.
