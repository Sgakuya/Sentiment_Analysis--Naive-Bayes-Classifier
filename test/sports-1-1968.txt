lol I love how many international people hate the Yankees as much as the next guy. . . .true the epicenter of the hatred comes from Boston Red Sox fans. . . probably because most people in Boston hate the city of New York because it is like comparing a 100lb supermodel (BOSTON) to a 300lb crackwhore with 4 children they can't take care of. Our Giambi (jeremy) may not be as good of a hitter, but at least he doesn't shoot up and snort coke.
