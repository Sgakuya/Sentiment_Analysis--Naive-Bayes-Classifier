I made a reservation with Thrifty online to rent a car in Las Vegas. On the website it said no credit card required to make this reservation. I got to Las Vegas and went to pick up the car and was told that I needed a credit card. My mother was with me so she said she would put it on her credit card, however since she is elderly and no longer able to drive safely she gave up her licence. Since she has no license they would not let me rent a car on her credit card. Now I am in Vegas on vacation and find out I cannot get a car! Worst yet the bastards at Thrify refused to call me a cab to get to my hotel!!! I recommend never doing buisness with Thrifty!!!
