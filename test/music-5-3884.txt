With Blue Joni Mitchell went from being a very talented folksinger/songwriter to a major musical force. Informed as much by jazz and blues as folk, Blue is a moody, potent masterpiece that has survived the thirty years since it's release almost entirely in tact. As lyrically and vocally inventive as it is musically. Blue gives us the first hint at just how far Joni Mitchell would travel.
