The above rating is for the billing department only. I received a bill in the mail today in the form of an advertisement card, open for anyone to see my information, and I do not like this at all. I have paid more than the minimum payment due each month, the bill today had a Past Due Amount as -523.80. I was really upset, called the toll free number, could not get anyone to answer my call until I chose option 3 which says if this is a store , knowing this would be answered. I did not receive help with your billing problem. How do you expect a customer to know a negative is actually a positive. I receive a statement only every other month. It makes me wonder if this is a way of adding on extra finance charges if a customer fails to make a payment as a result of the billing department's neglect of sending out monthly statements. Also, after finally speaking with one of your associates at the help desk, I got the impression the stores are the only ones who are important enough to have a telephone call answered. My chain of command surely starts with the CEO and it very well could stop there. This person is deemed to be the most important person in a company. I disagree wholeheartedly. It is the customer. Without customers, the CEO would not have his job. I would like to receive a monthly statement if that is at all possible.
