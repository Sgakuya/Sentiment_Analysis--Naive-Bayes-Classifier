Do not rent from FOX rental, and if you do.....BE SURE TO THOROUGHLY INSPECT THE CAR FOR ITEMS LEFT BEHIND BEFORE YOU TURN IT IN!!!! I left my expensive cell phone in the car accidentally one night when I rented a mid-sized (looked more like compact) car from their SAN JOSE AIRPORT FACILITY. I called the next morning to ask if they had re-rented the car. They said they had not. So I told them I left my cell phone in the vehicle and would be by that afternoon to pick it up. They told me they would check and call me back. When they called back, they said they did not find the phone!!!! The FOX employees RIPPED ME OFF....I was so upset I went there in person to complain and their inexperienced staff, including the "on duty" manager who looked more like a parolee, told me they could not do anything about it. I reported the incident to their district mangager who just happened to be on site at the time. She did nothing. I even wrote a letter of complaint to their corporate office in Los Angeles. Nothing was done...these people are incompetent thieves and I vow I will never rent from them again. Pay the extra $10-20 for quality service...you will not regret it. I give FOX two thumbs DOWN!!!! DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!!
