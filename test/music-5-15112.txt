I bought Crystal Meth when it came out and I enjoy every track. I work at a video store and I always re-configure the soundsystems so that computer animated art is showing on the background. Customers love this! THey ask me if they can rent this tape and I tell them that its not the tape but a CD I bought from home. I tell customers what it is and they go out and buy them.
