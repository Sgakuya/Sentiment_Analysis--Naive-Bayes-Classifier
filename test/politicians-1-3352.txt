I am not a Bush fan at all, never have been, never will be- BUT- the review below mine begins with some nonsense about 'heterosexists' as if the majority of people (who are straight) are some sinister cabal and ends with two lines from one of Steppenwolf's best tunes: "The Pusher." In between, the speaker sounds like he or she is mimicing Gollum/ Smeagol from LOTR- "He will lie, cheat, hurt you My Precioussssssssss." In between we get a little of the poster's views on the president, but for the most part this poster wants to bring attention to their homosexuality as if they should get a damned ice cream cake for it.
