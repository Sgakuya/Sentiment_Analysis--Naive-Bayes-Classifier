Jesse, please do me a favor, shut up!!! You are not a politician or a preacher!! In fact, I can't think of a subject that you know least about...fairness in politics!!! We have enough trouble makers in Washington.....so....please don't speak for me....I like to think that I'm not as stupid as you apparently are!!!! Oh yea, I have never voted any other way than Republican...I feel that I would be consorting with the enemy....you know...the Scribes Pharisees Jesus spoke of them in the Bible, you should try reading it and practicing it more often!! Don't talk the talk, if you're not walking the walk!!!
