Once again I must comment on you conservative right wing dunderheads that always say MOVE OUT if you don't like it here. Is that all you know? We love it here. I'm a patriotic American. I use a wheelchair at ball games and I stand up and use my cane when the National Anthem is played. Look around and see how many of YOU don't even stop talking on your cell phones. It's the buffoons running the place that are killing it for ALL of us including you dunderheads but you just refuse to see it. OPEN YOUR EYES and EARS!!! Stop listening to the lies that Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Bill Bennett tell you. That's all crap spewed out by the government that they want to you to hear. I read today that old BUSHY and the boys are now blocking the truth from us about the so-called relief effort effort after Hurricane Katrina that is trying to be wagered by the Senate. WHy is BUSHY trying to block that effort? Is he hiding the TRUTH? Just like he blocked the TRUTH after 9/11 and the TRUTH why he is contnuing to murder the soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq? You right wing conservatives only spew MOVE OUT because you know nothing else because you do not want to know the TRUTH only the lies, corruption, greed and treason that now holds our government. WAKE UP!!!!!
