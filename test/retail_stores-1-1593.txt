I recently had an issue with Sears for the last time. We are evacuees from Hurricane Rita. After the storm and everyone gets back to work, I call Sears to have them look at a dishwasher I bought from them and a refrigerator that I did not. I schedule one appointment to get it all taken care of at the same time (reasonable on my part, I thought). The first tech shows up at 8:00 on the morning of the scheduled appointment and informs me that he cannot work on the refrigerator. The refrigerator repairman has me on the list for the 7th call of the day. I call and ask to speak to a supervisor and would you believe, they told me that I could not speak to a supervisor. The lady even had the balls to tell me that no one at Sears could help. (She was right). My dealings with Sears Roebuck and Co. are over forever.
