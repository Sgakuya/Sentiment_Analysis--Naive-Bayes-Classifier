When i bought this album, i had heard how much it was like his older stuff and how much everyone liked it, so I was expecting something akin to Captain Fantastic or Goodbye Yellow brick road. Unfortunately, I think those days are gone. His music is never going to be like that again, and I hate that. However, this is a great album and has some great musical efforts by both Bernie and Elton. It is certainly a great punch to remind us how he was in his 70s heyday.
