I just want to state the George W. Bush may have had a DUI. He admitted he had a problem in the past and has not had a drink in 10 years good for him I say! Who gives a crap what he did back then he has fixed it. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Also he ADMITTED to it he didn't say that he sniffed it but never swallowed. Sound like something Gore's buddy said doesn't it?
