Another supreme A HOLE bites the dust or at least I hope he does.I was indifferent to the guy and knew he was a skilled player and had nothing against him at all up until the sex scandal.For a so called stand up guy he sure changed his stripes and proved he is a moron even if he's found inocent.Lots of risk for no reward.If the guy wanted to get laid,he should have done it with his wife.Sure,there are groupies out there that lust after black athletes even if they have the I.Q.of a turnip and the personality of an inner city rap star socialist.When you have 200 million bucks on the line you better keep your magic johnson in your pants.Then you make your moron wife come before the camera and play the Tammy Wynette stand by your man routine making her look like crap.It's not bad because she has the choice to look like crap but what about your poor inocent little kid that's 6 months old who had no part in it.Then you have this parade of talking head liberal feminist white groupie lawyers who stick up for these pigs like Clinton and Kobe because they are abortion loving,socialist,liberal, minority,lesbian-gay loving panty wastes.Boy,when a old fart Republican white guy like Bob Packwood asked just to get a feel every socialist feminist democrat wanted off with his head.Ya,and who feels your pain when the crap hits the fan after the democrats or socialist athletes screw you.The young woman who they make out to be a slut and a nut does.Any idiot who would send their kid to Washington to be an intern for a democrat or to a college where they have a B.S.fluff course scam athletic program where the only skills the players have is screwing,the parents should be brought up on child abuse charges.
