jesse jackson is an idiot, he stands for nothing, believes in nothing, and is nothing. he like other black leaders latley are not leaders. they are pawns whos main perpose is to lead ignorant society of people who have no opinion and cant even take care of there own nieghbor-hoods. let alone have a say in how our country is ran. every man has the right to be heard. but not when he claims to speak for his people when his people realy dont care nor do they speak.
