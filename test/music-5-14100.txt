I think that this album is a magnificent piece of work by the Bee Gees. There is great musical flexibility to be experienced throughout the 14 tracks, with each Gibb brother taking turns on tackling the lead vocals. The tracks which standout most are 'Wedding Day' - a possible future single, 'Embrace' - featuring one of Robin's best ever performances, and 'Technicolour Dreams' which sounds rather like a TV theme tune. Since making their 'comeback' in 1987, the Bee Gees have released 6 studio albums. In my opinion, 'This Is Where I Came In' is the best one of those. Buy it today.
