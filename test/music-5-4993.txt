Lee Ann Womack's album I Hope You Dance is amazing. Her voice is angelic and very soothing. She keeps her music in the traditional country music genre. All the songs in her collection are great, however, the ones that stand out most are: The Healing Kind, I Hope You Dance, After I Fall, I Know Why the River Runs, Ashes by Now, and Lord, I Hope This Day is Good. Well done, Lee Ann!
