George W Bush is very very good, very good at overturning the fact. in his mind he doesn't care about his people. he cares about history that he could write under his name. he doesn't care about how many people killed, how much money is spent, he only cares about writing his name on U.S. history. and he always tries to look smart on TV (come onnn, smart people don't have to try to look like one, just need to behave like one)
