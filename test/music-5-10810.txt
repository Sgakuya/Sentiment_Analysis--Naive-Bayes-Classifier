P!NK , what can I say. She has such a unique style and voice, her beats are rediculous, and she even writes her own songs! Can't Take Me Home is one of the best albums of 2000, and catchy as hell. Standouts are : Split Personality, Hell Wit' Ya, Most Girls, and Hiccup. Of course the first single, There You Go, is one of the best. A must have.
