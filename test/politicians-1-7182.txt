It is his antics that inflame the feet of his people and others, and yet he does more harm than good when he gets on TV, ESPECIALLY during the Election2000 ongoings and show such biased and ignorant views completely making little to no sense. However, he was not the only one. But his blind leadership hurts his cause and will cause to anger many of us who are tired of accusations of racism. I would rather be born ANY color under the sun, but without arms and legs or an eye, even they will truly know struggle beyond any that Mr. Jackson can proclaim. He should fight for people, NOT RACES! No one is treated equally in this world, that is a fact. But to use it as a crutch, does not earn respect nor dignity. EVERY good man I've known, Asian, Caucasian, Black, Indian, Egyptian, it is hard work, honesty and a good trusting heart that has made them GREAT not complaint, not fight, not spiteful argument. Rev. Jesse Jackson should not be a reverend because he can speak like an evangelist, nor should he be a leader if his argument is simply one of ignorance towards the true problems in society and America. It is not them against us, or us against them, it is each and every one of us for the betterment of this world and our country. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS. I love all races and all of God's children. And I just wish we could all work together and not be subjectively misled for the betterment of one's own agenda or intentions.
