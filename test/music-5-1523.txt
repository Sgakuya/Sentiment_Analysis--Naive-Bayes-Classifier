This is hands down the greatest album of the last decade. I was not impressed with their last few albums, but they completley redeemed themselves with this one. This is a REAL album instead of a bunch of random songs thrown together. This album has a great build to it including recurring characters and even a twist ending. I bought the album because I enjoyed the title track. I was pleased to learn that the title track was actually, by far, the weakest track on the entire album.
