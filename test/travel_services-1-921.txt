Dealing with United has been a nightmare. Heavy items were packed on top of breakable items resulting in numerous damaged/broken items. When delivered, numerous boxes did not have tracking numbers. As a result, we had several items missing. The movers who delivered our items were reluctant to take back the numerous items that were delivered to us by mistake. Items that were to be assembled were not assembled. Dealing with the claims department has been a nightmare. It took 4 weeks of repeated calling for them to return my calls and to finally talk to someone about my claim. They basically told me that the reason my items were lost was because they had to be put in their storage for awhile since we did not directly move from one house to another. As a result, we should expect missing items and they would not give us any settlement for them.
