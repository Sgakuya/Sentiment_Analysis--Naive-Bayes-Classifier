I agree with crazy...but jealous????? Of what? That she looks and acts like a skank? She sits there and whines about how she is always getting picked on, and hates that people call her skanky, and slutty, and what not, yet she continues to dress and act the part. Theres a difference between being yourself and being obnoxious, you know. She has a voice, but she abuses it! Instead of singing what could be a good song and a good style, she over-vocalizes everything, and deep throats the microphone...no wonder she has a reputation.....
