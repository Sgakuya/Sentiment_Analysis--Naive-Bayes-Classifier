Vince Carter hasn't been trying hardest in Toronto, and fans are paying to support him. Toronto fans has supported Vince Carter while he was injured BUT this guy admitted to not trying hard. I'm disappointed in the attitude displayed by Vince and I have heard rumours of Vince Carter giving out one of Toronto plays during their match against Seattle. Alright lack of effort and giving out plays to opposing team, what can you say? Vince Carter is not a professional player, he's just a corrupted little child playing in the nba.
