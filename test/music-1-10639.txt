I didn't mind matchbox twenty before, but now that their songs are played on every station, every day, every time I turn on the radio, whatever small liking I had for them has been difficult to sustain! It's not that they're the worst group ever, it's just that I will go out of my mind if I hear If you're gone one more time!
