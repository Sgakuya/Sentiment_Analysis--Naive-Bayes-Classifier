If you want a good pizza call a local shop. This stuff is just horrible. If you get a 2 for 1 deal they only put one pizza worth of toppings on both. Sprinkle enough MSG on cardboard and it tastes good. Big deal they give you a 15 cent hot pepper. Way too expensive considering a pizza costs them around $2 to make.
