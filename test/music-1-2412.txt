Why are Christian CD's hype and secular CD's are not? Christian CD's speak of the love of God and people, not the love of SEX. Christians CD's are uplifting, secular CD's usally teach dispair, drugs and infidelity. Christian CD's are not all without fault as well as secular CD's are not all bad. To call them hype though is unfair and without merit.
