This guy is out of control. His comments about the 2000 election, whether you like Bush, Gore, or neither, are on the lunatic fringe. Referring to the process as a court led coup is a bunch of bull. Get a life Jesse. Or maybe, get a job. According to his pompousness, Blacks, Holocaust victims, college students and other Democratic-minded Americans were intentionally excluded from the voting process. Talk like that will get you arrestd on drug charges Jesse, 'cuz you must be on something good.
