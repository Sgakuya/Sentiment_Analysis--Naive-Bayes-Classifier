During my 3 HOUR wait for my simple 12 or 16 prednisone, about 6 prescriptions were picked up.... Half were finished before the people came.... that means they were pumping them out at a rate of 1 per hour. What the hell is the matter with them for not staffing properly on a sunday afternoon??? I will not be returning to eckerd. I am so very thankful I do not own shares in the company- building stores all over the place, yet they cannot run one efficiently...
