Windows just plain old sucks. Sure its getting a little more stable, but its because of windows that people regard crashes as normal! the stuff is designed so that you can leave it running for weeks without a hitch. not a chance with windows. its slower, more vulnerable to viruses (not 1 successful virus has been written for OS X). I just want an os that is simple, but secure, malleable for cross platform cooperation and self modification, but easy to use and intuitive. basically i want a modern DOS type OS with customizable interface. I want to be in control of EVERYTHING about my comp.
