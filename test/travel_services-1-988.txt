DO NOT EVER USE THESE PEOPLE! ESPECIALLY IN OSHAWA. The movers showed up at our place 6 hours late, took waaay too many breaks, charged us time for their breaks, were loud, rude and obnoxious. And get this, they didn't even place ALL of our belongings in our house. They were in such a hurry to leave, they put the rest in our garage. WHAT A RIP OFF... I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE CROOKS TO ANYONE!
