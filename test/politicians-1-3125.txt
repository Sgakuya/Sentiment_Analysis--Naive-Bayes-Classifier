You think Bill helped the economy? Think again. it takes 3 years for a president's policies to come into effect on the economy. When Clinton stepped into office, the economy grew and right before he left, the economy went down. Who was president 3 years before Clinton came in? GHW Bush! Who was president 3 years before GW Bush came into office? Bubba! The only reason why the economy was good int he 90's is because the Republican controlled congress FORCED Clinton to balance the budget, something Clinton didn't want to do. So why do we give him credit for balancing the budget?
