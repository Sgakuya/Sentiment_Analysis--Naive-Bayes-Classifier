Won a lot of games, and a couple of championships by avoiding Notre Dame, and actively trying to bury ND as a program. Poor losers stopped scheduling Notre Dame after first win, didn't schedule another game for 40 years. Two years later, Notre Dame won again. Michigan again refused to schedule Notre Dame for 40 years. Pansies.
