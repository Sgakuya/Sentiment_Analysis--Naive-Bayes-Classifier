With Eric Clapton at the height of his incredible powers (and still but twenty two years old!) joined by the incomperable Jack Bruce on bass and booming vocals along with drum master Ginger Baker, this album is a blues rockers wet dream! Slipping in and put of several idioms (jazz, blues, psychedelia...) while being tied together by Clapton's astonishing guitar playing, Disraeli Gears rates at the top of the releases of Cream's all too short career. Sunshine of Your Love stands high as the the most powerful track and continues to represent itself as the hallmark of what a great rock song sounds like. It would be a smash hit if it had been released last week. Eric's impersonation of the great Albert King on Strange Brew (the opening track) gets the ball rolling and the treats just keep on coming. Don't miss this album. One of the best, from the best year in the history of Rock and Roll.
