This is one of the sorriest individuals ever to surface from the civil rights era whose sole purpose is to take advantage of black Americans. His one objective is to make everything a racial issue in order to divide black and white citizens. He is terrible for this country because if there was racial harmony, there would be no reason for him to exist and no donated money to line his pockets. His latest sin of adultry and ruining the lives of others is not at all a surprise. Will the reverend still be revered and respected by black Americans??
