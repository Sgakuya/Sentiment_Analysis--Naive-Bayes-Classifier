I shouldn't rate him since I don't know anything about him like 99% of the rest of America. But it is a sad state of affairs when a good public speaker is considered a leader just for his ability to give a speech. Let's all be honest about it. The Democrats have low expectations for any minority and when they excel they want to take credit for his/her success. In other words, you can't be a minority and successful without an entitlement the Democrats gave you. I'm not sure, but I think I recall those millionaires from Massachusetts almost breaking their arms to pat themselves on their own back.
