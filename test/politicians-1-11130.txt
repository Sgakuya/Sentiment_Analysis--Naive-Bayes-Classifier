He's got a future alright, as a typical politician. After only months in office hes already lied to the people of Colorado. During the campaign he repeatedly stated his opposition to the filibustering of judicial nominations. Now elected, hes sided with the dems and turned his back on his promise. Again, it proves you vote for the PARTY when you vote for the PERSON.
