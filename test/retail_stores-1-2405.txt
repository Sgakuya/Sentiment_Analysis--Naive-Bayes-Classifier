I lived, and shopped at the store in Dearborn Heights michigan. I bought a DVD player there thinking since its $40, its a good buy. After moving and finding that I'd rather needed the money more than the DVD player, I called to find out about returning it. The manager stated; Icannot return a $40 item without a recipt. I explained to her that I had just moved, and that would be difficult to find; The manager reitterated her statement, I promply hung up. Be Ware! they low ball stores have no customer savy, if they were smart they would return it just for the public relations part.Now they have lost me as a customer for life, and will tell all my friends and family about this to prevent them from shopping in a place like this.
