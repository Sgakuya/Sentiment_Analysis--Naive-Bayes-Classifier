Created our wonderful welfare state. Pay people to produce nothing except babies. Talked peace during his campaign and then got us deep into the most pathetically run war in our history. 58,000 men dead for what? Civil rights? Thank a republican congress!! On behalf of all the dead in Vietnam...Rot in hell!
