A Hard Day's Night is the best of the Beatles early(pre-Rubber Soul)albums and ranks right up there with their later classics. Every song is superb and it contains a good mixture of great rockers such as the title song, Can't Buy me Love ,and Tell Me Why ,and beautiful ballads such as If I Fell and And I Love Her. The later is arguably McCartney's best love song. The amazing thing about this album is that it was written on the run under a tight movie deadline and while Beatlemania raged around them. The Beatles didn't have the luxury of having time for lengthy studio experimentation as they did for their later works, but they still did an excellent job. This was the album where their musical genius really became apparent and set the stage for what was to come.
