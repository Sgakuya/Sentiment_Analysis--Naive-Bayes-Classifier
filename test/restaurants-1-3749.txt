Update: In response to Helmut's post, maybe the dude was making doughnuts! [Original Post] Worsto Pizza. Toaster pizza is better. Even their plain pizza is barely edible. When they toss all the dreck toppings like onions, green peppers, black olives, run for the hills (or men's room). If it weren't for kid's soccer team parties, CiCi's would have shut down years ago.
