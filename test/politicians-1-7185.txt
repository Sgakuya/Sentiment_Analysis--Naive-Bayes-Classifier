Jesse Jackson has sold himself out to the Democratic party.. What have they done for him? I have never seen him appointed to any prominent position... He make almost no sense when he talks. He uses a lot of rhetoric but when you anylize it, it holds no water.. Here is a good link: http://www.higherd.org/Pearson/black_republican.htm Truthteller1 asked how many native americans i have seen today.. What difference does it make? Well being a native american I guess at least 1 and actually a whole lot more.. Actually I am not a native american, I am an AMERICAN... My ancestors way of life went just like thousands of civilizations in history.. I am of the Cherokee tribe and we were one of the first to see the change and accept it.. Life is about change.. This has been the job of idiots like jesse jackson and his crowd. Divide the country. Pit rich againts poor. Black against white, and on and on..
