Lord and Taylor has very bland over priced clothing. Futhermore there service leaves much to be desired. You can be in an empty department for a long time before being helped. Lord and Taylor is in the process of shutting down 38% of it's stores. I wonder why. They don't cater to their guests and they don't stock clothes for people that could pay the prices they charge.
