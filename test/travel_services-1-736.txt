They don't even deserve ONE star. I took a early flight from SJ to Las Vegas (6:30am!) and went to the Alamo car rental area and needed to wait 1 hour and 10 minutes before I finished the paperwork. They stated that they had changed to a new computer system. I would think that they would provide training and maybe roll it out during the week when it is slower rather than a Sunday morning? When I dropped off the car, the gas needle was just off from the F indicator and the guy states go into the office, because they want to speak to you about charges. They charged me for 2 gallons at $4+ per gallon! The gas price in LV was $2 at the time. I'll never go to Alamo again even if someone paid for the car.
