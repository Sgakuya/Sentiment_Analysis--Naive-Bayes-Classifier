I refuse to shop at J.Crew because of their policy on fur. They have already openly promised to stop selling fur and fur trim products, both to the public and to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They still sell the stuff and I find it a let down. After all the publicity of the way in which fur is produced and the treatment animals have to endure for J.Crew to have it's fur, I'm amazed it can carry on selling it. They have a poor customer service policy, refusing to acknowledge the comments that I and many others have submitted.
