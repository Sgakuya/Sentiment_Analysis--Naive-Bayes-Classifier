I just want to say that good charlotte isn't a fake punk group. These guys are just awesome and they have something to say in their song, not like some artists that everyone love and just sing about stupid things. Just buy the cd and try to understand the message in gc's songs. Thank and enjoy. GC ROCKS!!!!!
