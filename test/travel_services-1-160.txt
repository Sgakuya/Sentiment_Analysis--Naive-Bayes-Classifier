1/28/05: Sltlyamusd, you are so right to say these things because I am one example of such melancholy travelers last year. (IT IS '04, not '05!) Here is my story: After being screwed in the midwest, I may never want to fly on this airline carrier. I booked my itenerary in advance, and I had priority. My first departure was OK, but my return was not! I could not take my return flight from the airport I arrived and I was moved to two airports; but nothing was done on one of them during Christmas. I accidentally hung up the phone after mistakenly booking a flight I didn't want (It was later an insurance flight and I had to take it.) I tried telling what happened to another receptionist on the phone but (s)he was totally unaware. I was issued another flight, but I was on hold for three or four hours to see if they confirmed my flight change. I went anyway to the other airport. On the 24-26, I was stuck in one airport and I had to change my itinerary five times! They never supply me with free transport. What was worse was that they took my luggage on another flight that was filled, and I didn't board it. I had to go to another airport the next day and miss Christmas with my family and also miss a business meeting. The receptionists on the phone and at the desk were inept for this situation. I can let them off the hook because of holiday travel and the weather, but it is no excuse for them to say that they ran out of deicing fluid and to not have a backup system when their computer system crashed. I am now waiting for them to respond to my mail I sent them about their service that time, and after a month, they finally responded and gave me a voucher. People should you go to Cincinnati, Atlanta, Salt Lake City or Boston, try another carrier or take the bus or Amtrak if it is the only carrier there because they are totally dishonest, silly and incompetent when such calamities like this occur. What I think that would make it a better airline is if they can establish a new hub west to the Mississippi or make Dallas and/or Salt Lake bigger hubs for it so westerners don't have to go east for their connecting flights. Hope that Comair and Delta et al clean up & reorganize their acts soon because they will be missing a lot more travelers soon... >>>update: I will go on it again because I have the voucher, but this is their last chance. Hope they don't screw up on an international flight.
