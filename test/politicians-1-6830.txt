Where to start? This man is a racist hypocrit. Anyone who claims that the US would be better if Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrat Party had one an election can not possibly claim to be anything else. His attempt to redeem himself by appearing on BET only made matters worse...he claimed he was not a racist and offered the fact that he has one African-American staff member as proof. Give me a break.
