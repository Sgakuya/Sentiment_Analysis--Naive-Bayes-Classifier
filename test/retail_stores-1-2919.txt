Diamond quality is terrible (should not even be using these for jewelry, really obvious black inclusions, even to my untrained eye in poor lighting). When I tried to return earrings with receipt within 30 day return period, the salesperson wouldn't let me because I didn't have the credit card they were bought with (they were a gift, credit card owner is now far away). Also, the saleswoman was strangely rude when I said I wanted to return them and seemed gleeful when I didn't have the credit card. Look around before buying. Prices, quality, service all awful.
