I obviously cannot beleive he is this high on the chart! His intellect isn't very good and he is too focused on war. Sure, I believe we should do something, but when our economy is in trouble as well, that is when he starts losing approval ratings. I feel that he just wants to get back at Sadam because of his father. He needs to stop avoiding the our economy. Other presidents have been known to multitask, why can't he?
