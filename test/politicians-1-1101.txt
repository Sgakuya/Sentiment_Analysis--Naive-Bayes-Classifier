First off, I can't believe anyone could be so idiotic to vote for this guy. He is just as creepy and incompetent now as he was in 2004. Canadians have forgotten that the current Conservative Party isn't the same Conservative Party of a few years ago, and certainly not of the Mulroney years. They amalgamated with the Canadian Alliance, a radical right wing group that only serves the small-minded hillbilles of Western Canada. Thank god the election is a minority government' You can thank the good and sane people of Toronto and Southern Ontario for that.
