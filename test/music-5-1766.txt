Radiohead cd's get better by the minute. It took a couple of times to get used to Kid A. After that I fell in love, just like I did with O.K. Computer. Kid A is all I listen to now. Radiohead in my opinion is the best band ever. Their songs have alot of meaning. They mean different things for different people. I can always relate to them. And the music is anything but tense! It is the most relaxing cd. The whold thing is good. Some idiot reccomended to stay away from it, they must be crazy! I reccomend getting O.K. Computer if you dont have it, and definitley Kid A to go along with it. This cd should not be qualified as rock music it is hardly that.
