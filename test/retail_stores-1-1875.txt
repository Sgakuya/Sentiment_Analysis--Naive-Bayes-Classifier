I tryed to return a Christmas gift and didn't make the 30 day cutoff policy. I guess I bought my gift too early before Christmas. I found the Dillard's store manager rude and basically told me to take a hike. That's fine, because I will never enter their store again. Dillard's just lost a customer for life because my future dollars can shop elsewhere, that is my return policy.
