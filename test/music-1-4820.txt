The first time i saw Aaron carter was on disney, and it was the music video for "How i beat Shaq", I nearly hurled right then. What kind of sick person wrote this song, and thought it was something someone in there right mind would like. Holy crap, just hearing him sing this song makes you want to find him, and beat the living daylights out of him
