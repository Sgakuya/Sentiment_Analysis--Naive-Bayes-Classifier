Definitely the Moron of the Year Award goes to this ill-bred selected president. If he was my child, I would leave the country. And with daughters like his, what family values does he teach them? I guess they are just like their daddy G. Dubya, a pot-smoking, cocaine-snorting, alcoholic who lied his way into office. I guess when your dad was president before you, you can get away with anything. I wonder how G. Dubya likes the taste of his Arsenic water.
