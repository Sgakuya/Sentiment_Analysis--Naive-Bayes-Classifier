The action and graphics are great, but when you have 20 mintues of chatter between each fight it gets a little old- obvioulsy they did not have enogh mateial for a longer game so they bulked up on the talking - people say that the story is great, the story is crap, but then again anything that confuses 13 year old pimply kids is cool by me
