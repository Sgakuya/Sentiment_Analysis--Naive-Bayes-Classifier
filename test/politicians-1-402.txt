Thank you Bird808 - I was beginning to think the world had gone mad - Tony Blair the favourite politician?? PAH! I can only assume that none of you actually live in England, he is supposed to be our Prime Minister for gods sake, not a puppet to an uneducated pratt who tells him when to jump - How high Mr. Bush...is this ok? Millions of Brits were against Blair ever having anything to do with Iraq, we have our own issues, our own problems to contend with and Blair has quite blatantly lied about all his policies and quite frankly its way too late - come next election he's dust!
