These guys know how to write a perfect melodic, catchy rock song. Nothing too difficult or hard to listen to, just good ol' fashioned alt-rock. Amidst all the bands out there today that are attempting this 'sound' and genre, these guys take the cake. I would consider them in the elite group with Pearl Jam, STP, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. Great album.
