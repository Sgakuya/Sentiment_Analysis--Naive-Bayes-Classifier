What a slam! Britney is no more than a product endorsement of herself. She is one big money-making advertising tool for corporations. Her concerts started out with her Herbal Essence commercial on the stage screen. From there, it just got worse. Funny thing was her voice (live) was hidden under layers of pre-recorded voice.
