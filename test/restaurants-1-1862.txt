I used to be a huge fan of Taco Smell..cheap, tasty soft chicken tacos with sour cream or some nachos grande to go. That is until..until I saw IT...the oversized bag o' slop. Yes, the loose meat (specification unindentified) was packed in this very large plastic bag, which I saw pulled off of a shelf (not out of a refrigerator) the employee (sans gloves) tore it open with his teeth (I am NOT LYING) and then poured it out into its proper container. I am gagging now, and I was exposed to this horror over six years ago. I do not know why it has affected me so. I KNOW it isn't pure beef or 100% chicken or whatever..but I was happy not having to see it. I was content eating my chicken taco in my naive world ..No more, no chalupas for me
