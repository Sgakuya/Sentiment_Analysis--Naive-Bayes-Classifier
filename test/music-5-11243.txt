This CD is amazing. You can't judge a musician by the way they dress, it's irrelevent. The bottom line is: This girl can sing. These songs are coming from her heart, and almost all of them are awesome. The best song is Walk Away Its amazing, it gives me chills every time I listen to it. Fighter , Can't Hold Us Down , and Dirrty are also great. Buy this CD, it's worth your money!
