Sorriest, lamest excuse for a president this great nation has ever produced. I am mystified that so many Americans can have the wool pulled over their eyes and vote for this drunken fool. It is time's like these that make me wish I wasn't an Atheist, so I could say GOD BLESS AMERICA, because we sure as hell are going to need it, now more than ever.
