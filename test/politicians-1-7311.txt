I too cannot believe that Mr. Jackson calls himself a minister of God. I can only imagine what God is thinking of him. I pray that he will someday soon wake up to the damage he is causing to God's people (I am not calling the Black population his people, because they are God's people) and continually bringing up past oppressions...let us move forward not backward. Please search the Bible for God's word on how we, as Christians, are to live our lives in front of others. We are all equal in God's eyes...stop dividing us, Mr. Jackson.
