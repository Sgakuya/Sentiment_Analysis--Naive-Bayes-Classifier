Here is a true renaissance man if being a stupid pothead Senator s son weaving fantastic lies about your accomplishments was the sole criteria for being a renaissance man. He flunked out of Vanderbilt University s Law and Divinity schools and was forced by his father to enlist and serve a safe non-combat role in Vietnam to give his craven racist traitorous father a fig leaf of patriotism for the folks in Tennessee. He was elected to Senate the same year as Dan Quayle and was thought to be posturing dunce while Dan Quayle was thought to be intelligent, industrious and insightful by all.
