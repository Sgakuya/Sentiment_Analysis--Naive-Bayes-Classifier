DO NOT hire 2SM. Move from Calgary to Vancouver was a nightmare. Packers did not look at all trustworthy or bondable. Broke cabinet door to island in kitchen. Used clothing as packing material. Truck did not show up until evening of day of move and movers moved through the night so that we had to stay at hotel. We had to leave to be in Vancouver before movers left and they left rug and articles on two shelving units in garage. They double billed our credit card for the move as well as charged for the packing without authorization. Sent claim for lost and/or damaged articles...no reply. Worst experience ever...do not use them.
