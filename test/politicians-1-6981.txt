In the late 1970s, I was impressed by him. He was pro-life, spoke intelligently, urged our youth to avoid drugs...but within a few years he morphed into a first-class trouble maker. I am a minister of the Gospel and I'm stunned that another man who calls himself a minister of the Gospel would work so tirelessly to deliberately stir up hatred and division, and try to keep himself in the spotlight all the time. Did you notice that Bill Clinton chose him to be a spiritual counselor to him after he got caught in the Lewinsky affair - only to have it come out later that Jackson was engaged in his own illicit relationship with a woman at the very same time? WHEW!!!!!
