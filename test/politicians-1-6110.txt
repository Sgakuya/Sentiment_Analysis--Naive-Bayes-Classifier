This man is a threat to democracy,he will undermine our fundamental human rights.His supporters seek a world were they will be given control through these tyrants,given leave to oppress. the banning of abortions is similiar to the catholic churches policy on birth control,keep the underclass breeding for a labor surplus and an end to minimum wage laws.Face it you damnable republicans you just want to tell every one else what to do and have leave for unchecked power.I will never sucumb to your absurdity
