I had the crappiest experience on National. I rented a car for one-day, and got unlimited mileage since I was going from San Fran to Reno. It sounded like it would be real cheap ($30 or so), so I decided to pay extra for insurance ($19). I wound up returning the car 25 hours later, getting charged for a full extra day of the insurance, $15 for the extra hour, and they also charged me $38 or so for mileage past a certain point. When I contested that I'd reserved the car asking for unlimited mileage, they pointed to fine print in the contract I signed saying I signed something different. Their customer service people were totally unhelpful, then I wrote an angry letter and eight months later, I haven't heard anything back as of yet. I'm official on boycott from National until they do something to make nice with me!
