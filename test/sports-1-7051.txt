He's not the most overrated basketball player ever; he's not the most overrated athlete ever; he's the most overrated human being that ever walked the planet. Anyone who thinks Jordan is the greatest ever has been brainwashed by Nike and ESPN, and there's no point in debating with someone who has been brainwashed. He wasn't even the best player on his team; Pippen was. I know I said I wouldn't debate with brainwashed people, but I just can't resist. This is in response to a PM: Nobody could beat him ever? Only if you pretend basketball started in '91 and ended in '98, and Pippen was really just an average player. If you want research, check out my Pippen post for a start. Also, Jordan is overrated as a defender: Pippen would always guard the other teams best perimeter player (Who shut down Magic in '91? Oh, that's right.), Grant/Rodman guarded the best post player, and Longley/Cartright guarded the centre; so who did that leave for Jordan? No wonder he had so much energy for all those dunks: He didn't have to guard anybody. And how do make all-defensive teams guarding the 4th or 5th best player on the other team? Unless, of course, it elevates your marketability as a player. David Stern knew what he was doing. If you want to know who the real greatest player ever was, check out my Chamberlain post. Who else was better? Magic (better all-around player and team player), Bird (ditto), Russell (rings, better team leader), Dr. J (did everything Jordan did, plus a better shot-blocker, rebounder and dunker), Oscar (triple-double. 'Nuff said), West (Better defender, passer and shooter), Kareem (more dominant, better numbers, just as many rings and one more MVP), Baylor (not as good defensively, but a way better rebounder), Hakeem (didn't have the talent around him that Jordan had in Chicago), and Havlicek (you probably don't even know who he is, since basketball didn't start until '91 and all). Plus all those players (with the exceptions of Hakeem and Pippen) won their titles against tougher competition: the league was watered-down in the 90s. So that puts Jordan at about 13th all-time (and as soon as Garnett wins a championship, he goes ahead of Jordan as well). And if you still have doubts, you might want to do a google on 'confirmation bias'. If Jordan is your favourite player, fine, give him 5 stars. But he's not even close to being the best. As for his influence on the game, just look at the league today, especially guards: selfish players who jack up bad shots and think they're the best players ever. Remind you of anyone? Nice influence. Okay, I think I wrote enough about this phoney. If this doesn't satisfy all you blind Jordon-lovers, I don't know what will.
