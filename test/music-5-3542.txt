This album is GENIUS!!! While the majority of the songs on the album are, to me, mediocre at best, the album itself is probably the most brilliant I've ever listened to. It is a narrative album, telling the story of a bordering-washed-up rock star with some mental problems. He builds a psychological barricade and keeps out everyone, including his mother and wife, to the point where they don't know him any longer. Another Brick in the Wall (parts 1-30) is a great song, and part 2 is the most famous Pink Floyd song of all. And the climax, The Trial, is a brilliant, trippy piece of music that sounds disturbingly Disney-like. This album, like Dark Side, needs to be listened to all the way through with a stereo (or headphones if you don't have one), but it is twice as good as Dark Side.
