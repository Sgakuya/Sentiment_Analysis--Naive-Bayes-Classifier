My favorite Sublime album and probably one of the 5 albums I've listened to the most in my life. This record should be listened from beginning to end - some of the deeper cuts are my favorites... stuff like Live at E's and Ebin. As iTunes starts to take over my listening habits, there's just not that many fully albums that I listen too anymore... makes 40 oz to freedom that much better.
