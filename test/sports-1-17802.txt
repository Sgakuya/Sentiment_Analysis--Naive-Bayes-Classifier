Being a lifelong Eagles fan, I have always hated the Redskins. But I had to admit that they had one of the classiest organizations in the league with Cooke and Gibbs. Now they are the joke of the league. Rather than build the team from the foundation up, Snyder prefers to come up with quick fix gimmicks every year. As long as he is the owner, they will suck. Long may he reign!
