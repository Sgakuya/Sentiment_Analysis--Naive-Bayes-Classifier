Unlike most groups, who lose their identity after the release of their debut albums, The Beatles continued to grow and challenge their genius with each new release. It seems nearly impossilble to believe that this band could expand our universe so completely and so many times over the space of only seventy or so months. But then, there has never been a group like the Beatles. I feel sorry for people who refuse to give these brilliant artists a chance to enrich the fabric of their lives. I can't even imagine living in a world untouched by the music and magic of these four. Just grab a copy of this opus and take John Lennon's advice..."Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream...."
