Way too expensive! I don't understand how people afford this stuff. And I don't understand why anything should be priced this much, especially when most of the products cost about $2 to make. It's a huge ripoff. People are just paying for a brand name and pathetically, it's just contributing to the deconstruction of America and making people more and more obsessed with their consumer driven lives.
