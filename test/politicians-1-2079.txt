I knew California was in trouble when Davis was first elected and the media described him as a moderate. That's a code word that means the Press is sneaking a heavy-handed liberal Trojan Horse onto the front pages. I'm thankful there are enough people in California with minds of their own, who are willing to use peaceful, legal, due process to see if this tricky governor can be recalled.
