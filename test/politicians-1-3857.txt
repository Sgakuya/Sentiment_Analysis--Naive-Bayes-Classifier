Vote swapping. If you are a progressive voter worried about the Gore/Nader dilemma sending Bush to the White House, here's a creative solution to your dilemma. It's called vote swapping and it's legal. The idea is that a Gore voter in a Bush safe state, such as Texas, gets together with a Nader voter in a swing state, such as Wisconsin. The Gore voter agrees to vote for Nader (it won't hurt Gore a bit) and the Nader voter agrees to vote for Gore (it won't hurt Nader a bit). The end result is that progressives work together to defeat Bush.
