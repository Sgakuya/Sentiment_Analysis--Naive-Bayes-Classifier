I bought a 14k brazilian garnet earring and necklace set for my mom's birthday at the Lenox Atlanta location. Service there was great, the girl was very helpful. But my mom didn't like the jewelry and she wanted a designer handbag instead. So i brought the set to the Town Center location which was closer to me anwyay for a return and I was appalled at the lack of service. I was not acknowledged at all for several minutes until I finally decided to speak to two girls who were just chit-chatting behind the counter. One guy was helping a couple with engagement rings and the manager totally ignored me and hovered over the salesperson helping the couple. The girl who decided to help me was obviously new but none of the other associates would help her do the return. She asked the manager for help and he brushed her off and continued to hover over the other couple. I finally spoke up and asked if he could just verify the return and he gave me a very displeased and nasty look and grudgingly did the return. I was told I would get a refund by check in two weeks. That return was performed 12/17/05 and it is now 1/6/06. I will never buy from Whitehall or any other mall jeweler ever again.
