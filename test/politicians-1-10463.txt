Duyba is the luckiest man on earth. He has gotten a pass his entire life. Duyba was born on third base and is sure that he hit a triple. He wasn't smart enough for Yale, but slid in on his daddys coat-tail. He drank and partied his way through college. He and his dork brother have been coke heads for years. This scum of a man has been given many opportunities to make money on questionable deals that only a priviledged scum like he would have access to. He wasn't elected president, he was selected Resident. I can't even imagine how the republicans would be complaining had a Democrat won the election using the same tricks that Jed (yes I know) used in Florida. Then Duyba takes office and is clearly floundering. The economy is on the rocks and he's making assinine remarks about nothing. Then he strikes gold. September 11th happens and all of a sudden he's Marshall Dillion, Dwight Eisenhower,General Patton, Ronald Regan and Franklin Roosevelt all rolled into one. If it had not been for the tragedy of 9/11 he'd be impeached by now. Duyba (I can't even say his real name) is a lucky SOB. He has gotten a free-pass his entire life. He's stupid, he's inept and he's a crook. He should be tarred and feathered and run out of office in disgrace. Anyone, ANYONE that agrees with his policies and strategies is a fool. He is driving our economy into the sewer, all for the sake of lining the pockets of his super-rich pals. Anyone, ANYONE who thinks that attacking Iraq will do anything positive for this country is either an idiot, stupid or in line to benefit financially from the deaths of young Americans. Attacking Iraq and killing thousands of innocent people is not going to do antyhing but increase the terrorist attacks on America. But then again, that will give Ole Duyba more fodder for his stupid, assinine decisions. PEOPLE OF AMERICA... WAKE UP BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE DUYBA IS ANTI-FREEDOM, ANTI-PEACE AND MUST BE STOPPED BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
