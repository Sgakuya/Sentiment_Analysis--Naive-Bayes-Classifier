I have found their customer service to be the worst I have ever dealt with. They tell you one thing over the phone and then when you go to book the tickets online, it's different. Their attitude is, we always right and your not. They probably are only concerned with taking care of the high level flyers, but that's OK with me as there are plenty of choices from Atlanta. This is probably one of the reasons they are going bankrupt as many people I have talked too have started flying other carriers where the staff is more pleasant.
