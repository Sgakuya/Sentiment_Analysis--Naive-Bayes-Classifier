One of those Cds you can listen to forever and not get tired of it. "Fallen" has great flow and I don't skip any songs. Its a Cd you'll buy because of the chart - topper and keep for all the others. "My Immortal" is really sad and made me cry when I heard it. "Imaginary" is one of the best songs I've heard and Amy has a voice that will haunt you
