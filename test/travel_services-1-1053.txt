The movers arrived an hour late. They spent more time arranging the truck and sitting in the back of the truck talking than they did packing or moving anything. It took them 15 hours to move our things we could have done it on our own in less time than that! They sent only 2 guys to move a 4 bedroom house. Many items were damaged or destroyed completely. Claim was filed on 7/6/02 we waited a full 30 days before following up when no contact was initiated by Starving Students to process this claim. At that point, the claim processor was rude, and told me (not asked me) to take pictures of the damage when the claims literature CLEARLY states to not proceed with any repairs, and to maintain damaged property until contacted by Starving Students, as the appraiser would be appointed by Starving Students, and proceeding on our own would void the claim. 90 days have now passed since filing claim, and SS HAS STILL NOT CONTACTED ME!
