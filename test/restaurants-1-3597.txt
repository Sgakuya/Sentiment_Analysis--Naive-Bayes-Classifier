Little Caesar's sucks. That's why there has not been one in my town for several years. And guess what, Moosekarloff! I am a mongoloid from the Heartland! I have no problem with someone leaving a negative comment about a pizza chain, but I take MIGHTY offense to someone who can sum up an entire region as a drooling backwater. Moosekarloff has probably never even been to the Midwest but wow, he sure is an expert. I'm blessed to live in a city with several locally owned restaurants that focus on locally grown, organic cuisine. Not to mention some awesome Thai and Indian places. I also live in a city where I can see a world famous reggae show on Friday, a Broadway production on Saturday and a travelling Warhol exhibit on Sunday. And yet according to Moosekarloff, I'm lucky if I have the mental capacity to tie my shoe and drive to the local Applebee's! Sorry I've strayed so far off the Little Caesar's subject, but I can't stand stereotype promoting ignorance like this. Maybe Moosekarloff should do a little more travelling before he sticks his foot in his mouth.
