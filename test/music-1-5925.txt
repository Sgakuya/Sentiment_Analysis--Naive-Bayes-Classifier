Horrible s**t! If you're still listening to Bon Jovi, there's no hope. Give it up, tie some bricks to your feet and take a long walk off a short pier. You have no future. Not only was JBJ a bad singer, he's now a mediocre actor. I wish I could say he's terrible at acting, but I've seen too many worse ones.
