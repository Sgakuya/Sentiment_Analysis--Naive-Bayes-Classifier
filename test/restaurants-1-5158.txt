If I was blindfolded and taken to an Applebees, Ruby Tuesday, Chilis or Outback, I'd never be able to tell them apart. same crap, different name. What would set Applebee's apart is their horrible service. If I was still sitting in my booth with my blindfold on for 15 minutes with no server around, I'd know I was in an Applebee's. Also, one of my old roommates got HORRIBLE food poisoning from Applebee's so that always sticks in my mind.
