I am disgusted by this man's ignorance of political reality and his ego. This country will not have a viable multi-party system; indeed, without a parliamentary government, such a system is not even desirable. So what will his election bid do? First, it will likely elect the candidate farthest from the political ideals of his own constituency. Second, it will in no way elect Mr. Nader. But -- and this may be most important for Mr. Nader -- if he can garner the requisite 5% vote, it WILL provide him with missions of dollars in federal matching funds! I think that's what he wants, just like Buchanan. I will never again use the check-off on my 1040 for election funds. It is just a way for unelectable wannabees to get their hands into the public till. SHAME ON YOU, RALPH.
