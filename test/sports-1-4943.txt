Anyone who has ever coached basketball can see it in a heartbeat. Indiana is the worst taught team I've ever seen. Basketball players must be taught how to play the game, and watching IU's games it's obvious that fundamentals are not part of the equation. There's more to the game than launching 25 footers. Remember when we used to work for a good shot? Remember when it wasn't four guys standing around watching one guy go one on one? Why abandon everything that the previous coach did? Seems to me he had some measure of success.
