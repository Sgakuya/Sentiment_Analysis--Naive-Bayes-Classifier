I DO NOT LIKE THE PET SECTION BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KEEP THE BIRDS IN THE CAGES AND THEY POOP ALL OVER THE PLACE. 0NE TIME, A BIRD ATTACKED MY FRIEND, GRISELDA, AND IT FLEW IN TO HER HAIR. SHE WAS SCREAMING BECAUSE SHE WAS SO SCARED, AND THE EMPLOYEES THERE JST LAUGHED. HALF THE FISH WERE FLOATING ON THE TOPS OF THE TANKS........ YUCKY
