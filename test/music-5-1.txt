Fantastic album. 16 unique and perfectly performed covers (hence the name "fakebook") that includes the underground song "speeding motorcycle" written by the institutionalized man in Texas, and other extremely random choices - the only of these covers I'd ever heard before is "here comes my baby" which shows up on the Rushmore soundtrack performed by Cat Stevens. Fakebook is a brillant album, and one of my all time favorites.
