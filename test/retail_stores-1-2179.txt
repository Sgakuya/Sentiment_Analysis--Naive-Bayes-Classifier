FRys Electronics of Woodland Hills California Fry's Electronic of Woodland Hills, California has with out a doubt worst customer service of any store of this type I have ever visited, Specially the computer repair department. I bought two Sony Lap top at this location and I had full warranty coverage for both of this Lap top for 5 years. Fry refuse to repaire these two sony lap tops after numerouse repairs attemps and refuse to replace me with comarible new computer insted they came up with the suggestion that I have Liquide damge on both of my computer, which in fact I did not have any liquid spill or damge on my computer. I asked him to show me where is the damge he couldnot show me the damge and he ran awayand hid himself in one of t6he offcie which is behind the counter and never dare to come out. When I asked him for let me talk to your manager he said I am a manager in charg. I asked for his name and number he gave me store number.Finally I got the name of the store manager from another employee and telephone number.He was on vacation so I left him a message to return my phone call he never return my call. SO consumer when Frys try to sell extra insurance coverage on your electronic items Be CAreful. That is a SCAM. Do not sped extra money.When the time comes to repair the computer or electronic items they come up with an exeuses. They also sold a bad cpu fan to me and a perfect computer blew up. Most of the employees who works at Woodland hills location are not knowledable.
