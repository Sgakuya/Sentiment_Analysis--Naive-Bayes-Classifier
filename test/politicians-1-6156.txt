The wrong man at the right time. When the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, the opportunity was there for the Speaker of the House to represent a MAJOR change in US policy. Who did we get? Newt. This guy is just as slimy as ANY of your Democrat lifetime politicians, just as much of a liar, and is incapable of backing up anything he says. I liked him for about two weeks; the more I heard from him, the less I liked him. Instead of taking a strong stance against high taxes and Clinton's Socialist policies, he wastes our time talking about prayer in schools and adoptions instead of abortions. Are these bad things? No, but they are for the back-burner... the important thing was to introduce the people to ideas and a Congress which SHOULD have been totally different from what the US had for the last 40 years - and he blew it big time. He is the same kind of mush-mouthed politician that the people were trying to get RID of, and instead of being a leader he was a compromising, lying imbecile. Thanks for nothing, Newt. (Memo to The Real Truth - I told you once that I disliked Gingrich and rated him a two. I thought about it, and I downgraded him.)
