U2 is possibly the best band ever. Even though everything about them in the 80's besides their music was corny, their music has definately stood the test of time. Somehow they survived the 90's even though they strayed from the mainstream for most of it. And even though Pop isn't for everybody, it's still probably my favorite U2 record. That is, until the new one comes out... I have a good feeling about it.
