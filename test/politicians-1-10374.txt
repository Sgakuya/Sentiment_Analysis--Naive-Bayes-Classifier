For my comment, please go and read Neil8's comment. See the people who didn't find his comment helpful, must have been the large percentage of illiterate, attention deficit disordered, simpletons who only care about filling up cheap on gas and living the 'american life'. Anyone with half a brain, and some critical thinking skills can check out those facts, and evaluate for him/herself. Like well fed cattle in front of the monitor, you sat and you clicked 'no' on neil's comment. Too bad for you my friend.
