Finally! Other people tell the truth about Wal-Mart! The place sucks. Whatever you do, don't ever - EVER - apply for a job there. They'll push all these lies about being part of the Wal-Mart family. Their compassion, or whatever you could call it, for their associates is so conditional, but you can't tell them that. At the Wal-Mart where I used to work, we'd have lots of meetings (right in front of the customers; usually in softlines, where they have carpet) and at the end of every meeting, we'd do this lame Wal-Mart cheer. Give me a 'W' and we'd shout 'W' They did that for every letter, and then the store manager would shout, What does that spell? and we would all shout Wal-Mart! Wal-Mart! Wal-Mart! I used to shout Wal-Mark! Wal-Mark! Wal-Mark! Thr true 'sting' there is their associate newsletter. It discusses everything that's going on with Wal-Mart. The problem with that is all the associates, from all over the world, are truly overjoyed because they are a part of the family. Associates from the US, Canada, Germany, and all over are so happy about this, it's scary. What's going to happen to these people if they leave their store? It was amazingly traumatic for me. I have friends who are pretty hurt because they can't get their job back. It was painful for me for about four years, but I'm doing fine now; it's even better now because I can release my fury towards them in a constructive way. If you currently work there, do not get terminated!!! They will not let you try to get your job back; once they let you go, you're out of the Wal-Mart family...for good (for your own good). I mean, how many families disown their own? I thank God to be away from that deception. As for their products, the only thing you should get is a can or bottle of pop from a pop machine outside!
