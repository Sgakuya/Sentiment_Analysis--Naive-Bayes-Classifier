A cunning opportunist, not part of the far right as far as ideology goes. Really only did what a mayor is supposed to do back in 2001, but was canonized by some.. A possible presidential contender next time around, but he is too far to the right for liberals and not conservative enough for the hard line Republicans, to really gain widespread popularity in my view. Being an ethnic Catholic can still hurt you in the South and parts of the Midwest, albeit nowhere near as much as it used to.Law and order type, as befits his role as a former prosecutor. While certainly not personally responsible for the Louima and Diallo incidents, his get tough on crime attitude didn't help matters. Of course, there's nothing wrong with trying to protect the public, it's part of what government does, but sometimes it leads to disgraceful events like those, too. Personally, often graceless , petty, and vindictive, as evidenced by his exit speech in which he crassly blamed the entire city of Boston for 9/11. Being a native of said city, of course I'm gonna be pissed about that, I'd say the same thing had it been Detroit or Omaha he'd criticized instead.
