For MR GORE: This country has ENDURED 8 long years of an embarassing Presidential Administration. Once the Total Votes are re-computed and finalized, do this country a BIG Favor. Be Honrable and do this country a creditable favor....CONCEDE. We do not need to make humiliation and embarassment a tradition. The news media and thier liberal slant are large contributors to this foul stinch as they support the left wing. Legislation to ban POLLS and predictions would go a long way to curing many of the election ills. But speaking of the election, with a 54% turn out means that nearly 60% of those eligibile to vote JUST DO (DID) NOT CARE and of course, those 60% are so apethetic, they just do not GET IT. (The stats as reported: Only 73% are registared to vote...only 54% turned out...meaning there was a near (74 X 54 =40) 40% turn out or 60% that just did not care.. The liberals such as MR Gore and the liberal news media can take a lot of credit for this.
