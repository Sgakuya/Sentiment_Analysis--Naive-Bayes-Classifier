Ashanti easily gets 5stars from me...The album is hot, better than Chapter II, even though the cd was good, but running a race with her self-title debut, which both Ashanti and Concrete Rose should be considered classics...It's between Focus, Don't Leave Me Alone, and Don't Let Them for the next single...either one will be hot..but I want Focus as the second annd Don't Leave Me Alone as the third single...Ashanti is here to stay!
