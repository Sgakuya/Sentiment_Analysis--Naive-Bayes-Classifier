Bum-bada-bum-bada-bum-bada-bum-Bonanza! I've been here a few times against my will, since for some reason when I was in high school activities and we were out of town, our coach would make the bus stop here to eat. I one time partook in the famed Bonanza burger and it resulted in violent diarrhea and vomiting. Stick to the ice cream and prepackaged soda crackers if you're forced to go.
