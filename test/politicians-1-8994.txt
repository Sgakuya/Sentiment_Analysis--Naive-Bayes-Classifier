Bill Clinton damaged our country more than any previous president. People may think they can relate to him because he was a hip president, and think it's funny that he recieved oral sex in the oval office, but he degraded the value of the presidency of the United States in the eyes of many foreign countries. I hope we never have another president that was as bad as he was.
