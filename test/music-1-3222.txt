A girly singing with Robbie i got more hair curls than you on this record sink zep. Listen to drudge of drumming on Black Dog , just ruins it! Way over rated by fans, Stairway To Hell more like it, get over them! John Paul Jones is the best musician of this group. The untitled album is dull, cover to cover. The gate fold leaves a lot to imagine. LZ III best album cover! First album won a Grammy Award and is the classic album. Still favorite album is LZ II, the first record of this band and bought this in 8th grade in 1970 before it KOOL to like LZ!!! Rock n' Roll is for TEENAGER, not for grade skool punks.
