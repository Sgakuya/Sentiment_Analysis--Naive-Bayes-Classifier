This man is the biggest piece of crap to come down the pike since Ted Kennedy. I guess Kerry's strategy of trying to pretend to be a war hero to hide his liberal political record from the rest of the country outside New England didn't work. If Kerry is such a friggin war hero why do most active troops and most vets hate him so much? He's now suggesting he will run again in 2008. PLEEEEEEAAASSSE! Neither he or Hillary will ever get anywhere near the White House. and thank god for that!
