It's hard to believe now, but at one time (before Teddy came on the scene), the Kennedy's were a family to be respected. Now they are considered white trash with money. Ted has completely disgraced his family's legacy. The only positive thing he has done for the Kennedy name is to make his father look moral and to make his sister Rosemary look intelligent.
