I remember being in an Abercrombie store and staring in shock at a racist T-shirt making fun of chinese people. My boyfriend is Chinese. This T-shirt did not please me at all. I was taught to respect everyone whether they're white, black, Chinese, Japanese, Catholic, Mormon, Wiccan, Satanist, Jew, etc. Abercrombie needs to learn the same!
