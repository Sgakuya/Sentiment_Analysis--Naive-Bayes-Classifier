For years I loved Kmart. But for the last five years or so, I have hated the store. The only reason I ever would go in one was because they had the only kind of tennis shoe I really liked wearing. But the last time I ventured into one of their stores, they no longer carried this type of shoe. But this isn t the reason I don t like their stores, the reasons are because they seem have forgotten customer service, (along with how to clean up the store as well as how to price things competitively.) Long slow lines, coupled with high prices equaled bad business.
