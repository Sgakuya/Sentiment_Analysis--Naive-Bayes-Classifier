I am greedy, and I think I know everything, what am I? A REPUBLICAN ! ha ha ha ha ha ! But honestly, not all Republicans are bad, but the majority are alot like Dick Cheney when it comes to politics...downright greedy, and love to push the poor American even further down to further their agendas...Dick Cheney is possibly the worst vice president this country has ever seen. For that matter, there haven't been to many great VP's for a few decades I don't believe....
