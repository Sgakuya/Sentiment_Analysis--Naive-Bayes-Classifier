How, oh how, can this pizza place be the most popular? I'll never get it. First, the cheese. The cheese tastes bad. Granted, Domino's cheese is also bad, but they really pile it on here--they put on too much, which might be OK if it tasted good, but it doesn't. Second, the sauce--it's WAY too sweet. So sweet, in fact, it's not enjoyable. Third the crust--tastes like bread. Pizza crust shouldn't taste like bread the way this crust does. Fourth, the toppings are consistently of a LOW quality. Simply, nothing about the pizza can be liked. It's even more expensive than Domino's, which tastes better! Why, oh why, is that?!
