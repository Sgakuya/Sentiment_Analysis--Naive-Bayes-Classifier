Hypocrite. He certainly isn't a revrand of any god I know. I do not thank that any God that is involved around morality would approve of adultry. BTW, is he really a revrand of anything....I mean besides reverse racism. He's an example of the many people and most activist organizations who piss, moan, and bitch about anything whenever they want something, but can't get it. They're all less mature than toddlers. He's one of the biggest crybabies of all. He'll even accuse his own people of being racist (Barbershop...the latest attempt). All he unifies is hate amongst human beings.
