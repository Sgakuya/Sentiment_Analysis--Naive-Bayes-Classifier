This Album was awesome just like all of their others. I love every song on here and love the way that they have so many varieties of them.Some people say that they do not like the way this album is too soft, but I feel that it is not and they did agreat job of expressing their thoughts through music. True, sometimes i am in the mood for some of their louder stuff, but this album is great for, how should I say it, relaxing to great music and lyrics. Get it....it is awesome!!
