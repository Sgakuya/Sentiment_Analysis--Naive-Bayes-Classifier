I'm not in England though I was born there. Here in Canada our politicians are just as bad as Blair although you probably don't hear very much about them in Europe. Anyway Blair is just a slightly more intelligent version of Bush. Not much to crow about there, obviously ... just like Thatcher was a slightly brighter version of Reagan. [ Only North America elects people who think the world is five thousand years old.] Politicians are thugs, murderers and thieves, not necessarily in that order. It appears that people only voted for this dink because they were desperate to get rid of the Conservatives. Blair promised some reasonable social democratic policies and, of course,lied about all. What else is new? Par for the course, n'est-ce pas? I hope England manages to survive this asshole ... she probably will. The British are a pretty tough lot, when push comes to shove.
