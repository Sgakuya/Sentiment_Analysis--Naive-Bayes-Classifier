You won't catch me on an Aeroflot flight. Aeroflot - doesn't the name itself sort of sound something out for you? I'm not getting into anything Russian that goes above or below the surface of the earth. Safety standards for Russian vehicles = -2. I've never heard anything good about Aeroflot from any of several people I knew abroad who have flown them.
