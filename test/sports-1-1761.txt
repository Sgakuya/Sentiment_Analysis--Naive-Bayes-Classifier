Mr. Perry, if you looked at Munson's comment, you will see that it was left well before the Red Sox GROSSLY OVERPAID for Manny Ramirez. Duquette panicked and, as a result, spent $160M of someone else's money for a guy who will make a mockery of left field. Sure, there is no denying that Ramirez is one of the best hitters in baseball, but what is his career average at Fenway? Duquette is one of the most hated men in baseball and has managed to alienate, at different times, Pedro, Nomar, and Jimy Williams. Every year, Red Sox fans believe that this is finally their year. Well, after over 80 years, all other baseball fans can be assured of two things. The Red Sox will find a way to lose and their fans will be jealous of the success of the Yankees.
