I saw Creed six times in 2002, five times from the rail. Their music and lyrics are so powerful, and then to see the high energy and passionate engagement they put out at a concert is exhilerating. They know how to connect wih the audience and it feels so genuine. The Creed high lasts for weeks. I highly recommend attending a Creed concert - I can't wait for their next tour!
