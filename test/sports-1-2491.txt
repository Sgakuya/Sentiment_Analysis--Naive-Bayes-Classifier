Rick Morrissey of the Tribune said that the worldview of a Cub fan regarding his/her team is cute and cuddly. As a lifelong Chicago resident, I've seen it. When they were losing (from birth through my mid-twenties, except for 84, 89, and 98), it was about drinking and nostalgia. Now, its still about...drinking and nostalgia. As long as they are investment bankers and Jettas in Lincoln Park, as long as people still try to imitate Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as long as Wrigley Field and the surrounding bars keep current on their liquor licenses, the Cubs will continue to have a large audience, Dusty Baker or not. I tried last season to get excited for the Cubs, but I couldn't. You know why? Because the fans get all emotional. Not emotional the way normal sports fans get when they invest their loyalties in a particular team. Cubs fans get all Dr. Phil and misty-eyed about storied tradition, replete with vines, Haray Caray, and Waveland Avenue. Well, the future looks somewhat promising for the Cubbies. They might even develop a winning tradition. However, here's a piece of advice from a fierce South Side fan for my affluent compatriots North of Madison Street: learn the freaking in-field fly rule: The infield fly rule is a rule used to prevent a team from letting a pop-up drop in order to get two outs instead of the one that catching the ball would accomplish. It is called when a pop-up is hit on the infield (judgment call by the umpire) and there are less than 2 outs and runners on first and second base, or the bases are loaded. The reason is that a player could let the ball drop and because all of the baserunners return to the bases assuming the ball will be caught, the fielder could presumably throw to two bases for a double play as if it were a ground ball. Once the rule has been called by the umpire (done by pointing to the sky) the batter is out, and the runners can advance at their own risk after tagging up like they would on a fly ball. So, when you are ditching your job and enjoying a nice afternoon BAC of 2.34 and notice Slamming Sammy Sosa hitting a pop-up fly over the infield, don't actively, as a section, shout DROP IT! hoping for the error and a (im)possible base hit. (Actually saw this happen the last time I was at Wrigley) Know your baseball.
