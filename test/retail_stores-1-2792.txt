I have had nothing but problems with my engagement ring that my fiance purchased from Littman jewelers. It has been in for repairs 6 different times in less than a year. The manager of the store I worked with is so not helpful and actually blames me for some of the problems with my ring. I am finally in the process of returning the ring and my wedding band and going to a different jeweler for a much better ring.
