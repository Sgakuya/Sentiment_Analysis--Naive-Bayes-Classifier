I think, well I know Da Brat never minds any misleading info about a wack track of hers because she's the dominant woman on the rap and beauty turf. You never see her head hangin low unless she's deep in her lyrics or shruggin at her pants. Her lyrics, album and BOD are tight. All you haters please step aside and give someone else a chance to be heard on this hea sight.
