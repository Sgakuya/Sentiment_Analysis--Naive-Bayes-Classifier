An all-American classic by these Heartland rockers. Reminds me of summer camp, innocence, and the discovery of what some called punk rock. Scandalous in its time, classics like Gimme the Car and Good Feeling still jingle through my head. These guys are sadly still riding on these here laurels, but they rock live as well.
