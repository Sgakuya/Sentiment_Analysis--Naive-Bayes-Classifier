Josh Groban has an INCREDIBLE gift. This is coming from an experience musician and vocalist. His voice is the best out there today. I'll admit that I like his first album more, but this one is still very good. He branches out from what he did on his first CD and experiments a little, and even does some writing. A really great collection from an AMAZING artist.
