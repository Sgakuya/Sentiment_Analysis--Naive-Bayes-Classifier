I don't buy CD's all that often, but I figured I liked both singles from the radio, so I gave it a shot. Sugarland's debut album, "Twice the Speed of Life", features Jennifer Nettles' heartfelt vocals (with some serious twang; normally a big negative for me, but this down-home touch works well here) with the songwriting talents of Kristian Bush and Kristen Hall. Each song has a down-to-earth charm; "Something More" and "Baby Girl" are strong songs, but the next song ("Hello") switched gears to something a little more along the way of a daydream. The rest of the album does not disappoint. If you're into country, this is definately worth picking up.
