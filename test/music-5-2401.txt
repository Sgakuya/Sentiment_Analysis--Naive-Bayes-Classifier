wow, thanks RIA, I forgot about this CD, haven't listened to it in months, but it sure is a great one...guess I'd classify it as mildly alternative, folksy modern rock, something like that...the music and especially the lyrics are phenomenal, even though mostly slower stuff--no Christian elevator music on this CD, edgy.
