Fry's refused to accept my defective computer for return after numerous repairs by people who looked like computer geeks, but were incompentent. I piled all the boxes and components into a shopping cart, shoved the loaded cart through the door, and delivered it to the customer service area. Fry's refused to authorize or provide documentation of my return, so I reported them to my credit card company (truthfully) as intransigent and belligerant), I eventually got my money back that way.
