I generally like music that's quite upbeat and ballsy but occasionnaly I'll make an exception. S & G are one of those. The tunes here have class stamped all over them. If the hairs on the back of your neck dont stand up when they sing 'sail on silver girl..' from 'Bridge..' then you're probably dead.
