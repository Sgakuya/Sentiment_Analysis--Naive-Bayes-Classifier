Clay is a gal I had no idea, when did this story break, I guess this brings new meaning to Measure of A Man. Some one clear things up for me, he is a woman and he has had surgery or he is a man who has had surgery. May be they should ask Michael Jackson, he might know but then again no one is saying Clay is a boy so he probably has no opinion.
