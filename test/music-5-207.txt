Holy Sweet God, this album is amazing...This has to be one of the best albums of the 90's. It is the rare CD that you can put into your player and just listen to from start to finish without ever wanting to take it out. It's a pop masterpiece that isn't all that poppy. The songs are incredible sing alongs and the guitar solos are awesome. This was Weezer's first album and while it was incredible, their second album, Pinkerton, was even better. You will love this album if you buy it, but no CD collection is complete without Pinkerton. Actually, come to think of it...no CD collection is complete without the Blue Album either.
