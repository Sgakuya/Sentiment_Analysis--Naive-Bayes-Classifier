Believe the hype, John was one of the most disastrous leaders ever to rule. His first duty was as ruler of Ireland in 1185, by order of Henry II. John screwed this up and somehow managed to alienate both the native Irish and the Norman settlers, many of whom left in frustration. After six months he returned to England. When brother Richard gained the throne, John sat poised while Richard was off crusading, waiting to steal his brother's title. He attempted to conspire with the French King Phillip II in an effort to take the throne, when Richard returned, John was forced to beg his Brother for pardon and spent the next five years in humiliated silence. After acceding the throne in 1199, John had lost all his French territories within six years. Shortly afterwards John managed to get excommunicated by the Pope over a dispute about the Arch-Bishop-hood of Canterbury but instead of making a stand he resolved the issue by begging for forgiveness, paying tribute to the pope and officially making the pope overlord of England in 1213. John spent the years following the loss of his French possessions trying to regain them, his attempts at doing so were by and large disastrous (his lack of Military skill also earned him the nickname John Softsword, a distinctly Freudian insult if I ever heard one). The taxes he extracted from the Barons to pay for his military misadventures finally drove them into revolt which culminated in him being forced to sign the Magna Carta. However since John was testy about sticking to the document he'd signed the Barons offered the Dauphin Louis of France the throne who proceeded to invade England. Now that he'd really dropped England in it, John promptly died of dissentry (Apparently he had some pretty disgusting eating habits and all I shall disclose of their nature would be a warning: Kids, don't bite your nails). Following John's death Louis actually captured London and for about a year extracted tribute from the South-east much like an uncrowned king (Fortunately for John historians don't actually recognize this as a successful invasion). Conventionally I was taught through history classes (and classic Disney movies) that the nephew-murdering, niece fancying John was a lascivious, petty, weak and almost comically incompetent King and truthfully I have seen little to disprove this.
