This place has screwed me over in such a major and horrible way. I dont mean I had one bad experience, I have had many. I wont go into all the details, cause no one wants to read that much, but here is the gist of it. They had my air conditioner in for repair for 2 months, no one would return my phone calls, managers who I happened to get on the phone promised they would help me, never called back. I have evidence that one manager actually deleted data from the system to prevent me from returning my item. I have sent letters, called store managers and even emailed the CEO with NO RESPONSE. I hope this store (big dreams, I know) goes out of business. The more I have researched, the more I find stories similar to mine. They simply DO NOT CARE about the customer. A place like this simply does not belong in business.
