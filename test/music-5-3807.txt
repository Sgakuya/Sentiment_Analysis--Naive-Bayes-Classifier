There are very few albums that can be considered a solid rock album. Boston's 1st. album is one of those albums. Almost every song on this album has either been a radio hit or a billboard singles hit. John Stolz came up with some beautiful yet powerful guitar riffs. Some may have labeled this band as corporate rock. However, they were still able to create some of the greatest classic rock tunes of all times.
