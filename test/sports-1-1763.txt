I am a Anti-Red Sox fan becasue my dad is. We are Yankees fans and know how to win. I don't mean to be rude. But the Yankees have won World Series 3 times in a row starting in 1998-2000. The Red Sox havent won a World Series since 1918. Wow...that's pretty bad. Even if they win this year (2001) with Manny, they still have to win 20 more in order to just tie the Yankees. The fans always blame the Yanks for winning so they always say they have a better team. Obviously if they did, they would be defending World Champs year after year after year...SORRY BOSTON!
