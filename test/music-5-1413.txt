You really could not as kany more from a band for their debut album, it comes in strong with those defiant drums at the beginnig of 'Radio Free Europe' and never loses it's magic all the way through. The sound is edgy and gritty which makes it understandable why they were such an exciting band at the time and which still holds true to this day. A classic and no mistake!
