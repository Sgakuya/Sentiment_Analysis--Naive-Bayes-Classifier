This team needs a make-over in the worst way. They would have been better off trading Barry, taking the cap hit, but at least getting some draft picks for him or something. What they ended up with was nothing and everybody hoping and praying he comes back year after year. At least they fired Morniwheg this year. Their might be hope for them yet.
