The french fries are okay. With just okay fries, this place could use some serious revisions of menu, customer service, and management. There is so little good in this store. I go in and I can't stand the smell. The cashier usually cannot understand me (being another ethnicity- obviously not a good english speaker). And I'm not racist! Customer service is the key in any restaurant- here it is non-existent.
