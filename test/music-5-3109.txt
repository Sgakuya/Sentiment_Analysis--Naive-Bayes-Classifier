It's funny,this recording was in Billboard's top 100 for something like five years and now you rarely hear it mentioned. It's Too Late was a massive hit. I was 12 when it was released and it was hard to go anywhere without hearing it. And it had staying power. Several cuts--You've Got a Friend, Way Over Yonder, Smackwater Jack, So Far Away--became staples of a generation. It was on near constant rotation in the record collections everyone I knew from 12 to 40. Probably the crown jewel in Carole King's impressive and massively influential singing/songwriting career.
