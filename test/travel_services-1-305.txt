I had the absolute worst time with ATA. Between my flight from Chicago Midway to LAX and back I was delayed 12 hours. On the way to LAX they couldnt find the pilot and when they finally did he was in a bar completely drunk so they had to find another pilot, then on the way back it was a nitemare I was suppose to land in chicago at 2p.m. and my plane didn't land until 12 a.m. the next day. Every time I contacted someone at ATA they were very rude, and when they finally said that they would refund some of my money, it never came! I would never fly ATA again if you paid me to, it was a HORRIBLE trip!
