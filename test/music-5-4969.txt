I think it's obvious that Billy Gilman has great talent... All of the ratings on here are either 5 or 1. I can see that it's not for all people, but I don't see how anyone can say the kid is not INCREDIBLY talented. He also shows incredible maturity for someone so young, and for those who don't think he's real country, you must not have heard his album, because he recorded a classic country song, What's Forever For . This girl's one voice cheers for great music... and to me, that means cheers to Billy Gilman! :)
