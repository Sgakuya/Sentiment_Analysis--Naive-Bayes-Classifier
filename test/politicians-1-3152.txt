The worst President in history. Accomplished nothing except weakening the United States. The economy was failing as he left office, in spite of a technological revolution that increased productivity in spite of his foolish economic policy. The military was not 1/2 of it's former, pre-Clinton self. The number of enemies that were capable of threatening and harming the United States grew during his time in office.
