Ralph Nader is a silly old man with the most worn out liberal battle cries as his slogans. More than half of the people of the US feel like liberals are moving away from the mainstream, and this guy is even further left than they could ever hope to be. He is a communist, through and through. He may say he's not, but there is not an issue that a communist would disagree with him on.
