Gave this a terrible rating because the prices for these to sweet drinks are highway robbery!! Do not recommend. A heck of alot cheaper to go the the store, buy a can of frozen orange juice, vanilla ice cream and ice and blend together. I could probably make 20 drinks for the price of one Orange Julius!!
