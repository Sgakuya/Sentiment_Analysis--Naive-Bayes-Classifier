I was selected for secondary screening 15 times in a row with Air Tran. After about 6 times I questioned it and was told that my name is randomly selected each time I fly. I asked if I came up on the list once was I likely to come up again, to which it was reiterated that each flight randomly selects passengers so, no. Having some basic understanding of statistical probability, I told the agent that that was not true. Over the next few flights I posed the same question with the same results. By the way, the fifteenth time was my last trip on Air Tran. Wish my employers contract with them would have expired sooner!
