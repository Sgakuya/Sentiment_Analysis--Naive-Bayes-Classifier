Eric Clapton's Crossroads (released in 1988) defined the box set as a compilation package. The track list is very inclusive, especially for the casual fan, as it covers Clapton's time with the Yardbirds, Cream, etc. as well as his solo efforts, including the essentials For Your Love, Strange Brew, Sunshine Of Your Love, Can't Find My Way Home, After Midnight, Layla, I Shot the Sheriff (though live), Wonderful Tonight, and Cocaine. While, there are other less inclusive Clapton compilations available, this is the one to look for. Nevertheless, in my opinion, no greatest hits package should be on this list as a compilation cannot really be compared to regular releases and do not represent the concept of a full-length effort.
