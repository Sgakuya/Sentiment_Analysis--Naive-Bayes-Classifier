This guy was out of synch from practically the start. When George Shrub selected this son of a newspaper owner from Indianapolis over the esteemed Richard Lugar, it seemed to me that there was going to be some unintentional laughs to be gained from this guy. Hate to say it, but he's a genuinely nice person who has little or no idea of what it means to work for a living. His wife, Marilyn, seems smarter (and more Machiavellian) than he ever could be. Life has been one big Martini and Rossi, coupled with three sets of 18-holes every day, for J. Danforth Quayle. I really am not sure if Quayle meant to mis-spell potato that time in New Jersey to show he was funny, or if, gosh darn it, he was serious. Oh, dear. Either way, my wife and I enjoyed his presence in the public eye, even if it did meaning having to wince every so often when he referred to black people as Negroes.
