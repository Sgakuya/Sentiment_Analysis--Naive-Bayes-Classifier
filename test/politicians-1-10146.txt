Bush Jr.'s re-election tricks have always depended upon manipulating the public through a fear-based agenda and distracting the public with a series of wedge issues. It my hope that most of us Americans have finally wizened to the fact that the public was sorely misled about Iraq being a serious threat. So many pains in America over four years, yet the buck never stops with Bush, who rejects that he responsible for a single mistake. Strangely, many Republicans could care less about whether Iraq was a purposeful deception, and how foolish some of his economic policies have been. According to them, Bush has had no failures or weaknesses in foreign policy and foreigners who hate America are getting calmer. I'd hate to see how much worse world relations will be if enough people are foolish enough to trust him with another four years.
