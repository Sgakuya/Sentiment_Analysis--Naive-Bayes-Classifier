A horrible program with a crooked coach and thug players. Taking ineptitude to lower lows is a specialty of Mississississississippi State. Their one goal each and every year is to beat Ole Miss. If that is accomplished on even a less than regular basis, the M(a)oro(o)ns wallow in their sloppy glory and invite Jackie Sherrill, possibly the least ethical coach in the history of college football (ask Joe Paterno, Pitt and, as well, Texas A$M) back for yet another pitiful year.
