This is one of the most beautiful, heartfelt, classic records ever made, and 'Isn't she lovely' is a wonderful example of a perfect song. I remember growing up and singing Sir Duke around the house..come to think about it, that was probably my first favorite song. One of the best albums ever by one of the most classic, talented performers. Very, very highly recommended
