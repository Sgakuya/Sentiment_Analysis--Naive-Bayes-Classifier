Hey Duhwa, Now that Al Yes I know I won Florida Gore did you a favor and decided not to run again. Don't you think you might wanna suck up to John McCain to make sure he stays in your party. Cause I gotta a feeling in a national election with him your ass is toast, much like it was last time you ran for President. But this time sir (lol) we'll hopefully elect you, instead of you the and good-ole boy network rigging the election for yourself. Your a sad pathetic, imitation of a real president, like Reagan or Clinton. br Signed Kathryn Harris.
