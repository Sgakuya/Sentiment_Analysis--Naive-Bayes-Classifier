If anyone is to be blamed for the abysmal leadership of this country under the Supreme Court appointed George W. Bush, that man is Ralph Nader. He split the Democratic party by running for presidency knowing full well that he didn't have a chance of winning and further, that Gore would be more responsive to environmental concerns than Bush. Nader's unparalleled egocentrism and arrogance have damaged his country. As one political commentator put it on election day, Ralph Nader's going to have a tough time getting anybody to return his phone calls for the next four years. Put this little twerp in a Corvair and send him over a cliff!
