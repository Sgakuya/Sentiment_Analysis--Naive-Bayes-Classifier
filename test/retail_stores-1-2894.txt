My husband and I purchased a one karat 3 diamond past, present, and future ring from whitehall. We were told it was a platinum ring and therefore would be double the amount to size it up as the materials are more expensive than gold. However, later that evening we looked at the appraisal card given to us and discovered the only part of the ring that is platinum, are the prongs holding the diamonds. The band itself is white gold!! Why am I being charged extra for platinum when the papers specify white gold? When I brought this to their attention, they simply lauhged and offerred to size it at the gold rate. Nevermind the fact that the initial price represented a platinum, not white gold ring. We are extremely displeased and URGE OTHERS TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN SHOPPING WHITEHALL JEWELERS.
