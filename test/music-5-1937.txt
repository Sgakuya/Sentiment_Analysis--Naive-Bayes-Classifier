'Spiritual Machines' is Our Lady Peace's 4th album, and it just goes to show that a band can get this far and still be new and interesting, without having to recycle songs from previous albums. Slapping the label of 'concept record' on this effort need not apply... almost the entire thing was written before guitarist Mike Turner and vocalist/lyricist Raine Maida got their hands on the book 'The Age of Spiritual Machines' by Ray Kurzweil, which shows the struggle between humans vs. machines in the future. While some of the songs play off this theme, the album is almost entirely about human emotion. And although records of the same nature, such as Radiohead's 'Ok Computer', have a negative outlook on the idea, OLP says a big 'F*ck You' to machines and lets humans know we'll prevail. Songs like the uplifting first single 'Life' tell you: 'Life is waiting for you/It's all messed up but we're alive/Life is waiting for you/It's all messed up but we'll survive', while the catchy choruses of 'Middle of Yesterday' and 'Made to Heal' draw you in musically. 'All My Friends' has the chilling vocals of Maida, reaching substantially high notes set to the eerie tunes and 'Are You Sad' is a beautiful song written for Maida's younger brother to help him through his own life. Even the spoken word tracks by Kurzweil himself give this album that extra punch and intelligence that lifts it above a lot of the other stuff out there today. Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron helped out on two of the tracks when OLP drummer Jeremy Taggart was injured during the last days of recording, and bassist Duncan Coutts sets some great tones to the music of this album. I highly recommend this album and it is, by far, one of the best to have come out of 2001.
