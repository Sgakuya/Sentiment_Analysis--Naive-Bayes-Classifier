Don't mind me, Michigan consistently fields good teams. However, field a team completely from the student body and it'll be a totally different story. The players are all paid off to go here; no top football player in their right mind would go to Michigan without getting paid. Having gone here, I've seen it. The students could give a damn about sports here. There are a few fans from bucktowns that are hardcore fans, but the rest of the rich kids and preppies could give a hoot. Call me crazy, but I don't even think anyone talked to the athletes on campus; they always looked ostracized in their Michigan gear compared to all the other students wearing North Face and designer clothes. Rest assured, there will be another scandal here, and our football team will stink. I'm sorry to say I graduated from here. Michigan's only fans are rednecks and ghetto folk that never took one day of college classes. The only ranking anyone cared about at Michigan was the national college rankings for the Engineering school and the regular LSA. Pathetic.
