CONFIRMED hypocritical slave raping bigot.Better identified by his foreskin than as a forefather. Known for this great quote in the Declaration of Independence...We hold these truths to be self evident...that all men are created equal (but first I'll enslave them, beat them, lynch them, and rape their wives and children because I can). That is how the phrase goes...right, Tom?
