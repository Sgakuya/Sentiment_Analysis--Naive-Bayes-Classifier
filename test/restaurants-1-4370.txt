The horror of Cracker Barrel has to be seen to be believed. Since I was eight, I imagined blowing these restaurants up with phasers (after beaming out everyone, so no one gets hurt), and I still hate the place! The food is horrific, most of it yucky veggies and stuff like that. The service is horrible and slow. The prices are outrageous and the country store selection is quite the joke. Another slow food terror.
