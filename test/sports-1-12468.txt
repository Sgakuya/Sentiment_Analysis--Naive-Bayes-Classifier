The most arrogant fans in the country! All you hear is how much faster they are, and how they'll blow you out. Guess what, it didn't happen! The fan support is also very lousy. They can't sellout more than 2 games a year, even when tickets are only $10.00. Their booster club actually let OSU fans join and buy Fiesta Bowl tickets from the Miami fans. They only had about 4,000 fans in Miami compared to about 65,000 for OSU.
