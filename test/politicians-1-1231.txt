Regardless of what people think of Yassir Arafat, whether he is good or evil, does not matter. God will have His way on this earth. He promised the land to the descendants of Abraham and Sarah through Issac forever. The so-called Palestinians are descendants of Ishmael who was born out of the fornication between Abraham and Hagar (Sarah's handmaid) and they are not the rightful heirs to the land according to God's promise. This is the ABRAHAMIC COVENANT and it is a covenant that cannot be broken. God will restore His name and defend His people Israel. I will bless those who bless thee and I will curse those who curse thee say's God. We all need to be behind Israel to receive the blessings of God. Moshiac(Yeshua,Jesus) will soon return to setup His kingdom on this earth, but not before the advent af the Man of Terror or Antichrist on the scene. We all need to get behind what Holy scripture says about Israel. It is astonishing to see it occur right before my very eyes! For anyone interested, especially Palestinians, visit Walid's Testimony on the internet. God's blessings can come to you as well. Shalom In Christ's name. Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem
