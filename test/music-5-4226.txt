Absolutely the most unbelievable voice I have ever heard. Bar none. If you thought Whitney, Mariah and Celine have talent and soul, check again. She even makes the old jazz greats sit up and listen. And the first time you listen, use headphones and pick-up the details in her voice. She is not only a powerful singer, but her range is great. But the very first image that came to my mind was crystal clear spring water. The most pure voice I know. Enough gushing, I'm going to put it in my player right now.
