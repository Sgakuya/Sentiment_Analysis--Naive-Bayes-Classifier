My fiance had purchased 3 items for me for our first christmas together, a gold diamond ring and a solitare engagement ring as well as a silver necklace. My gold ring was repaired so many times I was told I had to exchange it for a different ring twice because of a defect in the jewelery and they refused to repair it. My engagement ring was completely ultered to the point where the entire band the prongs are not the original ones and they cannot find the identification number in my diamond. Lawsuit!!
