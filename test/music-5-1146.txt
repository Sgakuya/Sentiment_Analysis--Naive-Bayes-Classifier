What happened to Prince's talent after 1988? Apparently, Beck ate it and regurgitated it all over Midnite Vultures! Now, everything Beck's done has been great -- but who knew he could make such an amazing party record?! Each song is hooky as hell and a new cool sound happens every three seconds. Bottom line: get this CD!
