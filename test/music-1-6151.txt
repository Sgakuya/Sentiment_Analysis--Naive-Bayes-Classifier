I have a hard time trying to figure out whether this is serious. Fred Durst can't sing, there's no musical melody to speak of, and the subjects addressed are so juvenile and irresponsible that it must be a joke. If I didn't know any better I would say there was no potential audience for this, but I do know better, unfortunately.
