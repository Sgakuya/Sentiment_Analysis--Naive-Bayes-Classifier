I used to work for Hollywood Video and loved each day I went to work. Yes we had upset customers and yes we had employees that should not have been working for us at the time. Other than the fact that you cant get anyone in the company to take you seriously about problems going on in the store you tend to sink or swim. I was terminated on my day off for coming in the store to help the new shift leader on duty who was overwhelmed with her crew calling in sick on her. She made a mistake using my code and they fired me without warning no prior write ups no prior counselings, poor girl did not not know what she was doing and needed a pass code for certain functions. I was with my family that day and had to go help her in fear of upsetting customers with lines. go figure i put in my own time and got fired....I loved working for this place... i loved the customers ....i loved the movies...I thought i was in the perfect job...
