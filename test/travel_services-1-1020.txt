: North American (NA) violated our contract on two (2) separate occasions by not delivering our household goods as promised. Therefore, we had to hire another carrier to deliver our goods. NA agent, Kings Moving and Storage, damaged our goods on pickup. Due to the delay in delivery we had to make some purchases to live. NA refuses to accept any responsibility since they did not deliver our goods. NA knew at the time of pick up they did not have a driver. Our contract specifically states dates of delivery. When NA did not deliver as promised they gave us an alternative delivery date, which they did not meet. We expect NA to pay for the difference in their estimate and the actual cost of the move. We expect NA to pay for the items we had to purchase due to the delay in delivery. We expect NA or their agent Kings Moving and Storage to pay for the damage to our goods when they picked them up and stored them. Total damage and cost $2,600.
