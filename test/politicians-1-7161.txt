JESSE CLAIMS TO NEGOTIATE PEACE AROUND THE WORLD, WHILE IN AMERICA HE DIVIDES PEOPLE. USING RACE AS THE MEANS OF GETTING MONEY - SOME FROM POOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL AND SPEND MONEY ON GROUPS - MANIPULATING THEM. WHY NOT TRY A MORE POSITIVE APPROACH - I AM CONFIDENT THAT AS HE HAS TRAVELLED THE WORLD - HE MUST KNOW THAT AMERICA MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT IT IS BETTER THAN ANY WHERE ELSE - OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE CHANGED HIS ADDRESS. HE IS NO MARTIN LUTHER KING.
