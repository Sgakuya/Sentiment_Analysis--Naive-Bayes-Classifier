Truck was due Friday, didn't show up. I called Friday afternoon and they said it was on its way. Still never showed up. I called Saturday and they said it had never been sent since I had not yet paid (I had paid in full a week earlier.) After many phone calls, Truck arrived Monday at 7:00 leaving me with 3 hours instead of three days to pack. Spacing in the truck also forced me to use either 11 or 13 feet instead of the 12 I asked for, and Management was rude and uncooperative about not charging me for space thast I was forced by them to use. When I was talking to Colette (the manager), she said she could not do anything about it and that she had better things to do than talk to me about this. I feel like I was extorted for another 85 bucks for space i didnt want or use.
