Senator Daschle has changed totally since I voted for him in his first Senatorial election. He used to represent quite closely the views of the average South Dakotan, but since he's started sharing power with the upper echelons of the Democratic Party, he's changed most of his views 180 degrees. His pro gun-control votes, his pro-abortion votes, his willingness to defend the Clintons at every turn, have caused me to change my opinion of him. He also claims to have helped the farmers of South Dakota so much, and farm prices are at all time historic lows--farmers are surviving only because of government handouts which Senator Daschle proudly claims credit for. How much longer will the American taxpayer continue to subsidize farmers, and what will happen when they decide to quit? If Senator Daschle was truly on the side of agriculture, he'd stop taking campaign contributions from the huge multi-national corporations, and work to raise farm prices, so we here in South Dakota could participate in the economic boom times like the rest of the economy.
