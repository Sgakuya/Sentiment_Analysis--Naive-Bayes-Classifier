This franchise is a disgrace. They have their best year in recent memory in 2002. They are a team of young studs - playing hard, getting up and down the court, and generating a little buzz in Oakland / SF. Shockingly, they are in the running for the playoffs until the last week in the season... can't wait until next year, right? So what does this organization do? The fail to resign Arenas, and dump their leading scorer, captain, and MVP for a 30 something gunner? Clearing cap space? Please... remind me not to drop $50 to see this sorry squad this year.
