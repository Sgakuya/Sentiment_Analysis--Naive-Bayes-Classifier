Some rich people use their money wisely, and become better people for it. Not this guy, it seems. After taking all the money the Rangers could offer so he could stay close to home in Texas, he jumped at the Yankers' best offer. Once I saw him punch the ball out of the Red Sox first baseman during this year's playoffs, I decided on a much better nickname for him, A-Hole.
