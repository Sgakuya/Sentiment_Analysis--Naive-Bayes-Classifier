I haven't heard a female artist in a while that I could relate to, but now I have! Pink's style, and unique perspective into the boy/girl world caught my ear the first time I heard her. I tend to listen to mainly rap/r b but she definetly made a fan for life in me. Her words mean alot more than people realize especially if you date interacially so listen to number nine closely!!!!
