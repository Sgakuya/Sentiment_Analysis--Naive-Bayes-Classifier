How the Hell is this musicial idiot even being considerd a Jazz Musician? He dosen't even compare with Kenny G. which is about as low as you can get. Please give us a break. Jazz is a very special type of music and should be respected as such. Most Doctors and Lawyers have not the training and true dedication it takes to be a real Jazz Musician. A serious Jazz Musician uses more instant brain power than any other profession. Proven. Unless you're God, I think John Coltrane may have been as close as one can get. Ry Cooder should be honored to be on this Rate It list. He's probably a fine Rock player and good family man. Peace.
