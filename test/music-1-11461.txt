How the hell the Sex Pistols ever got credit for the whole punk genre is beyond me. Johnny Rotten sucks ass. The only good song is, of course, Anarchy in the UK, but if you want real good punk/ska, try Velvet Underground or Operation Ivy with some Vandals mixed in...oh yeah and the Dead Kennedy's are good too.
