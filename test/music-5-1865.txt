Cuz the Bloodhound Gang is 4 100% hot baby. They all know how 2 party and they are all 100% cute : especially Jimmy Pop Ali ( who's my boyfriend, buy the way ). All songs on Hooray For Boobies are totally awsome, especially I hope You Die, The Bad Touch, Ballad Of Chasey Lain and The Inevitable Return Of The Great White Dope. I have this album about a year and still i'm listening 2 it every day and it doesn't bores me 2 death. Bloodhound Gang Rulezzzzz -XXX- From Amsterdam, Holland
