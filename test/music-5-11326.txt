This cd is really reallly fun! It's one of those perfect summer background cds, for when you just want some pop music to take your mind off of your troubles! Swimming, tanning, getting ready to go to a little league baseball game; it's perfect! Everything from Shake it Fast to Aaron's Party is on here! My favorite songs on it are Kryptonite Its my Life Absolutely (story of a girl) Jumpin Jumpin Give me Just one Night I Think I'm in Love With You I Wanna Be With You Lucky Show me the Meaning of Being Lonely and especially Don't think I'm not . I would recommend it to any pop fan, chances are you'll find a few favorites on here!
