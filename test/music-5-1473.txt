It was 20 years ago today.. What can I say... this is probably the album I have played more than any other... the very first CD i bought, the first CD i replaced when they were stolen.. Anyway.. back up to date.. this Classic album is about to hit the Road again, as former frontman Fish decides to mark the coming of age of his most commercially successful work. In my personal opinion his solo work is better than this (though this still deserves the 5 star rating) but there you go. Not entirely sure how much I can/should waffle on here so I'll leave it at this for now.
