Rented a car from Payless in Newark, New Jersey. When I picked the car up, they announced that I could not purchase a liability insurance policy because I live in New York city. The car we picked up had less than a quarter tank of gas. When I returned the car, it took an hour and half to find a way to enter the return lot which was located at a Ramada Inn hotel. The directions to the return lot were useless and when followed perfectly, caused us to retrace our steps back and forth through a loop of highway exit ramps. Eventually I had to drive over a concrete medium to reach the return lot.
