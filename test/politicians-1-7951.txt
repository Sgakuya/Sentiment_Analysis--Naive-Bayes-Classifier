This anti-American tyrant illegaly locked up thousands of innocent Japanese Aericans for one reason alone: being Japanese. He is the cause of the massive amounts of taxation we se today. Increased the size of government to new heights. New that the threat of Japan was high, yet pulled resources out of Pearl Harbor, thus, leaving it defenseless. He did everything in his ability to save and support the Soviet Union. Too bad he gave the Communists so much support they soon became one of the 2 wold powers. But the worst thing he did was lock up the innocent Japanese in camps. Can you imagine the flak that Bush would recieve if he locked up all Muslims after 9-11? The outcry would be enourmous! Let's expose FDR for what he really is: A socialist, racist pig.
