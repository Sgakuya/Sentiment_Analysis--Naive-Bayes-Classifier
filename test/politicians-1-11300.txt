That this man has any followers at all is symbolic of the dumbing down of America. He can only speak in bumper stickers. He can't think on his feet or problem-solve, as we learned during the recent primary debates. I would hate to see this man in a time of crisis when one needs to act reflexively. Talking about being the son of a millworker only goes so far in the real world. Oh, and did I mention he's a shameless ambulance chaser?
