Avril Lavigne I would recomend to everyone from ages 10 and up. Her songs tell interesting stories. Most people never listen to her and says she's horrible. I love her music and I could listen to it all day. She is deffenetly not like Brittany Spears.(whitch is a good thing). Most people think of Sk8ter Boi and Complicated when someone mentions Avril Lavigne. But I like My world , Anything but ordinary and Naked the best. Avril Rocks
