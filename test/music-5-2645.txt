I recently bought this CD and it has quickly become one of my favorite CDs of all-time. It has classic like Here Comes the Sun and Come Together, but it is the lesser known songs which I hadn't really remembered hearing which make this album so great. For example, Octupus's Garden is such a catchy tune that I found myself singing it to myself long after the song is over. If you like music and don't have this album, go buy it today.
