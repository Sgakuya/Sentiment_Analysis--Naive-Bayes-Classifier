Sort of a Canadian Howard Dean, from a right wing perspective. Self-destructed and is no longer a factor. UPDATE: Genghis, you're correct to a point, but his party didn't disappear, it merged with the Progressive Conservatives to form the Conservative party, and Day's successor as leader, now leads that party. The Alliance members, (Days party) dominate the Conservative party. As a final note, Canadian political parties are by no means as unstable as you suggest.
