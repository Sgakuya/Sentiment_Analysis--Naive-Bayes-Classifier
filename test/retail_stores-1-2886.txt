I can't even begin to explain how incompentent this jewlery store. Fist thing when I went looking at diamond earings they showed me a pair of 5,000 diamond that they said were on sale for 2,300 dollars They are a pair g-h S1 they were 1kt. the net worth of about 2,300 with out them being on sale This was the worst fraud that I have ever encountered. I ended up buying a 3/4 carat I, I1 for 1600 dollars then 2 days after I had them I lost both of them. Luckly I found them but they didnt have a back any more. I got on the internet and learned that they have 37,000 things about Whiehall jewlers fraud. if you are on here check it out Whitehall Jewlers fraud. You will learn alot about this company. When you know better you do better. listen learn and heed this warning.
