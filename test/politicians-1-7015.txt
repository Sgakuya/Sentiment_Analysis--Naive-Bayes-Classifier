If this man was really a student and follower of Dr. King, He must have the attention span of my 15 month old son. Dr. King's speech I Have a Dream must be played or shown by the media at least two or three times a month. So for someone that can say they stood side-by-side with MLK, the Rev. Jackson(Of what Church I don't know, but I wonder when he was there last to deliver a sunday sermon) must have selective memory. The Rev. Jackson it would seem of late has done more to poke a stick in the eye of americans, than he has tired to help americans. If the leader of the Rainbow Coalition is selective about what color(s) of the rainbow to provide help to, isn't that a form of racism? I am by no means a man without faults, I try not to impose my beliefs on another until I have corrected those faults or at least made an honest effort too. I have been in the military for over 20 years now, both enlisted and for the last 15 years as an Non Commissioned Officer. I stopped seeing color of my fellow soldier and officers long ago, I judge a person by thier actions and deeds. I am very confident that I would fight for the Rev. Jacksons' right to speak his mind and then not attack him for what he said. But I'm not as confident that Rev. Jackson would provide me the same courtsey after I finnished speaking. I am quite sure that a man of his vast knowladage could do more to help the suffering people of these United States, instead of driving a wedge between us. ( I'm also sure that he would do a better job of writing this, but thats why I'm still going to school. I'm trying to overcome my ignorance, and not pass it on to my children or others)
