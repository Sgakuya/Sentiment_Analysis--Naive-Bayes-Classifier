I agree with Thorne. OH MY GOD, this has to be one of the worst music videos ever created! May I ask what exactly the point is of growling NUTTIN' WRONG WITH ME/LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR!!!!! into a bad microphone is? MTV, please, I beg you, never ever ever ever show this video. The song nearly killed my poor eardrums the first time I heard it, and oh yeah, the video is a total waste of everyone's time. Take care, everyone!
