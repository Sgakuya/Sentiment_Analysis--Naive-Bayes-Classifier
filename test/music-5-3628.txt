This was the first album by a former Beatle that had great and far-reaching success. It shows the amazing evolution of George Harrison. The songs are very spiriutal and personal. The title of the album is so appropriate to sort of comfort fans that the Beatles WERE the greatest group to ever live, but all things must pass and good times are still to come. The major hit and my favorite song off of the album is My Sweet Lord.
