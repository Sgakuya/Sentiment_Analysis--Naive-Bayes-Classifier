Sabotoge of the bill H.R.4844 was the most heinous thing a politician could do. This could have helped the widows of railway workers find some grace and help in their plight for survival. Trent Lott and his crew had advice from Bush NOT to let this bill get past them. BOO for all Republicans, especially LOTT.
