I asked about the sexual harassment incident shown below at the Arlington Heights Il store. The employee I asked got the manager, and the manager refused to comment. I did my homework, and got the story from the person who posted the comment below. It rings true to me. I agree with him. A compony that takes no action when a customer is harassed by an emplyee, does not deserve my business. i hope all who read this agree and act accordingly.
