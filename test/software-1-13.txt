Although SpamCop seems to offer a potentially good product, I was appalled with how I was treated when I asked questions on their on-line forum. One administator was outright rude and very sarcastic when I asked for help after not being able to find the answers in their very unorganized FAQ section. I would definitely recommend using another product.
