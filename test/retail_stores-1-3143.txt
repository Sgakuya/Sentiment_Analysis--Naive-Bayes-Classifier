i will never rent from here again. i had made a down payment on a movie that wasn't released yet to reserve one of the first copies. but when i went to pick it up, they were out and went sure they would get anymore. then they refused to give me a refund or the down payment but wanted to give a due-bill. i have yet to cash it in.
