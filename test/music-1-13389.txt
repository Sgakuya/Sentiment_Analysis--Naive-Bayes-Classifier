Nowadays, people tend to think that just because a so-called artist is from the South, that it must be good. We need to start recognizing true talent. Nelly is not true talent. All you Nelly lovers need to just calm down. It's just a bunch of hype right now, and it will soon end because he sucks. Niggas down south need to get some education. Nobody talks like that. All of his beats sound just alike, just like all south sh$%.(except Outkast, Three-6 Mafia, and Goodie Mob) This guy is going nowhere, because pretty soon somebody else will come along and get the stupid public's attention. The public is full of dummies who don't know sh#! from doo-doo. They will listen to anything with a beat. Those garbage niggas down south need to just stop trying, because they will never be great artists.
