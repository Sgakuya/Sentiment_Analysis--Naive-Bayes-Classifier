I think she is a bad role model for all of her younger fans. Which are the only fans I think she has, except for all of the guys in the world. But they don't like her music they like her looks. And her performance at the last MTV award show was demeaning to all women. Stripping her suit off, while underneath she barely had anything on. She says she was just expressing herself, it lokked to me that she was SHOWING herself.
