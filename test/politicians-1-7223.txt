Mr. Jackson should be ashamed of himself. Hoe can you call yourself a reverend when you support abortion, gay rights, etc. It is horrible to see people put up with what Mr. Jackson is doing and saying. How does he make a living? If it were Billy Graham or T.D. Jakes up there saying the same things this man is saying, they would be criticized and told what a hypocrite they were. Sounds to me like Mr. Jackson needs to repent for the shame he has brought on the Christians in the U.S. and to get saved. He needs to get reaquainted with the Bible. God forgive him....
