I am a musician. I come from a long line of soulaquarians. I will forever embellish my soul with his words, his sweet expressions of poetry. You have enlivened my heart, my soul and my mind. I am ebracing this stimulus readily. Please D forever remain a soul that is free...for you, for us, for we....from your fellow ras/soulaquarian/moon/okayplayer...the embodiment of estrogen power...the light...sunshine...play on, play on.
