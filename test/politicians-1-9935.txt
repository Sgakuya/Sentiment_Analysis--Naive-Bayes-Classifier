For details see George Orwell's "1984" The Bush presidency is really being shaped more by his neo-con cronies than by Bush himself. One can tell in his press conferences or from the debates that he really doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. Its as if everything he tries to say has been coached to him right before he speaks and he's just trying to remember what he was told to say. I think Karl Rove is the primary brain behind the presidency. And this presidency is primarily just a spin machine. Karl Rove's gameplan seems taken directly out of the novel "1984". That novel introduced the idea of "doublethink" which is a mechanism a fascist government uses to foster ignorance and prevent people from being able to recognize clear contradictions, thus allowing for the re-writing of history. Here's a fun game to play. Here are some examples of doublethink that even the most dim-witted should be able to discern as false, yet many folks swallow hook, line and sinker. The game is to determine if the phrase came from the actual book 1984 or from the Bush administration: (Bonus points for naming the speaker.) A. "Significant quantities of uranium from Africa" B. "We've always been at war with Eurasia" C. "I never met John Edwards before this debate" D. "Want some wood!" E. "Those aluminum tubes are really only suited for one purpose. Enriching uranium." F. "War is Peace" G. "Iraq has significantly reconstituted its nuclear weapons program" H. "I'm a uniter not a divider" I. "The vast majority of my tax cuts go to the lower classes" J. "I have never taken steroids" while waving a finger K. "The insurgency is in its last throes" L. "I never claimed there was a connection between 911 and invading Iraq" M. "He's the most brilliant man I ever met" N. "Mission Accomplished" O. "I never downplayed the importance of catching Bin Laden" P. "I will fire anyone who had anything to do with the leak" Q. "When we're talkin' bout wiretaps, were talkin' court order. Nothing has changed." R. "Your doin' a helluva job Brownie" S.
