Hanson's new cd is incredible. It's a whole different style of music than Middle of Nowhere. Its more of a pop rock sound. People need to get over the fact that it's hanson and listen to the album, it speaks for itself. They write all their songs, play instruments and produced the album, they deserve so much credit. The lyrics are well thought out, and people of all ages can relate to them.
