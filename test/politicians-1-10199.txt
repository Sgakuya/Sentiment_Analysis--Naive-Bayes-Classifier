The overwhelming verdict on Bush from this site is that he is, for a number of reasons, one of the worst presidents ever. I couldn't agree more. Although i am not a 'leftie' and know very little about John Kerry, i would be prepared to vote for him despite this lack of knowledge simply because there is no chance that he could ever mess up America(and the world) as badly as Bush has succeeded in doing.
