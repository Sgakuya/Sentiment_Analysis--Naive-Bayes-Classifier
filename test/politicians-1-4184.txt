Mr. Nader's obsessive unwillingness to recognize reality has done this country grave an irreparable damage. I share many of his views on excessive corporate power and the environment, but the way to making changes is not by hurting more little people and setting the environmental movement back years. What he has done in the name of reform, but are really his personal ambitions, is a great disservice to the country.
