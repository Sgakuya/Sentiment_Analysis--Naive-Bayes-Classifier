This album is full of so many memories, for me and for anyone who lived to hear it! I can never get tired of it, any of it! I love every song! From the fun, rockin' Working on the Highway , and I'm Goin' Down , to the inviting and still perfect to blast in the car radio (even after all these years!) Dancing in the Dark and Cover Me , to the slow and meaningful Downbound Train and I'm on Fire . You will love it too, I'm certian! I can't picture life without this cd, and life with it is so awesome! I know I probabaly sound real sentimental, which I guess I am (this is my hometown...) but I can't help but welcome the fun, the romance, and the flat-out amazing E Street Band! This album is a perfect testament to Bruce's Glory Days and due to this album, so many people have been converted into lifelong fans! I know I have, my mom has, and you will too! Just give it a chance, and go into it with the idea that you will love it, and you really will! Swear! (Hint: If you are female, buy the cd (rather than the tape), so as to get the pictures, and you will like the boss even more after seeing them! Cover Me and I'm on Fire!) Sorry! I just happen to think Bruce not only sounded great at this era, but looked hot too! Anyway, no matter what you think of Bruce himself (although will love it even more if you love him) you will at least like this enough to play it again and again and again! Until, of course, you absolutely LOVE it!
