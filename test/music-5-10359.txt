A great mix of songs. The ONLY CD i ever owned on which i like every single track! And you should see Clay perform these songs LIVE ... there is nothing like it. My top favorites are THE WAY, SHINE, TOUCH, WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME, I WILL CARRY YOU and MEASURE OF A MAN. Ballads, thoughtful songs and a bit of angst.
