As a former employee of Blockbuster, I can attest to the fact that employees there get little, if any, real training. The selection of older and foreign films is bad. As for the BB employee comment below... if you don't like dealing with your guests, then you are in the wrong line of work. What is wrong with you? You are the perfect example of what is wrong with Big Blue .
