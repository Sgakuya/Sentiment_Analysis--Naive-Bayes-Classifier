When I think Gray Davis, I think Socialist Democratic Party. This man is so far left that totalitarinism can't be too far behind. Instead of being a man of character and vision he has absconded with the Taxpayers and ratepayers money and is spending it to help the poor electric generators and distributors. We need a strong individual to stand up the this monopoly of power mongers and prosicute them to the fullest extent of the law for their opportunistic preying on the ratepayers of California. The people have the power to change this errant behavior... What if eveyone forgot to pay their power bill next month????? What if we recalled Gray Davis???
