I signed up for A circuit city visa card and had been a customer for about 1 year, on a routine visist to make a payments on the card I had paid 50.00 on my account. Later on a few weeks I recieved a letter in the mail stating that I incured a 35.00 Late charge. Puzzled by this I went in to talk to them about the payment and I eneded up talking to the manager of the store and he found the problem, The 50.00 was put on to someones account. So without hesitation he then put the 50.00 on my account. I then asked what about the 35$ late charge, he began to tell me that it was not his problem. I argued with him for about a half hour and finally gave up. A 35.00 charge and one late payment on my credit history I gave up. And I now rate this the worste of the big time electronic companies. The location this happened at was West Jordan, Utah on Jordan Landing.
