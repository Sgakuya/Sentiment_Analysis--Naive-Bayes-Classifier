Jesse Jackson preaches divisiveness. He was recently quoted as saying revote or revolt in response to the current voting situation in Florida. Today he was quoted as saying that the day George Bush is sworn in we will start de-legitimizing him. In America we have the right to disagree, but this goes beyond disagreement. This is sedition. I wish the media would stop giving him so much air time. He has had his 15 minutes of fame...far more than he deserves for the kind of gospel he preaches.
