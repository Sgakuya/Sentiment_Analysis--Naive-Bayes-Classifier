Cheap imported junk, surly staff and management, unpleasant stores. Good for batteries and small electronic parts. Cannot understand why anyone would every buy equipment there. Why do they keep on asking about my cell phone service? Why do they keep asking for my address on a cash transaction? I know, they don't do that any more, but not because they wanted to stop...and it's still annoying.
