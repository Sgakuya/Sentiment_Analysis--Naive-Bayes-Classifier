There's a story on this album about two friends who fall apart over a shady record contract. Appearances include some familiar names from the Old School: De La Soul, Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Special Ed, Kool Keith, Sadat X, and others (even Chris Rock's got a cameo). Tight production as always by Prince Paul.
