Who does this man think that he is? He is still whining and crying after the American Justice System has provided more leeway to Al Gore than it should have. Instead of supporting the process and showing some dignity, he is trying to incite the masses to riot because he didn't get his way!! Democrats and Republicans should run the other way from Mr. Jackson. Judging from the comments, here the court of public opinion does not hold Mr. Jackson in very high regard.
