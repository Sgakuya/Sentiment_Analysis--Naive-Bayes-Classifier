The only good thing about going to a Cards' game is that it is not hard to find a good seat in the stadium. They are usually empty by half-time. UPDATE: They still have a chance at winnning the division and making the wild card, at 5-9. Something is not right here. UPDATE: They lost to the Seahawks last night, no playoffs for Cardinals, again. UPDATE: I have two members of the Cards on my Fantasy Football Team. Fitzgerald, and the player that has scored most of the teams point so far, Neil Rackers!!!
