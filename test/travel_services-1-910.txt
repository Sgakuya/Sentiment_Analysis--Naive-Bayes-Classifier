The move itself was ok. But the movers scratched the wood floor in my old house. When I filed a damage report, I was told that I would be contacted about it within 48 hours. Nobody ever called. In the last month and a half, I have called them numerous times and spoken with various managers, none of whom have taken responsibility or kept promises to follow up with me.
