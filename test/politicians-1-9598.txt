How did this loser get to #23? I d expect to see him at #42. Remember stagflation (stagnant economic growth, high unemployment and high inflation), hostage crisis and rescue, gas lines, Brother Billy, giving away the Panama Canal, and don t forget (gulp) Amy. I m shaking just remembering this peanut-head.
