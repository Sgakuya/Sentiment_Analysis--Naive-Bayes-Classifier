HE ONLY LIED WHEN HIS LIPS WERE MOVING!! The economy was phony and all the dot coms deflated. Accomplishments? His failed socilization of health care? The bombings that just happened to coincide with his sex scandal? His negotiation of peace in the middle east? His tax increases? His many, many, many social programs that sound great on the stump but fail miserably? The most demoralizing American president of the last 50 years - more harmful than Nixon in many ways.
