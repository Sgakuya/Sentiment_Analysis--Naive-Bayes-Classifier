Hands down, Pink Floyd's best album and one of the most underappreciated albums I've ever heard. Amazing how the band matured in the two-three years after Dark Side of the Moon (I'm realizing more and more what a worthless album that is) and put together this masterpiece of special effects, solid songs and great instrumentation. Only five songs but five great ones at that. Such a beautiful, clean sound on here and song flows into song like nothing else I've ever heard. Listen to it, then listen to it again and you'll understand.
