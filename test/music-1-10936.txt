There maybe no strings attached, but there are many seeds on this record. Those are the seeds of empty talent. Thrown a beat down, have some pretty boys on the mic whether they can actually sing or not (AND THESE GUYS CAN'T AT ALL!), and throw it to the masses that have to be told what is SUPPOSIVELY good. That is the story of this album, and basically anything to come out of the mouths of NSTINK...STANK....STUNK!!!!!
