He was a horrible leader for Russia, true, he did keep democracy (barely) afloat. If he managed the economy of his country better and had kept the 7 billion dollars worth in aid away from Russian bureaucrats, he might have actually done something. His form of democracy was just too liberal, the Russians are a demoralized people, thus they permit political cronisism to occur. He was a leader that could have been great, but he did not capitalize at the historic momement.
