Released in 1978, Van Halen peaked early with the group's self-titled, full-length debut. The band wasn't so pop oriented as they increasingly became with each subsequent release. Van Halen contains some of the band's signature tracks, including Runnin' With The Devil, Ain't Talking 'Bout Love, Jamie's Cryin', and their immortal cover of the Kink's You Really Got Me. There is not a weak song on this release, and it remains enjoyable long after the end of my headbanging days.
