D'Angelo is an artist who emcompasses what music is and should be about. In this age of materialistic commercialism he focuses on issues that are real and truthful. His music is both recorded and played live. Not many artists these days have the talent to work with other musicians. Most music is highly synthesized and artificial. He continues to be a presence that both influences and changes the music industry. Like the some of the artists before him Hendrix, Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone and some of the musicians who are influential today Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu..he has stretched and redefined the boundaries of music.
