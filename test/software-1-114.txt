This Activation feature (?) is a disaster. After buying and installing and registering both TurboTax Deluxe and the TT State programs, the program determines that I am using a demo version and wants me to Activate for $39.95. Help has me reinstalling several times with no luck. I am going to try for a refund and buy Taxcut.
