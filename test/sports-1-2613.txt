He may dominate the NL during the season but during after September, I think he must forget to spit out the bones when he eats chicken wings because he, along with the team, chokes. True, he's had 12 quality playoff-bound seasons to how many World Series wins? one (vs. Indians '95). That's truly pathetic!!! Bobby, if you keep taking the Braves to the playoffs, start managing with your head out of your ass and stop letting down your fans, otherwise you and your team will always be the comic relief team and provide laughs for me during October.
