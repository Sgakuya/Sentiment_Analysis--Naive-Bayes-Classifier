Hanson has done such a great job maturing and perfecting their sound. I absolutely love the new CD, and I find the songs much more rock n' roll. They have done a wonderful job putting together the whole album. The songs have a bit more edge to it, and I think it's just great!!! I hope they keep up the superb work!!!
