He's bringing down the good name of the Israeli people throughout the world. Israel these days is unfortunately kind of like south africa was 15 years ago(more violent though). A large portion of the population have no rights , suppressed by the masses. They obviously rebel, and are quashed with hugh force, they get angrier and keep on rebelling, carrying out horrible atrocities. Squashed again, they get ever more angrier and its now chaos. Sharon has a lot to answer for, so does arafat, but sharon seems to have a carte blanche to do whatever he pleases. He can kill anyone, the world is outraged, and bush says nothing...even supports him. International law has been violated too many times by these fiends.
