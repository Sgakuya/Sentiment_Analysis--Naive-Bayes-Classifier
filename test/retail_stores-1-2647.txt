KROGER SUCKS!!! I worked as a management trainee for them for three months. It was the worst time of my life. I went to work everyday depressed and left work feeling as if I accomplished nothing. This was despite putting my best effort forward all the time. I was fired despite the fact I did everything I was asked. Even though I made some friends while working for Kroger, I wish the company nothing but ill-will. I especially wish ill-will to my zone HR coordinators and the management at one of the store at which I trained (which shall remain nameless due to me being classier than them). These people are conniving suck-ups who told half-truths about me and stressed my weaknesses much more than my strengths when talking to high executives. I'm not even going to shop at any Kroger stores; I hate the company so much, I'd actually rather shop at crappy Wal-Mart. Barney Kroger is turning in his grave. I'll say it again...KROGER SUCKS!!!
