Even better than their superb debut effort. Great singing and guitar playing, fine songs. "Almost Cut My Hair" is tremendous, "Country Girl" is a magnus opus, "Everybody I Love You," is one of the most joyous rock songs ever recorded. Amazing that a band so overloaded with talent could get anything done, much less something as truly accomplished as this.
