*barfs all over her own shoes* Avril Lavigne is a hypocritical piece of pop music. He rband should get a new singer, someone nice and beautiful and smart and TALENTED WHO ACTUALLY WRITES AMAZING THINGS, and become a band!!! They could be something if they ditch the whiney, stright haired, pop singing, talented poser that is Avril Lavigne. Want amazing lyrics written by the people who sing the song,play the music for it? Lyrics that are so amazing I can't get their cds out of my player? Try No Doubt. Gwen, Tony, Adrian, and Tom. Not Gwen Stefani, single artist. No Doubt. Soooooo much better.
