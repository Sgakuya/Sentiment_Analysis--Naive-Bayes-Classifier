I took a job as a Tech. Manager at Chuckie E. Cheeses, hoping for a nice quite job, what the hell happened? With in the first weeks of this job, I got the flu, momo, and a server staph infection. The workers comp lady came to see me in the hospital and ask me very personal questions, like what I did in the military and was I sexual active, and how old was my son? I did some checking and these restaurants have been sighted for many, many health violations. I did not have ax to grind with the Chuck but when the GM came in and said to a cast member how had acne bad, you need to shave! I went off! The GM told me that nice guys finish last, and this is a place to take the kids? Go ahead violate the I-9 forms, while the real Americans stand in line at the employment office. I use to take my son to the chuck and cut him loose, now, Oh no; we will go to the park, fly a kit before I take him the cesspool of bacteria/virus at the Chuckie.
