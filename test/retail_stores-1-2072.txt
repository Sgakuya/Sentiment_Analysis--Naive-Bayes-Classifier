I called the customer service number and talked to the nice lady in India to have my 50 projection TV serviced. The service technician arrived, determined the part that needed to be replaced then returned the next week to install it. During the process of installing the repair part, the technician blew out two previously operational parts (his admission). He said he would order the parts and come back in 3-4 weeks. I then called and emailed customer service stating that I wanted the set replaced or repaired immediately since they had damaged it. They won't return my calls or emails now.
