Perhaps the greatest ever Terrorist leader of a Terrorist state. By butchering hundreds if not thousands of Palestinian men women and children (remember Jenin) how can this man of this state be anything else. A common defence for Isreali's (not all however) is to accuse people like myself of anti-semitism. That is an over used and extremelt transparent ploy. I have no grudge against anyones religion and they should be free to practice whatever religion they desire. However, what I do have a grudge against is Isreal's occuption of the Palestine, its continued land grabbing, its breach of the peace process and the dialy slaughter of men, women and children who have been branded terrorists by terrorists. If these people are willing to blow themselves up, please try to consider how desperate they are if they have to go this far. Isreal is becoming increasing alienated exceppt to the Americans and we all know why that is (the Jewish lobbey on Capital Hill - again this is no slur against Judism, but merely the facts) I far one look forward to Sharons downfall and the liberation of the Palistinian people.
