Let me start with the fact that the only time I have never been more angry was when I had a complaint about a Pizza Hut that was never resolved. I finally dropped it. This time I will not. Tonight at at or about 7:00 pm I ordered a festive combo from KFC on the cornor of hwy 2 and liverpool RD. I and waited.... and waited. at 8:00 it showed up, it looked like it had been draged through a mud puddle. The fries were so soggy that they literally had started to resemble the shape of worms in a box. To top it all off there was supposed to be turtles or something, they were just not there. At 8:00 I called customer service. They did not apologise in any way and said that they would have the order redone imeditally and a replacement would arrive at no extra charge shortly. I was also instructed that I was to check it while the driver was here, if it was unsatisfactory they would refund my money. At 9:00 now suffering from uncontrolable rage from hunger I call looking for my food. While I was on the phone with the CSR. the delivery guy arrives. I hang up with the CSR. Answer the door. The delivery guy hands me two bags. One containing my order and one containing turtles. Opon inspection of the fries they are once again room temputure and soggy. It was no better than before, only...... the chicken was under cooked! I tell the driver this is unacceptable and request the refund. He refuses and says he has no refund, and if I wanted a refund I was to call Customer service. I call costomer service they give me the store's phone number suggesting I call them to rectify the problem. I call the store. Request the manager explain to him my displeasure in my experience tonight. He tells me that the Meal was fresh cooked and that soggy fries are normal. every one gets soggy fries. and uses an attitude with me like my complaint is not valid. Later in the conversation He said what do you expect me to do about it The KFC I am speeking about is less then four minutes away from my house! Eventully the Assistant manager who I was speaking to informed me that he would refund my money. I personally when to the store to collect my refund. and return the disqusting slop that the assistant manager called normal food. It was less than 4 minutes away. Opon arrival he refunded my money, still no apology. When leaving the store. He said only Have a nice night. When I arrived at home I called cutomers service back. the CSR I spoke to supervisor level, informed me that soggy fries were not normal and they will file a complaint about it. I told the CSR that was unaceptable, he recomended that I should contact the KFC head office. I do not find this as an acceptable resolution. I want a follow up. I want to know what is being done to resolve the future abuse I will take from KFC if I choose to purchase from them again. I want to be informed of any diceplinary action that is taken. So far I my most recent business tranaction with you has cost me one evening without food (the assistant manager got me so upset I was nasius), 2.5 hours of my life (waiting for food to show), and a five dollar tip. I want it all back! Espically the now 3 hours of my life! I will keep a tally on the loss of life spent looking for a resolution. and will be looking for that too.
