I just saw an interview on the news with 6 people they just pulled off the street , 4 out of the 6 were black. (Thats funny when only 14 percent of the population is black) The purpose of the interview was to ask these everyday people what they thought about the latest Jesse Jackson news. It made me sick when the people started saying they thought this was good because he is being such a responible person by paying child support and by letting us know up front. LETTING US KNOW UP FRONT? Do they not realize that the baby is 20 MONTHS OLD? For almost 2 years this has been a secret. What a great role model for America today.
