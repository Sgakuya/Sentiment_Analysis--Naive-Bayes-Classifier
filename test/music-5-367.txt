Truly a work of art, O.K Computer will be talked about for generations beyond Radiohead's existence as a band. I twill become the 'Nevermind' of the new millenium. I didn't think Paranoid Android could get any better, until I saw them peform it live in Manchester last year. That memory will be with me for the rest of my life. To all fans who haven't heard either Lewis Mistreated, or Talk Show Host- both B-Sides- grab a listen as soon as you can. Only a band like Radiohead could have B-Sides that good.
