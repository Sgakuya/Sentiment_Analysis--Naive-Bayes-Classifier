I just got this album a couple of days ago and I really like it. I bought this CD because I heard it was a good one from friends and I have been wanting to expand my horizons of music. So, Amazon delievered. I have had it in the CD player since I got it. It is so good. I have listened to it while working on my computer, making dinner and even reading. It fits every mood. It surprised me when I heard it, that I knew a lot of songs already, I just never knew that they were by Radiohead. I am looking forward to really getting to know this album as well as getting other Radiohead stuff.
