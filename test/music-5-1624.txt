A second smash album from Coldplay (the first being Parachutes) Beautiful lyrics (for example Warning Sign 'Come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in, I've got to tell you in my loudest tone, I started looking for a warning sign, and the truth is - I miss you, I miss you so') which is where you get a haunting guitar and cello creeping in. If you think that Coldplay lack emotion, listen again. Their songs are wistful, longing, upset and highly emotional. Best times to listen to them is when you want to chill out or you feel upset about something and you need to let it out. They are just simply beautiful and its definately worth having in your music collection.
