The kmart near my home is the pits! Merchandise is always scrambled about. Lights need to be replaced. Rudeness by the staff is the norm. The other day I was trying to get some paint mixed and I stopped a young man with a kmart vest in the area of the paint and asked him if he could help me. He unzipped his pants and started stroking himself! (He was well endowed, though.)
