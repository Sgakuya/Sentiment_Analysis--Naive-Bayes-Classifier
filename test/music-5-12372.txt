I would like to say that Jagged Edge, has really stepped up and taken over in the 2000. R B male groups really fell off after Jodeci and Dru-Hill seperated but JE has restored my faith. This cd is always in my cd player in the house and car and I have it downloaded to my pc so i can listen at work. I will continue to be a fan and can't wait untill the next release.
