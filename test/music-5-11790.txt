OKay! i just wanna say that GOOD CHARLOTTE ROCKS!!!!!! no matter what people say, they are DEFFINATELY PUNK ROCK!!! i dont know why people say they are not punk! i must admit that them being on the radio does not make me too happy, but what the hell, they are getting fame (not what they want by the way) but i was a fan BEFORE they were famous and shoved into the pop/punk genre, but that wasn't their fault! i hate people that think that the only real punk is the crappy, whiny, badly mixed and poorly recorded losers singing lyrics you can't even hear becuase they SUCK!!! good charlotte is not pop, and they are the best band in the world! i love benji! his hair is amazing! and if they ever need a groupie...I AM WAITING!!!
