There's just one word needed to sum up the British monarchy. 'Pointless'. You hear people saying ..'but they're good for tourism'. a. this isnt true. surveys done by the English Tourist Board and other organisations show that this factor is quite low down on reasons for people visiting the UK. The only 'foreigners' with any real interest in the royals are sentimental Americans over 60 and of British ancestry. Most other foreigners' interest is purely prurient. b. if it were true, that puts them on a par with Disneyland and Alton Towers. As for prince William, do women really think he's handsome, or is it a bunch of sad teenies looking for an alternative to Westlife?
