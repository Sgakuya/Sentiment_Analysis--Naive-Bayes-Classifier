Against the kansas city chiefs Big Bad Bonehead Tom had 4 interceptions!!!! He won superbowls only because of Charlie Weis. Tom Brady sucks!!!! He is a complete and total idiot. And by the way, fans who come to an opposing team's stadium "Shut The $%#@ Up and Just Watch the Game." Some stupid Patriots fan started trash talking about Tom Brady and how he won 3 superbowls even though he just threw 4, yes 4 interceptions that day. By the end of the game this guy almost got thrown off the top of the stadium!!! If you come to our stadium, IN KANSAS CITY, DONT CHEER FOR YOUR TEAM, JUST SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!
