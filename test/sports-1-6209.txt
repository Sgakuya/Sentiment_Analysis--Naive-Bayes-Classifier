WHAT A JOKE THE ILLINI TEAM IS. The reason they got a better record then Carolina is because they didn't play anyone hard. What a joke the big 10 is. Thy lost to Ohio State, sure shows they couldn't be a contendar to my tar heels. Carolina actually played good teams, like Duke, even though I hate duke they had a desent record. Oh ya, and they won the NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. I must say that I kinda like Dee Brown, but he is definetly not ever going to be as good as Ray, he is NUMBER ONE!
