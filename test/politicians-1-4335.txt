A hypocrite of monumental proportions! To hear Joe Lieberman invoke the Will of God makes me sick. Here is a man who supports the continuing holocaust of abortion, yet tries to pass himself off as some sort of latter day prophet. Last time I checked, God was strongly pro-life, and frowned upon the murder of the innocent. I don't think treating God as nothing more than a political whore/election ploy will help Mr. Lieberman get through the pearly gates.
