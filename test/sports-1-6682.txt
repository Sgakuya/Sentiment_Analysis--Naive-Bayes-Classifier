I think Phil Jackson is the biggest hypocrite I have ever seen. First he makes outrageous comments about how the Kings's luggage should be sniffed by dogs at the airport, and then I find out he's done shrooms and pot. He is a better name-caller than a coach if you ask me. hopefully he, Bryant, and that huge tub of lard Shaq will go away soon. Sacramento 4-ever!
