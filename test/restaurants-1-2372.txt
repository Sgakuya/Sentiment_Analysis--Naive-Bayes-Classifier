Today being the 8th of Oct.2005,my husband and I decided to go to JIB for a ciabatta burger,(which is the best burger we have ever tasted.)Our complaint isn't about the food or cost,it's management.We arrived around 4:00 pm,ordered,and sat down,there were several very young,loud,and unruly children in the very small resturant,turns out they belonged to one of the employees on duty trying to work and mind the little darlings,as they fought yelled and screamed at each other,she eventually took one of them to the restroom and proceeded to dust his britches rather loudly,but by that time the damage was done and our meal was ruined by the disturbance.Our second complaint is if you don't eat fast,the flies eat it for you.One employee was on her cell phone talking so loud we couldn't hear our on conversation.Please help, we don't want to stop going there,but the shop needs responsible help.Plus we like the food.JIB #741 ph.#940-665-2911.
