Don't volunteer to give up your seat on an overbooked flight when US Airways offers their worthless free flight vouchers in exchange. To begin with, they only have a few seats set aside in each plane for these vouchers, so you're likely not to even be able to use the voucher before it expires within one year. And if you do plan your trip well in advance, they purposely make obtaining the ticket extremely inconvenient by requiring you to physically go down to the airport to pick up the ticket ten days before your flight leaves. And then you won't actually know if they've made changes to your reservation until you get there. I had the extremely unpleasant experience of going down to the airport to pick up my ticket to find out that the reservation I had confirmed a month in advance was somehow changed to a different returning flight. They insisted that I had confirmed a flight I've never even heard of (how can I confirm a flight I don't know even exists?)and did nothing to alleviate their mistake. They have several seats still physically available on the plane but refused to give me one of those seats because they were not one of free voucher seats although they had made a mistake. Terrible customer service. Worthless voucher. Fly JEt Blue.
