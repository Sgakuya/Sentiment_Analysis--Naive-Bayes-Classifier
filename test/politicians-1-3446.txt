And did I forget to mention that he has mental capacity of a six year old and only got into Yale and Harvard because of his rich and powerful daddy. Oh, and did I also forget to mention that for the first year he was in office he was on vacation for 40% of that time, and that the the first four years (or only for his dad) that Clinton, Reagan and Bush Sr. were in office they had about 3X as many press confrences as ol' W has had in his first (and hopefully last) four years... man, don't even get me stared on Iraq, his mini Vietnam, his little divert-attention away-from-the-fact-that-we-couldn't get-Bin-Laden-while-simultaneously finishing-my-Daddy's-war-and-getting revenge-for-him-while-also-getting lucrative-oil-contracts-for-all-my rich-buddies war. God! tax cuts for the wealthy, The cutting of veterans benefits...the list goes on! The only thing worse for this country than George W. Bush would be to elect Sean Hannity into public office...
