I think I was in eighth grade when I discovered this LP in my parent's record collection. As I listened to the first few bars of Box of Rain amid the vinyl crackling and inexplicable buzzing of the old turntable, I knew that this album was special. The folksy Americana portrayed in its honest, inspirational tunes left me with a warm feeling, like I had just been given a special musical gift. I know this may sound cheesy, but the album really has that kind of an effect! While listening to Ripple I could understand why their generation seemed so optimistic about creating world peace and changing the world. Sometimes I wish that my generation had more music like this, with this sort of message (although it's awfully idealistic and I guess not very realistic.)
