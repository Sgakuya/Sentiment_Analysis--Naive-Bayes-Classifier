the guy's better than a one, but i gotta bump him down a little. he got to where he is in yardage by consistency and time, not by talent. while he is good, he doesn't have that break away ability or agility that some of the greats, like Sanders, had. Somebody said, he cant' go 80 yards in one attempt, but he can go for 40 twice . for me, that doesn't cut it.
