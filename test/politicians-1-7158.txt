Jesse Jackson can claim to be a Reverend but he had better wipe the dust off his Bible and review the word of God. He does more to hinder race relations than help it. He had no business in the middle of the presidential vote in Florida encouraging demonstrations and saying there was a racist overtone to the vote. He also is pro-abortion. A travesty for any man of God to to be in favor of killing the unborn babies!
