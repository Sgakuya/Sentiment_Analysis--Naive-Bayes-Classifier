Davis came out with a big pat on his back statement about what he has done to avert the energy crisis facing California, but the only one that believes it is himself. He knows that the only solution is to take back the power plants that PG E and SDGE were forced to sell to Duke Power and Enron. That is the only way that the price gouging can be stopped because Duke and Enron have no vested interest in Califoria they are here to drain the money out of the state. They have found a gold mine and they are not going to stop until it is dry. Californians are going to be faced with 400 and 500 dollar power bills because Duke and Enron are producing power for 4 cents a Kilowatt hour and selling it for $1.41 a kilowatt because they are deregulated. If Davis does not take back the plants any solution he says he comes up with is nothing but a band aid on slit artery.
