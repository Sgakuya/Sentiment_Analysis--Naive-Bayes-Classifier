There is not enough info here to tell which greatest hits album this is referring to, so I will take it as the original Columbia records greatest hits from the '70's which is what garnered the 5-star rating. The songs range from the heart-felt What's Your Mama's Name? to the gut-wrenching Blood Red and Going Down. Considering these songs were recorded by an under-aged tot like Tanya was then, they are unbelievable. Even as an adult, she can still mow down the compition with her voice. Anyone being critical of this album just isn't a true country music fan.... or a music fan at all for that matter.
