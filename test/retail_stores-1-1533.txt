I could go on and on about how much I hate shopping at The Bay but I'll try and keep it short. Today, I tried to purchase a pair of Levi's jeans in the men's section only to be left wandering around the area looking for an associate to take my purchase. After waiting at the checkout counter for about ten minutes two associates came to the counter. Finally! I thought, someone had come to take my purchase. Instead, one of the employees was making a purchase of his own before he took his break and the other bozo ignored me. Afterwards, the associate who stayed behind told me the counter was closed and to wait in line at another counter where he could help me. OK! I thought, maybe we're finally getting somwhere! When I got to the other counter though, there were a bunch of other employees carousing and taking their time while customers stood waiting in line. The associate who said he would assist me then stopped to join in and chat with his co-worker buddies forgetting about me. Exasperated, I threw the pair of jeans into the air and stormed out the store. It was only when I made a scene that I was finally noticed as I walked away. Too little, too late. I will not shop at The Bay in the future based on this experience! I will take my business to Sears and Eatons instead.
