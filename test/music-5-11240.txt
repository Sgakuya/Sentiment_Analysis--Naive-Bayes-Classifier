Now unlike some people I'm going to rate just this album-not whether she's skanky or beautiful. When this is compared to her first album and other teen pop fare, this is a huge departure. Her own songwriting turns out to be quite talented. Her songs are real and emotional. Her voice is always where it should be and every song is made to fit it. She has proven wiht this album that she has the talent of a so called diva and no matter what her appearance or attitude, Stripped is a pop triumph.
