There's something cursed about the city of San Diego, CA and any sports team affiliated with them. It's taken me most of my life to realize it but it's true. I gave up the San Diego Chargers as my fav. NFL team in '96 and the Padres this year. Not all because of the past failures but there's just something about the community and the owners of their teams, the athletes they sign that I can't put a finger on that bothers me. They're losers; they're morons. I get that impression from the actual citizens every time I visit San Diego. Don't get me wrong, I love the climate and scenery of San Diego. The weather is the most perfect in the world. But there's something about the people of the community that comes across as fake or amateur or stupid. Maybe there's no adjective to describe it. No real culture or pride in the city, either. The people are just kind of stupid, just... there. And so are athletes and owners of San Diegan teams. No, I'm not delusional or paranoid. This is real.
