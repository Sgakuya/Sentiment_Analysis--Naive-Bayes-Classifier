I'll never forgive Whitney Houston for kicking the crap out of what was, in the hands of Dolly Parton, one of the all-time most touching songs, I Will Always Love You. Whitney takes all of Dolly's heart of out of it, and slams it home like its a gymnastics routine -- entirely missing the point. Awful.
