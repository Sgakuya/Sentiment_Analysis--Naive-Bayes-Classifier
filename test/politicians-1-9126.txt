What did Clinton do? He inherited an economy that was growing before he became President. He gave us the largest tax increase in history and raised taxes where we pay the largest percentage of our incomes to the Government in history. He also raised taxes on the middle class, not the very wealthy . The top 2% have gotten richer faster under Clinton than they did under Reagan and Bush put together. This man also has done more to divide our country than anyone ever has. He has initiated class warfare, racial discord and divided us along lines of sexual orientation, gender and religious beliefs. How anyone can honestly say that he is a great President is beyond me. Reagan turned the economy around, ended the cold war and made us feel proud as Americans again. Even Bill Clinton pointed out that our current economic boom would not have been possible without the Reagan era. To those who think that the next President doesn't have the authority to lead because he didn't get a majority, remember that Bill Clinton never won by a majority. The first election, only 43% voted for him (57% voted against him) and we heard nothing except that he has a mandate to lead. In the second election he got 49%. Where was the outcry about no mandate then? The only reason why he got one star was because the rating doesn't go any lower.
