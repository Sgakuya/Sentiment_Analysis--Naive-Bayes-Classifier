I had some problems with my engagement ring which was purchased at Chapel Hill mall, Akron. The employees at the store over about ten attempts to size my ring, returned the ring pitted and dented, with a loose center stone and the side stones easily fell out. Two days after my engagement, the side diamonds fell out in front of my co-workers. How embarrassing is that? The ring was an expensive ring! I was going to tell my extended family about the engagement when they came in from out of town. That was in July. Every time I wanted to tell my extended family my news, the ring was in for repair. I wanted to keep within tradition by sharing the news of my engagement and showing my ring. I finally told them the news on Christmas Eve which was 5 months later. During the five months, the people that knew of my engagement were joking about whether we were still engaged or if it was called off. In December, the work on the ring was completed and even though I was still unhappy with the quality of work on the ring, I accepted it in order to show my extended family. I believe the main problem Kay Jewelers has is that they are unable to custom design a ring without serious problems, wasting your time, not informing customers beforehand of the problems that could arise with a custom design ring. Has anyone else experienced similiar problems at Chapel Hill or other stores?
