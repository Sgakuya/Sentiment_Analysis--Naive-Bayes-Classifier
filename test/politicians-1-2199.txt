Though I am not a NJ resident, I am following this guy's story. I believe that his sexual preference is NOT the issue; I think he is resigning, instead, due to scandals yet to unfold. This convenient distraction (for liberals who would like to pound on the gay issue) may just backfire. Time will tell.
