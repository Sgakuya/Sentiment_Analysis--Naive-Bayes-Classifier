Whatever Maynard touches, gold soon appears. Which is not to in any way emasculate the contributions of the rest of the band: The whole album is just enough of a departure from tool to be a wonderful creative entity in its own right but carries the same trademark genius of sweeping emotion and lyrical prowess. What a JOY!!!
