Hillary Clinton has assaulted the body politic -- in Arkansas for 16 years and in the country as a whole for 8 years. Now she wants to extend Clintonism via a run for the Senate in a state in which she has never lived, never paid taxes, never voted, and never paid taxes until the past 2 months. What gall! Of course, she's a great commodities speculator... and one of the country's greatest lawyers (except she's about to lose her license in Arkansas). Very well qualified to represent the great state of New York!
