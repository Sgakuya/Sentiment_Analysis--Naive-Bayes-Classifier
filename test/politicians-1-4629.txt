Dick Cheney is a shame to the office and to all Americans. During the debate in Cleveland last night, Cheney used much of his time defending Haliburton. Is he Vice President of the most powerful nation on earth, or CEO of Haliburton. Furthermore, even the appearance of impropriety is unbecoming of a man in his position. His allegiance to Haliburton belies his claim that he does not have a conflict of interest. The state of the economy, the high rate of employment, and the decapitations which infiltrate televisions all over this globe speak for themselves. It is time for a new administration, one which values the lives of the people of this nation and not oil. This adminsitration has been a travesty. I only hope that Americans can open their eyes and stop claiming allegiance to political parties. We are all Americans, and we should feel for the families who have had to bury their young.
