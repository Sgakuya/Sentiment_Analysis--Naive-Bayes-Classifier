Former education secretary and "drug czar." This guy is a self-righteous, condescending, pompous, blowhard - and would be bully who thinks HE knows what's best for you. Would assign us all tracking numbers instead of names if he could. Not a good listener either, he always disrupts opponents on talk shows. He looks like an angry boar too. In a past life, he was probably a Nazi prison warden. Lately known for making positively charming remarks about African-Americans. A sinister force in the Republican Party. Intelligent, but sinister.
