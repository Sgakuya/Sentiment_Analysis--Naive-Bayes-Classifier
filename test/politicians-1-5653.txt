She's got the personality of a dried up wrinkled old prune. By no means do I approve of all the things her husband did, but to be married to her, it must have made something snap inside him. She's one of these women who think the whole world ought to be run by her set of rules and standards. She's totally arrogant, and it seems like she looks at everyone else as if they're peons or something.
