After tasting Cold Stone and thinking it tasted waxy, didn't taste that good, and was expensive, I didn't understand what all of the fuss was about. Then I tasted Marble Slab and was blown away. I talked with the owner and found out that it was 100% natural with no additives or preservatives. If you like thick, creamy ice cream with not a lot of add ins that hides the taste like Cold Stone, then in my opinion, Marble Slab is the best pure ice cream that I have tasted except for Giardelli Chocolate Factory in San Francisco. Cold Stone can keep there off key singing.
