My camera got stolen out of my bag, and they took no responsibility, even though the gatwick police sized crates upon crates of stolen good from their baggage handlers. I was unfortunate, my camera was expensive, and they sold it off before the police got them. Additionaly the people i dealt with were rude, the food was aweful and there was not enough room on the plane for an average size adult. I will never fly british airways again.
