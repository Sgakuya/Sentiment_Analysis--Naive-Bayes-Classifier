Jesse Jackson got on TV and asked all the people to forgive him. Why should I forgive him? He didn't do anything evil to me. Maybe he should ask his illegitimate daughter for forgivewness, and in the process tell her why he sent her off with her mother to live in California where she would be 3000 miles away from her dad.
