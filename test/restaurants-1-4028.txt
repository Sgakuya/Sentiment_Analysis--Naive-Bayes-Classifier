Quite possibly the worst Italian chain restaurant in the US. HOW CAN YOU BURN MARINARA SAUCE?! Well, BdB managed, and since it's served on everything they offer, all of our food was rendered inedible. Combine awful food with the tacky TGI Friday's-style decor and the loud music, and you have a place I won't visit again.
