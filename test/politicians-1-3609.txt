Murderer(is death penalty anything else than a murder?), polluter (and corrupt for that purpose). And really unable to have a correct foreign policy: he's ignorant (remember the Grecians ?!), and wants to impose the views of half of the 5% of US citizens to the other 95% of humans in the world. His views? Missile views, that is war with China, Russia, Europe, Brazil, everybody sooner or later. A word about China: with Bush, the US behave the same: massive death penalty, corrupt capitalism, pathologically self-centered views about the rest of the world. Just a few hundreds of Floridians, to hurt 6 billion people: TOO BAD!
