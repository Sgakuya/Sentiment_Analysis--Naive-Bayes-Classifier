You know something's terribly wrong when you see a bunch of grown men dancing around like a bunch of pansies in their videos on stage! I mean, come on, no respectable artist has choreographed moves. I've never seen Pearl Jam or Korn or Red Hot Chili Peppers get up do some gay dance moves all at the same time. BSB is a HUGE joke!
