Released in 1969, Abbey Road was the Beatles at their best and was the last to be recorded (though Let It Be was released afterwards). Abbey Road flows nicely, and if one only owns one release by the Beatles, this is the one, plus one gets a picture of barefooted McCartney on the cover. The release has a relatively strong Harrison influence with Something and Here Comes The Sun as well as some signature Beatles tunes: Come Together, Oh! Darling, and I Want You (She's So Heavy). As others have noted, the release ends with a medley of sorts including You Never Give Me Your Money, She Came In Through The Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, and Carry That Weight which is probably the most enjoyable portion of the LP.
