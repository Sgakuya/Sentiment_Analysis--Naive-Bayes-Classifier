I could not believe it, but it is true: Cuba has better health care than Sweden! Is this something to be proud of? So a lot of people starve, get sick, get beaten or (almost) killed when trying to escape and who can easily cure them? The fantastic health care. How about trying to get less people cured from diseases they should not have had in the first place and start finding a remedy for the terrible position this country is in?
