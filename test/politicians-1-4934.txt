This man continually uses fear, unreasonable fear to get attention. For 8 plus years, he has said NOTHING about energy, especailly with the former man in the white house. NOW, he wants to blame Bush for California's energy problems? I don't think so, they REFUSED to build any power plants for their own people!!!!! The greenies refused to support real human beings, and now they wish to blame Bush? Get a life, stop reading Gore's Earth in the Balance because California is starting to LIVE it!!! These people don't care about people other than themselves and the stupid owls and sucker fish. Let them fix their own problems, but leave the rest of us out of their stupid animal plans! They could all go and live with Redford, on HIS massive property, and maybe they could learn that humans do count! What a bunch of idiots!
