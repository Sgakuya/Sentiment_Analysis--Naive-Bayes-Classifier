I love my Huskers and I do not want to see Nebraska's coach rated last, but Solich has to go. A team that won 3 national championships in the 90's is now not even a Top 25 team. Hmmm coincidence? And to all the goody-goody fans who say oh everybody's gonna have a bad year once in a while and you have to stick by your team, I am sticking with the team , just not the coach. Things have goten progressively worse since Doctor Tom left and it is more than just a bad year . Get someone with some fire, coaching ability, recruiting prowess, and let him lead that Huskers back to where they should be, on top of the football world!!!
