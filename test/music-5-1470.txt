Along with REM, U2 was the best band of the late 80s and early 90s. I remember being in junior high school (might have been 1985) when someone gave me a tape with War on one side and Unforgettable Fire on the other. I listened to that tape non-stop during an amazing train ride through the Canadian Rockies, and now whenever I hear a song from either CD it takes me right back to that trip. I'm sick of the song Pride, but the other, lesser-known songs on Unforgettable Fire are classics. This is one of the three or four best U2 CDs, along with War, Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.
