Yo Red-dog, I'm feelin you. This kid sucks but somehow everyone loves him. I think all of his tracks are whack and he's got to get over the Tupac image and come original. I wrote about how I really feel about this crap that he's selling to the people that got fooled into thinking that this fake thug is an artist, but it had too much profanity so they didn't post it. Red dog, stay real and don't fall into this fake gangsta stage that rap is going through, thats all I got to say. STOP SUPPORTING THIS FAKE
