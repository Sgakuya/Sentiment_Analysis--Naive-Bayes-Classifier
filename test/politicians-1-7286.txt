I am shocked at Jesse Jackson in front of the US supreme court today, stating there would be a civil rights explosion if they vote for Bush!! Exactly what was his intent? Does he want violence on behalf of Al Gorf? Can and will Jesse and others like him be held legally responsible to victims of violence at the request and statements of these men . Its too bad this guy doesnt use his brain for better things than inciting violence and encouraging racial bigotry.
