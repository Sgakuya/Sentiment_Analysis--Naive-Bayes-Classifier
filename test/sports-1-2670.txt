Joe torre is only a good manager when he has players that are good but he is a dumb bastard when nobody is performing. How do you take clemens out of the game after 82 pitches and a 3 hitter. Joe Torre should be ashamed of himself he can only manage the best team in baseball he is like phil jackson but if you not the clear best they both suck.
