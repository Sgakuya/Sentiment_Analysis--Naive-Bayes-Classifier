How can anyone give this less than 5 stars! I'm ashamed of you! This is an AMAZING collection of music, the Boss is hotter than heck, and it is one hundred percent perfect! Every song brings back great memories, and every second you stare at that gorgeous cover you find yourself just lost in those beautiful eyes! Sigh. Bruce is my honey!
