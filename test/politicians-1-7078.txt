God said...Beware for false profits who caim to speak my word...for they are among you. I thik that Jesse Jackson is a false profit...not only because of him fathering a child outside of marriage ( which a minister's DO know the commandments )but it deals dividing people for his own gains. Jakson threatens the race card for his own gains, which really damns the real racism problems in our land. Martin Luther King was a profit...Jesse Jackson is not... I live is Selma, Alabama and he has done Nothing. He makes speeches on fighting or us and insists on big money for speaking or he won't show. So as for me...I think he needs to evaluate his own soul...and realize that the type of demonizing of morals of others today does not help...because in today's world our OWN people are holding OURSELVES back!!! We need to come to grips with the facts... The truth WILL set you free. God will judge. Jesse Jackson has been juding others ALL his life.
