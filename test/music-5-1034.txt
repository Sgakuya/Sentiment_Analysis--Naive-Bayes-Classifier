I've been an avid Dido fan since the first season of Roswell finished. Here with me will always have a feeling of Nostalgia for me, I love her soft voice and great lyrics. Christmas day on the platinum christmas is by far the best christmas song, and some of the best music on this CD is the non-mainstream ones like, Isobel, Hunter, Take my Hand, and the best one is the concert one don't leave home!
