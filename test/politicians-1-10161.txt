O.K., where to start. First, for you idiots who explain away our currently poor economy on the so called declining economy he inherited that's bull and you know it, you just fell for the lies hook line an sinker and are just another one of the herd. In fact when Bill Clinton left office our economy was stronger then it had ever been, with the DOW well over 10,000, an extremely low unemployment rate, and 1.9 trillion in excess government funds ( no defecit, unlike the one we have now which is the largest one ever). So what did Dubya do with 1.9 trillion? Gave back to everyone $350, what am I gonna do with $350. Next lets talk about the biggest Travesty of all, the so called war in Iraq, I still have yet to recieve a solid explanation for why we are there, every one Dubya gave us has been proved false, and don't try an tell me they haven't, read the 9/11 Commission report, republicans have very selective hearing when it comes to that book. I saw a great bumper sticker the other day When Clinton Lied, No One Died, aint that the truth. And whatever happened to Osama Bin Laden, as soon as Dubya got what he wanted (Saddam and his Oil) we haven't heard hide nor hair of the hunt for Bin Laden, and we have next to no troops currently in Afaganistan searching for him. They are all in Iraq protecting Haliburton Oil convoys and getting paid less then the truck drivers. It's a crime and an absolute shame what happens over there. If I could put zero stars up there I would, and you don't know how much I wish there were negative stars for me to use. And for you Dubya lovers out there, answer me this. Why is he the 3rd worst president on this ranking chart? Only behind Herbert Hoover and Nixon. He sucks, get him out, anyone is better.
