Perhaps the best album in terms of solid hit after hit. As debuts go, the Boston quint may have actually outdid Boston. Though I found it too quirky at first, once I really listened to their songs, I was a Cars fan forever. The summer of 1979 was around the prime of my life and I could hear those great tracks like Best Friends Girlfriend and Good Times Roll spilling out of jukeboxes from Smokey Joe's Cafe in West Philly to the infamous Shamrock's in Wildwood NJ. (I remember sucking face with some skank in Shamrock's while Just What I Needed was blaring at last call). The only track that was borderline throwaway was I'm in Touch With Your World (the flipside to Best Friends Girlfriend on most juke boxes). But after 8 Rolling Rocks at Smokey Joes, even that sounded great. I never tire of listening to the Cars. I even like Door to Door. When the Cars disbanded in 1988, that was truly the Day the Music Died.
