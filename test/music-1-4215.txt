As other comments have noted, 18 Tracks (1999) is primarily a sampling of Tracks (1998), the latter a compilation of unreleased takes and demos of previously released songs. 18 Tracks includes fifteen of the songs included on Tracks plus an additional three new songs that had never been released (eg The Promise). In other words it is for the budget minded casual fan of Springsteen with a hook to make the diehards buy it on top of the more inclusive Tracks. This release is enjoyable enough; however, in my opinion, no compilation package should be on this list as a compilation cannot really be compared to regular releases and does not represent the concept of a full-length effort.
