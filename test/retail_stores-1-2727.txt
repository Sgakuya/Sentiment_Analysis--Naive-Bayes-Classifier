Our local Home Depot used to be excellent. Then they remodeled -- during the remodel they moved their inventory willy-nilly. They didn't group things together -- moulding was with screws then the next day it was moved near sprinklers. The staff had no idea where things were. It was more like a treasure hunt than a shopping trip... but it wasn't a fun treasure hunt. Finally, the remodel ended. I can't see any improvement to where things are except that they now have a service desk where the McDonalds used to be. I've gone in there several times. I've walked out several times. It's good place to be ignored by staff. However, I had to get flooring in quickly and HD was the closest. In the afternoon, I got help right away from a really nice person. She assured me that they could provide everything from taking out the carpet and the previous tile to putting the flooring in. I brought my husband in that night to pick out the flooring and waited and waited for someone to help us. We got passed around until we got a gentleman who assured us again that they could do everything. So, we bought the raw materials. The HD measurer came, took measurements, and noted the current flooring -- rug over tile. He still gave the impression that HD could do everything. However, when the installers came, they told us that we had to remove the tile ourselves because it might be asbestos. Nowhere in the paper work had the representatives of HD indicated that this might be the case. I called HD and they said their folder had a note to this effect. I'm not the Great Karmac -- I don't know how they expected us to know what we had to do if the note was on their folder and not on our documents! Since we've already bought the flooring, the adhesive and the mouldings, we're between a rock and a hard place and they offer no help. That's the final straw. I'm selling my stock in Home Depot and giving all my business to Lowe's even though it's further away.
