George W. Bush is not a conservative. Conservatives believe in keeping government out of people's lives and in shrinking the size of government. Bush spends money like it's water and has massively increased the size and scope of government in every conceivable manner. He has shredded the Constitution with the USA PATRIOT Act. And he exploited the deaths of thousands of Americans on 9/11 to justify the invasion of Iraq -- a country that never did anything to us and never posed any threat to us. He has destroyed our credibility in the world. He has made us reviled and hated and has undone decades of buiding alliances and trust among the nations of the world. He advocates torture. For every alleged terrorist Bush has killed, two more have risen up in that terrorist's place. He hides behind the mantra of spreading freedom, but he turns a blind eye to Sudan and eagerly helps send our jobs to China, which is led by a far more evil regime than Saddam's ever was. He's an ideologue of the worst order. He has done nothing to discourage a poisonous political climate -- what I call "Toby Keith's America" -- in which to merely disagree with his policies is tantamount to hating America and loving Osama bin Laden. (America was founded on dissent; how easily we forget.) He sees a very complicated world in black and white, good and evil, us and them. That's fine when you're a kid in the sandbox playing war with wooden guns, but it's a dangerously naive policy in the real world. Bush is giving Bill Clinton a run for the worst president in my lifetime, and he will surely be remembered as one of the worst presidents in the history of this nation.
