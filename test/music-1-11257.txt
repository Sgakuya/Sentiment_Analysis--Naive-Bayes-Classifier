Well, what can I say about this album. Oh yeah, how about Hoey! This is, yet another terrible one by Britney! Once again, very unoriginal. This album is REALLY bad. The songs are so bad! The only songs that I could tolerate were everytime and shadow. But Britney needs to stop acting like a slut and start growing up! All her songs are about boys and sex. HORRIBLE!!!
