The bears suck and even they know it. Look forward to another 4-12 season you losers. Can't wait for the pack to beat up on their asses again( what is that like 16 out of the last 20). Bad moving drafting Rex Grossman, he will end up just like Cade McNown. Gotta love it when the bears suck year in and year out. This year should be no different.
