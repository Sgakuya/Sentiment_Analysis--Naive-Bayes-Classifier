Delta is by far the worst airline in the country. The sooner they file for bankruptcy the better off I'll be. As an active duty service member, I am forced to fly Delta on all my government funded trips. Over the course of the past 10 months and 11 Delta flights, my luggage has arrived with me on only 5 occasions. Less than 50%?!? What kind of service is that? I have yet to mention the two times I haven't been able to arrive on time to my destination because of maintenance issues with their aircraft. I've also been given a voucher to an overbooked hotel by a ticketing agent one late night, and spent the next two hours trying to find a room in Atlanta at midnight. Don't even get me started on their Sky Miles program. One would have better luck teaching a goat to tap dance than getting a free ticket with your accumulated skymiles or any sort of substantial compensation for the aggravation of flying their airline. Delta Stinks!!!
