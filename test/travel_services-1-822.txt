Septa is the worst transit system in the country. With rising healthcare cost they feel as though they should have to pay for benefits. The schedules are never right. The customer service is horrible. The Trains are disgustingly dirty. Who in there right mind would put fabric seats on a mass transit system. Thats just stupid. I have rode mass transit in New York, Toronto, and London. And Septa is by-far the WORST!!!!!!
