My fiancee purchased my ring at a Whitehall store and two weeks after I received it, the two side stones BOTH fell out. I took it in immediately (thankfully we had purchased a warranty for it) and they apologised saying that the jeweler must have forgotten to tighten the stones when he resized it. So, after that was fixed, I wore it for another month and took it in to have the settings checked (following the warranty contract) and was told that two of the diamonds (one side and one center) were extremely loose. They took the ring to be fixed and accused me of being careless with it. The store manager lectured me on how this was fine jewelry and I shouldn't wear it to bed or to put lotion on...and so on. So, when I got the ring back, I didn't! I maybe wore it 5 hours a day because I was either at work or sleeping and didn't want to risk having more problems. Well, ten days later, I adjusted my ring only to notice that the center stone rotated 360 degrees within the prongs. Unacceptable. My fiancee and I immediately took the ring into the store (which is an hour drive from where we live) and explained the problem. We traded in the ring for a completely new style...hoping to have better luck. They told us that this new ring would be in in about 4-12 weeks but felt that it would probably be more like 4. When I called to check on the progress of the ring, they informed me that it would indeed be 12 weeks and that they could no longer give me the sale price. WOW. I hope other ring shoppers read comments like this before going to a Whitehall store!!
