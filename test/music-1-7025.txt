This video is absoutely disgusting. I am not a fan of either singer , that may be part of my opinion. But who the hell is attracted to a artificial woman like that. She sets the whole video off to begin with. The setting is nice. Another major problem, it lacks a PLOT! and visual stimulie unless you have a crush on either singer (which I don't). There's nothing to keep the audiance interested. It is totally dependant apon fans who are obcessed with the image of either one of these artists, which is where A LOT of todays video go very wrong.
