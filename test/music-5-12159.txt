Okay. I can understand that people don't believe that she is a genious because she only plays the piano. And I have to agree that the rifs are very easy... I picked them up the first time I heard the album. However, It's everything put together that is genious. It IS beautiful music even though it's not the hardest to learn. She also plays many of the other instruments on her album, so she is really a truly talented person. Her voice is beautiful, and I envy her because I play the same kind of music, and sing the same way that she does...only...she probably sounds a lot better! I love the album. It's moving and chilling. A really easy listen.
