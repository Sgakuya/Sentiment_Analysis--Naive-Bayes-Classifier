Zell Miller gave an impassioned speech. He spoke of patriotism and spitballs. He made the RNC uncomfortable with his rantings(did anyone else note some of the delayed clapping during his speech?) Zell is not the archetype of the Democratic Party. I'm not sure what went wrong -- not enough medication or too much? Who knows? All I do know is that his arguments were full of hot air and lies. Red-faced Zell spat out that Kerry voted against weapons programs like the B-2, etc. as though these weapons were for the our recent Iraqi occupation. Nope. That was years ago. In the early 90s Cheney and Bush, Part One supported a reduction and/or halt in defense spending measures. Kerry hasn't voted against a Pentagon appropriations bill since 1997. Don't believe me?
