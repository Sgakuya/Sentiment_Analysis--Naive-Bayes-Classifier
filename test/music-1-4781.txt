I was very disappointed that she lip-synced just about every song. I didn't mind when she did that in her concerts as a new artist but seven years later I would expect her singing to get better. It's gotten worse. She is horrible at singing live shows. Even Madonna sings all her own songs in concert and she sounds good. Britney is a marginally talented dancer but she is not a very good singer. She may be sexy but I'm not impressed with her singing or dancing talents. She should take some time off and find something she can be really good at.
