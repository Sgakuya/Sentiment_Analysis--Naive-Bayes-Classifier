This is a trendy selection for front-runner, fair-weather fans - the same people who buy Michael Jordan sneekers. Okay, think honestly now...you're in San Diego on a Sunday, you're from out of town, but you would like to find a bar that's full of your team's fans decked-out in team colors...you're NOT going to find a Patriot bar...you're NOT going to find a Giants bar...you're NOT going to find a Browns bar...BUT YOU WILL FIND AT LEAST ONE PACKER BAR!!!
