I DO NOT like this man AT ALL!!! I feel sorry for the American people as the majority of them didn't even vote this man into the white house. Dubya is always accusing Saddam Hussein of being a terrorist......well news flash Mr Bush YOU ARE THE BIGGEST TERRORIST OF THEM ALL. You not only detracted from the subject of 9/11 that Saddam Hussein and Iraq was responsible for the atrocities of that day when really and truly it was Osama Bin Laden and you've done nothing to capture this man sacrificing millions of not only your soldiers lives but innocent Iraqi civillians and many other soldiers and their families around the world. Can you ever apologise to the families who lost their loved ones on 9/11 due to your incompetence and negligence to ignore terrorist threats? Or even to those soldiers whose lives have been lost to an unjust war mainly due to oil and money? You then LIE to the American people and the rest of the world on national TV that Iraq has WMD's when there were no WMD's and you failed to inform Americans that whilst Saddam was murdering and killing thousands of his people YOU Mr Bush were actually supporting and training Saddam Hussein and he was being supported not only by you, but that muppet Blair, so it only takes a two-year old to figure out why we went to War!!! When you went into that White house you had one reason to go in and one reason only. You've done nothing to help world peace and thanks to you and Tony Blair Great Britain is on high alert for fears of severe terrorist attacks like that of Spain on March 11th 2004 (one of the countries that assisted you on your War on Terror and liberating Iraq) killing another 191 innocent civillians. How many more innocent lives are going to be sacrificed for your unjust War on Terror and Liberation? I cannot wait for the day yourself and that idiot Blair topple from your posts and think about the mess you have made, maybe thinking is just not your strong point Mr Bush.
