shaq is the worst basketball player i have ever seen in my entire life! he can't even shot free throws if your in the nba you should at least be able to do that! the only reason he made it as far as he did is because of his size, he has no skill, you could find a little girl on a playground that has more game than him!! SHAQ GOT NOOOOO GAME!!!!!
