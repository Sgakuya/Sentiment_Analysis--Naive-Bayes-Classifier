Fry's is the worst electronics store there is. Re-turning an item is like pulling teeth. They hassle you to get 'store credit' instead of your money back. Every thing you do needs an assistance of about 4 supervisors and managers. They sell you warrantees for $200 that cover nothing! It's just money in their pocket. You wait in line for an hour just to wait at the checkout for 20 minutes. The employees have no computer knowledge at all. They stare at you with a blank face and refuse to get you anywhere but confused. I will never buy anything at Fry's again!
