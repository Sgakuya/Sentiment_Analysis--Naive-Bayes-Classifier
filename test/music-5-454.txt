The RHCP triumph once again over personal adversity and challenge, and come out with a mature, positive, and most of all, uniquely funky view on life. This album couldn't find a better way to bring back prodigal guitarist John Frusciante and transmit the pure and awesome vibe the Peppers have with him. Songs like Around the World and Get On Top have the Peppers at their funk rock best, with Flea playing the bass with a power only Flea can. Also, This Velvet Glove and Savior show the more serious, introspective side of the Peppers, while showcasing the beauty of Frusciante's playing. Awesome!
