They want to be considered a top notch program, but everytime they get close, something sets them back a ways. Like this past season, they were on the brink, and now Melvin, Sherril, and that white kid with the big head are gone. I understand they got some decent recruits, but who doesn't in the ACC? What, are they gonna knock off NC, Dook, Wake, GA Tech, and Maryland with Hodge and a couple of Freshmen? I say they MIGHT break the top 25 a couple of times, but they should not look forward to anything but the possibility of an ACC upset or two.
