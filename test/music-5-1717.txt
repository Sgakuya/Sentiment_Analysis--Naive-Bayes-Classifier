I cant give bjork enough credit really. Every one of her albums has been amazing. Crusty electronic beats, strange glacial melodies and that voice, soaring gently over the top of it all, twisting and turning every which way. Three thumbs up to Bjork! Oh and just to say what really annoys me are these singer these days, claiming to be 'independent women' when they dont write any of the music or words, are little more then record industry slaves and are simply marketed to idiots who believe that this is what an independent women is all about. Well they should listen to the likes of Bjork, tori amos, Janis Joplin and Patti Smith to find out what an actual talented women can do. There are lots of them, unfortunately people who are willing to sell their bodies for money will be the ones in the public eye. What ever happened to feminism!
