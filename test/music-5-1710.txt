i literally can't stop listening to this album. i think they should have released it before 'kid a', to ease people into their shift toward electronic music, since this is more conventionally melodic while at the same time sounding like it was recorded in a submarine on another planet. this list depresses the hell out of me, since most of what's popular on it i deem to be crap, but for what it's worth, here is a truly remarkable album. buy it. now!
