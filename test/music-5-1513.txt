Ok, I have to disagree with the reviewer below. I have been listening to this band from the beginning (1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours...WAY before Dookie!!!). American Idiot is a really good album. This band has really grown up and it shows in this cd. LOVE Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, Give Me Novacaine, Letterbomb....
