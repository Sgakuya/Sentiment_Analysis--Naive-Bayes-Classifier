This album is everything I expected and more. I am dissapointed by some people's comments aboutit lacking sense of direction, and not living up to their other albums. As this album clearly demonstrates, not all good music has to follow standard ABABCB linear format. And, not all music has to have immediate pop-appeal to be valuable or enjoyable. This album is marking the wave of the future. Technology is rarely used in the mainstream music world in unique, innovative ways. This album is far from formulaic, although it follows in the steps of some of the greats(eno and fripp for example). If you think this music is weird, a-tonal, etc, then listen again- and force yourself to listen to composers like Stockhausen, John Cage, Raymond Scott, etc. to hear that it is actually quite melodic in comparison to other unique uses of technology. I don't mean to renounce any other view, but I strongly feel that this music deserves attention. It is time that we look past the wretched pop music bombarding our radios and see the true innovators of our times. In the trajectory of musical history, it will be Radiohead that goes down in the books of rock and roll history- I garentee.
