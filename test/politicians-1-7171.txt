Much like the many emails already sent in, I too think that Mr. Jackson insights violence and creates racial problems for his own livelihood and to the country's demise. He speaks of being a preacher of good, forgiveness, and God's ways; yet he is forever keeping the flame of racism and negavity going. It has come to my attention that he and his Rainbow coalition are planning a demonstration on one of our country's most important and revered days, Jan. 20th. For what, to continue this division? I believe most Americans want to heal from this debacle created by Al Gore, (crazy man Daily coaching him, Daily's crazy father coaching him about election abuse from wherever he is after death), the recklessness of Florida's canvassing boards, and the out and out disobediance of the Fl. Supreme Ct. (All who I hope and pray are voted out SOON.) We need to heal and let this new leader, someone that half the country just hasn't met yet, but is surrounding himself with fine leaders and will himself prove to be a great leader. Someone shut this racist black man that hasn't even been ordained as a minister.....UP.
