Giulani can be interesting. However, There are TOO MANY flaws. He cheats on his wife and lectures people on their morality. (Hypcritical.) He lacks artistic taste. He cut back a program for people with AIDS. He advocated racial profiling. His little spat with The Saudi Arabian Prince was inconvienent and irrelevant. The guy had offered the victums of September 11 10 billion dollars! And Rudy says no! So I'm kind of neutral on this. UPDATE: I am not so keen of Rudy's little bratty behavior over the Sensation Art exhibit. He needs to look at himself before calling a great artist like Chris Ofili immoral! Also, I am starting to feel like he used 9/11 as something to enhance his reputation. UPDATE: He is also responsible for the death of Amadou Diallo!
