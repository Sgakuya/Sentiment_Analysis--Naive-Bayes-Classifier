This guy was one of the biggest embarassments in American political history, and an old and in the way drag on the progress of this country. People in foreign countries would read his idiotic pronouncements in the newspaper and then write off all Americans as hicks, hayseeds and cretins. In a way, these people made correct assumptions. Helms was a racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic moron who managed to fraud his way into that useless and increasingly irrelevant Old Boys' Club known as the U.S. Senate, and then continued to hoodwink his imbecilic constituency in North Carolina in his rise of the top. Sorta like cream in a milk bottle, or scum on a pond, or a turd in the terlet. His parochial and backward-thinking positions on geopolitical issues and the influence he brought to bear on U.S. foreign policy set back the best interests of this country. Big time, as our fraud of a Vice President would say. I really can't, for the life of me, despite all best efforts to probe my memory, remember a single good thing this dimbulb ever did for this country, a single significant piece of legislation be authored, a single worthwhile cause or issue he championed. Seemed all he did was drag his feet on civil rights, condemn queers, assign women a second class citizen status, attack liberals, insult the U.N. and generally confirm the suspicions of reasonable, thinking people in this country that the collective IQ of those rubes living south of the Mason-Dixon is about 56. Cliche for Cliche should be his political epitath.
