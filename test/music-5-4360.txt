I wish I could give it 10 stars! It has songs that will break your heart in memory of those who died on 9/11 and it will also melt through the clouds to make you the happiest and content you've felt after hearing a new rock release in a very long time! The songs are fresh and new yet at times recall both the starkness of Nebraska and the upbeat rock n roll sound of The River . Very very highly recommended!
