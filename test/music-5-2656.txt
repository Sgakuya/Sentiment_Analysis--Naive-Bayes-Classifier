this album is so good and good is not even the right word for it. It is a very fun album full of raw energy. Not as raw as the 1st album, but not as technical as later ones. This album has almost a live feel to it. Every song on it is a hit and to this day plays well. Whoever said it is overrated...WTF. Whole lotta Love is on this. Moby Dick...What is and what should never be... And yes, JPJ is talented. his basslines in Ramble One and The lemon Song are great. This album is a classic. Could never be overrated. It is right where it should be...perfection.
