Quadrophenia is equal with Tommy on the greatness that the Who achieved with the rock opera/concept album. It is an album meant to be heard all the way through, but also offers up hits like The Real Me, 5-15, Love Rain O'er Me, and The Punk Meets the Godfather. The Who were one of the best bands of all-time at making albums that were clearly the result of a lot of planning by mainly Townshend. A work of genius put out by The Who.
