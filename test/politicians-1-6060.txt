Ashcroft is totally conservative. His views on guns are even to the right of the National Rifle Association, and he seems to be against everything good for America. Just look at his creation of the Patriot Act. If he was given complete control of America, which is his dream and our nightmare, the U. S. would be a dictatorship by the next morning, and the Separation of Church and State would be no more.
