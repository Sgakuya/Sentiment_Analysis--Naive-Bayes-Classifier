I got my fiance's engagement ring from Kay. It developed what looks like a crack in the diamond. My fiance took it to Kay's and a mean lady said "it's just dirty" and literally THREW it in the cleaner. After fighting with them about it for a while, she got them to actually look at it, and the man that was there said it's just a "feather inclusion". Well, what my fiance didn't know until she looked it up on the internet when she got home, is that a "feather" is a general term for a BREAK in a diamond. They are really sneaky people and sell you cheap jewelry and always have an excuse for it to try to get you to not exchange it. This is actually the second engagement ring I've purchased from them, because the first one was hollowed out underneath the setting, and when I returned it the woman tried to tell me "it lets the light shine through the diamonds more". Yeah, bullcrap, it's just so they don't have to pay as much for gold.
