Alitalia is a disgrace to Italy and the Italians. I have flown it only a couple of times, many years ago, and never will again if I can help it. On one of the flights the attendants were the rudest I have ever experienced; I had a knock-down, drag-out verbal altercation with one of the stewards, in Italian. I couldn't believe that he mouthed off as much as he did to a passenger. It was a really unpleasant flight, and I would never, ever recommend Alitalia to anyone, unless I wanted to get even with them for something or other. Anyone who has read any of my comments concerning anything to do with Italy knows what a bias I have for anything Italian, so trust me, if I tell you that Alitalia stinks, much as it pains me to say it, it really does.
