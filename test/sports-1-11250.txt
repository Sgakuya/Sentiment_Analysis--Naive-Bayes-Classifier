Let's recap his glory years in the NFL... He joined the Chiefs staff as defensive coordinator. The players were there and ready to make it to the playoffs under Dick Vermeil. Then something extraordinary happened, Kansas City became the worst defensive team in the NFL. My hat goes over to you Greggy. Not only did you ruin a once great defensive system under Marty Schottenheimer, you did it with class. You weren't afraid to say you were a bad coach or didn't really know what to do to make things better. And for that, I admire your honesty. However, as far as coaching goes, I'd suggest you stay aware from any potential All-Americans in college before you ruin their careers as well.
