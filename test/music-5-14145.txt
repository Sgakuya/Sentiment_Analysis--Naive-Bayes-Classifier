Supremely Great!!! The movie was outstanding. What I loved about Kill Bill was the great soundtrack. Since popping it into my CD a month ago, I still can't get enough of it. As good, if not better than the Pulp Fiction Soundtrack, which was another great one. Tracks 7 through 10: Run Fay Run (Issac Hayes); Al Hirt's Theme from the Green Hornet; Battle Without Honor or Humanity; and a great rendition of Don't Let me be Misunderstood are stupendous. This would be the one CD I would bring to a Desert Island -- if I could only bring one. It's OUTSTANDING. Even my kids like it (though a couple of tracks are quite coarse).
