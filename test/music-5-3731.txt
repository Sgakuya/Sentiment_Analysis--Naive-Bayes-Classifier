An absolutely incredible album from start to finish!! Queen built off a very strong debut album with a work of absolute brilliance. From the regal Procession clear on through to Seven Seas of Rhye, the album is a riveting, wonderfully orchestrated and ambitious collection of phenomenol songs-- a timeless classic!
