An egotistical spoiled yuppie from hell owner. I feel sorry for Redskin's fans. If Snyder keeps his nose out of day to day team business and with his hiring of Spurrier as coach this team could be an up and comer. However, any proud Baltimorean has little to like about the Deadskins. When the Colts were ripped away from us, everyone (media and NFL commissioner) thought we shoud embrace the Washington Redskins and put up with no team. NOT!
