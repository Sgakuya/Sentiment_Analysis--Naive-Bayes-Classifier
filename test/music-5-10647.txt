An absolutely awesome CD! The songs are brillianlty crafted, and Rob Thomas' vocals are awesome. There's something on the disc for everyone, and not a bad song to be found. My favorites are Angry , Stop and Rest Stop , but the whole disc is worthy of playing over and over again. If you don't already own it, you should!!
