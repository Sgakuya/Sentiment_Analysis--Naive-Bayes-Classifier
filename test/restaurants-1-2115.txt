Consistently AWFUL. I was appalled the first time I stopped by early one morning for a box of raised sugar glazed donuts to treat our computer class. My classmates thought what a great idea, but they were STALE! I have never purchased a fresh sugar glazed donut at Tim Horton's. They should NOT be permitted to allege always fresh when always STALE is the truth. I should have learned my lesson, but a few weeks ago, I was pushing my twin grandbabies in their stroller and didn't have the stamina to go farther, so I thought I'd give Tim Horton's another try. I picked donut holes for the toddlers. They were just as HARD and STALE as all Tim Horton donuts I tried before. The babies wouldn't eat them. Tim Horton's holds the record in my book as the only donut shop I know that NEVER has fresh donuts. My message to Tim Horton's is: THROW OUT STALE DONUTS!! Why pass them off on trusting customers? That is SO WRONG! Just throw them away! I searched online for Tim Horton's SUCKS and found http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/chalk_river/tim_hortons_crappy_donuts.html Check it out. The Tim Horton's on N. High Street, north of Arcadia, in Columbus, Ohio 43202 (Clintonville) should CLOSE. Try Buckeye Donuts on campus where freshness is a tradition.
