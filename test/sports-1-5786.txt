good player, no doubt. But I agree with the 2 previous comments. How smart can a player who lights a fire under a Carolina guy's ass be? I mean, McCants wasn't doing sh*t until Hodge decided he would intimidate him. Thaaaat, people is the definition of stupidity. Oh, we are making a pretty good come back against Carolina. I think I'll motivate McCants. Gimme a break! How stupid can one be?
