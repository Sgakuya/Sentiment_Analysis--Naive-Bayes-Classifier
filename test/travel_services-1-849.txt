I used Moving Staffers for a move in Dec 2004. The movers did not show up at all on my scheduled move day. The local company kept telling me that they would show up until 5pm, when the admitted they could not come. I actually had to reschedule and re-do the entire move - including another truck rental. The entire day of the original move, I was calling Moving Staffers and nobody answered the phone. I eventually spoke to Dan Cunningham, the owner of the company. His excuse was that Moving Staffers is simply a consultant and can't be held accountable for the local movers they recommend. So, you are essentially paying for them to find you a local mover - if anything goes wrong you can't expect any help at all. I eventually reached an agreement with Dan that was less than satisfactory to me, but I was going to let it go. However, he then backed out of that agreement and left me with their full charges. I would recognize that if Moving Staffers sends a good local mover, you will have a good experience. However, expect no help if there are problems. My advice - get a recommendation from a friend or use the yellow pages. Save yourself $100 or more. Additional note: the user TomA is in fact the owner/operator of Moving Staffers.
