Al Gore, Times is hard aint it? May God lead you by mercy and my he restore honor. You really don't have a clue that killing a baby is murder do you? I wish your wife hadn't convinced you that delivering a baby's head far enough out of the womb to suck it's brains out was better than delivering a live birth that can be aborted. Partial birth abortion is murder.
