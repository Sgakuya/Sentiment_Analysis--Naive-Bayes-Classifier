After waiting four years after The Joshua Tree (1987), U2 peaked in 1991 with the release of Achtung Baby (their next true studio effort). A nice return to a harder and modern edge, though my favorite song on this release is So Cruel, a softer, slower song. Not a fluff track on this release which includes the singles Even Better Than The Real Thing, One, The Fly, and Mysterious Ways. The bottom line is that any U2 compilation release should be supplemented with Achtung Baby.
