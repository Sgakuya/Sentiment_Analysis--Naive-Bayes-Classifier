This is a fantastic debut record and shows what a great and individual songwriter Stevie is. The title track sounds like nothing you've heard before and is a great opener. Both duets on this are good too with the sweet Leather and Lace and rockier Stop Draggin My Heart Around. Still the best solo album she's made.
