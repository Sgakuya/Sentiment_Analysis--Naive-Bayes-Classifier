I suppose I never would have used this service if I knew the extent to which my beautiful things would be damaged upon arrival. At first, I thought this would be a good thing, cheap and relatively easy. I did a terminal to door move. Loading was super easy. I just packed my boxes carefully and loaded them along with a two dressers (the extent of my furniture at the time) and a desk and left my belongings in their hands. First, my stuff got held up in Arkansas for 3 days, only about 5 hours from my Illinios residence, on the way to the destination: san antonio So, after they had told me my stuff would take 3-4 days, and after all of my help had to leave San Antonio before my stuff arrived b/c of work responsibities, I was left waiting in a new city, all by my self. As if that was not bad enough. My newly painted dressers will need to be painted again, for they are scratched, dented, and dirty with dirt and grease. One of my kitchen appliances was found smashed on the ground of the truck, yet the box was comepletely shut. My microwave was damaged. And every thing is covered in dirt. I really don't know how the dirt, grease, smashing, and general wrecking happened. I wonder if the 1/2 broken how divider had anything to do with it? Not that that should matter, since the driver didn't wait to even open to door, possibly b/c it was 9pm, yet I had been expecting the truck since 5pm. Alas, the San Antonio dispatch and I had our problems. Things got more heated when they seemingly refused to pick up their trailer that was taking up three parking spaces at my apartment complex. What I at first though was going to be a reasonable, sensible alternative to a moving service, turned out to be a failure that I actually paid money for wrecking my things. Next time, I will pay the extra bucks to have my things carefully handled and arrive on schedule so I can plan around it.
