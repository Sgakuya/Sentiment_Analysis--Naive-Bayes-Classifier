It is unbeleivable how Democrats will support anyone just because they are a Democrat. Yes, a lot of them supported Sen. McCain, but then why didn't you Dems register as Republicans to support John McCain. As far a Algore, (purposely misspelled), there has not been a scarier candidate for president since George McGovern. Why can't people see what a phony he is? All he wants is a big bureaucratic government with hundred of liberal programs. For the sake of freedom, vote for Bush.
