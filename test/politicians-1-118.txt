Pretty damn nice guy? You may a moderator, but you sure aren't moderate. Imagine, (God forbid), you were in a relationship with this guy, and then all of a sudden, you find out that this so-called Prince Charming winds up being blatantly unfaithful behind your back? Well, that's what an average bum is. I'm giving him a poor rating not because he's supposed to marry someone suitable, but because he needs to be faithful in order to be a suitable husband. After all the dirt he's rifled himself through, most anyone would argue he's made himself unsuitable for marriage, and even more importantly...unsuitable for becoming King. --Charles is quite simply put...a vile thug. He wishes he was a tampon? I say throw him in the garbage...where Di put him a looonnggg time ago.
