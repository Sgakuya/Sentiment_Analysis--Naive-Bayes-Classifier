His constant harping about campaign finance reform is wearing very thin on me. If he insists upon honest reform, he should start by finding out why the military wing of the Chinese Communist found it wise (and illegal I should add)to contribute to the DNC. Aren't you a little curious as to why they would do this? Is it because they got missel guidance technology from this past Clinton administration? If you want real reform, it should be insisting that the CURRENT LAWS are strictly enforced. You know the one that say: IT IS ILLEGAL TO TAKE CAMPAIN MONEY FROM ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS!
