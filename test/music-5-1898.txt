i didnt' think it was possible but this album is better than TRAGIC KINGDOM - i love every song on this album. at first i hated MARRY ME and i would skip it every time but now it's my favourtie. on every track gwen seems to be so insecure but i don't understnad why. she is beautiful and has a great voice. she doesn't need gavin if he's gonna do is cheat on her. HER PINK HAIR IS SOOOO COOL
