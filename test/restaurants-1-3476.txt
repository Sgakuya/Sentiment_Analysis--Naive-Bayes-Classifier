I worked for Pizza Hut for over 5 years and I must say I wouldn't eat pizza from them again...when I first started the Pizza Hut had a local owner and was the best pizza in town..the chains was sold to a corporate chain and went all down hill...we had a manager who drunk beer from the tap while working and editing employees hours to save on her labor...she was reported and nothing was done...they gave her a promotion to a bigger store...when i worked there we came in early every morning and made fresh dough for the day...talking to people who still work for pizza hut i found out they are using frozen dough now...there is a lot of grease used on the pan pizzas...Pizza Hut use to be the best but their quality is going down
