Yu-u-u-u-u-uck. He and his music make me want to toss my cookies. This time, I won't even bother being polite. This has to be the worst of his albums. To call it classic is so incredibly stupid. And no, I'm not going to get all over him for being a satanist. I'm going to complain because he is a worthless, idiotic man who's only work of art is himself and who should retire from the so called music business. He should then take tickets for R.E.M's concerts and really serve the people.
