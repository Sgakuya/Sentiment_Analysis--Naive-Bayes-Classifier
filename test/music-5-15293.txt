To be honest, this is my life's CD No.1. I don't find it neither sick, nor boring. All you need is just to have proper level of consciousness in order to feel what's behind what you hear (or do not hear). It is just a two-way road. If You understand - it's your best. If you don't - well, good for your experience...;)
