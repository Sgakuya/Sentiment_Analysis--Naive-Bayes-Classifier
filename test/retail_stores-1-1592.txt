I bought a Kenmore Ultra Bake Triple Task Oven in March 2004. I had trouble with the bottom oven from the beginning. Sears came out in July 2004 to replace the heating element. As I do not use the second oven frequently, I did not recognize the problems again soon. There were many times when I questioned whether or not it was working properly, but with a busy life I made due. Prior to Thanksgiving, I felt the bottom heaters while on (which I had not done previously for fear of being burned), and it was cold. Again, I called a repair man. The first technician (not from Sears) told me that the fuse was blown and that it had been left dangling by the previous Sears technician. He did not want to replace it because he felt there may be some engineering problems with my oven that would cause this continuous problem. So, I had Sears come out again. Not only was the fuse blown, but the heating element was out AGAIN. This is a relatively new oven, and the bottom oven has had problems from the beginning. Do I wish I had addressed the problems with more zeal during the warranty? Absolutely! Should I have to pay $228 for repairs to my lemon? No. Until this is rectified, I will NOT buy anything from Sears, and I suggest you do the same. Shop Home Depot; shop Lowe's. Shop a store with integrity. Sincerely, Cindy Robinson
