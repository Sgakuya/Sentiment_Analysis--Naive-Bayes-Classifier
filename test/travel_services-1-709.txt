Reserved a Mid-Size SUV (Ford Escape or similar) at Seattle location for a trip to the San Juan Islands. After first being told that no vehicles in this class were available and offered a minivan instead, 45 minutes later was told my vehicle was ready. Instead of a SUV, my vehicle was a Pontiace Vibe, which is in no way similar to a Ford Escape. A complaint to the manager and subsequent emails to customer service after returning were to no avail. I will not rent from them again.
