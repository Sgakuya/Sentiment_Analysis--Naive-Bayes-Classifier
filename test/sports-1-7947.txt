This is the most overratted person in the history of this planet. He won't last long in the NBA and he'll be in the NBDL next year. I don't see his projected talent. His first two games were against teams with no defense and his points in those games were fast breaks and dunks. His third game, when he played the Portland Jail Blazers, he was shut down by that group of thugs. The lesson of this story is anybody, including me, can score on a team with no defense. But when you run into a defense, like Lebron did a couple of days ago, and you'll be shut down.
