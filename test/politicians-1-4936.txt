Mr. Gepharht should spend a little more time being construtive rather than destructive. His only purpose in Washington is create little sound bites that tear down the opposing viewpoints. Of course he would like to be speaker and better yet president. But for those of you who keep voting him into office do a little R D on this guy. Granted he's a nice guy, but dig deep.
