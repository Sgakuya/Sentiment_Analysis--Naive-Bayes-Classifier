I feel sorry for Britney,she has been used to have great time with her music and videos.I have to share/unfortunately for Britney/my opinion with the others that Slave is out of the range for good taste.It is too provocative,sometimes on the soft edge of pornography.My Godness,Britney,what kind of advisers do you have around you?
