Jesse Jackson, I can descibe him in two words. MENTALLY RETARDED. There is a big gap in between Christianity and his views. As a matter of fact they're on the opposite ends of the page. If this is what the media wants to call a Minister of the Gospel, then let's also have Ozzy Osborne and Marilyn Manson perform at Rev. Billy Graham Crusades. That would be just as far fetched. Jesse Jackson and his followers are magicians. They can make something out of nothing and they all get something for nothing from the U.S. Government.
