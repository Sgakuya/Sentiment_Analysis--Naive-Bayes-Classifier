Here's the deal: I like the song but the video is a lil too much! I mean Christina looks very scary and LiL Kim is just plain ugly especially with white hair!YIKES!Mya is the only descent one who actually looks good in her outfit and Pink is just not fit in those clothes!In other words! This video bites the dust!
