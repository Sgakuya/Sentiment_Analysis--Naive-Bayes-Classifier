Kmart is more expensive in most items then Walmart, I have compared prices since I am a bargain shopper expessially on big items like vacuums and stuff of that sort. Last week I seen the exact vacuum they had at Kmart, but at Walmart it was exactly 20 dollars less. Kmart also has less variety of items then Walmart and Target at my location the Kmart has no sewing material, cloth and items of that sort and also don't have a wide selection of candles, sorry but im a candle nut. Also Walmart is cheaper on their candles, alot cheaper. Christmas ornaments are also a whole lot cheaper at Walmart then at Kmart...I usually shop at dollar general strores or walmart for low priced ornaments and gift wrap. Although Kmart is sometimes alot easier to get in and out then other department stores, if your in a hurry..sometimes not always.
