The Album that should have won Album of the year at the Grammys instead of the one hit wonder Christopher Cross. Roger Waters and Co. created a masterpiece with this album (and to think they were all fighting with each other at the time). We don't get many concept albums today (let alone great rock operas like this one). A very complex and compelling story of one's inner turmoil that everyone faces at many moments of their lives. The songs are incredible separately ( The Trial, Confortably Numb, etc.) as they are as one. One day, Pink Floyd will be given the total recognition that they deserve for this album.
