A good live album is the ultimate prove that a band can really play and relate with their fans. There are a lot of artists who never dared to release live albums because they couldn't survive without help from technology or simply were lousy musicians. Yessongs is a great live album, some of the songs like Your's is no Disgrace are better than the original version, but in the case of Your Move/All Good People, the difference is amazing. Great album, amazing musicians and a perfect album for those who want to listen the best early Yes songs.
