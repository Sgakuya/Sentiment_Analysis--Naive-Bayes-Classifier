How pathetic the democrat party has become that someone who hates America as much as this piece of garbage does can find a home in the party of FDR and Jimmy Carter. Has anyone in the entire party any backbone? Any conscience? Any shame? UPDATE: To get a clue how ridiculous this lady is, read through Flick's comments (thorough and accurate, as always). I'm sure he shortened his comments for this medium but you get the idea. Anyone want to attempt to refute, and defend her? Is there a positive side to her ledger?
