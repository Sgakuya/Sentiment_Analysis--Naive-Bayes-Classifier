I wish Rateitall.com had a rating system that included zero, and negative ratings. I honestly don't think I could rate Daschle low enough. He is a mean-spirited, backstabbing, whiny, puny person. He is great at criticizing every approach the Republican party takes to bettering our great nation. At every corner, and every turn, you can bank on seeing or hearing Daschle commenting on how poor the Republicans overall strategic plans are. But, as usual, the Democrats are only capable of griping, and never, ever offer constructive and sustainable action plans. Daschle and his motley crew disgust me. Had he been President, our Great nation would have already succumbed to multiple terrorist attacks that would make 9/11/01 seem like a picnic. I don't consider Daschle or his party to be patriots; I consider them an impediment and roadblock to achieving this nation's goals and objective. Just another Clinton mindset, and you see what that can do to our nation.
