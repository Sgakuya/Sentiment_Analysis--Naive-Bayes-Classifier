This CD is a compilation of his best Spanish work and after listening to the entire album, I must agree. These songs are so moving and full of real emotion. His voice is amazing, even more so in his native language. So to anyone who is in doubt of his talent as a musician, give a listen to La Historia. Perhaps it will change your mind.
