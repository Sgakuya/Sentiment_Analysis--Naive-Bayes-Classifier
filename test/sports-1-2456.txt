Jeff Torborg?!? Are you kidding me? You have one of the best managers in baseball and he wants to stay in Montreal, the absolute worst baseball city in MLB history, and what do you do? You fire him. Felipe Alou should thank the Expos ownership for letting him out of his misery. He will go on to bigger and better things while the Expos will be either disolved or moved to Northern Virginia.
