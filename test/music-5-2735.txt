Sgt. Pepper is not among my personal favorite Beatle albums because it tends to get away from rock and roll with all the studio experimentation. But it deserves a 5 just because of the pure genius of it's creativity. Most bands today, with far more sophisticated equipment to work with, couldn't come close to producing something of this magnitude.
