I purchased a Panasonic Mini DV Camcorder worth $472 from Best Buy on line. They had advertised that I will be getting $50 Digital Dollars in 14 days of my purchase and that they will send it via e-mail. Today it has been more than 7 weeks and I am still waiting. I complained 3 times online and 3 times on phone but they have the worst customer service I have dealt with. Each time I called, I must have spent atleast 45 minutes and all they do is give me a new case number each time and that someone will contact you in 3 business days - which never happened. Noone knows where, how and to whom I can forward my complaints to as nothing has happened. The supervisor also did not knew anything and is blaming on a different Department ( which does not receive phone calls). They don't have the web page where they had advertised for this $50 Digital Dollars. I can still go on with the horrible experience I had with Purchase, Dealing with RUDE CUSTOMER CARE and the way I lost my $50 But I will make my story short and CAUTION YOU ALL - PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM BEST BUY OR BE PREPARED TO FACE THE HUMILIATION FROM WORST CUSTOMER CARE.
