I wish this thing went higher than 5!! Zeppelin is the greatest band that was and will ever be!!! This album is by far my favorite album, but not their best. I believe ZepIV is their most solid work, but I can't help buy favor this one. There is a bit of everything on this album. There is less blues on this album than the first, but you have a variety...blues, rock, mellow...it's all there. My favorite song on the album is Heartbreaker. Then probably Ramble on. My boyfriend and I, we made Thank You our song. That is so beatiful. He wrote that for Maureen (IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ME THOUGH!). This is a great CD, if you don't have, well, you aren't much of a Zeppelin fan.
