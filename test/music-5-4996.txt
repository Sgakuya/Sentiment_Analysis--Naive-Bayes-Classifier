I'm not really into country music, but I am forced to listen to it from time to time as it's my boyfriend's favorite music. I heard I Hope You Dance on the radio the other night and I cried. It's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. You can apply to to almost anything going on in your life. If this is what country music is all about, I'm hooked :)
