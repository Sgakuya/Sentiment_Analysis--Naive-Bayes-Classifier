i love hanson so much but i must admit i thought tay was my girl friend megan when i first saw him, he looks good with short hair, so does ike. thier music is real on cd, video, and live, and i love it. i think girls talk bad about hanson to sound cool around other people that don't like hanson, and guys are jealous or lost thier g/f b-cuz they want/wanted to go out with hanson. ALL I AM SAYING IS IF YOU LIKE HANSON DON'T BE AFRAID TO SAY ANYTHING. IF SOMEBODY HAS A PROBLEM WITH IT THEY WILL GET OVER IT AND IF NOT, PAY THEM NO ATTENTION!!!! I LOVE HANSON SOOO MUCH!!!!!
