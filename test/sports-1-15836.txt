The only consolation I have after that superbowl is that I will probably out-live that obese loud-mouth of a football player. If he were a team player, if he would respect opposing teams and their coaches, if he played half as well as he talks, then I would give him 5 stars and Tampa Bay would have been the team of the decade.
