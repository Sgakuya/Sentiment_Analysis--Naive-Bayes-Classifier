After reading Medgar Evers review of this record, I tend to agree more with Lou28JG. I've heard this album several times and with every play it gets worse and worse. To hear the almost amateur-ish lyrics and guitar playing makes me realize how over-rated this group is. Ditties like If I Needed Someone , What Goes On , and The Word rank along side of songs from 'N Sync or 98 Degress.
