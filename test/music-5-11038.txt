Mandy Moore has got to be one of the most underrated pop princesses out there. Since her early Britney-esque debut and subsequent albums, she has struggled to carve out a niche for herself. I think with this album she finally succeeds in presenting the real Mandy Moore and music from her heart. Oddly enough, since this album is 12 cover songs. You would think it would be lackluster-an easy album to pop out and make some cash. Instead Mandy takes these and performs them, not as her own but more like a tribute. She knew exactly what she wanted with this album. She didn't want another sugar-coated MTV dance album; she wanted something honest and something simple. Ignoring the pressure to match up to scantily-clad popsters who belt out sexually blatant songs, she came out with an album worlds apart. I thought the covers she chose to record were fantastic. None were overdone or out of her league; they were instead songs she herself loved and wanted to share. Highlights for me were 'Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters ' and 'The Whole Of The Moon '. Each song was done reverently and simplistically. She correctly avoided changing the songs to any drastic measure and kept them within her vocal limits. I think she has never sounded better. With no cheesy hip-hop beats or whiny affectations to her voice, she stands out as a pure voice in a dirty pop industry.
