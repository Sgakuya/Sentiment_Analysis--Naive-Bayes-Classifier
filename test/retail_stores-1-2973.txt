I purchased my wedding band from Kay Jewelers at the Rhode Island Mall. I wore it for a week after my wedding, and brought it in to get cleaned, as I was in the mall that day. I was told I had loose stones. Asked how that could happen so quickly, they told me it was how I must have taken care of it. Then they shipped it out and fixed the loose stones, but the ring came back different. Completely different. I confronted them about it, they said they would ship it out again. I have been married 6 months now, and have worn my ring 3 weeks out of the entire time. I am being told that there is nothing they can do to compensate me for it, they can't fix it, and all they can do is give me another ring. I asked them if I did get another ring would the pay for me to get it reblessed? They told me they couldn't do that! Worst experience I have ever had. NEVER, EVER buy ANYTHING from any Kay Jewelers again! Horrible customer service!
