This is an album that you could lose yourself in for days or even weeks, and should! Amazing lyrics! for long you'll live, and high you'll fly, and smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry, but all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon Just lay back, spark up a joint, and enjoy!!!
