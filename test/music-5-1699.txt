Not as good as Automatic For The People or New Adventures In Hi-Fi, but they are still experimenting after the departure (a song from NAIHF!) of Bill Berry. I think the next album (due for release in 2004) is going to be alot better judgeing on Animal and Bad Day that will be on the In Time: Best of REM 1988-2003 coming out in late September 2003.
