Strong album, especially following on the heels of his horrific 1982 acoustic release Nebraska. This album runs the gamut from political commentary (Born In the USA, My Hometown) to love, lust and loss (I'm on Fire, Cover Me, Downbound Train) to straight up fun (I'm Goin' Down, Glory Days, Darlington County). Buy it even if you aren't a Springsteen fan.
