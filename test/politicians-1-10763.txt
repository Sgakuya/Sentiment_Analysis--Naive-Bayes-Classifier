The most do nothing president the U.S. has ever had. Was more interested in himself than he was doing anything for the country. The pompous twit actually declared himself the last President of the United States at one point, apparently feeling that the Union would fall to the CSA. I don't know if he was gay or not, and I have no idea why some people feel the need to paint everyone in history as potentially gay, but I do know he was not a good president, gay or straight.
