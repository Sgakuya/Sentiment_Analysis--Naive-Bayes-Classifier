I don't like Wal-Mart for this reason; just about everthing that you pull off of the shelf is made in China or elsewhere. WE AMERICANS NEED TO SEND CONGRESS A MESSAGE REGARDING NAFTA, THAT WE WANT OUR MANUFACTURING PLANTS BACK HERE IN THE USA! When we have to start buying our bullets from China, we will be in DEEP trouble. We probably already are buying our weapons or parts to support our military from foreigners.
