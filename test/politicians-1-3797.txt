Do we want a stupid person for president? Yeah-I'm a left wing bleeding heart who wants to save the trees and the salmon. And I'm PROUD! Not to mention that during the standstill, Bush complained vehimently about Gore's demanding a recount. George Dubya Boosh would have been doing the same thing. Listen to this nuts enviromental policy: Industry freindly!'' Yeah, screw wild animals and forests, we want cash and tons of it, because those children of millionere oil and mining kings need a Play Station 2, don't they? Shrub disgusts me. More power to ''O'l Blood n' Guts'' Gore!
