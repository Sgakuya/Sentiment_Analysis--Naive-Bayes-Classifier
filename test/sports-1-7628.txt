I used to respect Reggie Miller. I thought he was a hall of fame caliber player, a guy who always gave 100% and was clutch when it counted. Last night, however, in the second game of Indiana's playoff versus the Celtics, I saw a completely different side of Reggie. In the first half he was trying to draw fouls, falling on the ground from as much as a slight breeze from an opposing player. I had no problem with this - Reggie has always been an actor and has been good at drawing fouls and getting the other team upset and taking them out of the game. Last night though he wasn't getting those calls and he started whining like a little girl. I was really getting surprised watching him. And with 2 seconds left in the half I saw it all. Jumaine Jones heaved up a last second prayer from 3 quarters down the court, and Reggie stuck his leg out and tripped him. He didn't try and hide it or anything; it was a blatant move out of anger and frustration. I was yelling at the screen - what a punk. He got a technical foul but should have been suspended from the game. I would expect that type of play from 2 people - a rookie or Dennis Rodman. Rodman has long since retired and taken his antics with him, and Reggie Miller is in his 17th season. Miller will be regarded as one of the best to play the game, but he'll get no such respect from me. He's a coward who I hope will never get the satisfaction of an nba championship.
