I hope that the latest news about the Reverend Jesse Jackson puts an end to his public career. He has lived off of civil rights issues for years and has accomplished very little for those for who he proports to speak, while obviously enriching himself--how else could he be paying $10,000 per month to an ex-paramour and an out of wedlock child? When is the last time Jesse Jackson has a real job and a real life? I guess he felt that his life in the fast lane would never be revealed. The truth of the matter is that he is a known philanderer and has just been publicly chastised because of the birth of a child. And, he is so low to say that he was raised under these circumstances--so he was an out of wedlock child--does that make it right or any less painful? I hope his wife tosses him out on his rear-end, but, if she is anything like the paramour, she will just take the money and shut up. If he does come back into public life, I would hope that he would have the decency and humility to drop the Reverend title which he has been brandishing for years and, has, in fact, deflected a lot of criticism about himself and his actions. You can only play the race card but so much, Reverend. You should now shut up and go raise you new baby. Just think, you will only be 79 years old when she is ready for college--but with your track record, you will probably have moved on to another paramour and family!!!
