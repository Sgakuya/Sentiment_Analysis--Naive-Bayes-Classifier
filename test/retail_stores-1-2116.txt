They used to be the authority, but now they know nothing and overcharge for everything. A phone splitter that I get for ten cents from my wholesaler costs six bucks at Radio Shack! UPDATE: I used to take Radio Shack sales partner jobs for Dish Network and always had to re-explain EVERYTHING to the customer. The employees had zero knowlege of the promotions or equipment. I know because I checked one for my amusement. He proceeded to talk down to me like I didn't know a thing about Dish and got all pissy and told me to leave when I told him I was an installer. Hacks.
