A total failure without any redeeming features or character. He drove this country into the ground and allowed it to be humiliated. He humiliates it at every opportunity whether the administration is Democratic or Republican. The employees in the White House hated him because he was a mean and arrogant little turd. He tries to present himself as a man of high morals but his adminstration was racked by scandals. He couldn't even make his own family behave being embarassed by his mother, his brother and his own daughter. I was never so ashamed to have this man for a president and that includes Nixon and Clinton.
