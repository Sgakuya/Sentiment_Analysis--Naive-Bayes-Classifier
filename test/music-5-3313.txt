How could anyone in their right mind give this album LESS than five stars? Truly, positively amazing. Queen has named two of their albums after Marx brothers films: A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. The reason is unknown. This has to be one of their two best albums (the other is The Works ---has my favorite Queen song, Radio Ga Ga, on it.). Bohemian Rhapsody has to be the all-time most complex song ever done---and Freddie Mercury, the greatest genius in the history of rock music, wrote it ALL BY HIMSELF! And the others played it PERFECTLY!!! Now, how many of todays crappy excuses for bands could do that? I am thinking of *NSANE, the Backstreet Toys, and B(ull)ritney S(***)pears in particular. Someday, I am confident that most of you will realize this. And the other songs on here, like You're My Best Friend are also amazing. No Queen fan (REAL Queen fan, not Freddie is so hot girl) could dislike this album, and personally, I would be shocked if anyone else did not, either. I totally agree with Killerqueen's comment on the Queen page. No one should BE ALLOWED to degrade Freddie OR Brian OR John OR Roger. This is all I have to say. See you in heaven (whatever that is), Freddie. XOX.
