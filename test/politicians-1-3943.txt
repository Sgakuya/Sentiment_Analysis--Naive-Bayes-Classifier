There is no substance to this man. I fear for all who have economic struggles if he wins the election. He's floating on buoyant coattails those of his father and some good Republican advisers, who are more interested in a campaign than in caring about America and all Americans. Check it out: Bush does not answer a question of substance well the first time it's asked. Second time, though after advisers have coached him he does very well. Our country deserves so much better. So do Republicans.
