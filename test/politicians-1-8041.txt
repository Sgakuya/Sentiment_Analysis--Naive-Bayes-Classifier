I'll be frank-lin! I'm rating him so lowly to temper the excessive congratulations of other raters. Not a terrible president, FDR is largely and gigantically overrated. Didn't at all solve the Great Depression--any economist and historian knows that World War II ended the Great Depression. His reforms looked and smelled sweet but the insides were rotten. Probably prolonged the Great Depression by fabulously overspending (Keynesian economics--father of our national debt). Economy probably would have righted itself eventually like Hoover said, as ALL such depressions do, have done, and will do ever since. This was a depression like any other, it would have been righted like any other. But Roosevelt's lockbox policy on money kept money out of circulation and the economy stagnanted until WWII forced him to open it up again--when the country was cured strangely enough. Credited with the creation of the welfare state that is causing our society so many problems today. Did NOT help win WWII--the generals did that! Also, in many respects a near dictator who took the presidency four times rather hoggingly, who had an overwhelming democratic Congress that bowed down to his every wish and command so that anything he wanted to pass got passed--thereby eliminating the gov't's integral checks and balances system--save for the conservative Supreme Court. Roosevelt displayed his dictatorial wants when he tried to illegally add more judges to the Supreme Court and appoint Democrats to these new posts so that the only buffer against his complete control of gov't would be destroyed. The people didn't buy it; Roosevelt lost that one. Nice man, well-meaning, but too socialistic and arrogant. Given too much credit. Didn't stop the flow of the Depression at the start of his reign. Early government-help-the-people reforms started with Hoover, not Roosevelt. Thanks Hoover. Thanks Roosevelt: but stay in line. You got greedy for years as president, don't get greedy for too many stars.
