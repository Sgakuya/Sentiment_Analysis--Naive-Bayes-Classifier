Rage Against The Machines are capatialist phonies. Never the less they still manage to put out radio freindly pop medelys about fake revolutions that will never take effect because the people they NOW cater to is the same that listen to Blink 182 and Limp Bizkit. No offense.Their political messages are stale and dry attempts to make us believe we are fighting some great repression. Whatever. If you like pop music and Carson Daly go grab yourself a copy. What used to be a great band has now shrivled into nothing more than another cop out.Their music is a sweet sugar coated vision of teenage political rage.
