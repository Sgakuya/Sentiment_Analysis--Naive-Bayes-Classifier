The Arby's at Baxter, KY has the worst service and food of any Arby's I have ever visited. Just tonight I waited 11 minutes and when I received my food they had left out my salad, my dink, and an order of cheese sticks. I went back to tell them of the error and the guy was rude. I will never go back to the Arby's in Baxter, but really like the one in Barbousville, KY.
