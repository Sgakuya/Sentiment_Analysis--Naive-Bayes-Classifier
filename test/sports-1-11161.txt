Don't get me wrong, I am eternally grateful for everything Lloyd Carr has given us, but he just can't win the big games anymore and he can barely win the easy games. It is killing me that we have come to this. Even if we have a 7 or 8 win season (which other schools would die to have), we aren't improving and thats the problem, we're stuck in upper tier purgatory, better than most, but ultimately we are losers, continually falling below our potential. In the past few years we have been backsliding into a mediocre oblivion. 3 loses, 4 loses, now 5 loses this year. There comes a point where enough is enough. Even if we have 30 bowls in a row, what good does it do if you can't win any. It's also bullcrap that we can't beat Ohio State and Notre Dame and we're not dominating Michigan State. I swear I will kill myself if we let Michigan State become a legitimate rival or if I have to listen to another Ohio State fan tell me what that fag Jim Tressels record is against us. We are above that! We should be knocking there butts out of contention every year on the way to the Championship game not the other way around. But that is the way we are becoming, one of the good sometimes, bad most times, middle-of-the-road Big Ten teams; on par with the likes of Wisconsin, Minnesota, or Iowa. That is an embarrassment! It taints Michigan's Legacy and in my opinion is inexcusable. But what does the athletic director Bill Martin do? He goes and gives Coach Carr a raise! A raise, did I miss something? This is the worst season in 15 years and he gives Carr a raise? Obviously its perfectly ok with the senior leadership at Michigan to let this program go to waste. That's a slap in the face to the Michigan faithful. He's condoning Carrs degrading performance, WHY!? Because he won a "shared" championship almost 10 years ago? Because he won a share of the Big Ten title a few years? Thats freaking Bullsh*t!!! We should be winning the Big Ten outright and be in contention for the Championship every year. We are going to end up like Penn State, having a bunch of 3-8 seasons because they're afraid to fire the coach. Sure, we might have a good year once in a while but is it worth it? Does one national championship guarantee a coaching position for life? Give me a freaking break!!! We are better than that. The bottom line is this, what kind of team do you want? Do you want a team that is in contention for the championship every year, or do you want a progressively declining program that not even worthy of its own lineage. The most successful program in college football history needs an elite coach, and right now Coach Carr does not fit the bill. Im fed up with these stupid, unnecessary loses. I say out of respect give him one more year. If he doesnt improve drastically, I think he needs to find another program.
