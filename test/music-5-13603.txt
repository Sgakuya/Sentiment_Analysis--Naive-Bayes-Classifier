I don't see how someone could NOT like Eminem. He is the finest mo/fo rapper out there and I love his music, not to mention him. I love his new CD the Marshall Mathers LP cause he tells it like it is, and that inspires me to be what I want to be, and not let anyone say that I can't dress like that, or whatever....Marshall Mathers help me believe that I can express myself through anything, and not let other people stand in my way....thanx. 3 Heather (of wyoming, michigan....detroit's not that far away... ...keep smiling)
