A bad experience all the way. I am considering suing them - at the very least reporting them to the Better Business Bureau, and my lawyer will hear all about it and advise me. The charged me more than twice the original firm estimate, the moving-men badly scratched my hardwood floors. They said that the delivery date was 99 per cent certain, and then cancelled that delivery date with no firm assurance that the new delivery date is certain. They were friendly and polite initially, and now, despite my attempts at being tactful and patient, they are down right nasty. Jon in Washington State.
