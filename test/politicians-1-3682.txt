Look back at the courage of Franklin Roosevelt. You are nothing but a coward. Look back at John F. Kennedy. You are an idiot. Look at Jimmy Carter. You are Satan's own. LOOK at Lyndon Johnson. You are a New Englander (I don't care where you were born). Where are your parents from? You are not a Texan. I pray that God will judge and defeat you.
