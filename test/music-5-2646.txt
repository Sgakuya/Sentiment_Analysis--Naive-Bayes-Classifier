Melodically and lyrically, Abbey Road is one of the best pop music recordings of all time. If the Beatles had to go out, this was the right way to do it. It may not be as ground-breaking or influential as Sgt. Pepper s, but Abbey Road is the band s most mature and well-rounded effort. Sgt. Pepper s, to me, doesn t have the highly self-conscious, slightly dark edge that gives the White Album and Abbey Road a mesmerizing, almost forlorn quality. Songs like Here Comes the Sun and Oh! Darling are classics, and I never get tired of the Golden Slumbers / Carry That Weight / The End medley that closes the album and serves as the Beatles final goodbye.
