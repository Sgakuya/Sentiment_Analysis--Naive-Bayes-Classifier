This is my first time on this site. I just wanted to say, that I really enjoyed hearing Billy Gillmans voice. I think that some of the people who think this music is crap so to speak, have been listening too long of music about girlfriends who've done them wrong and lovemaking. It is refreshing to hear this kid sing, no matter how sissy he sounds. I hope he continues to sing, and I hope he does well. Best of luck to him.
