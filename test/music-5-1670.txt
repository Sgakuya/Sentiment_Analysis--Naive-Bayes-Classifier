This album is bloody amazing! It follows on nicely from Californication. The opening track- 'By The Way' is so easy to sing along to and the the lyrics are fantastic. One of my favourites is 'I Would Die For You'. You'll find that this is one of those albums where you can sing along to every single song - buy it.
