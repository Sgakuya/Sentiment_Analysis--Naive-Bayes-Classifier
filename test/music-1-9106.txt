Complete blah video. It is just showing you the nest pre packaged teeny singer girl to be put up for sale. Nothing new as far as videos are concerned. If this were up for commercial it might have gotten a two....Yea she plays her own instument and i give her props for that, but the video and song still suck. So did American Pie 2, which her song is in. Just had to mention it.
