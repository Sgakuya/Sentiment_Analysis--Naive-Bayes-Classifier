I have never heard any singer, young or mature with the quality of voice that Josh Groban displays in his widely varied selection of music. His natural ability to interpret a song's lyrics and his passion for the music make him one of a kind in the world of male vocalists, and because he's only 22 yrs old, we can only look forward to more amazing things from him. If I could award more stars, I would, because he's a wonderful human being also. He works very hard to insure he does justice to the languages, lyricists and musicians he works with.
