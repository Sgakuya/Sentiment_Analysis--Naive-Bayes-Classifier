This is a guy who potentially should have been the best quarterback in the nation this year. Somebody who is a precise passer and scrambles excellent, what more could you ask? But see, that was preseason. This 2005 season has been a major bust. True, A&M has had a ton of injuries to key starters, but Mcneal isn't helping when he throws the ball WAY to hard at his young receivers. He can only hope for a major breakthrough in the NFL. He needs to learn to handle pressure much better or his dream of being an NFL quarterback will be shot down.
