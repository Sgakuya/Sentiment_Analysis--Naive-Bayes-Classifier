It would take a miracle for the phillies to win a world series with this guy as their GM. I think he judges talent poorly (cough cough pat burrell), he doesnt want to spend money, he's clearly doesnt care about competing with the rest of the NL east, and he tries to create a false sense of excitement by talking up the team's has-beens and never-will-be's. He should take tips from Joe Banner on how to make a team. GET ED OUT OF PHILLY!!
