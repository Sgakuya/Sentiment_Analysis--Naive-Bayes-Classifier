Josh Groban has the best voice I have ever heard. I would just like to clear some things up for oyu people who only gave him one star. Josh is NOT clasically trained, nor is he an opera singer. With David Fosters guidence he has produces an amazing sound for an amazing cd. He is in a completely different category than Charlotte Church or Pavarotti and Elvis does not compare. His voice is unbelievable, a voice of heaven, not of Earth an thats why definately deserves more that 5 stars.
