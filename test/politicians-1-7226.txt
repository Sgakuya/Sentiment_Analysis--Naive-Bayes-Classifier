Jesse Jackson, who I will never honor with the title of Reverand, needs to take a hike! Get a job! Get A LIFE! Today he was shown leading a march with many African Americans (note: there are a lot of people who have dark skin and DETEST this label). They were saying that their voice wasn't heard on election day. If they voted, their voice was heard. So, is Mr. Jackson saying that he believes their voice should be heard *more* than any other group of people in America???? I believe he is. A Reverand? Concerned for ALL America? Interested in Justice? Patriotic! What a crock!
