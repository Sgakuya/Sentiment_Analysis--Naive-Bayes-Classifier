Measure of a Man is such a wonderful album, filled with songs that cover a range of emotions. From the pain of unrequited love in Invisible, to the joy of having a love that completes you in Perfect Day, to the heartbreak and bitterness of a breakup in I Survived You...Clay Aiken covers it all, and with the voice that leaves you breathless. He has a talent that is indescribable. This album was called the best pop album of 2003 by Billboard Magazine! Need I say more?
