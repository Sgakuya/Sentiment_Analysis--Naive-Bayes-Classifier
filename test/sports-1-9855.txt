Bye Miller, gonna miss ya. You'll be better off now that you've retired....especially after you've had to put up with the Pacers. Notice that the owner gave Reggie a Bentley.....I think he was bribed to stay in Indiana......hmmmmm......anywho..Pacers blow. Artest needs to go to prison and stay there and O'Neal needs to grow up. The team is held back by too much negativity......brought upon them by themselves to do anything.
