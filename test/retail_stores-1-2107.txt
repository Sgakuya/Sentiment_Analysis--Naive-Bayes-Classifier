I purchased a DVD player with two valid rebate from their site(one with the original UPc and one with copy of UPC)Only to find out a week later they they will honor only one rebate with original UPC and not the other one. Now I am holding the product without the UPC because I submitted that for rebate. And I can not return it or if I did the return will be less for the amout of rebate which I may not even get it because I returned the product. So now I am out $129 and holding a product that is not worth the amount I paid for excluding the rebate amount. What a rubbish company to do business with who can not honor their own advertised offer to millions of customers.
