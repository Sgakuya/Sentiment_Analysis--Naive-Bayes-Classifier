This is a little slice of heaven on earth! I can't get over the magic and exhuberant joy that the E Street Band manages to convey through every single second! From the very first song My Love Will Not Let You Down Bruce promises not to let us down (and keeps that promise, too!). He Proves it All Night , from Two Hearts to Atlantic City and Mansion on the Hill . Murder Incorporated , Badlands , Out in the Street , Youngstown , 10th Ave. Freeze Out , The River , American Skin , Land of Hope and Dreams , Born in the USA , Lost in the Flood , Don't Look Back , Ramrod , Jungleland (The one we've all been waiting for live!), Born to Run , Backstreets , If I should fall Behind , all of these songs convey that E Street Magic that we Springsteen fans have felt since the first time we ever heard the Boss! I can't find one thing bad about this whole double cd set, and I reccomend it STRONGLY! It will show anyone how, even at age 51(!) Bruce will always be the best in his class! In fact, he's in a class of his own, and this just proves it! I love it!!!!!
