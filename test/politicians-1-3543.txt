I won't call him President until he has won an election and been voted in by the people. He stole the election (rigged in Florida by manipulating the voter list then declared the winner by his cousin), he has been helped on his way by daddy, he supports the bombing and killing of innocent women and children, he won't let UN inspectors see the USA's weapons programme then condemns other countries for hiding theirs; he railroads the UN and the rest of the world into his lunatic, hypocritical ideas... oh and he is an idiot on top of it all.
