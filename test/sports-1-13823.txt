The saying goes: Don't quit your day job. Norv Turner epitamizes this saying in every way. In Dallas he proved himself to be one of the greatest offensive coordinators in the league. As a head coach he was just offensive. He had one good season with the Redskins, and i think even that may have been a fluke. He had a hard time dealing with the hands-on approach of Dan Snyder and he'll have the same problem with the owners in Oakland.
