My boyfriend just proposed to me yesterday, in which I am very happy. Later that night I found out he had payed way to much for my dream ring at this store.I flipped out, and said that was outragous! He took the ring back today saying it was the wrong one, and bought it at the very best store ******s.Sorry I can not give my secret out, but he saved $2000.Now I'm the happiest soon to be bride.
