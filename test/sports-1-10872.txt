To be the top two coaches in the country, one must have a universally recognizable good deam. Say what you want about recruiting (umm... Mack Brown can recruit, does that make him a top pick?), UVA isn't even the best team in the state, and until it is, no one has any right to proclaim Groh as anything more than a POTENTIAL up-and-comer.
