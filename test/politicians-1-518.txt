I admire Nelson Mandela for being a political prisoner who has risen through the ranks, but I am otherwise not impressed. He is basically seen as more of a figurehead - like the Queen or the Pope - but sadly does not inspire much in the way of politics. It makes me a little disappointed to see him flying around the world meeting the world leaders, while his country back home suffers under a crippling crime rate.
