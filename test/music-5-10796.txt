P!NK is my favorite singer! Everyday I have to listen to her album, and every song means something. I can relate a lot of things to her songs. She has a beutiful voice, got great hair and is awesome all together. She's got awesome beats, kick butt tunes, and can dance to them. I have all these pictures of her hanging in my room. I love P!NK. She is #1!
