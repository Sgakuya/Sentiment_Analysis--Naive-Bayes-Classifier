Goodbye, Jesse and thanks a lot! You have now ground your reputation and our credibility as liberals into the mud. To think that some of us defended you for years, as though you were a remaining member of the MLK inner circle who could keep our eyes on the prize ...To think that I argued with my right wing relatives over your character and value as a spokesman for people of color... You have proven yourself to be the embodiment of the stereotype of blacks - create babies without dads wherever you go... AND a milennial doofus like Larry King and the rest of the codgers.... IF you were going to fool around, and I have no problem with that if your wife is cool with it, you could at least have prevented a baby. Are you PROUD of the 70% + of blacks who are born out of wedlock? Well, the rest of us, including your legitimate children, are tired of supporting them financially and socially. (10K a month will NOT shield her from the pain and deprivation of her birth.) PLEASE for the sake of the left side of the aisle, for the sake of the people of color needing true leadership....GO AWAY. ( AND treat yourself to a vasectomy.) A furious liberal supporter.
