DON'T SHOP AT WHITEHALL!!! I purchased an engagement ring in October and was told by the manager (John) in the Albany NY store that the ring was totally platinum. Got home and the card which shows what the ring is actually made of said just the prongs were platinum. I called the store immediately and was told that I was correct and they would replace the white gold with platinum. After several phones calls, it was obvious I was getting the run around and they were not giving me the platinum band. I don't believe they ever intended to. They were just jerking me around. It is now January 2006 and I never received the platinum band. I will be notifying the better business bureau and taking other legal action as well. This was supposed to be one of the happiest experiences of my life, but let me tell you it was certainly one of the WORST!! I think the few folks that gave Whitehall a good rating....got lucky.
