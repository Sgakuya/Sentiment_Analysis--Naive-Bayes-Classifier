I work at a Friendly's as well as a few others that have commented and the reason for the bad service is not because of your server (unless they are straight out rude to you.) but because of management. My restaurant is always understaffed because corporate forces them to understaff everyone. Everyday the cooks are slow. They do it on purpose to punish the servers who they blame for punching in your order too fast. If you send something back unless your server can fix it themselves good luck to you because I can not get my grill cooks to remake food correctly, or even get my management to get them to remake it correctly. We make ice cream, we host, we deliver food, we bus tables, and we have mystery shops held over our head constantly. Every shift I have i'm expected to stick around until they feel like sending me home because they understaff so bad. The reason why your service is bad is because they keep trying to save money and slack on staff to help the servers. The reason why I still work there is because I can't find a job that I will make this money at and be able to go to school and pay rent/bills. Please if you dine their and your server is nice believe me they are trying their best.
