If you liked Dre's first CHRONIC album, Chronic 2001 is a must! Dre came back with dope, mellow beats one can just 'chill to'. With the addition of Eminem, Snoop, Corrupt, Nate Dogg and Hitman, this album was #1 throughout the country. Hits from this album, 'xplosive,' 'Dre,' and more are played on the radio constantly.
