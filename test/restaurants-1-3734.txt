I recently visited a Cici's for the first time and was horribly shocked. The restaurant was brand new...still had its "grand opening" banner hung above the entrance. The only reason why I even went was because of some coworkers. Anyways, the price is ridiculous for the quality of food they are trying to give you even if it is "all you can eat." I asked for a refund before even trying the food. The tables were unclean, I had to wipe something gross off my chair before sitting. The bus boy or girl drives a cart around with dirty dishes and uneaten food piled ungodly high right by your table while you are eating. They slosh undrunk sodas into pitchers right in front of you....it was digusting. Not to mention that I about fell due to the layer of grease that coated the tiled floors. The pizza looked and smelled unedible...digusting cheese that looked like it had been cooked three days ago and was laid out under the heat lamps until then. Very unsatisfied with the service. The manager did not even know how to give me my refund. He wanted me to write another check instead of just paying me the difference (my husband insisted on trying it so his portion we still paid for that). Did not seem to care about my obvious unhappiness with their food, service, or facilities. Never again.
