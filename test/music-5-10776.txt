If i had to be stuck on an island forever and could have only one cd i would choose PINK! This cd is one of the GREATEST cds in the WORLD!!! It has some great songs that any girl can relate to. I belive every girl SHOULD have this cd. If you only have $20 to spend and thats it for the rest of your life I suggest getting PINK Cant Take Me Home because it is soooo good! I love you PINK!
