Ozzfest is an awesome show, not only do you get to see one of the last and greatest fathers of heavy meatal preform but you get to see alot of current bands too. I have seen Ozzfest in the DC area and in Somerset WI. and though the Somerset concert is much better Ozzy and the rest of the bands put on a great show. Hell where else can you get inked while a concert is going on?
