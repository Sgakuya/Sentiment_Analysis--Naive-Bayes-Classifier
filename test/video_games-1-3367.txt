GOD I HATE THIS GAME the game was revelutionary for the time but after extensive gameplay (2 min.) The game had lost its appeal wow i can sit there and pull 900's till i turn blue but nothing beats going out and breaking a sweat, or an arm skateboarding. Games are suppose to spark the imagination and lets us take adventures we could not take otherwise. Like pilot a plane or fight a demon to the death. Why would there be a game with many clones for a normal task.. what next a game on how to eat?
