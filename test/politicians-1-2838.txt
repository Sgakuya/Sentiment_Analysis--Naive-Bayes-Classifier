Who the hell is Harry Browne? Oh right he's a libertine Republican. This is the party of the cheap liberals. They have all the same principals as the left but they don't want to pay for the consequences of those beliefs or even require anybody else to pay as well. The left on the other hand want somebody else beside themselves to pay for their problems. In the case the Libertines (By the way this isn't a typo) are little more honest.
