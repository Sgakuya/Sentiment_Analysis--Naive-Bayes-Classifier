I hate Kmart. Their stores are ugly, dirty, and cramped, everything they sell is really cheesy, and their selection is quite limited. The only thing I can say in defense of Kmart is that they're cheap, but other department stores are just as cheap and not nearly as crappy. Stores like Wal-Mart and Target have made Kmart obsolete and Kmart don't seem to be doing anything about that...they keep getting worse while the other chains keep getting better.
