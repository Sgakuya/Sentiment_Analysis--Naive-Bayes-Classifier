Worst than Netanyahu! Now Israel is bombing and even planting bombs on the Palestinians - he has (again after Liban) turned his country into a terrorist state! Israel deserves better. By the way, why not give the Palestinians back their own? (It's not Israel's, so it should be nothing to them - Bible says more about values than borders)
