Yeah right, Grey Davis was great. Man, anyone can see he was a huge screw up. Maybe as a person he was great and all but as far as running a state, he has got to be the worst governor in the history of CA. During his rein in office he put California deeper into debt by almost seven billion dollars. Yeah what a great guy he was. I am thankful Arnold is our new governor. He is letting the people of California vote on laws and policy in CA and not the state assembly. The assembly is blocking Arnold because of their political bias. So, like the recall election, the people get to decide how best to run our great state. I would like to hear an opinion on why Grey Davis was good at all. Grey Davis last action as governor was to raise the car tax by 215%. My car registration went from 185 dollars a year to 560 dollars. Yeah, Grey Davis was the man. The funny thing is Arnold still lifts weights and runs the state of CA and he is doing a way better job than Davis. Maybe Davis should have lifted some weights himself and we would have been better off. VIVA ARNOLD!!
