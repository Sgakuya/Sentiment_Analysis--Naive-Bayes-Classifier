He gets a lot of credit for the economy but nobody seems to be able to say exactly what he did to make the economy good. How can anyone be a good president and be a dishonest person at the same time? If he cheated on his wife how could we trust him not to cheat on us as a country? If he would just have admited his mistakes I would have trusted him more. But he justified himself. One classic example is when he said he was so busy taking care of the country that he didn't have time to think about his family. No - we're not that stupid. It's more like he was too busy taking care of himself to think about his family or the country.
