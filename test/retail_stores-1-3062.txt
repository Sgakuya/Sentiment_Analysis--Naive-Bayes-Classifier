What a terrible real estate group. In the Hudson, OH office, there are terrible stories about them. The office tore up a deal because it was with the wrong title company. They blackball realtors who do anything to make them unhappy. The manager at the office is a witch. One realtor was threatened because she used the wrong title company. Whatever you do, do not sell your house through them!!!
