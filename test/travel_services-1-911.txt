Awful packing and protecting furniture and appliances. ALL APPLIANCES WERE SCRATCHED AND DENTED. Dining room table scratched. The walls/floors/carpeting IN BOTH LOCATIONS we damaged to some degree. TO OUR AMAZEMENT, THE MOVERS CLAIMED ALL THE DAMAGE HAD ALREADY BEEN AND PROCEEDED TO GET INCREASING RUDE! WOW! Must be a huge market demand for movers in Raleigh, NC, otherwise they would be out of business.
