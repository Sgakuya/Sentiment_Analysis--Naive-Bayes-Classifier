I know it must be a hard job to be Prime Minister, but he has no excuss!!!!! Barak was horrible for Israel! What was he thinking when he was offering Jerusalem?!! Jerusalem is ours now and forever!!!!! He was going to make agreements without passing it by the knesset, What was he thinking?! He was out of his mind, and just because he was out of his mind we should not have to suffer. I am glad Sharon will be Prime Minister instead of Barak, now HOPEFULLY Sharon can get us peace without paying a highh price, Hoping for the best
