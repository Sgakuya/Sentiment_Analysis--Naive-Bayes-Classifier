The corn pone Genghis Khan. Inititated and totally mismanaged an unnecessary war while thousands died. He had enough guts to send Americans into action into a nothing place but was petrified over possible Soviet and Chinese reactions. They should have been worrying about us rather than the other way around. When Ike was the president-elect, he went to Korea and told the Chinese that he would definitely drop the bomb if they did not come to the table. Sadly, with Ike there would have been no Vietnam conflict because he knew better and he had warned us about the military-industrial complex. And, there are a lot of questions about that assassination that I wish had been answered rather than covered by that polecat's stooges.
