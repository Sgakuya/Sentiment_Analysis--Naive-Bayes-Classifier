This album isn't ranked as highly as Sgt Pepper or as Revolver, and it was made at a time when the Beatles were fed up with each other. However, it is a work of art, a mixture of toughness and tenderness. Although tunes like Revolution 9 and Obladi Oblada do not satisfy, they are redeemed by standouts like Dear Prudence, While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Happiness is A Warm Gun. Helter Skelter gives us a side of Paul we've never seen before-the horny screamer. Although the album is very disjointed, due to the prevailing disunity of the Beatles at the time, the prevailing theme seems to be a longing for tenderness in a chaotic and violent world.
