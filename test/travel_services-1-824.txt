The SEPTA is the worst subway system I have ever ridden. The fares are ridiculous. Anyone want to buy SEPTA coins off me... So you can see how un-sanitary,un-helpful,and un-monitored germ infested rathole of a subway system the SEPTA is. If you go to Philly and have to take a train I'd reccomend you stay above ground.
