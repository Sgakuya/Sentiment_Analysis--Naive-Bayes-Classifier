By far the best album to come out in a long time. No promotion, no videos, no commercials, and it shoots to #1 its first week on the Billboard charts. They melt pop and rock together in such a way that boggles the mind. In my opinion, this is a concept album rating up there with Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and a breakthrough album the likes of Nevermind. Excellent.
