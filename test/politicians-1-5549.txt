Its sad to see that a person can buy an election. But at least those of us who live in New Jersey don't have to see and hear his annoying comercials anymore. Bob Franks has experience and has many positive acheivements on his record. Its sad to see he lost to the allmighty dollar. Corzine cares about only one thing, power. All of his proposals include record breaking new spending. And where do you think that money will come from? Us! He is not just a problem for New Jersey but for the entire country since he is a senator. Hey Mr. Corzine. Since you think this country has to spend so much more why don't you spend your own money? If you can spend $ 65 million on a campaign, then you must love your country enough to spend money on your new proposals. Leave us alone we are all taxed enough!
