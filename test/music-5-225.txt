This album is not only beautiful, but inspirational. Every song on this song is sung with originality and feeling. Every song is another stage that Billy Corgan went through. The album is so thick with emotion that the final song (Luna) is the perfect way to end any album, it leaves you feeling like everything is alright. The Smashing Pumpkins are the most under appreciated band ever. With the quality of work that they have put out i am amazed that they are not regarded as highly as some bands with 0 talent have been.
