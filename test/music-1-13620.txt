Hi, I'm Eminem. Just here to tell you that I'm a big, fat phony. When you look at me you see the result of many meetings between turbo white guys at record companies who wanted a way to sell more rap albums. The black artists who actually had talent and made the music, well, they were just to scary for Wal-Mart so they thought lets get these guys to write rap music and we'll have a white guy say he did it! Yeah! A white guy who looks just like all the chestless losers who buy the albums and sustain the industry. And we'll legitimize him by paying black artists like Dre to say he's okay and pay a bunch of black guys to act like his buddies. Plus, he'll say all sorts of inflammatory, homophobic things in an effort to hide his own obvious homosexuality. Wasn't I lucky that I fit the bill!! Well, my fifteen minutes is about up, see ya later!!!
