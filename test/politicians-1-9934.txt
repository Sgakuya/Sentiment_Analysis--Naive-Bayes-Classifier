UPDATE: I recently noticed my hyperlink was incorrectly typed so here is the corrected version. *(re-submitted to correct grammatical errors)* If all that Bush has done thus far is, not only not enough to convince you that he is a poor president, but actually a great one, then nothing could possibly change your mind. I won't run down the laundry list of Bush's shortcomings, because it has already largely been covered. Let me instead direct my ire towards Cait2040, who makes a very weak case for the president. Your bio claims "I am open to the views of others ( if they make sense, are backed up with logic and fact, and are not just based on emotion)." Really? Lets see about that. I don't know where you get your information, but I would certainly like to see the "logic and fact" that supports the following quote("let Saddam Hussein dictate and murder millions of innocents and harbor terrorists.") Could that be just a little bit "based on emotion?" There is no denying Saddam was one of the worst dictators on the planet, but your unsubstantiated claims are specious at best. I believe the number of his victims could be quite high, but forgive me if its a little difficult to take you on your word. As for harboring terrorists in Iraq, that is not what the 9/11 Commission Report says. Read it. As you descend into the shallow rant about "hardly that notable considering all the people who hate him and use these things against him are pot heads and druggies, or are friends with them *don't lie*" your argument is exposed for the propagandist nonsense that it is. Can you tell me for certain that all those who hate bush abuse drugs? If so maybe YOU should be president. You see the point. Once you have given yourself over to such hollow attacks on those who oppose the president you tell everyone not to take your argument seriously. Let me ask you something about that trickle-down economics theory you support. What is the guarantee that this money will be spent on the creation of jobs? Furthermore, do you really believe the ultra-rich (the main beneficiaries of Bush's tax cuts) are motivated to do that? The results of these 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are not something that is immediately felt for either its benefits or its detriments. The problem is they have to paid for right now. Do you know how we are paying for them? We are borrowing money from foreign countries. Our government has borrowed money from overseas to finance these cuts and that money not only has to be paid back, but there is the small matter of interest. The interest we paid on our national debt in the last fiscal year was somewhere in the $300+ billion range (nevermind the principal). Given, Bush is certainly not responsible for all of this, but giving tax cuts to the very wealthiest in this country does not help. You can expect some other president down the line to be forced to raise taxes because of this recklessness. "George Bush is an all american." What does that mean exactly? I doubt you have ever even thought about it, much less are able to answer it. The claim about Bush winning both elections, while true, does not mention one key fact that is undisputed. More people voted for Al Gore in the general election (by about 500,000) than did for Bush. Check any almanac. Or if you like here is a web site. http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm "he cares about problems that effect our future ( and not the doomsday theories of radical environmentalists)." How do you know this? Because he told you? Or is it because when he gets in front of a microphone and speaks to the nation, that hickish bumbling is just to charming for someone who might deceive you? There are many quotes like this in your rating that contradict your claim of "I am open to the views of others ( if they make sense, are backed up with logic and fact, and are not just based on emotion)." In fact you claim this twice!!! The starry-eyed, unabashedly militaristic, wrap-yourself-in-the-flag-so-you-can-sleep-well-at-night-superpatriot is an unconvincing argument for why a president is effective.
