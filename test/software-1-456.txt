Windows ME is a complete piece of s__t. It came installed on 2 of my Dell computers. Crashes and compatiblity issues caused me to upgrade to XP. I don't know if it upgrades well because I reformated my HD before installing XP. I wanted no trace of this crap anywhere!! Microsoft should be embarrassed they ever issued this.
