Took a Top 25 established program right out of the rankings. He took a high powered, prolific offense down to the 100's in D1A. He took Top 25 recruiting classes at GT never to be seen again. He entered the GT program with a cupboard full of talent and on his own ... turned it into a mediocore football program. His recruiting classes are ranked in the bottom of the ACC just above Duke! Terrible coach and this terrible coach has made his terrible mark at GT!
