This is a good album. Even though I'm not really into computerized type music, this is still a really good album. Face it, these guys can really sing. Maybe not as good as Frank Sinatra or something but they should still be appreciated. Their voices aren't computerized and they actually sing live at their concerts. (Unlike Britney Spears)
