At least Clinton was a talented liar, Gore is corrupt and full of delusions of grandeur. Some of his views are radically asinine (see virtually all of EARTH IN THE BALANCE), but truthfully, I know that he doesn't take any of them seriously. Page 173 talks about the need to tax gasoline to discourage the consumption thats destroying the world (btw, USA absorbs more CO2 than it puts out). Now that people are worried about high gas prices, he starts pointing figures at over-regulated oil companies and even GWB (how he's supposedly responsible, I don't know). Four more years of this kind of phony leadership -- accusing everyone of not being as compassionate as he, at the same time that he denies basic repairs to the tenants of the shack he rents out -- is truly a RISKY SCHEME.
