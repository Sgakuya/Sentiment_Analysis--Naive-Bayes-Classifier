The joke used to be that Smith was going to be fired and replaced with Linda Lovelace- she might blow a few now nd then but she wouldn't choke on the big one like Smith habitually did. The two Smith finally won were accidents caused by the two biggest choke plays in NCAA history- Georgetown was about to take the lead when one of their guys threw the ball to James Worthy, who was so out of position defensively that he thought he was a teammate. Michigan was about to win in the closing minute when Webber called a timeout with none left and got called for a technical. The other joke was that Smith was the best defensive coach in history becuase he held Michael Jordan under 20 points a game.
