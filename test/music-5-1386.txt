U2 fans are excited about their new album because it is supposed to be similar to Joshua Tree, their classic from the '80's. Though short, only 11 songs, the album is full of haunting music- The Edges superb guitar playing, Bono's wail. They give voice in 4 minutes to certain social justice issues that others simply couldn't say.
