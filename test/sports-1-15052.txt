...or as I now think of him after his many dingy post-trial television interviews - O.J. Simpleton. To quote the great Bugs Bunny - what a MAROON! I agree with Snoopy - I don't care what kind of football player this has-been was - he is first and foremost a murder who got away with it. And, like one of his murdering predecessors Lizzy Borden he did so because of many extenuating circumstances that should NEVER have become part of his trial or the investigations. In Lizzy s case the truth was lost partly due to Victorian prudishness. O.J. s case was slightly more complicated and even more ridiculous; we had the odd little selection of bumbling Keystone cops, a bird-brained prosecution team, an alleged judge who quickly fell in love with his media enlarged head, and O.J.'s own nightmarish dream team fanning the racial tension fires for all they were worth. I hope the jury is still cringing with the thoughts of their colossal stupidity in handing down such a travesty of a decision. But since the very words O.J. Jury is now synonymous with things like weak minded, easily swayed, and tiny intellect I doubt they lose much sleep over it. (never repeat yourself when you can simply cut and paste yourself)
