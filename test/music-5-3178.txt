Fantastic album any way you look at it. Stevie Nicks' Dreams, and Christine McVie's haunting Songbird make the album worthwhile all by themselves, but there are several other gems on this one. Go Your Own Way, Never Going Back Again, and You Make Loving Fun are all superb song-craft. No wonder it sold a zillion copies.
