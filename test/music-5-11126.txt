Britney Spears is the very image of bubble gum pop. Teens like her music (and her body) and adults find her music very bland. While the music on this CD is very much like the music on ...Baby One More Time (Oops! I Did It Again is the mirror image of the aforementioned song), I don't see why she should have to do any major renovating. This is the same stuff that made her a multi-millionaire in the first place! Overall, this CD is better than her first, as it has more music that is worth listening to. Check out Oops!, Stronger, ...Knockin' On My Door, Can't Make You Love Me, etc. This CD is great for fans of the first album who want more of the same.
