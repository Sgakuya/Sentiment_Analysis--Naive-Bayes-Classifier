I can't say enough great things about this album! Every song is great! If I had to choose a favorite it would probably be either Dancing in the Dark (which I listen to every night as I'm falling asleep!) or I'm Goin Down, or maybe Glory Days. Heck, My Hometown is great too! The Boss is the BEST! He's hot too!
