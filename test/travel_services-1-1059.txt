I had booked with this company in June. Had my confirmation date of the move and corresponded with them weekly. I had my confirmation number and was paying credit card. The were supposed to call the day before the move. No call. I called them and they had no record of my move. No apologies nothing. Thankfully my credit card wasnt charged. However, I had to scramble to find a reputable company to move my furniture. My advice is to stay away from this company. I learned and expensive mistake. Stay with a company that has a local office.
