I too would give less than one star if I could. My boyfriend bought me a march birthstone set with the ring, the necklace and the ear rings. The ring was too small so they sent it out to get re-sized, I got the ring on time, infact I got the ring 2 days before promised. Only to find out when i got the ring, the people who re sized it did a half assed job, They must have been drunk or something. My ring was scratched where they took the gold from, and the sides were uneven. it was a terrible job. AND the sales person didn't have the foresight to tell me that next month (March)the set would be on sale for 1/2 the price (100.00) May not seem like alot of money, but it's the principal of the whole thing. if I can save 100 dollars TELL ME!!!!!!! P.S Wish me luck. My B/f bought our wedding set at Kays. I only hope nothing goes wrong with our rings!!!
