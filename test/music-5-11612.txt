This is'nt one of Blinks best Cds,but its hysterical!!Dumpweed and All the Small things are great!But the two(and only two)serious songs,Adams Song and Going Away to College are totally kick ass to.If i were'nt obsessed with them i would'v gave it a 4,cause most of the songa are way to short.Overall the CD is awsome!!!
