Nasty, rude staff, down in the sewer corner of the Riverwalk where the water either stagnates or floods Casa Rio far too frequently. The food is the typical SA tourist trap Tex-Mex variety - you native San Antonians know what I mean. There are 999 better Mexican/latin restaurants I can name off the top of my head that I would go to before I came here. Gross.
