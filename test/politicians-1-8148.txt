I think President Kennedy is a national hero for being assassinated, but sadly, a poor President. Many rate him highly brcause of their vision of what he could have done, but in his two years as president he accomplished little and there is no reason to see that he would have finished his presidency differentlty. The Cuban missile crisis, an event often billed as one of his greatest accomplishments did not escalate into war because of the actions of Khruschev. Repeatedly the USSR was given ample reason to be angered by the US and did not fire missiles on the US because of their premier, not Kennedy.
