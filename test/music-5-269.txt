 Homogenic , Bjork's forth solo album, includes songs that are truly beautiful both musically and lyrcally. The first song on the album, Hunter , has the most entrancing beat that plays like some other-worldly military on march into battle. In Joga , a string octet, mournful and beautiful, play behind Bjork's intensifying vocals. Some of the tracks are dance music for those who prefer to be intellectually stimulated as well as physically stimulated. Pluto has a heavy static sound and pausing beat. Alarm Call is a little more pop sounding, but still as unconventional as the rest of the tracks. Perhaps this album is for the more discriminting electronica fiend but for those who are in the know, know that Homogenic is certainly the result of someone who can easily be called a genius!
