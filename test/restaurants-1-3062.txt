After dinner we decided to stop by the location in Millbury, MA. The staff was pleasant but ice cream was some of the worst I've every had at a premium ice cream parlor. It had a gummy consistancy that left a coating on my tongue. I love ice cream but was unable to finish this, it was terrible. I am amazed at the high ratings some people posted. In fact, my 5 year old wanted cake dough (or cake mix) he took one bite and started crying because he was so looking forward to having ice cream and he made the mistake of asking for cake dough. My wife order here ice cream with mix ins and they were almost no existant. She said she'd rather have a Blizzard. I hate DQ but in this case I'd have to agree.
