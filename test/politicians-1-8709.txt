Although the best known of the forgettable presidents, Grover Cleveland is still best forgotten. Firstly, he was a snob and refused to cough up money for injured war veterans. Secondly, he LOVED the workingman--he treated the strikers at the monumental Pullman Strike of the early 1890's with a welcoming boatload of scabs and strike-beaters. Cleveland's days were a sad time for civil rights of both workers and blacks (Plessy vs. Ferguson). He humiliated the nation in the Panic of 1893 when the gov't was so impoverished that he had to beg J. P. Morgan to lend the nation money. Also, he was a little bit of a sicko. He raised a young girl called Frances in his household. When she was 21 he married her--he was 48. A bit like marrying your daughter... nice man, worked hard, lots of grit--but as I said, better forgotten...
