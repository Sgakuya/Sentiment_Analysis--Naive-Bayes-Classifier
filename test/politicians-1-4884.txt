part of the real axis of evil with Asskoft and Cheney. I'd hate to be his wife because his macho Defense (or should I say offense) Dept. approach suggests not much below the belt. Too bad he has to drag the rest of the world into his overcompensation. His recent tirade on the media showing the same vase being removed from the Iraq museum is classic complete with sorority girl smarm: Like, my God! They showed the same thing over again! Like there's even that many vases in Iraq! Duuuh! Well, there aren't anymore thanks to you Donny. See you in hell, warmonger.
