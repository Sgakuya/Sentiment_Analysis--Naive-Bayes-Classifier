The game is fun for about a week until you realize how kiddish this game is. It's too easy and not very complex. There are no items to collect (except for gags), the tasks are all the same, and it has way too much.. security on the chat. It's good for little kids that aren't yet developed in the mind yet. So all you other intellectuals don't try this one. Try better ones like Runescape or World of Warcraft. They have a lot more to do
