Socialist libiot. Her comments against Bush on 4-30-03 were hilarious. Since when is it un-patriotic if you dont support this current administration? Who has said that? No one has said that. Her screaming and yelling at the top of her lungs were completely unnecessry and was nothing more than a popularity stunt.
