First of all, when someone calls this group the Fab Four I want to throw up. If anything they were the Fag Four or Drab Four. It seems that fans of this group can't stand that anyone hates the Beatles. Yes, you Beatle fans, a lot of people don't like the Beatles. This album further justifies why I think they sucked.
