How can we get the networks to stop interviewing this clown. He is an insult to humanity, Christianity and if I were black I would start a huge organization against him. He desires only to keep the blacks in the past and in their failures. Lets look on the bright side Mr. Jackson. Things are looking up for your people as I see it. Go and find a real job.
