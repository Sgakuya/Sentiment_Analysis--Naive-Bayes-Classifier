The Boss is one of the greatest performers of all-time. His concerts of the 70s are legendary and he still can rock better than anyone else. He does a great job of mixing great and different versions of familiar songs with stories. He also changes the set list from show to show which is great for those of us who try to go to as many shows as possible.
