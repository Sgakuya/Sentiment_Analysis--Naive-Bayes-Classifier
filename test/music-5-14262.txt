All of the above comments say everything that has to be said for this soundtrack, in terms of commentary. Comes in two basic flavors -- The Star Wars Anthology (1993), a 4CD set that covers the trilogy, with 98% of the first movie's score; about 94% of Empire Strikes' Back score, and sadly only 67% of Return of the Jedi's score. Flavor # 2 : Two-CD sets --released in '97 with the Special Editions -- for all three entries of the classic trilogy, and all 99% to 100% complete. My only question is -- why aren't the sdtk.s for Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi on this list?
