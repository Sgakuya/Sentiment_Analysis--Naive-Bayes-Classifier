UPDATE: For those finding this entry "not helpful", let me get this straight. A US Senator makes the clearly false analogy of our prisoner camp to the three most evil regimes in history ON THE SENATE FLOOR, then makes a feeble statement that sounds like an apology but only to those "IF they were offended", and some think he's a good guy? Let me remind any confused souls that NO ONE was killed at Gitmo. MILLIONS were killed by the Pol Pot, Nazi and Soviet Gulag regimes. False analogies like these by high ranking officials in our government significantly hurt our troops by fueling anti-American hatred. So, this begs the question to essentially anyone who backs such blatantly false statements; What is it that you disagree with? If it is not purely politically based, then what possibly could you say to defend what he said? One can only deduce that you must blindly support democrats/libs empty, negative agenda and denounce those who ardently speak for what they believe in, myself included! With all due respect earthbound, if the truth offends democrats, than so be it!! To use Goering as a point of defense for Durbin's criminal remarks implies the US has evil, deceptive motives, so good for you if you agree with this blather. People blow my mind who don't appreciate that the US is the greatest country and treats prisoners better than anyone IN THE WORLD, NOW AND IN HISTORY!! Where's the dems/libs outrage at how the enemy treats the inocent around the world out of their radical ideology of Islam or BLAM?! Lance is spot on about no dems/libs not having the fortitude or integrity to speak up against this language because MOST AGREE WITH IT!!!
