I wish there was some way I could give this blue-nosed prick a 0 rating. This man is the greatest threat to our individual liberties since Richard Nixon. Actually, he's probably even worse than Nixon. At least Tricky Dick wasn't always trying to shove the bible down our throats. Ashcroft's campaign to spend thousands of dollars of taxpayer's money to cover the naked breast on the Statue of Justice says everything that needs to be said about this Christofascist. The biggest menace to public safety to emerge from Missouri since Jesse James and Bloody Bill Quantrell.
