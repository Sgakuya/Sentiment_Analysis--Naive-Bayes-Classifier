Bad band, bad song, bad video. What exactly, may I ask, is the point of watching a lot of people leap around the room in their underclothes while terrible music is played in the background? Watching this video on MTV just made me want to throw up. Whatever happened to making music videos that had something to do with the song? Not to mention, whatever happened to making videos that were half decent, even if the song was not tops? Whatever happened to the music video as an art from, not a chance to see morons running around drunk? What exactly happened to music videos?
