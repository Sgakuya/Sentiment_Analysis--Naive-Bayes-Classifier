Cheney is probably the most frightening and corrupt member of the administration. If he is such a good businessman, then why did he help steer the world's largest economy into a steep nosedive while ensuring that he and his friends would continue to become wealthier and wealthier. Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of economics would tell you that tax breaks for the rich will never jumpstart the economy because during a recession (i.e. right now) investors tend to bank their capital since it is perceived as too risky to invest it. He is a good businessman the way Pablo Escobar was a good businessman.
