This is, hands down, the worst ice cream I've ever eaten. The flavors were so weak we could barely tell the difference between chocolate and vanilla (sweet cream). The mix-in ingredients added nothing but texture, chemicals and sugar. I felt sorry for the staff, having to sing out about tips and whatever they were doing. But it was the terrible quality that will keep me away. Why is everyone eating this stuff?
