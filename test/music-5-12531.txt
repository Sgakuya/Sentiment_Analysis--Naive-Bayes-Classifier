What can I say? 2Pac is the greatest rapper ever to live. On this album you get some of his unreleased cuts that I consider some of the best songs he's ever written. 2Pac's greatest hits offers listeners the essence of his rap although we can't delve into it too much because I think his later rap gets better, but we still get a taste of his style and the way his rap evolves.
