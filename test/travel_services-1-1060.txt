One of the worst night mare. This was my first move after a longtime. I was looking for a cheap and reliable rates. MY mistakes I never check any rates. This company is a rip off. They give you a low estimate on the phone upfront and ask for a deposit. Now the day they come to pick up ur stuff. They double or even triple the cost. Now ur stuck as u have already made plans and paid the deposit. Their simple answer I was not the one who took the order........... that is a scam. Now once they pick up ur stuff. They will only show u the contract for few min and during that time they will be insisting if u want to put ur tip there. So you hardly figure out what u are sign. Nobody gives u details.Once the stuff is gone u forget it On the back of the contarct it is written 9 month in small letteres that protects them. their insurance carrier sucks. Their handling of stuff is bad. On delivery they want cash from u. Trust me it was a nightmare. All u will end up will be phone calls to the people u don't even know. Stuff on delivery was broken and boxes missing. Insurance doesn't cover nothing so u loose a lot try to save few bucks. Go with a reputable company. Never ever use this company.All they want is money from u. Don't fell in the trap.
