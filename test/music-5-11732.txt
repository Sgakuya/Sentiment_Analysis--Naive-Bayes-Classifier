I luv this cd, I think that Benji and Joel r brave for writing about their past the way that the hav. This cd is AWESOME!!!!! I luv how they hav not only hard punk songs on it, but they hav somethin for everyone. Whether u like punk or not. It's hard not to find a song u don't like on the young and the hopeless.
