The interview on Meet the Press was a total joke. I tried to email him regarding a number of issues he brought up during the interview and after reading his baseless rhetoric on his website. This guy wants to be President (he is thinking of running in 2008). He has been on the Hill for 30 years. I am 31. He is on the Judicial Review and Foreign Affairs committees making decisions that effect me. I got an email saying he couldn't respond to me because I don't live in Delaware. 785,300 people live in Delaware, 45th in population size out of 50. How in the explicative does he plan to run a country? Well, since he doesn't have a plan for anything else I suppose he will just follow pattern.
