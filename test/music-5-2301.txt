For those not familiar with Knapp, she's not just an acoustic guitar playing singer with an edgy voice, but also a songwriter, and her lyrics are excellent and intimate, about the Christian walk or pilgrimage. Kansas (which I think was her first album) is my favorite of her albums, which are all good. Don't know anyone that didn't like it.
