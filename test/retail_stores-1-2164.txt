As a former worker os the Shack, i can say with certainy that the company has being driven into the ground. in the last year and a half, upper management have fired many loyal managers by using their loss prevention managers to dig into many vet managers store operations to find any dirt they can use to can them to save money. This from a company who calls themselves honest, loyal, trustworthy, and supportitive to their people. They are now a bunch of back-stabbbing conniving penny-pinchers looking for a quick-scheme to make money at the customer and the employees expense. Don't shop there! Take adiise from a former 13 year loyal senior manager who got the shaft from the shack.
