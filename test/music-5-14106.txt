I noticed that people just gave this album 1 star just so it wouldn't be listed as number one. I would bet my house, car, kids, and dog that they haven't even heard this CD. They just voted because it's the Bee Gees and they automatically think, oh it must a disco album. That is so ridiculous! Read the critics reviews and listen to the music and find out why this album is 5 stars.
