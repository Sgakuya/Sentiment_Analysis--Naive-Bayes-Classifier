Lets see....got into the National Guard to save his butt from Vietnam when NOBODY could get into the guard, then deserted his post yet by magic nothing was ever done about it. Ran several companies into the ground even though they were hand picked for him to succeed. Ex-coke head. Alcoholic who had drivers licences from more than one state, which is illegal, so he could still drive after multiple DUI's. As a matter of statistical fact he is also our lease intelligent president of all time based on IQ. If it wasnt for his family, he would be selling used cars somewhere in Texas.
