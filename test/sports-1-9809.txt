Because they are in a big-money market and Shaguille O'Neal is the biggest draw, the league will do anything it can to make sure they win the title. They let him get away with countless fouls and they changed the best of five first round playoffs to best of seven just so they would have a better chance of winning. AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT'S WHY THEY CHANGED IT. UPDATE!!!UPDATE!!!UPDATE!!!The Spurs have sent them packing!!! Happy happy days!!!Joy to the world!!!Order has been restored!!!Bye bye Laker losers!!!
