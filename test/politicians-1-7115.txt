Sadly the only people who take this man seriously are the media. A fitting testamount indeed. For a man who is an adovacte of intolerance, who seeks fame in using race as a wedge for his own use. He is predictable. Sad. And lately sinking to such low depths that even amase me. Keep hope alive...remember the words...... where there is hate let me sow love...
