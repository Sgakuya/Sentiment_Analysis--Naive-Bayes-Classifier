The Marshall Mathers Low Profile leaves you asking one thing... Why? Why would someone want to sing such hateful songs. In his songs, Eminem (real name Marshal Mathers III) sings about killing his wife, beating his daughter, and various other hateful things. Though I think it is very overstated, the media has a legitimate gripe about the bad-boy rapper. As the old saying goes: 'If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all.' I wish Marshall Mathers had kept a low profile.
