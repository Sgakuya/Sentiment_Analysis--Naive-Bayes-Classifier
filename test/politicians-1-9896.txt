Hanseatic, what??? Pierce had 9 or so kids, only one of them lived to puberty (died at 13). He has no direct descendants. I have no clue what you are talking about. And you don't need that comma before because. He did nothing except spend a huge amount of money on desert. Was the only clearly pro south presidents we had and I believe he was from New Hampshire (could be wrong). Does not deserve more than a 1. UPDATE: You new guys are morons. drbowler, slavery had been rekindled during the Polk administration and never ceased. Please shut up or say something accurate. You are doing neither. ourtobbaco road, your vote and rating are not supposed to be based on your opinion of the someone else but on the presidency of Pierce. I'm sorry if this is a new name to you, but don't trash this site with your illegal posts.
