I left my watch for repairs and was told it will be ready in 6 weeks. Well 3 months later I am still waiting for my watch. A month and 10 days ago I was told they need to get the Crystal for the watch and was told I will be contacted today to see why is taking so long. Well still waiting for the call. Never will buy from there again. My store is on The Esplanade Mall in Kenner, Louisiana.
