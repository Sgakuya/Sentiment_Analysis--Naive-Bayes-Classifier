This song hooked me to rock. Yest, the year was 1984 and I was only 9 years old, but I rocked like I was a 17 year old. This is my definite choice for all star rock album. Even though they sold more records with Sammy Hagar, they couldn't capture when they had with David Lee Roth as lead. Jump, Panama, all classics.
