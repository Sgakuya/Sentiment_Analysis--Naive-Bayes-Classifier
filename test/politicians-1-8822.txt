Hey Kerry-04...If you don't remember from HS government class, the President doesn't have a major role in the economy. That's Congresses job (ie. the House). Clinton lived off of Reagan's economic boom after fixing what Carter screwed up. Spin it any way you want. Take a look at the economy before Reagan and after...there's a world of difference and don't give me that natl. debt crap...we're talking free market. Clinton lowerd the mercury levels allowed in water to a level that nature can't even compete with...just so Bush, when he raised then to normal levels, would get bashed by environmentalists and CNN. He was and is SCUM.
