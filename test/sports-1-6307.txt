Dook has ugly cheerleaders and a pretty good program! DOES THAT FIT YOUR RULES, RIA SITE ADMINISTRATOR? I'm being censored everybody! I do not like it. This is an opinion site, not a movie a Christian is allowed to see. Oh, I have to literally rate Dook or this will be CENSORED . Ok, I rate them geeky, republican, rich, racist, but pretty good. Yes, I can back that up with facts, dorks. And it would appear that in edition to the wonderful qualities I just mentioned, they are also narcs,.........rats, tattle-tales, squealers, however you want to say it. Why else would the site administrator check every comment I make? Just like a Dookie/communist, sweep anything negative under the rug to prevent others from reading it. Just like K did with that kid's piece in their school paper. Babies. Punk fan base for a punk school. That's why you got booed in Charlotte. But no, it was because the whole crowd was Tarheel fans, right? MY POINT EXACTLY! That's also why Ewing and Love (scrotum stench face) got booed in Asheville this past weekend at that Crossfire game.)))))))))))))))))))) )))))))))UPDATE- RIA ADM, I rated them so don't delete this.................truthaboutduke.com. Scroll down to 'cheer sheet revisited' I think it is, and let the hilarity ensue! Myron Piggie, baby! Hilarious. Caner Medley rules.))))))))))))UPDATE. No, income has nothing to do with basketball.....................unless it's Dookies/Crazies so classlessly ragging on Carolina guys for their financial situation, or their financial situations growing up. Why in the world do people think Dookies are snobs? Kris Lang ring a bell? Rasheed? Most Dookies probably haven't even watched ACC ball long enough to remember. Nope, no snobs there.)))))))))))UPDATE Calling somebody a spoiled rich boy is DEFINITELY classier than calling players from the hood PO BOY and chanting at kids from western NC, hill- billy, hill-billy. And you wonder why locals don't like Dook? )))))))))))))))) )))UPDATE- as long as everybody is reading! The truth shall set you free! un helpful, helpful, whatever, just keep reading! truthaboutduke.com!)))))))))))) )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))UPDATE: DOOK sucks (rated them). Check out my new weblist on 'greatest clutch shooters of the past 20 years, COLLEGE AND PROS. Check out my new weblist about biggest NBA idiots. Dook is lame. Not their game, just themselves in general. If I ever saw them on the streets I'd....................................laugh. Maybe rob their lunch money or something. ))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))UPDATE: Really, 'EMS4DUKE'? I thought Dook fans hated Carolina fans because we are Carolina! Because you are our bitter rivals? Because you are 95 - 124 against us? Because we drink wine and eat cheese like some rich boy trust fund boy school? But if I'm the whole reason, thank you, I'm very flattered. Me? Well, I hate you because you were born. I hate you because that's what Carolina fans are supposed to do. But me being the reason Dookies hate Carolina fans? I've never been more flattered in my life. Lil 'ol wine drinking me? Really? Cool. Man, you guys are lucky. You should count your blessings that you're not some rich boy, trust fund baby school like us. All we do is drink wine, and embrace students from within our state. Us jerks
