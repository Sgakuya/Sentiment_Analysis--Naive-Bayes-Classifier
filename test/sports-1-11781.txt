you don't know the facts, Herschel was faster than Bo. Look it up. Hersche's 100 meter time was 10.22 Bo's was 10.39. Herschel had more rushing yards in 3 years than Bo had in 4 years. Herschel won the Heisman as a junior, finished 3rd as soph.,2nd as a TRUE freshman, and would have won a 2nd had he not left early for the USFL. Had he returned for his Sr. year he would have shattered the career rushing record. He barely missed being on the olympic track team as a 225 lb. guy. Bo couldnt carry Herschel's jock strap.
