When I finally decided to buy a new computer 2 years ago, unlucky me, it has Windows Me. At first it looked impressive. I would soon find that that it was awful. Crashes to the blue screen of death and hanging on the Me screen on a boot has plagued me. I can't even install new application software. Now I'm going to have to spend more money and time probably filled with aggravation to install XP and save everyones work. There are 4 users. Microsoft should share the financial burden.
