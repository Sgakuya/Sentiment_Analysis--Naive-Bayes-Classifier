What a piece of crap! It's some dude dancing around trying to look like a rock star, but doesn't pull it off. The music is terrible. The video is terrible. It's totally uninteresting. I'm sick of all this wannabe glam crap. It would've been a little better if they showed the band playing in a small dirty rock club, but even then the band still sucks. If you're going to play weak music, at least make an interesting video.
