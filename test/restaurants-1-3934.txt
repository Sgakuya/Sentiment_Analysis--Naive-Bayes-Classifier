The pizza boli's in Federal Hill is disgusting. Everyday they put their trash out in the street, including raw dough in the flower boxes. Not only is it repulsive it attracts rats to their store and the surrounding area. They have been asked time and time agian to clean up their shop and have refused. I don't want to think about what is in the pizza. But if you like rodent excrement this is the place for you.
