In Feb.2001 I was travelling from NY to Caracas Venezuela not only they took us of 2 airplanes, they left us in the runway 3 and 4 hours on every airplane, but when they finally realized that they could not take off they left everybody in the airport without hotel, transportation etc. Forget the supervisors, a 18 hour nightmare, this people just don't care. They needed to have the airplane in Caracas for the next morning flight, and just didnt care about all pasangers until 4:00 am wasssss just to much and the crew became illegal.
