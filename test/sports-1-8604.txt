My god, how i don't like this kid....He is nothing to Vince or A.I....He has Shaq, therefore he thinks he is the greatest...Jordan schooled him, Iverson schooled him, Vince and Marbury schooled him......He has no Defense...He tries to play the Terry Porter's and Rod Strickland's out there....He's scared of the best out there...He's got no game....Kobe straight sucks.....
