Clinton did two good things. He eliminated the 55 mile per hour Federal speed limit. He also was responsible for encouraging the voting public into electing a Republican Congress. This created the legislative / executive gridlock necessary to prevent Clinton's Socialist policies getting enacted. Thanks Bill, you liar.
