I just hope ANMALONE was being sarcastic. George W. Bush has not won the respect of any serious politician of the country. His manicheism, his closed-doors politics, and his stubborn will of forcing the rest of the world to think like him has dropped his reputation on the lowest basin of the Grand Canyon. And for this we don't have to go outside the US. Strong opinion leaders (politicians, musicians, entertainers, intellectuals) find his actions more than solutions like mere new and graver problems. Even his economic plans lack of total popularity around the world!
