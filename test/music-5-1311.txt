One of the great, great records (though Hunky Dory is of the same class). It starts out pretty great and gets better from there. The bonus tracks on the CD are excellent as well. Hang onto Yourself gets lost in the great stuff on this record but would be a standout anywhere else. Bowie was in a groove on this one.
