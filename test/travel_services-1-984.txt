I wish I could give zero stars. What an absolutely terrible company. They are complete liars and scam artists. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Their quotes aound low but then they hold your stuff hostage until you pay them more money. It took six weeks for us to get all our stuff. I can't believe the run-around we got from the Winnipeg and Vancouver offices. They hung up on us regularly, put us on hold and never came back, taunted us, and lied over and over. A sampling: That guy shouldn't have told you your stuff was coming today. He's the mechanic. I can't tell you who you are talking to. I don't know anyone's name here. It's a big world out there. We won't go broke without your friends' business if you bad-mouth us. Would you get mad if I hang up on you again? Your stuff moved a long way, off course it's damaged. So unprofessional I can't even believe it. Not to mention the damage, all boxes unlabelled, most hardware lost so things couldn't be reassembled, etc. etc. I wish to God I could go back in time and never have dealt with these complete assholes.
