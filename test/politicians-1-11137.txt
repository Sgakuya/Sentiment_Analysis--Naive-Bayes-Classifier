Do you believe this lunatic said that Mr. Bill (from Saturday Night Live) knew that the levee system in New Orleans would fail in a major hurricane, and she goes on to say that President Bush cut funding for improvements to the levee system. WHAT?? Are you kidding me?? First of all, Louisiana is #1 when it comes to funding for Army Corps projects, way more than California which has many more people than Louisiana. Where did that money go, Ms. Landrieu?? Second, if YOU knew there was such a threat, why didn't you propose new legislation to solve the problem?? All these Democrats offer are nothing but criticism and never have any new ideas. What a pathetic party.
