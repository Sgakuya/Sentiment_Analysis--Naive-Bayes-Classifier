Awesome CD, I just bought it. Each song is very different, and Eminem even gives his first attempt at singing in Hailie's Song, a song for his daughter, Hailie Jade. This is a CD I am sure will become an even bigger hit than it already is. Eminem has once again proven his uniqueness as a rapper. But dont take my word for it, try it your self to decide if you like it or not.
