Arguably the most overrated president in our modern times, Reagan was a charming, witty, gifted public speaker that pulled off an Oscar-worthy performance as Best Actor in the Leading Role of the United States. From the beginning of his campaign to the end of his Presidency, the deregulated media fawned over him, and hard-working Americans adored him, would worship at his feet, despite the fact that by the time he left office, the individual incomes of the bottom 60% of this country were lower than they were in 1977! And of course, since the very beginning of his campaigning, illusion consistently trumped out over reality. For instance, Reagan used Carter's inability to free the hostages held in Iran as a weapon to undermine the Democrat's administration. And the public cheered as competent Reagan freed the hostages, something of which incompetent Carter was incapable. However, reality is not nearly as pleasing as illusion--recently, head of the ABC bureau in France, Pierre Salinger, uncovered evidence that the Republican party and Reagan conspired with Iranian officials to DELAY the release of the hostages until after the 1980 election--a plot likely costing Jimmy Carter the Presidency! Not to mention that this was a nefariously illegal and unethical conspiracy that risked American lives! And then there's that old rumor about Reagan supposedly rescuing the economy from the weak Carter as a result of his HUGE tax cuts. But his tax policy, termed supply-side economics, was denounced by virtually all economists of the day, and it was even denounced by George HW Bush as voodoo economics when he ran against Reagan in the 1980 Republican primary. But the truth is that Reagan's ridiculous tax cuts that overwhelmingly supported the wealthy (much like the current President Bush's tax cut proposal, though he doesn't call it by its real name--supply-side economics), and they did nothing to prevent the recession of 1982. But the Republicans used the ignorance of the public to present the illusion that Carter somehow caused the recession, and Reagan would save it with immense deregulation and tax cuts. What's more, most folks don't know that the stagflation that plagued Carter's years were predicted a full 15 (!) years earlier. And most Americans are ignorant to the fact that the chairman of the federal reserve controls inflation and unemployment by setting interest rates in this country. When Carter appointed Paul Volcker to the position in the late 1970s Mr. Volcker commenced to deliberately create a recession, for it was the ONLY way to combat the inflation. When inflation subsided, in 1982, he cut the interest rates resulting in the recovery portion of the recession/recovery cycle. But those facts are lost somehow in the mix, and Reagan was given credit for the rescuing of the economy. Reagan's deregulation and tax policies did, in effect, funnel wealth into the hands of the super-rich (the top 1% would hold 42% of all this nation's money in 1992 as opposed to the 22 they held in 1975), and his policies resulted in falling individual incomes of the lower three quintiles of the American population as well as a tripling of the national debt. I saw that one person on this site pointed out that Reagan halted the Cold War, and that is justification for most of us carrying thinner wallets. This is an illogical argument, because 1. The Cold War threat of a European invasion was virtually impossible. 2. The richest folks in this country lost NO money whatsoever as a result of the Cold War buildup. 3. The fall Soviet Union was predicted long before Reagan took office. So as you can see, Reagan benefited largely from coincidence insomuchas the recovery of the mid 1980s was not a result of his policies, but the actions of the chairman of the federal reserve, and the fall of the Soviet Union was not Reagan's doing. In fact, the defense contractors whose pockets he had hoped to fill had a vested interest in keeping the Cold War alive--had he had his way, it likely would have continued. But while the public and the media were fawning over Reagan, his darkest hours remained secretive. The horrors of his contras, the savage murders of thousands of innocent Guatamalen civilians, and the CIA's allowing cocaine to enter this country are well-documented. And much to the disbelief and disappointment of Clinton's fervent, over-the-top critics, it was during REAGAN's administration that China obtained nuclear secrets from our government. The Chinese gained these secrets between 1986 and 1988, likely from Wen Lo Hee, a man long suspected of espionage. What's more, the Chinese TESTED their warhead in 1992 while George HW Bush was President, long before Clinton would have even had the chance to hand over secrets to another government. But when the evidence came to light in 1995, the media sloppily failed to point out that Clinton could NOT have been responsible because of the simply timetable of events. Chinagate was a Reagan scandal, not a Clinton one. Reagan's CIA aided the military dictatorships of Latin American countries in murdering some 200,000 innocent civilians, though Congressional hearings have superficially cleared the CIA despite overwhelming evidence contained in their own reports! In conclusion, Reagan aided the corporate special interest system in this country (capitalizing on Carter's policies) in creating the greatest income inequality our country has seen since the 1920s through deregulation and regressive taxation while aiding and abetting war criminals in Latin America soley for the profit margin. He blasted his opponents in the media, leaving them in exile, while he rewarded his friends with deregulation that gave rise to the huge corporate media giants of whom we find ourselves at the mercy. And they rewarded him with a $2.5 million loan for a home in Bel-Aire, California, and his wife with over $1 million worth of designer dresses. And the media didn't breathe even a word... Reagan was a damning example of how ignorant our public can be, and, as the election of 2000 proved, there still is a fairly large portion of our people who will vote for the person, not the party, despite the fact that Bush, like Reagan before him, hopes to funnel money into the coffers of his super-rich allies. Pray for Reagan, pray for the man--upon reaching the other side, I cannot predict what he will face... You can read these stories for yourself at www.consortiumnews.com.
