Glad to be Former Employee. I worked at a Tims in Kitchener for nearly 5 years. I was finally able to quit ('96) after finding the energy to get another job. To this day it is the worst job I have ever had (and I'm now 44). The pay was barely enough to survive on - and the majority of customers were rude and insensitive! for some reason some customers thought they could make comments and ask questions that were not only rude, but at times personal. Judgements were made with insinuations that since you were working at Tims - you were automatically uneducated and somehow unfit for common courtesy. Little do those inconsiderates realise - most were using the job for no more than a stepping stone to better... so many of us were in College or Universiy - on our way to much a much better paying and respected job - a better life than what I asumme most of the rude customers were living (I'm assuming this by what they could afford to pay for a cup of coffee) You get what you pay for so do you really have the right to be so picky? It's almost laughable! Where I worked we were allowed two fifteen minute breaks in an eight hour period (permission from the Labour bBourd) and since you were paid for those breaks they could tell you where to spend them - no going outside - even out back by the garbage (so if you smoked - too bad). Most of us were extremely fit from running around getting the perfect order for the often overweight,demanding, cheap customer. Again... it was almost laughable... The customers that were polite... thank you... you helped make my days the least bit tolerable. For the rest that liked to complain in a raised voice... perhaps practice yelling so you can do so without splattering your spit all over... the worker wasn't winking at you after all (just clearing her eye of your splatter!
