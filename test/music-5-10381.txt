He`s what I call a singer...Don`t get me wrong, I can appreciate even artists like for instance, Guns and Roses, but please, don`t call those singers when you have Josh Groban. I`ve never seen him in concert so i can`t tell of his artistic qualities and i don`t think he wrote a song but as far as a great singer, he`s surely a model for those pop idols...
