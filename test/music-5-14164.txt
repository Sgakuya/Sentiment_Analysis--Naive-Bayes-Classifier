After Reservoir dogs, Tarantino set a trend for his movies' music. The old tunes bring the listener into a nostalgic mood and along with Tarantino's comical scenes the viewer feels the mood better. The music brings the viewer in and I felt that I was almost there in each scene. Each mix has a variation of different old music, soul, rock, etc... I always look forward to hearing the soundtracks to Tarantino's films.
