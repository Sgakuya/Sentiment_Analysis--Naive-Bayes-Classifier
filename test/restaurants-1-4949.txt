the wait for the food was long and boring my friend started falling asleep they had a small menu and the 1 thing we wanted they didnt have. I ordered pasta even though i didnt want it cuz all the other stuff on the menu was clams in cheese sauce or something expensive and fatty. I went to the olive garden in the first place for the soup salad and breadsticks special but they said it was only for dinnertime. The waitress looked like she brushed her teeth with a chainsaw and the chef took 20 minutes to cook pasta. the pasta was flavorless and the sauce was the same stuff u get at the supermarket. except the supermarket has more variety than the olive garden and at a cheaper price. the pasta i made yesterday tasted better. in the same time i waited at the olive garden i coulda gone to mcdonalds and eaten what i wanted at a lower price without the wait.
