Some of the best damn music I have ever heard. So inspirational, sincerely, they helped me through a VERY tough time in my life. I get so sick of people who 'claim to know what music is' and that 'they're clones' or whatever. You know what, this music is suberb. I just wish you could give more than five stars.
