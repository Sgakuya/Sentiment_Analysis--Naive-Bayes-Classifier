This album, when released, was proof positive that The Wuss was a marginally-talented fraud. The guy was only five years into his recording career and was already imitating himself. Really lame. Time has borne out the initial assessment of those whose taste didn't end in their mouths: sawed-off toughguy wannabe Wussie has made some really dreadful records over the decades, and this one is among the worst. Yet, the beer-drinking losers love this guy, mostly because they see something of themselves in him.
