Take it from one who worked in the corporate office, the upper management are untalented, nasty, rude and backststabbers. The buyers are untalented, closed minded, and the company will slowly go down the tubes, they are bigots, racists, alcoholics and righteous. The buyers are expected to work 4 people's jobs and have totally unrealistic demands placed on them. Most of them are nervous recks. The taste level is horrible and they just do not get it! There are people who plan to give their life time of service because they have no confidence and are so stuck in their miserable jobs.
