Quite possibly their best album. The opener Come Together just slides in with that great bass-line. Next up Someting,one of the great beatles songs. Putting on this album with its huge melodies, beautiful guitar lines, great lyrics and superb musicianship is always a treat. The string of songs at the end of the album though is my favourite. In my opinion the second half of Abbey Road is one of the greatest passage of music recorded in the later half of the 20th century. My only problem with the album is the fact that ringo sings the word 'happy' twice in the same sentance in 'Octopuses Garden'. I dont know why, but it annoys me.
