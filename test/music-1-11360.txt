Oh God. What has music come to? Where's God when I need one? If I hear a single song off this piece of trash played one more time anywhere, you are gonna need to hold your ears. One of my friends from school insisted on having me suffer through the first two tracks (and I have no desire to learn what they are called) and I have concluded that all copies of the album should be taken to the landfills, and every buyer deserves a refund. HELLO? Does this band even do any work? No. Do they write songs? No, and even if they did, the crap that comes from them would not say much for their songwriting skills. Do they play instruments? No. Can they sing or dance? No. So somebody please tell me why they are making CDs? Take care, everyone!
