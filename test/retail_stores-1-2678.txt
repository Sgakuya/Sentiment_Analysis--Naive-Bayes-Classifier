dirty stores; no large selection of food; bought rotten fruit several times, e.g. bananas are green outside and dark brown inside, peaches with rotten centers, and worst of all expensive pineapple that is brown inside (up to $4 loss); they also seem to close the register when they see customers approach; especially bad is the store on Mill and Southern in Tempe. Unfortunately, tere is a Fry's on almost every corner Tempe, and therefore the competition is small.
