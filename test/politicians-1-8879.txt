Clinton seemed to reinvent reality almost daily. It's almost as if at times he thought he was running some small town in Arkansas rather than the US of A. Every President has made mistakes, so some of his bad policy decisions have to be accepted as part of the game. However, his overall outlook seems to me to have catered to special interest groups, to wanting to be popular at any cost, and to have done things in his private life that were an embarassment to both the institution of the Presidency and to the country itself. He really treated the American public as if they were idiots at times.
