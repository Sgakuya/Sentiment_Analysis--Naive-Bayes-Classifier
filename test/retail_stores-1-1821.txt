Wal-Mart is gross!! The floors are always dirty and the shelves are a disaster! I feel sorry for the employees who have to work in such a mess and deal with those disgusting customers. The shoppers are usually loud and obnoxious hill- billies who use foul language and have hygine issues. The merchandise is just as bad-- have you seen how old the make-up products are?? For a clean and pleasant shopping experience, go somewhere else like target! (and if wal-mart's prices are lower, most stores will match them)
