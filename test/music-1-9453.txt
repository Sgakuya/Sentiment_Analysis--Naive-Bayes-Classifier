The song was completely butchered in order to get played on music video channels! First of all, they had to completely change the subject matter of the song. The song was about doing drugs, getting high, smoking...you get the idea, but for the video version, every single drug reference was changed to something else. And that includes changing the chorus to a sped-up sample of an old song that went I get high, high, high to a girl singing I get by, by, by, so the song doesn't even sound the same! Censorship keeps getting worse and worse.
