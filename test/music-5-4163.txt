The aura that goes along with this album is so cryptic. It really is very touching when Freddie, looking so sick, him and his band members knowing he was so close to his death, whispers I still love you. It was Queen's last album with Freddie (they released Made in Heaven in 1995), so that adds to the appeal and feeling of the album. It is all around a really good CD.
