You can always tell who's going to win the election, just look for the guy standing in a field with a cow next to him, wearing a big ol cowboy hat...Too bad the camera only catches him from the waist up, the sad part is if they'd show a full body shot on television you'd see he's standing up to his knee caps in B.S....Next time vote for someone with a brain America...not just some good ol boy who claims to be a Christian! Going to church no more makes you a Christian than going to a garage makes you a car. I've never read in the Bible that poor people should find someone to marry so they can afford to live (as Bush suggested) I've never read anything about killing for money (which seems to be what this war is about..oil) He gives tax breaks to the rich, the people who don't need it. He seems to like killing others, war, he wants people to have less time on death row...that way if you're innocent ...OH WELL, your dead...but thank God we saved ourselves some tax dollars. An eye for an eye only makes the world blind - Ghandi ...and yes I voted for the other guy!!!!! The one not standing next to a cow :)
