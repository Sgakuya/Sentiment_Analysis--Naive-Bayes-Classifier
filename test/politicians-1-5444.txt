Should have a negative rating. Possibly the worst presidential candidate in U.S. History. He flip-flops on every topic, blasts Bush without giving any solutions, extremely liberal, and his attedance record in Senate meetings is worse than a Michael Moore made-up version of Bush's attendance record. The only positive about this guy is that he served in Vietnam, and many said he ran away from battle. Where did the Democrats come up with this guy? If you voted for him, you have major issues.
