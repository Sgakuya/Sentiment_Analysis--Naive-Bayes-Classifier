I used to think he was a fool (invented the internet? was the role model for Love Story? , etc), but now I think he's pathetic and pitiful. Really, how stupid could someone be to try and rile a crowd up about global warning during winter? His recent talk in Tennessee, screeching about Bush, made him look unstable. (Not to mention the hair plugs or weave he now has). He gave an elegant concession speech in 2001 and could have been respected as an elder statesman. Now he will be thought of as a buffoon. As always, Al Gore snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.
