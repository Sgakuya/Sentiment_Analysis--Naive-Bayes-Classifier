I can listen to this CD for hours and hours (and hours). I'm Going Slightly Mad was the most amazing song, musically, that I have ever heard and ever hope to hear. Headlong is so cool. Very energetic, Roger Taylor was at his peak, and Freddie's voice was absolutely godlike in both songs. And I don't know if any of you have seen the video for These Are the Days of Our Lives ---has officially moved onto my list of the ten most touching things I have ever seen. In the final scene, when Freddie looks at the camera and whispers I still love you , he looked so sick. In the cover of one of my Greatest Hits collections, the caption for the single stated The video, filmed on May 30, 1991, proved to be Freddie Mercury's last performance on film. How sad! On November 24, I'm going to spend my entire day listening to Queen music and watching their videos, particularly the one for Days . Why? It's Freddie's tenth death anniversary. Oh, and back to Innuendo (got a little off-track there, didn't I?) the title song is coooool. And it's true, to. Don't take offense at my innuendo! For anyone who's spent their entire life listening to crap like *NSYNC, I really recommend Innuendo. It will change your views of music, and you may get to liking, even loving, this amazing band. Queen has changed my life, and that is enough evidence for me that they are gods. Take care, everyone!
