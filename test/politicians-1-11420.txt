this guy is the biggest douche and I voted for him too. ugggh I hate politics. the guy spent 99% of his time campaigning in states Gore won; how can you win an election??? I am totally 100% against the Iraq war and this guy in my mind has absoulutely no right to criticize it simply for the fact that he voted for it and ultimately shares some responsibility. Kerry is a complete hypocrite. cya in hell ;) He's a D- at best
