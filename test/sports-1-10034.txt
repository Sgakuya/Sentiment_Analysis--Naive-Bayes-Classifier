The Clippers are the worst franchise in all of professional sports. Their best player did not want to be traded so that he could leave the team as a free agent (and get less money) to ensure that the Clips didn't get anything in return. Owner Donald Sterling does not have a clue. And, how does GM Elgin Baylor still have a job. It's kind of amazing that when you compare him to Jerry West (two of the best players in NBA history and the heads of the two LA franchises for years), one has been able to hold onto his job despite not doing anything at all for years, while the other has held onto his job because he has continually kept his team in the championship race.
