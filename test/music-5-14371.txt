I laughed, I cried, I cried some more, I creid even more. What an emotional show! I started crying at the very beginning during Circle Of Life, cried again when the father died, again during Can You Feel The Love Tonight , and again at the end. Such an emotional show. But I'll tell you what, I loved it!
