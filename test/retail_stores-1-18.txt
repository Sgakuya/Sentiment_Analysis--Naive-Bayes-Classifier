I bought 2 books online from Barnes and Noble. They were shipped UPS and went out for delivery last Thursday at 8:00 AM. It is now Monday. UPS needs B&N to call them and put a tracer on the package. B&N won't do that for me even though the books went out for delivery 4 days ago. Since UPS needs B&N to ask for the tracer and B&N won't do that for me I guess the books will be lost forever. I am so frustrated. I am so frustrated with Barnes and Noble I don't plan on every buying anything from them again. There customer service sucks.
