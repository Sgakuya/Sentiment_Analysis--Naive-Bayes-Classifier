A disgrace. The baseball encyclopedia has him listed at 185 lbs. He's at least 240 now with a massive frontal lobe to boot. The fact that he will most likely break the HR record is a shame and I hope the truth that he cheated by using steroids will be brought forward and his career accomplishments put in proper perspective.
