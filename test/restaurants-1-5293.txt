I agree with RaterX. Chi-Chi's is what you think of as the first attempt at chain-Mexican. Taco-Bell is a more pleasurable experience than Chi-Chi's and definitely better in taste, appearance and speed. There is no truly authentic Mexican chain in this country; all so-called Mexican chains here are actually TEX-Mex. Travel south of the border and half the stuff we are told is Mexican is not to be found on any menu since it originated in the same rotten state as Dumbya, not in Mexico.
