What has usually killed the Braves in the playoffs? Bad relief pitching, bad baserunning(Lonnie Smith Chipper Jones), bad bench management, in short, bad fundamentals...it's a manager's job to have his team prepared and to make proper substitutions at the proper time. It's also his job as a man not to pop his wife when he's had too much to drink. Other reviewers are right when they say that the Braves would have more than one ring with Leyland, Torre, Alou, etc. On a lighter note, according to my math, even Cito Gaston doubled Cox's championship output. John Schuerholtz(GM) deserves the credit for building those teams, Cox deserves the credit for coming up short year after year. Let's see how bad Cox does with aged and reduced talent in 2001. Leo Mazone(pitching coach) deserves more credit than Cox for their regular season dominance.
