Mr. Gore combines the worsed parts of liberas and conservatives with the result of Mr. Gore being the most dangerous enemy of freedom in the US. He is both a socialist and a religionist, and above all he believes that he should have arbitrary power over everybody and be above the laws of the US. If he makes it as president of the US, it will be the the most awful blow to the status of the US as the MORAL COUNTRY of the world that our founding fathers tried to institute.
