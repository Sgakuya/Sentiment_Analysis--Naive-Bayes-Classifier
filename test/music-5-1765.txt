Intense. That is one word to describe Kid A. And a word that is not used lightly. Brilliant is another word to describe Kid A and this is one of the most influencial records I have ever heard. Cry, to 'How to dissapear completley' sing to 'Optimistic' and dance to 'Ideoteque'. I can't get enough of Radiohead and Thom Yorke's voice. If only they had more guitar in the album, then it could have been flawless but it is as addictive as smoking and as exhilirating as a rollercoaster. Long live Radiohead!!!
