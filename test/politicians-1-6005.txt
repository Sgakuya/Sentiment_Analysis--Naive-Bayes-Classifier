This guy is really pathetic but worse than that why do Mass. voters continue to elect him? Why do Kennedys continue to fascinate? They are a disreputable family of criminals who bought their way to fame. An old limerick from the past: There once was a senator from MASS, he got horny and went looking for ASS, he lucked up and found SOME, but screwed up and drown ONE, and now his chance to be President is PAST!
