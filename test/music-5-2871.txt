Keep in mind that this album was from the late sixties. The sound Hendrix created was unheard of, and to this day unparalleled- even with the electronic advances. The production as well as the mix were equally ahead of their time. The copies available of this work very widely in quality. I have a German import CD that was somewhat pricey with the original UK cover of the naked ladies that was banned in the U.S. Insist on quality. From subtle nuances, to the buzz of previously uncharted electronic technics amplified to oblivion- you will want to experience (another great Hendrix album) this, the best of, the worlds greatest guitar God. You can hear this double-album a hundred times and discover something new each time. Thirty-five years later, this man and this gift to the world has yet to be equaled.
