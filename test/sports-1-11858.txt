PBeavr is right on. ESPN hyped Woodson right into the Heisman Trophy. Only Michigan fans thinks he still deserved it. Peyton Manning had one of the best college football seasons that a quarterback has had EVER. And when the voting was taken, Tennessee had just as much chance to win the National Title as Michigan. The Heisman got a great spokesman too with Woodson.... fur coat and cheap women on each arm with all his bling-bling.... what a thug!
