Hello, I thought I'd let you know about The Kroger Company's new policy of fining it's suppliers for making a human error! I'll try to get the point across as well as I can. Let's say I deliver bread to 1 of their stores and I have an invoice charging them for 40 loaves of wheat bread. I make a human error and only bring in 39 loaves. I will be told to bring in 1 more loaf, or change the invoice to 39.Everythings fine, right ? They're not out anything, right? WRONG! My company will be charged $25.00 for me making a mistake, which some companies are then passing along to the delivery driver. Independent distributors are charged directly by Krogers. True, making a mistake on an invoice isnt good, but thats why they check-in deliveries. And if the mistake is rectified, what is the basis for the fine? If I am shopping at Kroger and go to check-out, and something rings up the wrong price, can I charge them $25.00 ? This is an outrageous practice! Just another instance of Corporate GREED? Or is Kroger's doing that badly in sales , that they need to fine their suppliers like this? And on top of that, they say Due to Federal and State laws, beer and wine vendors cannot be fined. WHAT??? Now they can discriminate as to who they can GOUGE and who they can't? What is wrong with this picture? At least 1 Company that delivers to Kroger ( The Schwebel Baking Co. )is forcing its employees to pay these fines, or be suspended and/or fired! All the while, Kroger continues to lose NOTHING. Also, Who are these people that LOVE the Kroger Card?? Are you that naive? You're not saving ANYTHING people!! All they have done is to RAISE the price, then put it ON SALE, which lowers it back to the price it was in the 1st place! I serviced those rotten so and so's for 17 years with Schwebel's bread. Believe me, they're getting over on the customers in more ways than you can count.PLEASE BOYCOTT KROGER'S!!! You'll be glad you did.
