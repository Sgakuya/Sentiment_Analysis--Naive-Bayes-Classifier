From a former store manager.....here's the real deal if you are thinking about working for this company..if you are offered a position run as fast as you can, don't stop. Am I an angry terminated employee? Nope....just got tired of being promised a bonus only to have it taken away without warning at the last minute by Eric Kovats, Sam Cusano or one of the other former Service Merchandise head loosers that are now running this company while they are in bankruptcy. Just a clue...check out their SEC filings... while every single manager in the company has experienced deep pay cuts in their monthly bonus and commissions, these two plus one or more stand to receive over 1.2 million in bonus bucks if they turn the company around this fall. Did the employees get screwed...certainly....all but those that work in the Savannah Ga office... If you are thinking of making a purchase be careful...very careful. First, while the prices are low (not really for what you get) the jewelry at Walmart's is actually better and they will gladly take a return if you are not happy. Friedman's will do everything in the world to avoid having to loose or spend money to make a customer happy. Watch out for the other crap that mysteriously appears on your credit account too...look for their insurance, warranties and PMA....all useless. If you don't dot all the i's and cross all the t's you can hang up the warranty. PMA???? this is what they call their appraisals. First, these are done by a guy in the south on his on PC and all he does is takes pictures of the stock. The appraisal in most cases is not even your ring...it's just one like it he has a picture of on file from the company. What a rip off!!!!! And if you do decide to take a job with this failing company, wear a life jacket because this ship is sinking fast...oh, and ask for all you can get up front in pay because they currently have an infinite freeze on any raises. Their benefits are a joke, the employee insurance is the worst I have ever seen and I used to work in a hospital filing insurance. If you enjoy dealing with constant customer complaints about merchandise, like maneuvering thru their corporate bullS%^& every day, and don't mind a good butt screwing at least once a week...this is the company for you. Oh..and by the way, if they tell you anything about being in bankruptcy they will tell you the company is coming out of it....don't believe that, they recently closed over 200 stores and did it in one day by phone.... they received NO PRIOR WARNING......in short, this company sucks no matter how you look at it. If you do shop there...ask for a loupe (10x) to view any diamond....the employees refer to the diamonds as dalmation diamonds or 'frozen snot because they either have tons of carbon spots in them or they are green and milky looking. Their white gold is NOTORIOUS for changing back to yellow within weeks....they will tell you this is thenature of white gold...again, a cover up by the jewelry nazi's. Really good white gold will hold its color for years on end. Theirs all has a cheap rhodium plating on it that you have to pay and pay and pay for again and again to keep your white gold white. And finally, the best advice I can give as former 5 year veteran of this company is......if it sounds too good to be true...at friedmans it really is too good to be true!
