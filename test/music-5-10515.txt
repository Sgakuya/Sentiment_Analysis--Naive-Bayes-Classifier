This CD is something I have been looking for a very long time. IT's excellent, great music for all ages, romantic and lively the same time. Smooth and not disturbing. It has the rhythem, it has melodies, it has everything and Ricky's voice. What else can you ask for? I just love it. Listening to it every morning on the way to the office it makes me happy, optimistic and better person.
