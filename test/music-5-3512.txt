Aja and Gaucho are really two parts of one album. Having lived in the LA area in the 70's these albums captured the spirit of the time especially for those who thought about the times. The liner notes on the vinyl edition,(not copied on the cd) tell of the subversive nature of SD and it is the big joke of the album that's so entertaining. The album really digs into what makes people tick and go, think about all those people up in the smoky hills of Beverly, all of them fatuously making up the skewed reality of TV and Movies. While everyone else was howling about doing their babe in the backseat of a 57 Chevy Becker and Fagan were laughing at the party.
