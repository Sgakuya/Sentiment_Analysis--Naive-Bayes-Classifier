The offspring are one of my favorite bands. I have 4 of their released 5 albums (The Offspring, Ignition, Smash, Ixnay On The Hombre, and Americana) and I love them all. I also have 10 of the total 12 songs that are on their newest cd, Conspiracy Of One, to be released on November 14th. They are great. I can't wait for the cd. Any Offspring fan that hasn't downloaded the songs or hasn't heard them yet is in for a treat.
