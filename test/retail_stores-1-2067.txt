Circuit City has the most unreasonable, rigid return policy I have ever experienced. After a bad experience with a laptop I purchased and returned within 72 hours, every level of customer service refused to waive the restocking fee, even though I was willing to spend the entire $1800 purchase price elsewhere in the store. Let's throw out the baby with the bathwater! Unhappy customers are a costly mistake for this company to make!
