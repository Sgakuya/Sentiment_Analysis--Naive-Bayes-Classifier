I used them out of Tampa, worst experience EVER!! They showed up a day and a half late, with no reasons why.. after confirming morning before they would be there at 10 am.. Was from FL to NH. When they arrived, it was in a uhaul-different truck from the truck it wasnt to be moved in, everything was damaged, and my brand new big screen tv, microwave and mountain bike were all stolen from truck (admitted to by owner of company). This was in June 2004.. Im still waiting for my claim to be paid. We talk daily and they all know me by voice now.. Needless to say.. Im still waiting... Reported to FBI, DOT and Better Business Bureau, its not doing me to good.. they are out of Tampa/St Pete/Clearwater and New Orleans.. have many different names.. HEED THESE GUYS..If you call and they dont say company name.. Just hang up.. !!! I hope i can help just one person not use these guys, and live the hell ive been going through..Would love to hear from anyone else whose been burned by these guys (too old to be students..)!!
