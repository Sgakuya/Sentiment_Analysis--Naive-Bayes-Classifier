Hey, nationwidemovers. Before you go getting all shrill and snotty, I haven't used your service either. How is it that you know from ralphthewonderllama's internet alias that he's never been a customer by checking your records. This is the clear implication of your statement, and speaks to a complete lack of veracity on your part. If as your post states you are actually connected with this company, this nonsense doesn't speak highly of your or your company's integrity. Go run your shill act somewhere else, sonny boy. UPDATE: Oh, I see the shill games have started. So the customers have all been notified to come to the defense of the precious company. Makes you wonder, if this damn outfit is so good, and they've prompted their customers to come here and rate them, why only six have chosen to do so. Six. In four days. I smell a big fat moving company rat.
