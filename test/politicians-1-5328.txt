I had been a Good Morning America fan for 15 years, became an NBC convert during the Olympics- loved the way Katie Couric and Matt Lauer covered it. I am sick to death of watching Katie rooting for her man Al Gore. I am switching back to ABC... what happened to fairness in reporting? Bush deserves equal time. He has an important message. America needs to find its' values and people need to be trusted to raise their own children, invest their money, and not continue to hand over a higher and higher percentage of their paychecks for less and less back. IF GORE HAD THE SLIGHT EDGE IT WOULD BE A VICTORY FOR GORE... TOO CLOSE TO CALL IS WHAT YOU ARE REPORTING EVEN THOUGH GEORGE BUSH IS AHEAD IN ALL MAJOR POLLS. MAY THE BEST MAN WIN!!!
