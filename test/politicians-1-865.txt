What a horrible man. Corrupt, arrogant, shallow. I don't care how much he loves the country, he is a disgrace to the office and it is imperative he be removed as soon as possible. A classic Liberal politician, I might add - sleaze, patronage, pork-barreling, fence-sitting and do-anything-say-anything-to-win attitude.
