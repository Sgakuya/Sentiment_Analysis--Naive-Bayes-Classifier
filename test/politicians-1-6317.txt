A spiteful little weasel who acts like a Nazi. When he owned EDS, he had spies watching his employees. When GM bought EDS out and Perot was on the board, he was such a pain in the ass that they gave him loads of money to get rid of him. More than anything else, his candidacy in 1992 cost George Bush, whom Perot hates, the election. I hope he burns in the nethermost hell.
