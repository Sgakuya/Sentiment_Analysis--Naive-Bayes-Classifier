Overrated! Gets more press than K-Mart yet unlike Martin, Kidd can't be counted on in the Finals. Has shown he's in the same catagory as Barkley, Malone, Stockton, Reggie Miller, etc. He's the kind of guy who leaves his balls at home when it comes time to win it all. Was outplayed by Tony Parker (a 20-year-old kid). Will never be in the same boat as Jordan, Bird, Magic, Isiah, Dumars, etc.
