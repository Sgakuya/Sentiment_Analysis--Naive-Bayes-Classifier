I'm not a country music fan by any means, but I do listen to it. I heard this song and I wondered what am I hearing. This is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. At first I thought, who is this girl. Then I hear it's a boy. YIKES! I wonder who his family knows that would let something like this sign with their label. I have been to Nashville many times, and there are people on the streets who sing better than this. I tell you this. Puberty can't hurt him. Hopefully it'll help.
