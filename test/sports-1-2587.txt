Ed Wadew is a joke. He landed this job becasue he would keep his mouth shout when the Phillies budget was extremely low. Now they opened the wallet a little and let Wade sped a few dollars and he is being exposed to the fool that he is. Wade put a fantasy team together rather than a solid fundamental baseball team. As long as Wade remains the Phillies Gm we can forget about getting to the post season.
