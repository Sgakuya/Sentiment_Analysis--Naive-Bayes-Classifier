Ineffectual cretin. Shirked personal accountablity and lasting substance. He pulled the troops out? Only after 4 more years of needless war. He was unresponsive to the plight of troops and cosied up to his elitist, conservative buddies. Watergate aside, the major initial blight was his questionable campaign funding. Oh, and it's no big deal he aided in the murder of thousands of Cambodian peasants. No big deal. Major screw-ups are no big deal... Can anyone say in retrospect this man inspired them?
