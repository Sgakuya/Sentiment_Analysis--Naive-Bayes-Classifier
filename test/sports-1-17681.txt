I have no idea why the national media loves the Lions and Tigers, but hates the Pistons and Red Wings. The Lions and Tigers suck; always will, always have. For some reason, the national media will write articles till the sun drops on the Lions and Tigers, but even when the Pistons or the Red Wings go deep in the playoffs...it's chirp, chirp, chirp...I think the Lions have a team management problem, and it's not necessarily the coach. They always get great wide receivers, had one great running back and can't seem to get a competent QB to save their life. Not great, not good, DECENT. I believe that if they drafted Ben Roethlisberger, they would still go 3-13. What a bunch of perennial losers.
