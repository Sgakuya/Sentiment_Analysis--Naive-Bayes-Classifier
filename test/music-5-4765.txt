Argggh! LOVE them! And I am a World music freak who didn't even think I liked rock anymore, for years. Yet I used to be a fairly avid Deadhead and had all their stuff. Recently my neighbor let me hear, and then burned 3 CDs for me of some of Phil Lesh Friends' latest live music, and I find I like these guys' sound even more than I did the original Dead's. I especially love the way they do so many of the early Dead tunes and all those great long jams. This is truly the #1 rock band ever. We former Deadheads are very lucky -- and superlucky to be able to also listen to them free on the Web.
