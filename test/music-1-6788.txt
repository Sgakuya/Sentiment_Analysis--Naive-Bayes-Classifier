Are you kidding me? Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive!! Can you tell the difference between my way and my generation other than the mindless lyrics? What are these songs supposed to be about? It's just a bunch of jumbled sentences without any meaning! And don't tell me that it's about the music 'cause this isn't music! This is pure crap! Can Fred's voice get any higher and/or annoying? Limp Bizkit lost a fan with this cd. I thought Significal Other was crap but this is worse, much worse. This cd belongs with all the other Nu Metal crap ... inside a flaming garbage dump!! Yeelch!!
