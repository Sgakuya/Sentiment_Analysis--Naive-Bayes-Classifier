If I had just discovered Jimmy Eat World a few months ago and if The Middle was the first song of theirs I ever heard, then I might, maybe, almost, kind of, nearly, somewhat be inclined to give it a rating of 1.000001. However, Bleed American is not the first Jimmy Eat World album I ever heard, nor is The Middle the first song. And having said that, this album is absolute crap. Mass-produced emo-pop at it finest (worst). Anyone who has heard Clarity or Static Prevails will tell you this is a pathetically pathetic heap of patheticness. Pathetic. Of course, good taste helps, but I can't walk on water. I'm working on it, though. I think the first tip off that these guys were going soft (yeah, I know, it's not like they're a bunch of metal heads, but you know what I mean) was after the World Trade Center attacks. The tragedy of September 11th, 2001, prompted the retitling of Jimmy Eat World's latest work, Bleed American, to, are you ready, JIMMY EAT WORLD! How clever! How PC! I hadn't even heard a note of music from that record, but I already knew that something was wrong. What a waste of time and all-around declaration of Hey, we're pansies! than to retitle an album like that for fear of disturbing the post-911 porcelain dolls that now inhabit the United States. So when I finally heard The Middle, I knew it was over. Jimmy Eat World is now content to be as non-offensive and radio-friendly as they possibly can. Like, oh my god, Stacy! I can, like, totally listen to this with my parents! I suppose you gotta get your retirement money somehow.
