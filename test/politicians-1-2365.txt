I never thought I'd witness the day when I would see a classy, intelligent, well-mannered Democrat, but that day is here! Compare Mr. Obama's reasonable, courteous questioning of Condi Rice to the vile rantings of Kerry, Boxer and Kennedy. Keep up the good work, Senator! I had to change my rating--he blew it by comparing himself to Lincoln-- puh-leeze!
