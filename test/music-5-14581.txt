The time was right. The energy was high. The Bee Gees were IT! Riding high on a wave success in the mid 70's, The Bee Gees created perfection on this album. The fact that Barry Gibb delved into R B with his falsetto proves that not only are the Bee Gees outstanding writers, but incredible singers in natural or falsetto harmonies.
