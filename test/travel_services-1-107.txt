I gave Alaska Air aka Robbing Hood Air a 1 but wish it could have been a 40 below. Left for King Salmon, Alaska from LAX for a six week kayak trip in the Katmai and surrounding area. Upon arrival found the top to my barrel pack missing and the contents gone including some of the parts necessary to put my kayak together. Robbing Hood Airs response. Oh well! Had to immediately turn around and head back to LAX. Out my planefare, Golite hex tent, MSR filter and dragonfly stove, Northface 800 down bag, system 2l fly reel, Kershaw blade runner, small kayak parts and other gear. Thicker N'theives. You can read about my missed adventure at angelfire.com/ky/soybeans. Just click on Robbing Hood Air Next year it won't be Alaska Air. Sincerly, Flip Stoker P.S. The coffee was okay.
