I am absolutely obsessed. I love love love the movie! And the soundtrack! But not everyone does, you will either love it or you will hate it. If you have very strange taste, like myself and many others, I strongly reccomend giving this music a try (and the movie too)! You can sing and dance to it, or just listen, but it seems as if whenever I play the CD I can't stop listening!
