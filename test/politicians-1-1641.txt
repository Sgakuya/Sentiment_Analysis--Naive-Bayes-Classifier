Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is another failed politician. He promised prosperity, but instead has landed Iran in isolation with a possible war and this can only decimate an already failing economy. He broke his promises to the Iranian people who trusted him to continue with Khatami's work and still be a strong leader who will not bow too much to George W. Bush. Instead, Ahmadinejad may even do George W. Bush a favour, as his attitude is a complete turnoff and a war to oust him would indeed be welcome. Being an educated man with a doctorate, there is more to Ahmadinejad than anti-West/Israeli propaganda and fundamentalist religion as educated people don't believe in that kind of thing. Instead, Ahmadinejad is a pawn in a falling out between the Mullahs who control the Islamic Republic and the Basij/Revolutionary guards/military who want to turn Iran into a Pakistan-style military Islamic Republic sans Ayatollahs.
