It is a sad day in America when the inventor of the internet(hahahahahaha) and Vice President of the United States,Al Gore, gets a site on the internet shut down when he and Ralph Nadar conspire to rig the election by manipulating the votes. From what I understand the states where Gore needed votes you would vote for him and where Bush needed votes they would vote for Nadar. I would like more information on this if possible but I am pretty sure it is true since it was on the news and the site was shut down...Shame on you Gore is that the example you want for your 1yr old grandson? YOU SHOULD TAKE HEED OF THE FOLLOWING!!!!! First I would like to say thank goodness for our founding fathers and those who fought for our freedom in the revolutionary, Civil, WWI, and WWII wars. Also Thank you to all who have given their lives in the conflicts that followed such as Korea and Vietnam. I am a veteran of the United States of America. I believe it is the greatest country on earth. But, I have to say that we are diminishing in that capacity because of the ethnic differences within our borders. I just finished watching the NEW Mel Gibson movie the Patriot. When you look at history in school and here it from others it does not have the same affect as seeing it and experiencing it with your own eyes. This country is made up of people from all over the world who wanted a better life. So they came here seeking freedom and a chance at the American dream they hear about so often. Here are the things that upset me as an American. I have to say that I am sick and Tired of hearing I am European American, I am Cuban American, I am African American. WAKE UP PEOPLE YOU ARE AMERICAN!!!!! There is nothing wrong with your roots and being proud of them but BUCK UP and understand if you want to have the prefix of Eurpoean, Cuban, Mexican, African, and etc.... THEN GO BACK WHERE YOUR ANCESTORS CAME FROM!!!!! I am tired of when America stands against tierany and then all the people having roots in that country that live a free life here come out against AMERICA!!!!! THAT IS A BUNCH OF BULL^#% . I saw this first hand when I was stationed in the USAF at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. WAKE UP AMERICA AND UNDERSTAND YOU ARE AMERICANS no matter the color, cread, or background!!!!! When we all realize that then we will truly be the greatest country in the world. That is what the people in the military of this country are fighting for and dying for. That is what George Washington the Father of our country fought for. SO BE A PATRIOT AND BE AN AMERICAN!!!
