Have been going 2 Einstein's, cause of their coffee, honey butter & bagels-not their staff or upkeep on the restaurant, unless you don't mind ANTS near the windows! They need more efficient staff that cares for the customers. A woman spilled her drink, a man attempted to help her, but she had to wipe the entire spill off of the floor w/ napkins. Couldn't an employee have come to clean up the spill? Get a clean mop, employee to help in those circumstances. My last & final visit to Einstein's. Best of luck to their service.
