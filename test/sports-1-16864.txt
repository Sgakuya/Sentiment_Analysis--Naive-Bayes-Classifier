I hate the Patriots more than any other team in the NFL, including the Cowboys when I was kid in the 80s and 90s. They are quite simply the LUCKIEST and MOST OVERRATED 3-time Super Bowl winners ever. All three wins were the result of either bad calls, fluke plays and/or the other team simply running out of time. They could have easily lost all three Super Bowls. Other reasons I despise the Pats: - they play dirty and get away with it - they whine and throw fits when things don't go their way and when the refs pull their heads from their rears and actually call a foul on them - most fair weather fans in the league. Unlike devoted fans in Green Bay, Pittsburgh and Cleveland who come to the games even when their teams suck, Patriots fans only started coming to games when the team started becoming successful. Weren't they almost on the verge of leaving Boston less than 20 years ago due to lack of fan support?? - the constant ass-kissing of the East Coast elitist sports media making the Pats sound like the greatest team ever when there are at least 4-5 other teams in the league this year (Colts, Steelers, Bears, Seahawks and Bengals) who were better than the Patriots. Everyone knows they only finished their season on a high note because they played soft, easily beatable teams! - the tuck rule, enough said.
