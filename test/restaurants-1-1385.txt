In the Kansas City and Lawrence areas, the service is TERRIBLE at Sonic restaurants no matter what time of day or how busy they are. Their food is okay - no complaints - but nothing special either. Do your waistline a favor and eat at goodcents or taco bell instead - you can walk into a goodcents and order your sandwhich and eat it in the same time it takes Sonic to brings yours out, and you'll be saving all that gas instead of running your car idle while you wait!
