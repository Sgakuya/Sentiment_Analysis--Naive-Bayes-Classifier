Dave MAtthews Band is a great band. I have been a huge fan for many years. What i love about him is that his music is different and not like everyone else. So many of their songs are the greatest songs ever. Lie in our graves (my fav) crush crash tripping billies dreams of our fathers, many many more. Dave is great and anyone that like music should own any of his CD S.
