Dear Mr. Gore, I Voted and made a mistake. I thought I punched something twice. I TOOK THE TIME TO ASK!!! I was told I could redo my ballot and the first would be shredded OR I could leave it as it was. Then my vote on that part would not be counted. I really think you are a SORE LOOSER ! You are making a disgrace out of our HONARABLE COUNTRY , I think you should THROW IN THE TOWEL WHILE YOU STILL HAVE FOLLOWERS. I wrote to you and Tipper after the first Debet. I never heard from you then I really don't know why I am assuming any different now. Virginia, Arkansas
