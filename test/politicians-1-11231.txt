I just saw you on the nightly news talking about the wild horses. I vomited up my dinner. You actually made me physically ill. How dare you send the mustangs to their death. Much less, to be eaten by wealthy people like you. Let them be adopted and not sold to the highest bidder. Most likely, that would be friends of yours. Years ago, I couldn't believe how older people talked about politicians. My God --- Now I understand!!!!!! How sad for us. Lois Nichols
