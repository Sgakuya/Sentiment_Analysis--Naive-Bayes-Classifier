This is my favorite album even though zep is my fav band. Don't be pissed Queens two. Never stop this awsome album. Play from start to finish and you'll find that queen was a hard rock band with a operectic sound. Orge Battle and Seven Seas of Rhye are may favortives. I love seven seas opening Fear me you lords and many semetars I stand before nake to the sky.I swear i kill any man who tries to abuse my trust. I swear that you'll me mine , the seven seas of rhye. great song
