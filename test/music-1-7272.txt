Stupid, stupid, stupid. A pretentious attempt at being artists. This band couldn't play. Axl Rose is an untalented yodeler. Just because you put an orchestra behind you and try to have a slick looking video won't cover up the fact that this band had nothing spiritual or timeless to offer besides a bunch of drunk smoking band members posturing in everything they ever did. The girl in the video is probably regretting she ever touched that slimy greaseball to this day. Slash sux!
