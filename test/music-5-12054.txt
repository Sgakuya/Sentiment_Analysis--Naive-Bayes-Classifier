A good cd with solid tracks. It could have more fast tracks and more dance grooves, but i like it overall. I like the track if I told you that that's my favorite. I also love the reagular version to it's not right but it's ok and the remix they play on the radio. I also like the track hearbrek hotel it is a really emotional track that really coveys the messasge that's true about boyfreinds leaving us and messing around with other chicks. and the track when you belive feat. mariah is a really powerful track with aolts of meaning and anything is possible when you belive ! Just put it simple, A GREAT CD!!
