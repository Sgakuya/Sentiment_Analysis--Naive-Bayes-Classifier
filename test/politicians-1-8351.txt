Reagan doesn't deserve one star,he and his cohorts were enenmies of working people,he got credit for ending the cold war,all he did was take OUR MONEY AND SPEND RUSSIA TO IT'S KNEES,and there's not ONE thing positive he did for the people of America,not counting Dubya,he is one of,if not the worst leader(and I use the term loosely)in the country's history
