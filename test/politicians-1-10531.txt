Bush is a stupid baboon face as$Hole who has no idea what in hell he's doing. He's the worst president we've ever had ... can't somebody make a petition to throw him out or something? He sucks. He's sending this country to the sh*t. Now he's making people get Small Pox vaccines even though it is a fact that it will make a few thousands of Americans get sick and die and the terrorists probably have not even thought of biological warfare. Bush is just making a big storm in a small glass of water. Who does he think he is? His stupid war is taking us to the sh*t. How could someone so stupid make it all the way up to the presidency. This man has dog $#!+ in the head.
