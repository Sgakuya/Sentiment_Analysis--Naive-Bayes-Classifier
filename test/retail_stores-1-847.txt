Terrible customer service and poorly designed luggage. We purchased an extra-large rolling duffel bag and had the frame collapse. This caused the bag to drag and tear during its first use on an overseas trip. The bag was discarded as it was useless and its large size made it impossible to bring it on the plane. Although we sent them pictures of the damage, Eddie Bauer refuses to compensate us in any way while admitting that discarding the bag was a reasonable solution to the problem.
