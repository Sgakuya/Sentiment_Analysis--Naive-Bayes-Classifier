UPDATE: Bush a country bumpkin? Elected by the rednecks? Playing cowboys & indians? America would be safer with Kerry? But it's the rednecks who are incapable of rational, thoughtful discourse. A fine representation of our friends across the big pond. Heaven help Tony Blair and the sliver of people who understand real danger. Why is it so difficult to see a value, any value, in an aggressive response to a vicious attack against innocent Americans? 3,000 died, but 50,000 could have that day, but for the grace of God and the bravery of our first responders. Bush didn't invent the idea, Kennedy used it, Reagan used it, Bush, Sr. used it, FDR used it. Americans got their ass kicked when they approached an enemy with a pen instead of an M-16. We do better when we make the enemy go get the pen. ORIGINAL COMMENT (of which I'm quite proud) 7/23/04: This guy is the democrat party presidential nominee and he's not even in the top ten on this list? OK it's unscientific but wouldn't you think that he would be among the most popular DEMOCRATS? GWB appears poised for a Reagan-like surprise landslide after which rank & file democrats will be walking around saying, Nobody voted for the guy but somehow he got elected.
