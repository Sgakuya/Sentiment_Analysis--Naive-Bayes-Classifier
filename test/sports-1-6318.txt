Forget the game, ya'll beat us fair and square. Props. I want to address something else: I ask all dook fans who deny that the crazies are posers, and deny the local/yankee fan thing (I know some of you are local), but anyway............Go to espn.com's college basketball page, bring up the story of the game, scroll down, and on your right in 'related articles' there is a piece titled 'Crazy Dance', or it might say 'Crazies don't measure up.' Check it out, and you might begin to understand where some of our claims come from, and why most locals don't like you. Trust me, it's not because you're good. Again, good game last night. Much respect to the team. This has nothing to do with that. This about the character of the parties involved. FYI for those who aren't going to read it, most dook students think the crazies are poser dorks - dook students think that, mind you. And it brings up another good point: What does Jawad Williams or another Tarheel care if you're wearing a bow tie and sunglasses, and does he even notice? In other words, they might as well be performing on Broadway - they don't know anything about basketball. They just know when they arrive at Durham from Vermont or wherever, that they're crazy now. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee!** **************************************** *********************WOW, we're psychic! Aren't we guys? Gee WIZ golly condor, that's exactly what we thought they said, isn't it? NOTHING! That was lamost as big an upset as them beating us..........by 1, when they played awesome and we played our worst game. BY 1!- and we played as poor as we possibly could and they played perfect. HA HA ! How did Carolina do in Blacksburg? - won by 34! You suck, you just hadn't been exposed before tonight. Lucky bitches - I wish we got to play VA TECH twice.
