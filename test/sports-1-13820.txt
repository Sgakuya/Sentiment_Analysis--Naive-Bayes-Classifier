I can honestly say that this guy is terrible, possibly the worst coach in the league. Even though he was one of the most successful offensive coordinators in recent memory, he's an embarassment as a head coach. Defensively, the Raiders have suffered under his regime, giving up the most points in the league in 2004. To make matters worse, this offensive genius didn't even manage to get Oakland to have an offense in the top half of the league (ranked 18th). Considering the poor judgement in their offseason (grabbing Randy Moss to fix the only thing that wasn't broken on their team while letting their defense rot), they are set to break a new NFL record for futility. Between Moss, Porter, Curry, and Gabriel they might have nearly 5,000 passing yards, but teams will get alot of picks since they see it coming.
