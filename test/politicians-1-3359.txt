I tell you what classictvfan, you have no clue about anything about Iraq. You need to get you facts straight. Try talking to a veteran about Iraq before you go spewing your lies. As a Marine I have been there 3 times and that place gets more terrible and dangerous everyday. 20 provences are safe and secure. haha tell that to the marines and soldiers that have been killed in that hellhole. And no we havent found any weapons of mass destuction. Just small arms, rockets, mortars, mines, anit personnel and anti tank russian versions. no gas, chemical, or nerve agents. no uranium or plutonium. NO WMD's. Your info is way wrong. and I also liked your Afghanistan lie. That place is still full of terrorist cells and is actually heating up again. blossomed that country? I want to hear nothing from you. Your Twenty and dont know anything about the real world. If you really want to see Iraq and "Beautiful Afghanistan feel free to visit your local recruiter and find out for yourself. Thank a Veteran.
