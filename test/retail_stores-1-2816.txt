If I could rate this store at less than one star I would. My fiance bought my engagement ring at Helzburg Diamond. I have had it for a year and the setting broke. I took it to the store for repair, and they told me it was not on my warranty. I reluctantly agreed to pay to have it fixed. I was told I would be called when it was finished. I was never called. I went to check a week later to find that it had been done and waiting to be picked up for 5 days. I wasked why they did not contact me, and they told me that they tried to call me 4 times and my line was busy. I have call waiting so I find that very hard to believe. I looked at the ring to find a tooling mark all the way down the side of the fixed prong. I handed it back to the salesperson and asked what it was. She said just a tooling mark and handed it back to me. This is my engagement ring, there is no such thing as just a tooling mark. I demanded to speak to the store manager. He finally agreeded to fix it and waive the fee. He actually had the nerve to act like he was doing me a favor. I was not able to return to get the ring, so he UPSed my ring to me. When I got it, it still was not fixed right. I have tooling marks on the band and the prong was sharp. I actually cut myself on the prong of my engagement ring. I called the store and they denied that it was their fault. I will never shop here again, and I recommend that no one else who wants quality jewelery or services shop here. Quality of jewelery and customer service are worse than terrible!
