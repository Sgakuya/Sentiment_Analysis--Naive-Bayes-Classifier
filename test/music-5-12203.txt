Yeah Yeah its about time someone has moved my soul . I think Carl Thomas CD is one of the greatest CD of all times, for a freshman this is unbelievable work, singing, and talent. I met carl Thomas five years ago before he was a shining star, and I do remember telling him how one day he would make it, and how he should up keep that good voice. Well there he is (Carl Thomas).
