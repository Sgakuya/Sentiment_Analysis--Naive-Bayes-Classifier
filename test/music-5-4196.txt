This cd captures so much of the glory of the Bruce we all know and love! I bought this the day it came out, and I wasn't disappointed at all! Okay, not every song he ever did is on it, but the ones that are are some (repeat, some!) of the greatest! The USA tracks reflect widespread commercial success and 'springstomania'! The earlier tracks reflect the outright passion and joy of the E Street Band, and the later songs reflect how Bruce has grown as an ARTIST! I love this cd so much, and it just gives me a wonderful feeling to revel in this collection of heartfelt, beautiful music!
