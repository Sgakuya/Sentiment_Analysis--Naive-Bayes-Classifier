First of all Britney Spears is the reason there has not and will not be a woman president! She has set the women's rights movement back ten years. She parades her talentless, yet beautiful body around, surrounded by young pretty dancers. It's a travesty that a 17 year old (at the time) could openly sell her body for the all mighty buck!
