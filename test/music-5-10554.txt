My culture background is not westernized,is more ethnic and oriental.Therefor I don't find music of the new pop elite ,Britney and company very attractive,the only one who come very close to my ears and heart from this group is Ricky Martin. His music somehow captures the sound of my culture as well,but at the same time it expresses the vibrations of the so many people around the world.It's so easy to identified yorself with his music and his emotions and that's his greatness. The Best of Ricky Martin captures the sounds,the emotions,the rythms of him and all of us in one enormous hymn to the glory of life.
