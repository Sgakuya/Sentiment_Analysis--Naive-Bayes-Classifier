I have shopped at Winco for many years and as time goes by, 22 years to be exact. The store has prices that are ok and some things are cheaper but if you shop the other stores Safeway, Costco, and Walmart, the bargains you will find that they match or beat Winco's prices most times. The Winco stores always look dirty, dark and unorganized. The employees are the worst I have ever seen in a retail environment with the exception of Kmart (they are the WORST!!!) I have lived in many towns and from Boise to Oregon, Winco needs serious help on the CUSTOMER SERVICE lessons. I have been told I was wrong, that I could not have waited 20 mintues while the bottle boy talked with a younger girl for that long, and I have been looked at and since I am a woman and if a man is behind me the employee helps them because as I was told woman have more time than women? Really I would bet to differ!! I have been asked to move because they need to put their frieght out but in Corvallis, Oregon they will just ran you over so watch out!!!!!!! My favorite story is the one in Independence Oregon that never has enough checkers and the frieght people never help, they even have a Checker/bottle boy named Jay that gets away with telling people who are returning bottles that if the machine they want to use is full or not working then HE does not have to count the bottles and take them, he turns them away every time and they let him do it and laugh about it. I have witnessed this on three occasions and I only go to this store if I absolutely have too!!! So I ask how many times does this guy get to be so uncustomer friendly. I would never recommend this store or any others to anyone from other states. The price might be cheaper but the American public isn't stupid to know they are spending their hard earned money on them selves not the customer. Costco here I come. These are true stories and not sensored! Happy shopping some where else!
