I attended the Clay Aiken concert in Dayton, Ohio, a couple of weeks ago. I was overwhelmed by his amazing charismatic performance, those on backup, and the great audience response! That concert had fans on their feet and enthusiastic, from the minute Clay's name was mentioned, until 10 minutes after he has exited the stage! An nbelievable concert!!!
