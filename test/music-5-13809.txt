I've listened to every song on this CD, and I love every one of them. I think Kid Rock is a musical genious, combining rap (Ya Keep On) with rock (Dark Grey) with slow melodies (Abortion My Oedipus Complex). Now, Kid Rock DOES cuss a lot on this CD, so be aware of that. All in all, enjoy a look into Kid Rock's past, and with for a successful future.
