In the words of former congressman JC Watts from Oklahoma: A race hustling poverty pimp. He is one of the reasons the Democrats can't currently win an important national election anymore. People like him, Barbara Boxer, Cynthia McKinney, Al Sharpton, Maxine Waters, Teddy Kennedy and others pull the Democratic party even further away from mainstream American thought and values than do a bunch of Fundamentalist Christians who want to force feed Terry Schiavo and teach creationism.
