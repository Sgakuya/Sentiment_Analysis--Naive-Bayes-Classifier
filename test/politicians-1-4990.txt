OMG...this dude has totally lost it...although I did not agree with his ideas he did seem like a capable V.P.but over the course of the last few years he has acted a little strange...I mean I heard his last speech to the Democratic faithful and even they were even scratching their heads trying to figure out what he was ranting and raving about....a sure way for Kerry to lose the election is to give him any prominant role in this election cycle...hmmm not a bad idea after all...maybe Bush/Cheney should put him on their payroll...
