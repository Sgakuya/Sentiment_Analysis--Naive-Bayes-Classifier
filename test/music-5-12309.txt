This is a really fantastic album. I appreciate it so much more since I saw D'Angelo interviewed and he said how much Prince means to him and that the Voodoo album was in homage to him. You can really hear the Prince influence.I think D'Angelo really puts the groundwork that Prince laid in the 80's to use in creating a very today sounding album. This is modern soul music at its best.
