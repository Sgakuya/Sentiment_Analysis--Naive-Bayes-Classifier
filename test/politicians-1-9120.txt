He and his staff should all be imprisoned for defacing public property. It was and is the most vile treatment of public property I have ever seen. I hope that they all end up on the welfare system they hold in such high regard. I would rather call Mexico home rather then live through another Clinton term. I am amazed at the unprofessional level at which all of the Dumbasscrats have handled themselves. I would switch parties just because of his wife (the bitch). I HATE them. If H Clinton was on fire I would call my friends to watch.
