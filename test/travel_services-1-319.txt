We fly to London often. On the first (and only) time we took BA we sat in the cattle section in the very last seats. Because of the location, the seats did not go back but remained upright. Very tight and uncomfortable especially when the people in front of us reclined. BUT THE WORST WAS... there is a gutter located above the windows to collect the condensation from inside the plane. When the plane took off, all of that collected water ran down the gutter and splashed on my husbands head. GROSS! Never fly it again the competition is much better!
