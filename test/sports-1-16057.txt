Who does Keyshawn think he is? The guy has had two 1,000 yard receiving seasons, never been the best wide receiver in his conference (let alone the entire NFL), and he thinks he is Jerry Rice. Why doesn't he just shut his damn mouth? After all, the Jets did the right thing by him. They traded him to a Super Bowl contender who gave him a ton of money. Don't get me wrong, Keyshawn is a good player, but how about showing some class?
