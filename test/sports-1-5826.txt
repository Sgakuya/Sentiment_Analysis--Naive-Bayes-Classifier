It was hard to watch Duhon this year as he crumbled when given the opportunity to become the team leader. He never lived up to the hype as the go-to-guy once Williams, Dunleavy, and Boozer all bailed for the NBA. His shot was horriffic. I know he ended up leading the ACC in assists, but that was partly due to his lack of confidence in his shot and Coach K knew it. Averaged 9 points this year, up 1 point from last year when he was the 5th option. Daniel Ewing is now the man on that team, flying past Duhon who never felt comfortable holding the torch. Duhon is European bound.
