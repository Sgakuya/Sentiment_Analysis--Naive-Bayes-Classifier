To all the myrmidons out there who keep repeating over and over the economy was good , hello--I need to give you an economics lesson. The only Presients or any politician can do to help the economy is to LOWER TAXES and get rid of strangling REGULATIONS. Politicians do not create economies; geniuses do. Who are these geniuses? People like Bill Gates and Martha Stewart. Businessmen. Clinton is a dangerous socialist. When you vote for Democrats and sling mud at the actual businessmen who create an economy through inventions, industry, and commerce, you are killing your freedom. You socialists out there are leaving nothing but terror and poverty to your children. The Monica thing was NOT the worst thing about Clinton (only second worst.) His blatant hatred of capitalism, the constitution, and freedom was. HE built up North Korea, and instead of pursuing Osama bin Laden, he persecuted Bill Gates. He cut our army by 200,000 men and with the help of Doris Meisner, flooded this country with third world immigrants. Clinton is evil. He is another Saddam Hussein. All of you who worship Clinton are a bunch of good Germans .
