I am loving every moment of Carl Thomas's entire album. I can relate to his songs so vividly. The man is so talented! The sound of his voice his so soothing, it just touches every inch of my bones. Not only does he sound good on the album, but live as well. His voice is well trained, and his performances well prepared. He has it all...he is sexy,fine, and knows how to blow my mind. What about yours?
