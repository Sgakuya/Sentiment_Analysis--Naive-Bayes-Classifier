The most over rated President of them all! He almost turned the Cold War hot and he was a pussy. He couldn't stand up to the Soviets and that's why the CIA/FBI/Secret Service was justified in killing him! His reputation began to become legendary after he died. The only reason why he is so popular was the fact that he was the first President since Lincoln to be shot and killed! And, he wife was hoooooottttt!
