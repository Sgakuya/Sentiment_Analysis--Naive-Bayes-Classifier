Holy crap, these guys let Plummer go and think that a shot Emmitt Smith (who's gone for probably the year) and an average and very old Jeff Blake are going to bring them life? This team has always been awful, it seems, and there is no talent anywhere here. Maybe Ryan Leaf could come back since their penchance for losing seems never to be appeased. When a team is this lousy for this long, usually it's time to move to another city. Baghdad could use an NFL team!
