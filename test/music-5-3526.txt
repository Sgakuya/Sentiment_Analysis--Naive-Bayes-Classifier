This album was great but foreshawdoing of the bands eventual split. Comfortably Numb is one of the greatest songs in rock history, oh and dont give me this crap about Roger Waters is just a whiny baby and other people feel depressed and have lost loved ones too. OK, those people need to make an album that sell 23 million copies then i might admit Roger is just a baby.
