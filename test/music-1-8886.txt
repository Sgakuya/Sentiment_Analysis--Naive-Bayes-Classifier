i am sorry, but this band is the most horrible band on earth. they are riding a tred wave, where every song sounds the same, and there is no true talent involved. any drink kid with a guitar can crank out the same type of mediocre crap day in and day out, but does this mean that he deserves a record deal? hell no!!!! bor-ing....next please.
