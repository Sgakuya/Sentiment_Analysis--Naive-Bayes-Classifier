I have to give this place a bad rating solely based upon it's contribution to the homogenization of America. I went into one once to see what it was like, and it was like a down-home Walmart. Why go to a fake country store? Why not go to a real one? Why have chain restaurant food? Why not find a real old-fashioned country restaurant or a good old diner. When I go to a different city for a vacation, I don't want to find all the same restaurants and shops I left at home. Death to the mega-chain stores and restaurants! Rise up! Go to the mom and pop shops! Don't let the man keep you down. Be the ball, Danny. Etc.
