Overall this was a very good CD. I had about 4 songs I really loved. The rest of the album is all very good. There wasn't one song I didn't like. This album has a lot of influence on Rob Moma's recent marriage. His lyrics and album were extremely influenced by his romance. This is a sweet, upbeat album.
