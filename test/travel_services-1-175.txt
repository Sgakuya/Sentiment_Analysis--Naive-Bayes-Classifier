I worked for Delta years ago, as did my father. It was the best run company I have ever seen, or worked for--no one left, and passenger service was not just the most important thing, it was the ONLY thing that mattered. Tho I hate--HATE--to say this, the negative reviews are all too true now. Delta has become a monster, huge and so poorly run that bankruptcy seems inevitable. Tho I contine to fly them when I can, my choice is based on vastly misplaced loyalities, and I certainly should have my hear examined! On the other hand--there are NO good airlines that fly in and out of the city where I live, and airfares from this location are inflated to make sure that the airport authority stays rich.So--Delta from Charleston, SC is no worse--or better--than my other choices. Please--give me regulated airlines again!!!
