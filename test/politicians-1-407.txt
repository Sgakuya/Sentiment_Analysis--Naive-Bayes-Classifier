Blair is a Tory by any other name. Labour is no longer the party of the workers it was set up for. Yet trade unions still pay the Labour Party cash. The sooner trade unions can find their feet, wake up, and dissafiliate themselver from Labour, the better. Labour's policies, especially on asylum, have pandered to the worst kind of middle English middle class twats. Afraid to upset anybody, his trying to be all things to all people made most people dislike him. The gap between rich and poor is now higher than in Thatcher's day, and the NHS and the railways, because Blair doesn't have the guts to turn them back to the working, nationalied institutions they were, from the privatised, under-funded, crumbling laughing stocks they are now after years of Tory mismanagement. He is a disgrace to the name of the Labour Party, as is the whole Cabinet. Keir Hardie and John Maclean must be spinning in their graves.
