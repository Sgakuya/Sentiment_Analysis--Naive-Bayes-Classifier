I never thought a day would come when everyone wore the same clothes. This is truly crap. The shirts are very expensive, every prep and jock in school wears this junk. The only A and F shirts I wear are hand-me-down. I don't know which day will be better, when we catch Osama or this store will die out. Both I doubt will happen anytime soon.
