I guess fat, uneducated beer swilling white trash need musicians to look up to. Give Bruce his due, he found a market of low foreheads that like his labored ballads and cheesy rocker tunes and made a career out of appealing to them by coming across as one of them. They say his shows are great but all I saw was a tired, obviously rehearsed act that did little to hide the low quality of his music.
