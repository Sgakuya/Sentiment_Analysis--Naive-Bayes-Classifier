 Rudy deserve credit for making NYC a safer place. But he is a Conservative hypocrite. He has the nerve to criticized the Brooklyn Art museum for their lack of morals. Yet this tyrant has no problem in moving his mistress to the Gracie mansion. He doesn't care about his children's feelings. I haven't seen the Conservative Republicans complaing about his behavior. It is morally wrong for Bill Clinton to cheat on his wife. But it is okay for Rudy, Newt G, or any Republican to have a bimbo lying around . ....Give me a break!
