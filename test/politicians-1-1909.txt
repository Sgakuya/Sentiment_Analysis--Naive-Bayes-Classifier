I have lived in Florida for 14 years, and I despise him greatly. There is no space here to help someone understand the amount of injustice Jeb Bush has gotten away with. He claims to be helping schools, but the overcrowding of students in Miami-Dade, where I attended, is horrid. I had no idea what the book looked like for HONORS algebra 2, I didn't learn a single thing, I flunked every test, and they passed me with an A for the ADVANCED summer program. If you are late to class, you miss your seat. It's a circus. Of course people have a hard time passing nation-wide tests. South Florida's public schools are a disaster.
