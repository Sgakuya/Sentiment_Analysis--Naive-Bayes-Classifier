Clinton, as comander in chief, so abused the military that HE is personally responsible for under funded and manned units that lost lives in Bosnia and other countries. He is guilty of dereliction of duty in many ways. Not the least of which is the transfer of necular secrets by his adminstration to foriegn governments that hate the US and want to destroy us. His lack of action against Osama bin Laden directly resulted in the Sept 11th catastrophy. He should be tried, and if found guilty, punished just like any other traitor would be.
