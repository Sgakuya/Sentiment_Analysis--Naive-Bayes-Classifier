nothing has be shown by HILL for the benefit of the team he plays for. beside playoffs and co-rookie of the year, GRANT HILL is such a dissapointing player. he's a jayson williams (former NETS) type of guy who plays very well to get big contract, then injured himself so that he could enjoy his money while still get paid. SUCH A LOSER
