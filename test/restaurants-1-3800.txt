I am lucky enough to retain my childhood memories from about age 1.75 on. Unfortuntaely, one of the things I recall is going to Chuck E. Cheese (CEC, as I will refer to it from this point on). I was only at CEC a few times--five, if I recall correctly. The first four were with my parents and maternal grandparents. The first time I was there I was very young--about 18 months or so. I had been eating pizza from Pizza Hut for a while so my family decided to take me to CEC. All I did was sit with my family, as I loved being in their company at that age (I'll admit that I still love family meals and I'm almost 19). The next few times happened at what seemed to be 9 month intervals. I was never fond of the pizza, and usually only rode one of those 25 cent cars (most people should know what they are from that description)--and that's only because my dad gave me a few quarters to trade in for tokens. I actually walked away with a number of tokens, and they've been with my coin collection for 13+ years now! Too bad they're not worth anything like Barber Quarters. My dad actually won me a ton of tickets playing some game, but we didn't cash them in for anything since I was so uninterested in the place. The last time I was there was for my friend Jimmy's fifth birthday party. It was nice having dinner with my friends, but the pizza was still bad and I still wasn't that into the entertainment they had there. This was on November 4, 1992, and would be the last time I set foot in a CEC. Note that I was exactly five years, two months, and had yet to have a good experience at CEC. The CEC around my house shut down in 1993 and Levin Furniture expanded into the old area. A new CEC opened in another area in 1998. During the five year hiatus I never missed it once, and I had no comments about the CEC that had opened. Thankfully I got out of going there with my cousin when she was in town since she behaved badly. I've frequently been told I was crazy as a child because I didn't like CEC. This may be true, as it seems every little kid enjoys going there. For the record, my favorite place to go for dinner in my 0-9 years was Cranberry Hall, a now defunct family owned restaraunt that specialized in dinners such as baked ham, fried shrimp, and stuffed chicken. It shut down in October 1995 and Red Lobster became my de facto favorite. This review is out there for the 1% of parents who has warped tastes, such as myself. However, I was able to program in HyperCard at the age of five, so I guess there's a tradeoff somewhere.
