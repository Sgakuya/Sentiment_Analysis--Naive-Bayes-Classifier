1. Misleading Service at Las Vegas Apt site: 1 They removed driver's car manual,from car !-- despite fact that I said that car was new to me. They said that they needed to make sure that Manual was not lost to them, as they had to return it for their own lease purposes ! 2. Charges were greater at site than listed on Internet, with increase being effectively hidden, unless I played lawyer at the counter !--- seeming lack of integrity 3. Would NOT choose them again, if possible. ----MAPE
