I wish I could give an anti-matter rating to this former pest exterminator from Laredo, Texas. When this pathological liar was elected to the House from his Houston district, he entered government with a vow to help business and industry---which, in and of itself, isn't wrong---but to accomplish this goal at the expense of the poor, the indigent, the homeless, gutting social programs that were designed to benefit minorities and give them a helping hand, the Peace Corps, VISTA, environmental laws (DeLay was instrumental in eliminating or severely curtailing such laws in Texas because his pesticide company used chemicals that had been banned by the EPA but were accepted and even encouraged when he lived in Venezuela, where he began his company), federal safety regulations, and so forth. His name is certainly befitting regarding his legislative style in Congress. He's an intolerant bully with a pathological hatred of federal government (which he represents) and its laws designed to protect us from excesses (hence checks and balances). He's a notorious arm-twister who has done, and will do, anything just this side of the law to fight campaign-finamce reform because it's a threat to the way he does business in Houston and in Washington. He's not above accepting PAC money from questionable sources who, reportedly, are under federal investigation (no surprise here). He's for Tom DeLay, and Tom DeLay alone. This guy is no one to sneeze at. He's a master fund-raiser who has contributed to just about every right-wing wacko group, paramilitary or not, out there. I wonder if he is Charlton Heston's love slave.
