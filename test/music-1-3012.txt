The 60s are over with deal with it. I cannot relate to music this old, it's corny and so outdated in today's world. It may have been cool for teenage teenie boppers back 40 years ago. Man has it been that long. The whole bowl haircut and clean cut goodie goodie image is so yesterday. These guys got at least a little creative in their later years, I guess if you are taking LSD and other heavy drugs you're going to be creative even if it involves bad singing and 3 chords on a guitar. I never got it off with that revolution stuff.
