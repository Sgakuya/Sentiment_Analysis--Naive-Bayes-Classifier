Although I'm more of a fan from their stuff from the 80's, they continue to put out great music. There are not too many bands out there that have been around this long and can continue to draw record crowds. With today's music lacking credibility and the invasion of sugar-coated pop garbage, i.e. boy bands and britney spears, it's nice to know that some things never change!
