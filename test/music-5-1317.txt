Costello's nearly flawless debut, featured Alison, Watching The Detectives, I'm Not Angry, Miracle Man, etc,. The Ryko release features some excellent acoustic bonus tracks like Wave A White Flag, Cheap Reward Blame It On Cain. This is one cd I'd rather surrender two fingers than to have to live without. The beginning of an ever-changing, brilliant career that has rarely, if ever, been matched.
