I recieved a 3 stone diamond necklace for Christmas 3 years ago. Shortly after the chain broke and I took it in to have it fixed and paid $20.00 to have it repaired. That was ok, but 3 years later the chain broke again and I took it in and was told it would be another $20.00. That was fine too. The clerk at the counter took it to the back room to the repairman and returned with the diamond pendent and told me to hold on to it and take it home and I could pick up the chain in two weeks. I returned in 2 weeks and picked up the chain and brought it home only to find out the pendent couldn't sllp back on over the new clasp. I took it back to Kay's at Fox Valley mall in Aurour Ill. The sales clerk first argued with me about it being able to go back on. When she finally couldn'nt get it on she took it back to the repairman and returned to say I could pick it up in a week and a half. When I told her I had already waited 2 weeks and wanted to wear it since it was the Christmas season and I had a few nice avents to attend she told me that would be another $20. After I told her that was unexeptable she took it back to the repairman then returned to tell me I could pick it up Saturday, 3 days later I said ok. When I returned on Saturday on my way to an appointment they could not find the ring. A half hour later the clerk found it sitting under the cash register not even done. This clerk was able to get the repair man to fix it then, but I was late for my appointment after spending 45 mins. there. Then when I got it home I relized they put it on a longer chain so you couldn't even see the diamonds. It was too long. I will never shop at Kays again and neither will andy of my friends for family!!!!!!
