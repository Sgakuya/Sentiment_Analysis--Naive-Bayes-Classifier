I am saddened by this man who is now president. He is only a puppet for the powerful rich. Every week, he does something new behind our backs (this week giving a huge tax break to the most profitable company in history,) while trying to mislead everyone's thoughts elsewhere. He doesn't stick to his own policies and lies and covers up whenever he likes. We have gone from a balanced budget to debt like we have never seen before. The worst thing is that it is not going to help our military (they are losing benefits and have never had the correct equipment), but into the pockets of big companies. We, the working middle class are the ones paying it back. Last month, Halliburton got another 30 million dollars to build a new prison at Guantanimo. I could go on and on, but it gets me depressed, especially knowing that every child born today is now $39,000 in debt to the government.
