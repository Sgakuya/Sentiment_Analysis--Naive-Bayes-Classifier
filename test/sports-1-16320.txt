A complete and utter moron. He puts his ego above all else. The Eagles should dump this guy, the drama isn't worth it. One year after signing a new contract, this fool is actually going to hold out of camp, come to it, then get kicked out. Now he's starting trouble with QB McNabb. What is his problem? 49 million not enough? It sure is a heck of a lot better than what he'd be making outside the NFL, which would be in the range of 10K to 75K a year. If he keeps it up, a job that pays 10K to 75K might be his only future source of income. He could be a used car salesman though, he's already unlikeable.
