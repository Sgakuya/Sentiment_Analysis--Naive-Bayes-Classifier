Whole Foods Market is very unfair to their employees they are under paid and over worked. What I think is very disturbing is the mental stress and controling that they do. They will fire you for being sick , they call it finals. They fire people who have children to support. They only care about the profits they make. Please do not shop there. They are control freaks and do not believe in family values. I do know this first hand I used to work there and they did not want to let me off work when my father was in the hospital dying of cancer. I went to see him he died several hours later and I was fired the next day.
