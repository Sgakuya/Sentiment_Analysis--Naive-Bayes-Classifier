Coolidge presided over the bubble that burst on Hoover during his first term in office. But it's important to remember that Coolidge's expansion in the 20's most definitely did not bring everyone along with it. The 1920s was the time of great drought in Oklahoma, Kansas, and the other states that formed the Dust Bowl. This was an economic and ecological disaster that the government should have taken steps to alleviate. Coolidge's non-action had consequences for the severity of the crises in the Dust Bowl, the impact on the rest of the nation, and the shape of the Great Depression. I find Coolidge as underwhelming as some of the pro-business disasters of 1870s and 80s.
