The only reason that i think Alex is terrible is because, when he went to my school as a guest appearence he seemed like he was too good for us normal people! The whole time he was talking he kept on looking at his watch like he wanted to go! How rude! And at the end he wouldn't even stick around to shack our hands! He might be cute, but he ain't all that!
