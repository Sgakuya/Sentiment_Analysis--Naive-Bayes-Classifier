It is amazing how misinformed and ignorant people can be. Do you really think Bill Clinton had ANYTHING to do with the economy in the 90's. ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY NOT!!! The economy is cyclical and the technology boom (Computers, Internet, Cell Phones, etc) of the 90's helped the economy. Now that Dot Com companies are going under, the demand for high tech products is dropping, which leads to lay-offs in manufacturing jobs. Don't blame President Bush, if anything blame the guy that pushed for NAFTA......Slick Willy!!
