Hans Zimmer and other associating artists have done it again with this very moving score for Gladiator. Zimmer's ingenuity in mixing and blending contemporary harmonies with classical overtones complements the telling of the Gladiators struggle for freedom. Listen especially to the final track Now We Are Free to glimpse the magic of such a phenomenal piece of Zimmer's artistry.
