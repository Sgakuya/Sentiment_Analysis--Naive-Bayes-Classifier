This album targets kids under 13....or so I thought. Turns out there are teens supporting this kid's music...what's wrong with the world? is And to angellotsofnumbers...you classify good music on the basis of how much MONEY and LOOKS the artist has? HAHA! MORON! How shallow is that? So basically, 'so what if he is not very good at singing. He's cute,rich and famous...and therefore extremely talented and anyone who thinks otherwise is a 'hater'.' hmm....how old were you in 2002?
