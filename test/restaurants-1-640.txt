The most over-hyped food in the USA, these donuts will give you instant high blood sugar. But worse, they don't taste even halfway good if they aren't fresh out of the store oven, and they are disgustingly sweet. Only people who've never tasted a good, homemade donut will like these things, and that's probably why they are popular. People today don't know what good homemade donuts and cakes taste like, and believe me, they don't taste like this. Over hyped, over marketed, and all that media blitz swallowed by sugar craving souls. No thanks, I'll pass.
