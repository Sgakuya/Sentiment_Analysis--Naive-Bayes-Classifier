Probably the worst ever. Dragged us into a morass in Iraq and both lied and deceived us to do it. Presiding over massive deficits and running us into fiscal hole from which our kids and grandkids will have to struggle to pay - in the midst of a demographically unique period in history - when we will be an older country than ever before. This man is an absolute idiot.
