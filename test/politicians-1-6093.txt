Instead of focusing on our domestic safety in this country and the fight against terrorism, Ashcroft is busy wasting his time and probably our tax dollars going after a few harmless, terminally ill people in Oregon who happen to use marijuana for medicinal purposes.

Why do some people feel the need to control others and tell them how to live; especially when those people aren't bothering anyone.
