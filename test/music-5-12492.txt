A true poet. 2pac is nothing at all like your usual rappers. I can't believe that people are giving him 1 star without even listening to him. Shame on these hypocrites doing that! 2Pac was a great poet. He was very much different from the bling-bling rappers. He never did the whitey keeping me down or bitchez and hoez thing.
