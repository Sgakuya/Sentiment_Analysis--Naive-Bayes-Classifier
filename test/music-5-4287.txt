All you people badmouthing this album are just plain idiots and dont know a thing about them in the first place. They laid the groundwork for everything out today, from rock to rap. Wake up and stop getting mad because a band that broke up 30 years ago can re-release the same old hits now, and out sell jokes like Backstreet Girls and that waste of human life Skittles, I mean Reeses Peices, I mean Eminem.
