Shaq no doubt has alot of little men helping his 340 pound ego out. LOL. you think the all time dual was John Stockton giving a good entry pass into Karl Malone. How about the way Dick Bavetta assists the 340 pound big assed ball hogging homo. The Kings could probly beat Shaq and the Lakers if the NBA was still ran by honest commisionars like the NFL, and MLB. But we all no the truth, David Stern has a script already written out every year to help the L.A. Ladies get on top.LOL, atleast other all time dominating teams like the G.B. Packers, N.Y. Yankees, and Boston Celtics really win their Tittles. Ha! The L.A. Ladies, their all a bunch of little sacks of, well, hum, I can't even think of a hateful enough name to put on them, because I wouldn't want to insult any dirty name by using it in place and referance, of the little HIV infested L.A. Ladies.
