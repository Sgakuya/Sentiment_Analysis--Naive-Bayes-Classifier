Only flew them because they wanted $250 to fly my family and I roundtrip from Boston to Jacksonville, FL when the only other carrier that had a flight, Delta, wanted $600. Was reminded very quickly why I try not to fly them. With the exception of the pilots, everyone else was very rude especially the flight attendants. Doesn't surprise me that they may go out of business...and I thought US Airways was bad!
