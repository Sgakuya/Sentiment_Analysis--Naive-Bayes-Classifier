Forget Watergate and stupid partisan sniping, and let's judge Nixon on his actions. His foreign policy was a disaster - egged on by the Mephistophelean figure of Henry Kissinger, he deliberately sabotaged the Johson peace talks on Vietnam, thus prolonging the war for 4 years at the cost of countless lives. He also ordered the bombing of civilians in Laos and Cambodia, killing at least 300,000 innocent people in peaceful countries the US was not at war against, and he never asked Congressional approval as mandated by the Constitution (in fact he deliberately hid it). This is simple mass murder, if not genocide. The Cambodian bombing also destroyed the monarchy, paving the way for the hardline communist Khmer Rogue to wipe out 2 million civilians (1/3 of their population) - so much for stopping communism! Nixon finally surrendered Vietnam to communism anyway, so all those millions of lives were lost in vain. Nixon also ordered the toppling of Chile's democratically elected socialist government, by assassination or coup if necessary, which lead to the murder of non-partisan Chilean military personel and diplomats both in South America and on US soil. As for economic policy, Nixon took America off the gold exchange standard, thus ushering in a decade of inflation which led the dollar to fall over 75% against hard currencies like the German Mark and Swiss Franc, thus impoverishing the poor and middle class by devaluing their savings 4 fold. He presided over America's 2nd worst recession of the 20th century, and pronounced We're all Keynesians now just as stagflation (a phenomenon considered impossible by Keynesians) overwhelmed the economy. Nixon imposed wage and price controls, which every economist knows is a counterproductive and damaging policy with no economic merits whatsoever, not to mention a violation of the constitutionally-protected freedom of contract. Nixon expanded tax and government spending, and imposed restrictions and red tape on business in fine socialist style. He totally trampled over the constitution, repeatedly exercising illegal unilateral executive power in aggressive foreign military operations and lying to Congress and the American people. He encouraged COINTELPRO which sent goon squads to spy on and harrass so-called dissidents like Martin Luther King and college students who objected to racism. Nixon personally was a loathsome man - he beat his wife, was an alcoholic who frequently made presidential decisions whilst blind drunk, referred to black people as n*ggers and jungle bunnies , and repeatedly lied to Congress and the people. Finally, he brought disgrace to the Presidential office and to America by having to resign in the face of what would have almost certainly been a successful impeachedment. For destroying the economy, imposing socialism, violating private property and freedom of contract, ordering the deaths of hundreds of thousands of neutral civilians, and causing the deaths of millions more (including over 50,000 Americans), sponsoring coups and assassinations in democratic countries abroad, and being a dishonest unprincipled racist, Nixon must ranks as by far the worst president in American history. His actions and beliefs stand in almost exact opposition to the principles for which the Founding Fathers risked and in many cases lost their lives. Jefferson and Washington must have been spinning in their graves while this loathsome con-man was in office.
