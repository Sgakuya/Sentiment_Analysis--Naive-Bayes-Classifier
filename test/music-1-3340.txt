I hate Van Halen more than any band in existence, though Styxx is right up there, or down there, whatever the case may be. I'm not saying that Eddie Van Halen (is that his name?) isn't talented, I just hate his band! Their music is atrocious, whenever I hear it, I think I'm going to have seizures. They need to be stopped! David Lee Roth, that other guy with the big hair are terrible, good thing they left, but the band still stinks.
