Dubya just had it out for Saddam and used 9/11 to justify it. WAKE-UP CALL--- Bin Laden and Al Qaeda were responsible, not Saddam. George Jr. considered Saddam his daddy's unfinished business and wanted to finish the job!! He wanted this so bad that he lied to and deceived the whole country in order to get a war that only he wanted. Even the rest of the world (see United Nations) tried to tell him no, but King Dubya is bigger and more powerful than the world in his own mind. Of course, he'll never come out and say that, but his actions speak so loudly that he doesn't have to. Finally, George, I think you owe the biggest explanation of all to the parents who have lost their children, spouses who have lost the people they loved, and children who have lost their parent...forever. WHY???!!!!!!
