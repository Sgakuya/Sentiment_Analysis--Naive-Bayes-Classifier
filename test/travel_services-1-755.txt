I rented a car in Cyprus via auto-europe. When I got the car I was asked to pay an extra $50 up front for fuel, although the voucher from auto-europe specifically said I had to return the car with a ful tank. I returned the car with a full tank and was not reimbursed for the fuel. I contacted auto-europe by email, and they said there is nothing they can do about it, and blamed me for not mentioning that I am returning the car with a full tank. Since the total rental price was $125, the extra $50 was a real cheat.
