Perhaps the greatest Cd of Paul Simon's remarkable career. Almost certainly the best of his solo career. All of his albums have had their strengths and 1970's Paul Simon is a personal favorite but only Still Crazy After All Years really comes close to this one. And while Simon and Garfunkle produced several stellar recordings, it's hard to think of one this consistently brilliant. From beginning to end Graceland is as fresh and creative as it is masterful. An excellent recording.
