A Night at the Opera is by far Queen's greatest album. Coupled with A Day at the Races, it has about everything you could want in music on one album. I'm in Love With My Car, Good Company, The Prophet's Song (a great classic that's barely ever recognized), and ending with the masterpiece Bohemian Rhapsody. This is definitely in the top 10 or 15 albums ever. I can't believe it didn't even make vh1's list.
