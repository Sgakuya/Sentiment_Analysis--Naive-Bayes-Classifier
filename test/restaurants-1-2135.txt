Since the introduction of Tims steeped tea along with the price increase I'll no longer be buy my coffees or teas there anymore. I'll like to know how a company can justify almost a 50% price increase in tea to the consumer? It is only hot water. Tim's cost for tea couldn't have jump 50%. To me it is just another sign that the dam Americans want to make Canada and all our natural resources their own. Tim Horton use to be as Canadian as hockey is to Canada.
