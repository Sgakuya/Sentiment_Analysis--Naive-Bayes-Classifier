I had my worst experience with this company, most of my furniture have scratches after the move. During the move there was a temporary problem with the elevator, movers wanted to go to lunch around the corner. Problem was fixed, despite my phone call they did not come back for 2.5 hours. After the move, I had some boroken stuff, a frame the picked up to replace within a week, it has been 3 months they have not done it. I would never let them move my staff again!
