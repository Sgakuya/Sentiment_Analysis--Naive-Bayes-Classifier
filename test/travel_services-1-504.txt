lily6601, Torontonians in general are rude and hateful. A bunch of wannabes who will never be. As for the airport, very boring and bland. The guy driving me from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 also drove past the terminal and forgot to drop us off. He then had to do a big loop that took an extra 15-20 mins. Good thing I planned for a screw up by a typical Torontonian half-wit.
