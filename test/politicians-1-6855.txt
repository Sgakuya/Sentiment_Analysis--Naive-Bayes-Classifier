What is wrong with this guy? It's bad enough that a redneck is in heading the senate... but a moron??? What could he possibly have been thinking? I hate the whole political correct phenomenon as much of the next guy, but a leader in America's government just can't get away with saying that segregation would be better for the country. He needs to resign ASAP, or he will bring Bush down.
