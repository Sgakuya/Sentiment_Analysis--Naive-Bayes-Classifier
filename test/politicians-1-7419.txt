Ah yes, good old DeLay. Aside from his recent difficulties, his persona absolutely fits his former occupation- exterminator. That must be a bad rug that he has. About as likeable a personality as a cobra. Should've recorded a rap album as Ratkilla.. at least as bad as fellow Texan boor, the ludicrously named Dick Armey...
