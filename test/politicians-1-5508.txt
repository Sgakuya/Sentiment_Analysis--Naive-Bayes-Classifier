frankenstein never takes a stand on something. he'll say he is for something in front of a group of people in michigan and then the exact opposite in north carolina. he is a straight up liar. He even played us on his famous rally where he threw his vietnam medals at the white house, if he did that in the 60's then why does he have his medals hanging in his office? hmm weird. i hope he gets the democratic nomination so bush can spank him in the election.
