The Hitler of the 21st Century. A miserable tyrant who kills hundreds of people every day. Has used chemical weapons on several occasions, including against kurds and during the Gulf War. Fired ballistic missiles into Isreal. Desires nuclear weapons, probably in the middle of researching. Tons of anthrax missing. Countless other weapons and chemicals missing. The list goes on and on. Its time to strike this terrorist once and for all.
