Gephardt is a sad excuse for a leader. He is concerned only with his personal aggrandizement and his pipedream of one day being the Speaker of the House. Why else would an apparently sensible man, albeit a stinking liberal, actually pretend, with a straight face, to believe Al Gore has a legitimate claim to the presidency? Any dolt can see that Al Gore is trying to steal the election. There are no valid claims for him to pursue this farce he has dragged the nation through for over a month now...yet there is the slavering Gephardt, pumping Gore, selling the lie as visions of the Speakership dance in his fevered mind. Wash yourself Gephardt, grow a conscience, think of America before yourself, and find some integrity. You are a sham and a fraud.
