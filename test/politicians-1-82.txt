Just another social maggot on the public dole taking up space while her country has fallen to third world status since the end of WWII. The English are a pinheaded people to continue to endure the vagaries, excesses and wastefulness of a monarchy that does little more than eat well, drink well, dress well, live in sumptuous residences and go on costly vacations, all at taxpayer expense. Just what practical good use do these freeloaders provide to the English people? Supply the crappy London tabloids with gossip items that have been become as exciting as a paper cup? Even the shock value of such trivial inconsequential crap has worn off over the years. To maintain an enduring tradition? What good is a tradition of classism, exclusion, idleness, drunkeness, conspicuous consumption and marital infidelity? What great values to enfranchise out of the public pocket!!! I say, retire the English monarchy already, as the figurehead serves absolutely no useful purpose, and sell off the considerable assets of these mentally retarded and excessively inbred krauts to the highest bidders. God Save The Queen. She Ain't No Human Being!!!
