What a waste! For all of his good work with the poor, I can't understand why this idiot got us into Vietnam all the while knowing we couldn't win there. He has admitted as much on his tapes. I'll never understand this man, or his administration. If he wasn't going to let us win, he should never had put our military in there. His actions border on treason. He harmed the nation in ways that are still having effects today.
