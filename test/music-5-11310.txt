I think o-towns album is awesome, considering what little time they had to do it, and the fact that they weren't brought together to make a cd. They were brought together for a tv show. Their cd just shows how dedicated these guys are... plus their songs are pretty rockin'. I luv these guys and their cd... and i can't wait for their next one. '* O-town 4-ever and Alwayz*'
