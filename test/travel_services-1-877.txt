They misinformed their movers--told them there was 1 instead of 5 containerss to fill, told them they would be moving art and antiques instead of refridgerators, and an entire household worth of goods. THEN I told them we had furniture on the second floor that needsed to be taken out through a 2nd story window, told them they really needed to come out and look, but NO thye knew better. Turns out they didn't and left us hanging for THREE Days which put us in hot water with everyone and thme in hot water with us. DON'T USE MOVING STAFFERS, THEY ARE UNDEPENDABLE AND UNPORPFESSIONAL.
