Nancy Pelosi, minority leader? It reminds me of my reaction to Madeleine Albright being appointed Secretary of State. Which party put these weak, shrill women, masquerading as leaders, into such important positions? UPDATE: Not to imply that there are no capable women. To the contrary, there are so many strong, thoughtful, articulate women, in both parties. How do these shrill whiners get appointed to such vital, prestigious positions? They only bring embarrassment to their party and the country. What do Europeans think when this bitty calls the president incompetent? What do the terrorists think? Would you see it as OK if Kay Baily Hutchinson had said the same about Clinton while he was still in office?
