I think farmer Jack has gone very very downhill in the past year. I have 3 Farmer jacks near my house and will not shop at any of them. One store has no employes, (I have talked to some, this is not because do not want to work. but because farmer jack is to cheap to give employees hours) The store shelves are always bare, there is 1 cashier all day long, and store is filthy. Another store near me I have never once been into without getting overcharged for something and haveing to go back for a price change, and waste my time waiting at the service desk, only to find very rude employees. And the 3rd store near me, I would barley say is mediocer. It is always dirty, and has few employes, and is always out of sale items. I no longer spend any money at farmer Jack. I would much rather go to any other grocery store. I hope they will do more store closeings, and eventually will shut down.
