The Driver series has always been inferior to the brilliant racing games made by Nintendo (Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Kirby Air Ride, Ridge Racer 64, etc.) and other companies. Bad framerates have always plagued the series, and this game is no exception. The concept is also not exactly nice, as you are supposed to engage in illegal acts and destroy property. Not as bad as the offensive GTA series, but bad nonetheless. Also, lacking any lovable franchise characters, this game just isn't that good!
