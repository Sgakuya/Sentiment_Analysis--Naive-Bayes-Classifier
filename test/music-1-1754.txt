People only like this album because RADIOHEAD is on the front. If I put this out no one would buy it and no radio station would play anything on it. I LOVE Radiohead, but this album has nothing to offer. I think since they were so original and creative with OK COMPUTER they wanted people to think the same of this album. The only thing original and amazing about it is that is sucks when all their other albums were amazing.
