This game was very unentertaining and lacked skill. A very dissappointing game. The worst thing about the game was the cardboard cut-out background for the audience in the stands. The poor black brother could never win a match, and the foupaux catch phrase, Let's get ready to rumble, just got annoying after a few rounds. Moreover, opponents could just stall and punch after minutes of running around the ring. Thumbs down.
