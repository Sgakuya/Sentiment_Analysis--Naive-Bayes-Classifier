I have travelled around the country to see Clay in concert 20 times in the past 2 years. Prior to that I had only seen 2 concerts of any other artist in the past 20 years. So maybe I'm not the best judge... but I still bet Ive single-handedly financed at least one pair of his Steve Maddens. Perhaps youll see them the next time he comes to your town.
