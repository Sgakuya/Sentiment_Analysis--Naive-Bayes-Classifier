Jesse Jackson has proven with his words and actions what I have known all along-he is morally corrupt. How the Baptist church can allow him to remain a minister is beyond my scope of understanding. No wonder Clinton called on him for help during the Lewinsky event. Jackson was cheating even then, and Clinton thought he could help him cover it up!
