This place sucks all around, plain and simple. The food is atrocious and the employees are rude. If you cannot find another fast food establishment within a fifty mile radius and must stop here, make sure to thoroughly examine your order before leaving the premises. There is a 50/50 chance that one of the imbeciles inside fu**ed up your order
