I DO NOT WANT A REFORMED ADDICT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. I AM AN INDEPENDENT VOTER AND HAD DECIDED TO VOTE FOR BUSH BECUASE OF HIS INTEGRITY - I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO MY 10 YEAR OLD CHILD 2 JUST A YEAR OR TWO AGO THAT WHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID WAS WRONG AND THAT WE CANNOT DO THOSE KIND OF THINGS - I WAS SOLD ON BUSH AND HIS INTEGRITY AND SHARED ENTHUSIASM WITH MY CHILD AND NOW I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT WHAT BUSH DID WAS ALSO WRONG AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT DO THAT EITHER - CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW CONFUSING THIS HAS TO BE FOR A CHILD HIS AGE - I AM REALLY ANGRY AT THIS REVELATION ABOUT BUSH AND WILL CHANGE MY VOTE TO GORE - I DID NOT AGREE WITH ALL HIS ISSUES BUT AT LEAST THE MAN DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE - WHAT ELSE IS GEORGE W. HIDING - THAT SCARES ME, AND I DO NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER FIASCO LIKE WE HAVE IN THE PAST - I AM A MEMBER OF MADD AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE MOTHERS ARE EXTREMELY UPSET AND ANGRY WITH BUSH'S CONDUCT AND LYING - THEY MAY SAY HE DIDNT LIE - BUT IT WAS THE SAME DIFFERENCE TO ME. I THINK THE W. IN GEORGE W. BUSH NOW STANDS FOR WILD - WHAT A DISGUSTING SITUATION HE HAS CREATED!!!!!
