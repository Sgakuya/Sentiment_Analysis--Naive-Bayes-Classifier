Really nothing but an album all about man hating. Alanis was pissed at someone of the male gender and proved it to the extreme with this album. If it wasn't so filled with man hating, I might actually have liked it. But I think men are pretty awesome and could never imagine hating them to such an extreme. Men rock !
