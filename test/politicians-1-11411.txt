Why Massachusetts spawns some of the politicians it does, I'm not sure. This guy is pompous, arrogant,and in many respects a hypocrite. He has traded on his family name to get in power and stay in power. His liberalism in some areas I can accept, but his positions on several issues are totally inconsistent with what his faith is avowed to be, which is why I characterize him as a hypocrite. Also, the passage of time does not erase his disgraceful behavior at Chappaquiddick.
