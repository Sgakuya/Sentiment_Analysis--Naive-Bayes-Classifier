WARNING : Don't read if your a Bird fan, and just wish to stick your head in the sand (ignoring THE TRUTH.) Yes, he could shoot- he shot well; but other than that he was a sorry excuse for a basketball player- not top 10 worthy at ALL!! He deserves at most a 3 stars (Top spot- what are you people on!!- Oh, No M.J., Wilt, Barkley, Dr. J., Magic-huh!!) I do remember all the times, he would do a Karl Malone cheat push or grab out there when he was out of position badly. He NEVER had a good thing to say about other players; and about opponents, he was a bad sport. I don't want to rip him in ALL areas (who knows what else he was concerned with in life), but as a coach it seemed like he was half-hearted, quitting easily (4 years, hey- I'm done, that's it Pacers.) .....
