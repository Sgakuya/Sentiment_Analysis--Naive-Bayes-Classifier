I don't think Saks is particularly racist of judges by appearence. I think they are rude to EVERYONE. I have been in there on two occasions. Both times dressed very nice. I am blonde and skinny also. But no one would even look at me. When I asked for help, all I got was a rude respose. The only reason I am interested in going there is becuse they carry a line of wedding dresses I am interested in that no one else in Ohio carries. But I am not sure if I am willing to spend that much money in a place that is rude.
