I live in Missouri and John Ashcroft has left this state in a mess. Even though we had federal laws banning segration, he stalled this state with endless law suits to stop it. He did his dead level best to prevent Missouri women their right to choice, even getting all state aid cut to help women of lesser means. He has personaly and publicly defamed one of esteem jurist, Judge Ronnie White, on the floor of the senate, he could have done this in committee privately. You ask him why? Why was he a friend of Bob Jones University? They support his racist views. I am Christian too and I am ashamed of this man. He will not speak for me or represent my ideals. He is a extremist and fanatic. My earnest prayer is he never becomes our attorney general. He is unfit and extremely dangerous man. Check his record, I have and it is dismal.
