Actually, if you look into the matter you'd find that Abercrombie and Fitch has indeed sued (successfully) American Eagle for copyright infringement on multiple occasions, but this actually occurs quite often in the fashion industry. The fact of the matter is, the ripoff American Eagle makes a business off of is undeniable. Season after season, the trends Abercrombie displays it its stores are mirrored closely by American Eagle. When Abercrombie began labeling hats and shirts with their AF logo, American Eagle quickly changed all their logos to a similar AE. When Abercrombie originated the vintage, worn look that made their clothes so popular, American Eagle quickly overwashed their new lines to appear distressed as well. The examples of this ripoff are unending, all you have to do is walk into one store after the other to notice some for yourself. And as if it's not bad enough that they attempt to make a business off of ripoffs, they don't even begin to achieve the quality of product Abercrombie does, and this appears to be why the prices vary in certain areas. As for the customer service of Abercrombie brand reps, I appreciate the allowed independance you find when shopping the store, instead of the geeky, clingy, question filled employees you find at Structure and American Eagle. American Eagle also disgraces both of its namesakes with its ripoff Abercrombie imitations. It should close its doors or find some originality, I will never shop there and urge others to do the same.
