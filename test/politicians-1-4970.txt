Algore- A politician that makes Dan Quayle look like a Mensa candidate. Here are just a few memorable quips (courtesy of Algorisms): What a waste it is to lose one's mind. Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is. -- Vice President Al Gore I stand by all the misstatements that I've made. -- Vice President Al Gore to Sam Donaldsson, 8/17/93 We're going to have the best-educated American people in the world. -- Vice President Al Gore, 9/21/97 The future will be better tomorrow. -- Vice President Al Gore [It's] time for the human race to enter the solar system. -- Vice President Al Gore I was recently on a tour of Latin America, and the only regret I have was that I didn't study Latin harder in school so I could converse with those people. -- Vice President Al Gore The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. I mean in this century's history. But we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century. -- Vice President Al Gore, 9/15/95 We are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur. -- Vice President Al Gore, 9/22/97
