AA lost my child. She is 11 years old and flew with an AA escort. They lost her, did not put her on a flight 4 times, and then they said sorry, the agents didn't do their job. She was required to stay alone, with a stranger (escort) overnight in the Dallas Ft. Worth Airport. Her ordeal took her 20 hours to get from Ontario, CA to Ft. Smith, AK. She is traumatized. I strongly urge parents to NOT LET THEIR KIDS FLY ALONE ON AMERICAN AIRLINES!
