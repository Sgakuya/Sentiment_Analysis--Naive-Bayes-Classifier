Taco Bell is pretty disgusting, or at least anything containing chicken. I know you don't really believe in rumors, but haven't you heard about the lady and her mouth full of roach eggs? Gross! Whatever you order, always order the beef. Chicken is gross. But the chalupa commercial (and that dog) is pretty funny.
