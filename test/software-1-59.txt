Don't buy ALURIA spyware. Customer service is non-existent. THey give a 90 day money back guarantee, but they make sure they don't reply until AFTER the 90 days are over. Installing the software causes a lot of problems with the PC. IF you try to uninstall it, it leaves remnants and you still have issues.
