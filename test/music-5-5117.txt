A great new sound for country music lovers. Some new competition for The Dixie Chicks and Brooks and Dunn! ''Lonely Grill is a great cd. Also have purchased and love Lonestar's ''This Christmas Time'' cd and find it has refreshing new takes on some standards and some new Christmas songs that I hadn't heard that are special. Saw Lonestar in concert at JMU. I'm ready for the next cd by them please!
