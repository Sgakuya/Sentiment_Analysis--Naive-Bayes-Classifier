Logic dictates that one of two things about Arafat must be true. Either (1) He is lying when he says he wants peace with Israel, and is controlling or aiding the murdering Palestinian thugs or (2) He really does want peace, but has no ability to control the Palestinian thugs as they blow up buses and crowded markets. EITHER WAY, he has made himself irrelevant. There is no point for Israel or the US to negotiate anything with him.
