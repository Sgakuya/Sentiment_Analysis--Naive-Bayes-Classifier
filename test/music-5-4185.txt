Pink floyd is one of all time greatest bands ..they were leaders in their era..people who enjoyed their old albums with roger waters on..they sure will like this one..though some of us still miss Roger back nevertheless Gilmour is doing great with the rest of the guys anyone who do not enjoy Pink Floyd surley have brain damage.
