I can't believe this team gets a higher rating than the Yanks. Prolly cuz the Boston fans just live to hate them, and even without knowing anything about the team, they just simply bring down the ratings, just because they're the Yanks. I mean how can a team who hasn't won the series since the end of WORLD WAR 1 (or something like that) be rated higher than NYY? For crying out loud, they've done it 26 times and counting! And the Sox still get a higher rating? Unbelievable. As for this team, offense is great, but mediocre otherwise. NYY should still be in front of these guys in the ratings though.
