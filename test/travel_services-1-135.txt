I fly to Europe about once a year. My worst European flight EVER was a non-stop from Los Angeles to London on Virgin Atlantic. The people are packed in like sardines. If your idea of a terrific transatlantic flight is sitting for 10 hours in a seat with the person in front of you 2 from your lap (no exaggeration when their seat is pushed back) and tons of hand held video games then Virgin Atlantic is the airline for you.
