This place is nothing but a HUGE copy cat of the Long John's Silver Seafood Shoppe. Captain D's will never be as good as Long John's no matter how much they try. Another negative aspect of this place is that all of their food is extremely overpriced for what it is and you get smaller portions. It rarely tastes good. I never eat here anymore. I would rather drive out of my way to go to Long John's...
