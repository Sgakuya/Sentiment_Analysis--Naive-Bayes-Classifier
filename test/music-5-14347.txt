OUTSTANDING! Takes you right back to the movie no matter where you are. You can see Legolas running on the top of a lush green mountain, your heart breaks all over again when Boromir dies, you can feel Gollum's inner struggle, and you can feel the ground pounding at the approach of the Riders of Rohan. Howard Shore (NOT ENYA!!) does an excellent job! I can't wait to hear what he's created for the Return of the King.
