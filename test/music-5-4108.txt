I love this CD! Its full of so much memory and feeling! I could never be swayed into beliving otherwise! This album is so awesome!!!! The weird thing is, it sort of chronicles Bruce's first marraige (to Julieanne Phillips) from the falling in love, to the wedding, to the demise of the marraige. Powerful stuff!!!!!
