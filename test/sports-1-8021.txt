This guy isn't anything but a punk who wants a reputation as a bad-ass. His playing ability is ok, but no way is he on the same level with Jordan, Bird, Jabbar, West, etc. I suspect within the next three years someone will take this wannabe out in a drive-by, or he'll wind up in jail for a very long time, because he can't control himself.
