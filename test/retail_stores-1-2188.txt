I will never buy anything from this store again because their customer service and store policy sucks. They don't care about their customer and they act like you are a crook and a liar. I return a DVD because there was a problem with the language audio so they would spend all their time to test out the DVD to make sure I'm not lying. They refuse to refund my money and make me sign a bunch of paperwork just to give me the same product. They also opened up the package to inspect it before giving it to me. And when I leave the place, the guy standing out there checks my receipt and stares at my one item in my hand for a lengthy period of time like I have something to hide. I would definitely not recommend this store to anyone.
