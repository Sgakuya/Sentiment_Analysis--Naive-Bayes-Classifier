Bill Owens is a very bad governor, Romer wasn't the best but much better than Owens. Owens cut taxes to impress the people, but now Colorado has been having massive, massive cutbacks because the state cannot raise taxes without a vote of the people. Owens wants to abolish the Colorado Higher Education system. Owens also caters to Denver and the heck with Colorado Springs and the rest of Colorado.
