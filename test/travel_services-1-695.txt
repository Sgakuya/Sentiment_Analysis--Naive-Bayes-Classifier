I rented a car from National on 1/11/06 at Dulles airport (Wash, DC area). Originally, I had planned to stay for 4 days (including a Sat stay over). The rate I was given was $33.99. However, I had to leave that Friday (after a 2 day stay). To my utter dismay the per day rate increased to $99.99! The normal, non-discounted, non-Saturday stay over, is $53.95. This company is a TOTAL RIPOFF! Do not do business with these crooks! Buyer beware!
