purchased an engagement ring and matching band---never has been correctly reset from the first time I had the ring sized and the center stone was reset in a safer mount not by choice. Later noticed a feather in the stone that I know was not there when purchased. Now having had the matching bridal band sized for a third time have also noticed carbon spots of which again were not there at original purchase. I know that you always hear the stories and are told never to leave your rings overnight...I had not choice and did trust that the same items would be returned and now think differently. I also have a few ladies mentioning a certain employee who was caught switching a center stone and I would like to know if this is true??? Have any of you had similar experiences. Also---I have had my ring rodium and re-rodiumed more than just a few times...can't say the quality of merchandise is at all satifying thus far and realloy have tried hard to warn others as they choose a ring of a lifetime as well. Upset by the whole experience and that's a shame.
