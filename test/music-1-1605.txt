Pop angst. Urrggh. Really if your down listen to Nine Inch Nails or Joy Division or Morrisey or anyone who sounds like they actually care. It's all just recycled cliche and adding pseudo 'classical' touches don't help. Muse did this the right way, with electric Bachisms and genuine soul. Really. Listen to Muse.
