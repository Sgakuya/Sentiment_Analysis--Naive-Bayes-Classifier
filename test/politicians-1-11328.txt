Can anyone really take New York senators seriously? Bobby Kennedy ran over there from Massachusetts and got elected handily. Hillary Clinton from Arkansas did the same. As long as they're at least two steps to the left of Joseph Stalin, New Yorkers will vote for them. Chuckie wants to take our guns away so we can't defend ourselves. He loves high taxes and is absolutely obsessed with flushing fetuses down sinks. What a great guy.
