I wish I had accessed this site before I took a ring, that was very special to me, to be sized at the Helzburg on the east side of Indianapolis. Less than a month later one of the seven diamonds fell out and was lost. When I took it back I was treated like I was a fool to think that the sizing could have anything to do with it!Needless to say, I took it to another place to have it fixed, he also at the same time had to replace four more of the prongs. Not only has Helzburg lost my service but that of my friend that gave me the ring.We both used to shop there often but will not do so again! Carrie Harris
