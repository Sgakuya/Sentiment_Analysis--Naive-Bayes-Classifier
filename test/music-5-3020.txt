Don't tell me the Beatles don't have soul. If they don't have soul, I don't know who does. Certainly not who you listen to, Jackie72. And Lou, do you think some garage Band could play the guitar like George Harrison? No way. I especially love his solo in the middle of Can't Buy Me Love. I absolutley love I'm Happy Just to Dance With You. That one's a classic. The Beatles music will always live. I'll pass it on to my kids, they'll do the same to theirs, and so on. A Hard Day's Night is a great movie and album, anyone who gave it less than 5 stars needs to think again.
