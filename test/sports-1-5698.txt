oh ya sean may is just the slowest player besides Yao ming in the nba and hes only 6'8, Lebron James is that size and will own him, he has no ability to play in the NBA, he will not score and he doesnt posses any shooting ability to go beyond the key. He cant play defense either, so i think he mite play bench forward. HE Sucks!!!
