Isn't it ironic that George W. campaigned saying that he trusts the people and now that Gore called for a hand recount in Florida, the Bush campaign sought a Federal injunction on the grounds that the process is flawed because the ballots will be counted by people and not machines. So, WHO trusts the people now, Gore or Bush? If Bush wins, we are in for 4 years of gross hypocrisy and stupidity.
