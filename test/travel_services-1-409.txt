PLEASE! Their planes do not need aircons because the crew is so COLD! Not to mention old! Maybe that's the problem. They've spent so much time away fr. their kids that they failed to hone their parental instincts. They ask a passenger, beef or chicken in a brisk way and when asked to repeat, they become tight-lipped and repeat in an impatient voice. When a passenger asks for something, they don't go out of their way to give an extra smile or words of concern. Northwest should stop spending money on advertisements. Instead, it should funnel that budget onto customer service trainings.
