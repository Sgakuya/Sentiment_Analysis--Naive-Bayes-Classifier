Sinead is so much more than a singer! She is a poet, an activist, a warrior, and a true musical artist. Her voice is perfect, her harmonys are fresh and powerful, and her range is a gift from God. Her music inspires and comforts me and I would recommend it to anybody that is seeking music that has the power to make you think and feel, and not just dance ( It's gettin' hot in Heeere... ). I think it's sad that she got such a bad rap due to her demonstration against the hypocrisy of the pope on SNL. She is one of the top 5 female singers in the world and should get more credit, IMHO.
