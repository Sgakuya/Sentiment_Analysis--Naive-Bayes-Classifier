Jesse Jackson is not an elected official. He is nothing but an opportunist. Jesse Jackson is a publicity whore. He is not trying to bring the country together, he wants to tear it apart. I would like Mr. Jackson to explain to me how minorities were disenfranchised in the election, when their voter turn-out increased 65% over 1996??? George W. Bush is now the President-elect. We, as Americans should respect the sanctity of the office and lend our support to the new President, no matter what our political affiliation. Why is no one reporting that George W. Bush carried 51 of the 67 counties in Florida? And why is no one reporting that 7 out of 9 Supreme Court justices ruled that the re-count was unconstitutional? Mr. Jackson, I suggest that you read your Bible. The Bible is grounded on one fact, love. I don't see that Mr. Jackson is loving his neighbor, republicans and supporters of the new President.
