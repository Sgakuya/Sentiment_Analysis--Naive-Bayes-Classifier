It's quite simple: You cannot be a music fan and not own this album. It is messy, unfocused, and goes into a variety of styles, and these are the reasons it works so well. No other record in the history of pop music covers so much ground: Pop (Ob-La-Di-Ob-La-Da), blues (Yer Blues, I'm So Tired), surf music (Back in the USSR), country (Don't Pass Me By), folk (Rocky Raccoon), lullaby (Good Night), heavy metal (Helter Skelter) and avant garde (Revolution 9). I can listen to it again...and again....and again...and will, tonight. Just writing and thinking about it gets me excited.
