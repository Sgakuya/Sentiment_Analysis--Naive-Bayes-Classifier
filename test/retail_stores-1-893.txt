here's a store that is suppose to be for the larger women. but, now they have turned into the larger teen and twenty store. by doing this they are alienating the over 30 shopper who could care less about stripes up the sides of there pants and patches on jackets. they will need to make a seperate department in there store for this business of the teens and twenties and re-enter the over 30 fashions back into there stores.
