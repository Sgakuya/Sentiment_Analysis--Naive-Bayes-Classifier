The Bengals have become the poster children for a poorly run franchise. Mike Brown, the owner, has put his children in charge of a lot of the day to day activities of the team, including football-related decisions. Notwithstanding the new stadium and a supposed rejuvenated committment to treating players well, the Bengals are notoriously cheap, confrontational in negotiations with their star players (which makes you think about how bad they must treat the other players), and football's laughingstock. Realizing how much of joke they are, the team has tried to put clauses in new contracts which would force players to pay back part of their signing bonus if they badmouthed the team. Unbelievable.
