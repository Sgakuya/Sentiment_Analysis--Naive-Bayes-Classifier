I think he sounds like a little sissy girl. He needs to be singing on a boys chior and not on country radio. He better rack up all the money he can now because hopefully when his voice changes he want sound like a girl anymore and I wont have to hear that annoying song anymore. They should rename the song to One Wimpy Voice . I am so tired of hearing this crap.
