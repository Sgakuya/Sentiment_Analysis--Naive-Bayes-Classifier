Beautiful. Exceptional writing and producing. Perhaps the lyrics are a bit saccharine but so what. This kid's got a rare gift and his child's voice complements the piece perfectly (oughta... seeing it was written for him.) And the turn with violins to the A7 chord (it comes on a million words). If that doesn't move you, get a hearing aid or call the undertaker - you're either deaf or dead. A great song.
