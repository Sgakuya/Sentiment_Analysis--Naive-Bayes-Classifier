I've wanted to speak out about Jackson for some time, but with so many important issues, his recent presence was more a fly in the ointment. Although I do not discredit some of his accomplishments (and have applauded them), there's been a gut-feeling that something's not been quite right about where he's placed his recent banners (banters). I wanted to tell him he's been discrediting the title of Reverend, dividing people, not leading them to union. I don't have to bother now: a house divided is a house that cannot stand tall. Those who live in glass houses, cannot throw stones, is so relevant, and more than ever, reverent. Time for the old stone to stop rolling and gather some moss.
