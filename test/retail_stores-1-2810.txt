Ross Simons has the absolute worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with. My wife and I had our wedding reigstry there. We receive dozens of items from them, and they all were poorly packed using low quality boxes, and many items arrived damaged. They are in the process of discontinuing their registry, so many items on our registry have become unavailable -- even though they promised when we set up our registry they would be able to service it. To top it all off, their customer service representatives lie! One couple bought a gift off our registry, it wasn't in stock, so RS sent me a card indicating it was backordered. When the item came in and was shipped, RS shipped it to the couple (not me). When they called to complain, they were told RS didn't have my address -- yet the item was bought off our registry and RS was able to send the backorder notice. What bull! Based on my experience, I wouldn't be surprised if their whole business model is a scam! Don't deal with these people.
