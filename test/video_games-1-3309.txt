I thought I could get into this game when it came out. I tried to for about 2 days. After 48 hours of being bored out of my mind with this slow and dull little game I decided to go to bed and go outside and get a job and rejoin the living. I have since not returned to my playstation. I now live a life void of video game meaninglessness. I know live a life with friends,women and fun. THANK YOU FINAL FANTASY VII!!! This game blows.
