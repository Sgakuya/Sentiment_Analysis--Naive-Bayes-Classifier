The WORST airport I have ever had the misfortune to travel through. Some advice if you are flying into this airport-do not check your luggage. I have never flown into Philly and had to wait less than one hour (no, I am not exaggerating) for my luggage no matter what time of day or day of the week. Also annoying was the time my flight was diverted from the original gate and terminal but my luggage still went to the original terminal's baggage claim-with no direction from the airline or airport about where the luggage went. A fellow passenger finally figured it out. The parking there is a nightmare, too. There are lots of things to love about Philly, but the airport sure isn't one of 'em.
