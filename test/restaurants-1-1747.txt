I do not eat at fast food places anymore because I do not enjoy the taste of all the grease they use to cook their food. I once bit into a hard-shell taco and so of the orangish colored grease started dripping down my chin. Just image that was your chin. The food taste microwaved cooked and cheap(well it is). I do not want all my fat intake to go into my food by eating two tacos for the place. Their cinnamon twist are fabulous and are the best thing they offer. Plus all the Taco Bell bathrooms I have visited are always under-washed and smell like old disinfectent.
