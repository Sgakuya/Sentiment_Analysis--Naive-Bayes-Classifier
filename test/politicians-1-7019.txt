Why was this nitwit parading around in Florida telling us that black voters were denied the right to vote in the presidential election? No one has ever produced a single person that can certify he/she was not allowed to vote if they wanted to. Where is the proof? If you take the time to look at the facts, the Liberal argument falls apart every time, especially one coming from the likes of a professional shakedown artist like Jesse Jackson. While he was ministering to Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal apparently he was also ministering to a young Rainbow/PUSH activist. Would you want to donate money to an organization that sends $10,000 payments every month to Jesse Jackson's girlfriend who lives in a lavish house in California? Only fools would send money to the Rainbow/PUSH coalition!
