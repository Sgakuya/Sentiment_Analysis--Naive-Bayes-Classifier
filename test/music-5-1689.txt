may be it's a little too poppy sound for Garbage but it's not just pop ... it's a classical pop + may be some pop/rock/alternative/electronica. Songs like Nobody Loves You , Cup of Coffee and So Like a Rose just melt me... Of course there are some songs that sound like the old material( Shut Your Mouth and Silence is Golden ) and they are still great.
