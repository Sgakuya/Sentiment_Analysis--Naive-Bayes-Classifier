A fun and bright album. 'Just A Dream' is one of my favorite songs off the record. 'Mind Your Head' is about not letting fame get you too cocky. There are ten songs on the album, which makes it a bit short, and the last two tracks are remixes of 'Dance With Me' and 'In My Heart', which means you get two songs essentially twice and that makes the record even shorter. But the remixes ARE solid, so if you like teen pop and/or previous Jump5 releases, this should serve you quite well. Plus the disc's color is a bright, appealing lime green.
