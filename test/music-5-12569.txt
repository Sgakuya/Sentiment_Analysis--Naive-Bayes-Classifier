The best of several excellent albums from the rap legend. The double disc is packed with trunk thumpers like California Lore and You Can't See Me, and preserved the continuity with slow tracks like Thug Passion and Picture Me Rollin'. Strong lyrics with phenomenal beats produced by Dr. Dre make it a must have. Another attraction is the several guest appearances by the biggest names in rap and hip-hop. These artists include Rappin' 4tay, Richie Rich, E-40, B-Legit, Mac D-Shot, Redman, Method Man, Dr. Dre, Kurupt, C-BO, and Suge Knight.
