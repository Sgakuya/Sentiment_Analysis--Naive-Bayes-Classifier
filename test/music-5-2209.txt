This is a superior blues album throughout! Muddy's playing and singing are top-notch, and the addition of Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield really kick this outing over the top. Butterfield's playing really topped out on this effort (check out the intensity of his solo on 40 Days & 40 Nights) and Bloomfield is fantastic as usual (check out Can't lose What You Never Had). The live numbers are all incredible too. Very highly recommend this one!
