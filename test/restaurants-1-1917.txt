Imagine a hamburger patty, scortched, then wrapped up, and placed on a hot table so it can be steamed, ensuring that the virtually tasteless patty, pickle, mustard, and ketchup turns into glop, with gummy bread. Cap this off with incompetent help to make certain nothing is served promptly. If this sounds appetizing, you deserve BK. Otherwise, the place sucks, and is easily the worst of the chains.
