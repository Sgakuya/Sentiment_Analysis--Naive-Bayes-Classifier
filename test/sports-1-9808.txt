There have been a few times in years past when I pulled for the Lakers. But I was astonished at how the championship was stolen for them by the referees during their series against Sacramento in 2002. I also have no use for the vile and unsportsmanlike behavior of Rick Fox. The one saving grace is Kobe Bryant - as much as I despise the Lakers, I have to grudgingly admit that he's an incredibly good player. I wish that he weren't that good, if he's going to play for the Lakers. The rest of them aren't even fun to watch. It was a glorious night recently when San Antonio finally disposed of them in the playoffs.
