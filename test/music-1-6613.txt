I am so disapointed with this album. It has the most juvenile lyrics I have ever heard. Kinda sad to hear guys in their 40's going back to Too Fast For Love lyrics. A real regression,instead of progression. If you graduated from high school or beyond, this albumis beneath you and I used to be a diehard Crue fan, but Vince Neil's voice is in terribel shape. A real joke,this album.
