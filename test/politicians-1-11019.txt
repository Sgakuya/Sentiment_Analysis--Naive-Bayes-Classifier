He's also white, but uses his blackness for political advantage. As far as people thinking he's handsome, he looks like a monkey! No racisim was intended in that statement. I think it must be the big ears! Well anyway, I think he's overhyped. And as far as him being president, which most libs are saying that he'll become someday, I just don't see it. Blacks have a lot of growing up to do before there will ever be a black president. First of all they ouoght to quite whinning and start being self sufficiant, and stop shooting down blacks who try to better themselves by rejecting their victimhood. By the way he gets a 1, but he's really a 0.
