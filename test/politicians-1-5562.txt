Very poor choice for Interior Secretary, and she's shown it in her so-called performance. No vision here, no creative thinking, no long-term, well-considered planning in her department, just a concerted effort to make it easier for the corporations to exploit our natural resources for their exclusive benefit and to use our environment as a toilet bowl. That's what you get when you make a lobbyist and apologist for industry a supposed caretaker of public lands and the common good.
