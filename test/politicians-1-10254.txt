sorry jakemr but don't be so naive. what bush has done and is doing will not keep us safer at night but will actually put us in an even more perilous situation. i agree that rescuing the iraqi people from Saddam's control was a tremendous show of human rights and compassion, but at what cost? you seem to think that these actions taken by our president have somehow secured our freedom when in all actuality they have jeopardized the saftey of not only American's, but any person living in a free westernized country (not that we are necessarily correct in living this way), for that is why these terrorists hate us in the first place.
