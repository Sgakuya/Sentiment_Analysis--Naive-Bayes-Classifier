Since I have a working brain, I definitely voted for Busch. What can I say? I prefer a president that you can tell that he's not lieing with everything he says, and doesn't have the look of lieing all over his face. I'm not one of those people who live in dreamland who need a fake who also lives in dreamland running this country. I'm also a female, and I've heard that other females actually were DUMB and dingy enough to actually vote for Clinton and Gore in the past because they liked how they look! lol First of all, if some guys needed more confirmation that some females are dingheads, that would be a definite fact they could use! But then again, some females just don't have the IQ to understand that a competent president has nothing to do with how he looks. You would think that wouldn't need to have to be said, but then again, all you need to do is look around at todays society and how they drive, the ugly fads they wear, ETC to realize that some people just don't and can't get it! lol Also, to follow up with what I just said, not only was it completely dingy for some females to actually vote for Gore and Clinton on the basis of how they look, in what way are they even good looking????? Someone explain that one to me! lol Anyway, for those of you who did vote for Gore and Clinton for those reasons, you're part of what makes the U.S. a joke.
