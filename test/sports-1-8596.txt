First,I'd like to say I am not a big basketball fan,but in watching the NBA playoffs with my husband,this young man's demeanor,attitude and arrogance totally turned me off.I will not be purchasing any thing this young man endorses.Usually I will purchase things for my grandkids,as a surprise that they may see on TV.I personally will not spend my money,(and try my best to change their opinions)on this young man, until he learns some humility.He is not MJ,and never will be,MJ has and still has CLASS,that is something Kobe does not and it is a big turn-off
