2001 Rookie of the Year, absolutely ridiculous. Granted the Bears were 13-3, but it was not because of Thomas, more like Urlacher and the D. For those that never noticed, Thomas got most of his yards during garbage time , which means he was just trying to run out the clock and had no real part in actually winning the game for his team. Tomlinson had him beat on mostly every statistical category; rushing, receiving, touchdowns, etc. LaDainian didn't finish the season as strong, but its called rookie of the YEAR, not rookie of the last 4 games! Anyways, still pissed about that, but it is in the past. Honestly, who is the better running back??? I'm sure there's no question about that now.
