This is the best CD I've ever heard. Usually when I buy a CD, it stays my favorite for about a week, and then it goes in with the rest of my collection. I've had this CD since the day it was released (June 15, 1999), and it's still my favorite! DIVE IN at http://www.angelfire.com/ms/stevencurtischapman
