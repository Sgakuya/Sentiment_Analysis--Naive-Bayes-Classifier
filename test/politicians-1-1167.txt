I remember when I was a kid this guy was considered a terrorist. When ever a plane was hi-jacked they talked to Arafat. With his Italian restraunt head gear and dark sun glasses. Now he is a politician. I don't think so! Update: He is dead now and the peace process has moved further along since he has gone vs. the time he was on the planet.
