It always surprises me that people will claim anything is better than IE. This browser neither accepts RoboForm nor the Google ToolBar and some websites don't like it. It requires that I maintain two or three browsers in order to deal with different functions and different websites. Why be bothered if one will do it? Babysitting insecurities in one browser is certainly easier than keeping track of what might go wrong with two or three or four.
