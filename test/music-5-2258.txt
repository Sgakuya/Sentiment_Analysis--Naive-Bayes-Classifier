This is a must-have for any blues nut. We're watching all the greats die around us (how many are truly left) and it's great to see some new young blood. Unfortunately, he's 2nd album doesn't have nearly the same tone and feeling, and if you love this album, you'll hate his 2nd one. Track him down on Double Trouble's new CD. If you don't know who they are, you don't know blues.
