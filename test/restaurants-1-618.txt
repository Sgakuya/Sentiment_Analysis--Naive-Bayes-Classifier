They finally got rid of these tiny, sticky, overpriced, donuts at my supermarket. They went back to baking donuts fresh in their own bakery. The store brand are bigger, tastier, fresher donuts and they price them lower. I've had Krispy Kreme's fresh out of fryer and they are ok, certainly nothing special, but they don't travel well and, at grocery stores...well thank goodness they finally got rid of them around here
