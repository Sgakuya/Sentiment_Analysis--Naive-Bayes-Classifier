Best CD in the grunge scene! Eddie Vedder at his best. The songs are well produced and thought provoking. The epitame of the early 90's rock scene. Jermey won video of the year in the 1992 MTV Music Awards, which shows how one good song turned into many great songs. It is great to listen to while making love. You can also listen to it while studying for mid-terms.
