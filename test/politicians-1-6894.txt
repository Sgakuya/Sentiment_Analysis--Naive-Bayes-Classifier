Trent Lott and his committee shot down a bill that would have helped the Railway workers' retirement improvements the first time in 2 decades. This was a crass and petty act of politicking and he robbed the railway widows of an improved way of life. He reached for obsecure ways to defeat Bill H.R. 4844 and he held this bill and defeated it out of petty political gains. I will never vote Republican again. NEVER NEVER
