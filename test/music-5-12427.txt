Powerful revolutionary material from one of the first socially conscious hip-hop groups. This album was a well deserved pimp slap to the 'establishment'. Chuck D's rough and poignant lyrics would make you ponder, Terminator-X's aggressive, confident beats would make you rise up. Add to that, Flava Flav, who was the best hype man in the game. I remember the first time I heard this album, I felt like an uninvited guest at a Black Panther rally...Amazing stuff.
