Yuck! Who on earth would want to listen to Celine warbling on with that horrible singing voice of hers? I admit, I do have a friend who likes her, and when I found out she couldn't believe the look of disgust on my face. This woman just bursts her lungs out on the same old crap. I swear, I'll be out celebrating when (and if) she ever announces that her singing career is over.
