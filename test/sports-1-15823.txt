He is one of the worst people alive.....I hope to see him severely injured - not killed - just paralyzed and unable to move....with his only form of external communication being the ability to activate a red light and beeper with two beeps for yes and one for no ....like the original Captain of the Enterprise in the first episode of Star Trek ......it would be good to see him live a long, long time in this condition......
