Back in the days when Rappers didn't devote their albums to excessive profanity, gratuitous violence and sickening sexism. This is an album which has to be heard. With Rakim's ability to hit you with his on-the-ball lyrical dexterity and witty metaphoric word-play without even trying too hard, and with Eric B's wonderfully relaxed and smooth and wafer thin mixing of James Brown and 60's R'n'B samples, this is a must have.
