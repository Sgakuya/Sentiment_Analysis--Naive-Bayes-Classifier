This store is just for posers who think that shopping here and listening to trendy rap-metal and pop-punk makes them punk or goth, but really this store and its customers are just as preppy as A F and their customers. Also, the clothes here are, if anything, more overpriced and cheesy than the ones at A F, and the selection and size range is just as limited. I think Old Navy actually offers you the most bang for the buck and the biggest selection out of the mall stores, but apparently people think that shopping there makes you a prep while shopping at this overpriced, trendy store makes you different and rebellious.
