He's horrible helping acclimate rookies (sometimes doesnt even bother to learn their names). He sticks with ridiculous lineup orders too long. He frequently ignores statistical splits in pinch hit and lineup decisions. His bullpen management is a joke. He values grittiness over performance. He offers little leadership, as per his players who have stated he is a non-entity in the clubhouse. His influence over Tom Hicks, and subsequently John Hart, has led to personnel decisions which have unamimously backfired. And he was recently voted again, in an annual anonymous survey of players, the most disliked manager in baseball. He's never won a playoff series. And his talent laden team has a .500 record, another declining year. His teams' win-loss records have improved in only 2 of the 9 seasons he's managed.
