I do appreciate the fact that JCPenney has been around a long time, but all good things must come to an end eventually...and JCPenney is one of those stores that need to pack up and say goodbye. Boring, and the clothes are usually at least 3 seasons old by the time JCPenney puts them out...almost as bad as Old Navy....
