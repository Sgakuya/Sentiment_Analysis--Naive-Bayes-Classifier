No, the UNC fans will never give you a break, Dook. Take it from the neutral Arizona guy who almost started a war here by having the nut to laugh about an old tourney win by the Cats over the Tarheels. UPDATE: Tourney ain't over. Save mouth for later or prepare for mine if you go bye-bye. The Cats are still here to thump any wayward fools who beleive that they hold all the cards.
