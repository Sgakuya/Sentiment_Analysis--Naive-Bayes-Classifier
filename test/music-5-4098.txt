This is such a fun Springsteen album! 2 records of sheer excellence! From the irrisistable Hungry Heart and Two Hearts to the heartwrenching title track, The River is nothing short of fabulous! The first Springsteen album of the 80s, and an excellent entrance! Actually, during the concert for this album's tour, some lucky girl was so taken by Bruce's charm and newfound Serious heartthrobb looks, that she leaped onstage and kissed him! Lucky girl...! Bruce started not only producing yet another legacy of phenomenal music, but started his best heartthrobb looks too! I love Bruce now (and very very dearly!) but Bruce in the 80s was the BEST thing mankind has ever and will ever see!!! I love ya, Bruce!
