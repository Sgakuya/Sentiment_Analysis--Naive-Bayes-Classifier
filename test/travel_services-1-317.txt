We flew last Christmas on BA and while it was very cheap compared to Virgin, the service was horrible. We were delayed for literally hours without them saying anything. We were on the ground about 4 hours when they told us to get off the plane, find another gate and never gave any reason why. They lost my vegetarian meal request and insisted that I never asked for it (which I did). The bloke in front gave me his vegetarian meal to me because he felt bad (he said the only reason he asked for it was he didn't dare try BA meat). After that I have two words- Never Again.
