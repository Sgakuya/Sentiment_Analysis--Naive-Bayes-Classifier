I wish there was the option to give NO stars on this thing! When I was younger, my parents flew us on United so I didn't have a choice. Now, however, I will NEVER fly on them again! I had bad experiences every single time with them! They totally jerked my family around. On top of this, they're ALWAYS late, RUDE, and not careful with people's belongings. The food SUCKS, too! You definitely don't get what you pay for!
