I am embarassed and ashamed to be an American with Clinton as my president. He has gotten nothing done in the past eight years except a bunch of scandals and failed middle east peace agreements. He has destroyed just about everything that President Reagan built which makes me angry. He also leeches off of all Reagan's accomplishments and pretends they are his own (ie the economy). All of his suppoters-- Think about why you really like him, is it just because of the economy? Well he had nothing to do with it. His and his vice president's socialist values are so clear it is frightening. I am tired of how he has turned this nation into an international joke. Does anyone remember a time when we could respect, trust and be proud of our president? Well I do and I hope it will begin again in late January 2001.
