I am so agravated by the things that Al Gore and the Democrats are doing. How can he think that the recounts that he is having just 3 counties (democratic no less) do is fair. This is not fair to the rest of the United States. We all voted to! This makes everyone in the U.S. think that the democrats in Flordia are stupid, because apparantly they are the only ones who had a problem with the ballots. This is so dishonest everyone in America should know that people are biased. And if the people are not honest things will go according to how those people want it. And from what the American people hear about what is going on, there is nothing fair. And what is up with these stupid chads, until this year some Americans didn't know what a chad was let alone cared about them, and now we know about a whole sluegh of different chads. That are also being counted unfairly. So Al Gore may think that right now things are going the way he wants them to. But I know that there are many people praying that he is not put into office, so that we can have another four years of dishonesty and lies. I wish that Al Gore would just face on election night he wasn't ahead after the recounts and I pray to God that he will not be the next President! Michelle
