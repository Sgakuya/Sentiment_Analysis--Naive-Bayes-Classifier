I actually ordered this CD by mistake but figured 'What the hell, I'll give it a try'. And I was blown away. I think it's the first time I can honestly say that I, to a certain extent, enjoyed every single song. Robbie Williams has 2 songs on this album and they're both good (something I didn't expect), Gabrielle's Out of Reach and Geri Halliwell's It's Raining Men were no suprise but still good. It also contains the classics, Aretha Franklin's Respect, Chaka Khan's I'm Every Woman and Diana Ross Marvin Gaye's Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart). My faves however would have to be Love with Rosey, Pretender Got my Heart with Alisha's Attic and Kiss That Girl with Sheryl Crow. I really recommend this album. It might be considered a 'chick' album but afterall, it's from a 'chickflick'.
