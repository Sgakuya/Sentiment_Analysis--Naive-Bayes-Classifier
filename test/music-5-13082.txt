sisqo has got to be the most talented male singer/dancer/performer out there and hes so good at what he does. you can tell he puts his heart into what he does and you can just see through him what a great person he is and how much it took for him to get to where he is. hes one of those kinda of people that i would love to have in my life because his unique personality and good heart is so hard to resist (not to mention his nice body!!), i have never met him but i feel like i know him, i wish i could meet him!!! maybe some day i will. anyways, hes awesome and i know you all gotta agree with me!
