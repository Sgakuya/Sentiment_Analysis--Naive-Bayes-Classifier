Gee, nationwidemovers, the fact that you call yourself representing a company and come on here childishly calling people names is enough to let me know I would NEVER even consider your company. I too would like to know how you determined if someone has used your company by only knowing them by this sites username. You must have a pretty nifty crystal ball. I see you brought your friends and family along as raters. Pretty obvious what you thought you were doing.
