Way to choke! UPDATE: How well do you think the almighty Lakers will do when their over-hyped and overated star player has to play on the prison court, instead of NBA ones? Kobe still has no ring earned without Shaq's help to call his own, so he's not proven a damned thing to me. On second thought, I take that back. Trash-talking your own teammate when dissent only does a lot more harm then good proves to me that Kobe has mush for brains.
