Albertsons has the potential of being a great asset to any area that it's placed in, however, Albertson is way to high on the majority of the prices. The quality of service is great for the amount of workers they have on hand but that is not enough to make me want to pay more for the same thing that their competitors have. Albertson name brand products are overpriced. If you compare prices with one of the largest competitors (H E B) in the Austin area....it is astonishing to see the difference. The Albertsons stores do not even compare with the HEB...especially the new HEBs. Everytime I go into Alberstons the cashiers are standing at the checkout with no or few cosumers...even on the weekeneds durring the bussy times. Good Luck Alberstons....need to increase volume...it would help your out of date problems throughout your entire store including the dry grocery isles. Its not too often you see a can of beans or a bag of rice out of date.
