An absolute nightmare. After a very professional pickup, my property was held in a warehouse for days and days without being shipped, then after weeks it was delivered quite late. All that time my daily calls to customer service were ignored - never returned despite a frantic message every day. The operator always asked who was calling before directing my call, and surprise, surprise, it was never answered and sent to voicemail instead. This company is so incredibly shady they must work in the dark.
