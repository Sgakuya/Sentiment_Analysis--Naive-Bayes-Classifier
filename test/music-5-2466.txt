The reviewers on this site who gave Revolver one star are either demonstrating simple ignorance or a complete break with reality. Even if you don't like the music, which I find hard to believe, how can you argue that this album was not incredibly influential? Do you even have a clue how revolutionary Revolver must have sounded in 1966? Revolver and Rubber Soul are the keys to bridging the early, more traditional Beatles (e.g, Love Me Do ) with the later, groundbreaking Beatles (e.g., Sgt. Peppers ), and even someone with limited musical interest and/or education should be able to appreciate this record of the Beatles' unprecedented transformation. While I personally like Rubber Soul even more than Revolver, both albums contain more than enough classic songs to warrant a five star rating.
