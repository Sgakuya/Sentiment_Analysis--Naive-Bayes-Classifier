My husband bought me a watch in July, 2003 at the eastfield mall kay jewelers, he also bought the 2 year warranty with it. I tried to get it fixed (new watch band) at another kay jewelers store and was told I had to bring it to the store where it was purchased. I then brought it to the eastfield mall store and by then the battery was dead. I was told that they would have to send it away for repair which would take 3 weeks. 6 weeks later I still had not heard from them so I stopped by the store and was told by the manager Oh didn't someone call you?. I stated no. Then she said that they were told that the watch could not be repaired and a voucher had been sent so I could use it towards a replacement watch. However the credit voucher was lost and they were waiting for a replacement voucher to be sent and it should only be a days. They allowed me to order a replacement watch because the same one was not in stock. They stated it would take 5-7 days to come in, and they would call me when it arrived. I received a call( asst. manager) 10 days later that my new watch had arrived, however the voucher had not and if I wanted to pick up my new watch that I would have to pay for it and when the voucher came in they would pay me back. I asked for the manager and was told to call back tomorrow. I asked for the # of the District manager and was told that she was on vacation and the manager was covering for her and that there was no such thing as a division manager and that the corporate office didn't have a customer service #. How many times can a credit get lost. I can just imagine when the voucher finally arrives, if it ever does, the watch that they give me probably is no better than a bubble gum machine trinket. I will never purchase from them again.
