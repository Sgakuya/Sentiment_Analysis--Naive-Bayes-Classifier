Overrated blowhard. His "injury" during the World Series is, at best, doubtful. That "blood" on the sock looked an awful like a red marker to me. The Diamondbacks did right in dumping his fat ass!! And I am not only saying this becasue he went to Shadow Mountian High School, the Arch-Rival of my high school, even though that doesn't improve my image of him.
