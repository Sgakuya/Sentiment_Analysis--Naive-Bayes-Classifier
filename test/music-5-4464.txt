I saw Josh 3-4-05 and whoa that was the best concert I HAVE EVER gone to!!!! His voice is so amazing in concert. Not just in concert lol it is truly a gift from Up above!!!!!!! I hope everyone gets a chance to see him live even though the tour is now over... but after the new album whoot a tour pby will happen!!!!!!!!
