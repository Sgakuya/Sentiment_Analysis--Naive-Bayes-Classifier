Well, it's probably better than nothing. As is Windows Firewall. But I wouldn't pin my system's security on either. The biggest thing I noticed is that it doesn't look at your entire system. And there's no indication of why. It typically looks at less than 20% of the file system, and less than 5% of the registry (??) Try as I might, I cannot conceive of any plausible explanation for why this is 'O.K.'! I think I'd look elsewhere for something that's got a track record and reputation (and real support! Not the Oh, yeah, well what makes you qualified for us to listen to you! typical Microsoft support screen). You may disagree, but I hope you'll enumerate specifics, not general opinions.
