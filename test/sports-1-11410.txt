A great organizer, solid recruiter, and wily gameday coach. He was a perfect fit for Alabama (remember how they took Oklahoma to the wire in 2002?) but totally screwed the Tide for more money. Walking out on a bunch of unpaid 18-year old kids who are busting their balls for your paycheck? Sorry, that's bad karma. The 77-0 shellacking of A&M by Oklahoma was a taste of that karma.
