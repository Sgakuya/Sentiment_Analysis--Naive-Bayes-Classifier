This company SUCKS!!! There managment team is less than professional. I talked to the District Manager Marcy and complained that the Impala I got had bad tires and was a hazard. She said at this time this is all they had to rent. I took the car reluctantly and I woke the next day with a flat tire. I called their roadside assistance which took over half a day to repair. I called the location and they would have a car available @2PM. Me and my wife had flown to Colorado an extra day to enjoy the mountains and lost a whole day because of this company. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM. They rent cars with 60K miles on them and claim that I am getting a free upgrade in a car with bad tires. I will never use them when I travel on business. If you want to enjoy your vacation I would suggest you stay far away from them. I think a one star rating is too high for this company.
