Jack is a vain pretentious and fundamentally silly man who is the leader of the most irrelevant of European states. France, once the flower of Europe is now enthralled with the mad visions of Germany and allied with a duplicitous crypto-Nazis dolt. The French don t like the US because they ve lost their will to survive, to work, to dream and prosper. France is wrapped a fatalist vision of decline. They are drowning in a sea of the dregs of Islam and the flotsam of the third world. (These new comers, in spite of their own religion s ineptness in providing a decent life for its adherents, hate everything French.) The French respond with ludicrous platitudes about diversity while becoming less and less diverse. They simply haven t the courage to reproduce themselves adequately to face the future. Where is Charles the Hammer? He is sorely needed.
