Drowning Pool = Nu-metal posers. No talent and really, really, REALLY not original. They are just trying to be like every other piece of trash nu-metal band out there, with mindless, oh-so intelligent lyrics and annoying screaming . In a couple years, nobody will remember these idiots. If you want to listen to a real heavy band with TALENT, listen to Rammstein. If you want to listen to MTV s idea of metal , go ahead and subject yourself to this...if you can stand it.
