I watched this video in complete amazement with my mouth hanging open. The video depicts Britney, her usual baby-oil-smeared body in shredded dance clothes, gyrating with her dancers in some run-down abandoned warehouse-looking place. I swear, in one part it looks like she and her dancers are having an orgy (reminiscent of the Paula Abdul video, Cold-Hearted Snake ). If I had a daughter under the age of fifteen or so, I would not let her watch this video! This video is nothing more than a bold but really sad statement by Britney to say, Everybody look at me, I'm a grown-up! Really I am! I can breathe hard, emulate oral sex by sticking my finger in my mouth and grinning, and have pretend orgies with my dancers. Look at me! I'm an Adult! Britney, I am so sorry that the Masses do not yet see you as a grown-up. (Note the lyrics of the song: All you people look at me like I'm a little girl .) The thing is, Britney, your voice sounds little-girlish. You have no range and absolutely no vocal talent and rather than singing, you sound like you are hiccupping. And in order to be thought of as a real Adult you must conduct yourself as one. This means, stop drawing attention to yourself in these over-the-top videos that scream, I LOVE SEX!!!! That won't get people to see you as an Adult, just a Slut. Honestly. Alicia Keys is YOUNGER than Britney, but ACTS more like an adult and because she displays class and carries herself with dignity, she will be thought of as an adult by the public. Britney, it really would behoove you to put on some clothes and stop acting like an idiot. You are making yourself look more and more foolish with each video. If you want to be a porn star, stop pretending and just BE ONE. Otherwise, please show some class and stop smearing yourself with baby oil. Oh, and this song sucks too.
