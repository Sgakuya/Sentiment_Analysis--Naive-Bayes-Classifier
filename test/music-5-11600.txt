This is a great album by one of my favorite bands. They combine a pop punk sound with humor to create an album that you can put on repeat and enjoy over and over. This is their best known cd but it is not their best cd. It is the most popular cd. They found an audience with catchy songs like, What's My Age Again? and Adam's Song.
