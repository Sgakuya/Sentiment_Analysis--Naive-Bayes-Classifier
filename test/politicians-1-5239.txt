I am SO very tired of Algore constantly trying to drum up votes in any way he can. He doesn't care about the American people or he wouldn't have even started this re-count, re-count, re-count. He only wants to win no matter who he has to use. I'm terrified that this childish man may end up leading this country. I'm so ashamed that I voted for Gore in the first place. George Bush has shown more characture, dignity and class than Gore ever has and if we held the election again my vote would go straight Republican. I admire them for the style and grace they've displayed during this whole witch hunt for Gore votes . I am waiting to hear that George W. has won the election and will be MY next President and will be extremely grateful that my vote didn't count this time. Gore should really, really be ashamed of himself for acting this way and his actions will most likely create a lot of dis-respect with Americans.
