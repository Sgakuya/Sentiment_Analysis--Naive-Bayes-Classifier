I love Nsync and have since I first heard about them. Their new cd is awesome and they have improved so much since their first album. I don't know why poeple diss on them so much they can sing, and dance, and make harmony all at once. Unlike other boy bands who have to lip sync their songs because they can't dance and sing at the same time Nsync doesn't. So besides always having to practice with their singing and dancing they have to work out to. People always are on their backs because they don't write their own songs which they do and stuff like that. But take a look at the rappers sure they write their own songs but they just say the words they don't sing them and they just walk around on stage and don't dance. Don't make fun of boys bands because they are just a differnt type of music that some people like. We don't make fun of rap do we?
