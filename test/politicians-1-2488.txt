Here's a guy who lives in the fishbowl that is NYC...and has his girlfriend live in the same mansion that his (soon-to-be) ex-wife and two children also reside in! Then a court battle erupts, whereby Rudy's babe can't set foot inside the mansion. What does this do for his children, knowing their dad is making an absolute jerk of himself? His admirable bout with cancer notwithstanding, how could I take this guy seriously when he makes more headlines with his domestic shenanigans than with his administrative duties? I live up near Buffalo, NY, and our community had to deal with another clown named James D. Jimmy-baby Griffin for 16 years. I guess the good people of Gotham are more tolerant, because I couldn't stomach Rudy if I lived there!
