*** I Know Hillary Clinton is the Ice Queen and can be seen nightly at Helgas House of Pain at the corner of Main Street and Ridgeway. No cover but a 2 drink minimum. Her leather is so tight it is amazing she can breath enough to raise that whip. *** ** Haha. My attitude is a realistic one... Politicians are liars and cheaters. Believing otherwise is naive if not actually idiotic. As to a good view of a leader... How about one who has some ethics and legitimate personable qualities. When one runs let me know. I haven't seen one in a long time and those that do get chewed up and spit out in most cases. Hillary Clinton is a dominatrix who is only useful in a dungeon where she can squueze that huge butt into some tight leather and crack that whip to her hearts content. ** * Monica Lewinsky experienced more of the White House first hand than Hillary ever did. I doubt many will regard that as a good reason for Lewinsky to become president. * I'll state for the record now that I rarely support or oppose a presidential candidate forcefully but come 2008 I will. Bush is alright. Better than Kerry or the others. However... In 2008 I will volunteer my time and put great energy (ala Dean2004/Keery'04/HowCome/KeepTrying) into defeating the Icequeen. It is rare I care enough about politics to actually be proactive. I am certain of her nomination (unless she is dead or incapacitated). I don't mind a woman president but do mind a battleaxe. America should start preparing now to defeat this woman. Her prospect of winning the democratic nomination increased when Bush was re-elected. She will be on equal footing with her opponent given that Cheney is unlikely to run for the GOP. Few presidents are powerful or smart enough to really damage America. I am not willing to take the chance with her.
