There seems to be a common reaction to Kid A of pain. Fans with a grim determination to like it no matter how long it takes,listening endlessly til the blood pours from their ears; or non-fans who listen once and dub it radiator noise . For me this is the only Radiohead album I really loved the first time I played it. (The others all took at least a couple of plays, Amnesiac being my current favourite).There's something about the flow of the music, the shifts from say the beautiful How to disappear to the infectious dance of Idiotheque (which it's impossible to keep still through) which makes you feel good having listened to it.And it does get even better when you've played it a few times. Ok, it doesn't seem to be to everyone's taste (what is?)but, cross my heart, it is proper music and wonderful music at that. In short: Kid A:Not some form of torture device.
