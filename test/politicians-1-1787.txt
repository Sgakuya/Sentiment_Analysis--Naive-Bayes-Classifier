The so-called CEO of New Hampshire has no concept of how to govern, how to work with the state legislature. Furthermore, I'm pretty distrustful of anyone who refers to the Arts Industry and the Humanities Industry. The industrial/business model, quite frankly, DOES NOT APPLY to many enterprises, institutions, and communities. He just doesn't get it.
