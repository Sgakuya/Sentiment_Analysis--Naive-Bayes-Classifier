Sick, twisted, and different....Eminem defied conventional Hip-Hop wisdom when he came on the scene with this juggarnaut of verbal cannon fodder. The color of his skin not-withstanding, he also smashed the myths that rappers have to be gun toting, bling flashing, tough guy posturing, non-self efacing testosterone freaks. Good job Marshall!
