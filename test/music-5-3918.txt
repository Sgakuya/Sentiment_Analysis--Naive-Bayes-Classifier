This is a wonderful record. It's full of memorable songs with poetic lyrics and soaring feelings. The title track Netherlands is a particular favorite of mine, with incredible depth of feeling, beautiful orchestration, questing lyrics and Fogelberg's incredible multi-range voice. Other great songs here are Dancing Shoes, Love Gone By, and Loose Ends. I first heard this record in high school and still love it 25 years later. It's not a party record; save it for more intimate moments with those close to you or all by yourself.
