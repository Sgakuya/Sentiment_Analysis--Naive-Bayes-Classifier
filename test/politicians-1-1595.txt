Hafez al-Assad was a member of an Alawite minority in Syria who took power in 1970 and proceeded to transform the Syrian Arab Republic into a cult of personality. His Ba'ath Party, which advocates an extreme brand of socialism at the expense of the majority Sunni Arab population (and has only given socialism a bad name), has held the people in fear and captivity for over three decades. He managed to provide Syrians with a stable government and equality between the sexes in education and in religion, something which Damascus (Dimashq) had never known up until 1970. He remembered how his fellow Alawites had been persecuted by the Sunnis and the French when Syria was a French protectorate, and he took revenge upon a Sunni-dominated Syrian society when he gained power---he systematically massacred over 30,000 Sunni civilians in Hama in February 1982. (Kaplan, Eastward to Tartary, 2000, p. 137) His son, Bashar/Bashir, does not have the same ruthless yet suave personality that he did, and it is possible that Syria may become more willing to open up to the international community in the years to come.
