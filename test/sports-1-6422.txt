Gee, Kansas, I'm hungry, got any sour grapes? Losers, get over it. You know, I once had a beer when my 21st birthday was still 2 days away. Maybe you should report me. Roy gets a kid a graduation present, and you act as if he's dirty or something. Makes me mad, because you of all people know he would never intentionally be dirty. Do you like all the former Jayhawk players and respect their opinions? Well then, you should take a cue from them, because all they say is, Roy is like a second father to me, and we understand that is the kind of job he couldn't pass up. Hell, I'd be grateful to him. You'd be like UCLA has been in the past 10 years without him. I hope Giddens comes to Carolina just to piss you off. We are Carolina, we saw one of our native sons, we went after him.. ...............get over it. Think of it this way: If you were signed up to act in a film directed by Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg called and said, I need you to drop that and come work on my film, what would you do? Thought so. So, shut up and go husk some corn or whatever it is you do. Because, in case you haven't noticed, no major media outlets care about your Roy revelation. What he do?- buy a kid a slice of pizza? Bitter punks. Check out my new weblist on 'greatest clutch shooters from the past 20 years, COLLEGE and PROS'. Go be bitter rivals with Missouri, losers. We got some east coast hoops to take care of.
