My fiancee bought my engagement ring at Whitehall Jewelers in Miami. It has been THE WORST experience we have ever had with a piece of jewelry. First of all, the ring looked beautiful when he surprised me with it (at least the perfect moment will live in my mind forever), but right away, we noticed that the setting was off. We took it back, and it wasn't ready when they promised. Then, about 3 days later, we noticed a black spot begin to appear, which only got bigger each day. Three trips to the store later, and about 2 hours of arguing and them trying to sweet-talk my fiancee into a bigger ring for the same price (that should clue you in on what crooks they are), he thankfully got a full refund. They also sent him to another store to see if he could find another ring, but all they have is junk. Luckily we were under the 30 day return policy. Never again. Don't ever buy anything at Whitehall jewelers!
