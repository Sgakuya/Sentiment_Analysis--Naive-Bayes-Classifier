Never mind what happened during Chappaquiddick. Forget about it. Mary Jo Kopechne's dead. Um... excuse me? So... manslaughter is OK as long as you're a good public speaker. I'm SO glad that we have democrats to correct me... cuz I've been so wrong about MORALS all these years aparently... cuz I couldda sworn that most people who kill someone due to drunk driving get LIFE IN PRISON not life in the senate.
