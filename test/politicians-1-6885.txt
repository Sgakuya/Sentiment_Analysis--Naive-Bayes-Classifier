Mr. Lott seems amazed at President Clinton's job approval rating. Why, Mr. Lott? Democrats don't have to tout their good heart , compassionate agenda , and concern for all people (not just the rich) , as they have passed to laws to prove it. How difficult is it to see why he is loved (and forgiven for his personal sins ) by many? Perhaps those who are mean-spirited have a difficult time with that concept.
