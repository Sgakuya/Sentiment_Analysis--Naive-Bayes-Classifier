It is said that Martin had a dream and Jesse had a scheme. Looking at what Jackson stands for I find it sad that so many Blacks seem to blindly follow him no matter what he does or says. As an Afro-American christian I don't understand how so many others are lead astray by this charlatan. How he can call himself a minister of Christ is baffling to me. Jesse seems to care about Jesse not bringing reconciliation to the people, only about how he can obtain the spotlight. I also feel that Jacksons stands on abortion as well as his stands on homosexuality make him an person that is anti-christian. As a Christian God did not call us to be tolerant as Jackson says but loving; while we love the sinner we are to hate the sin not tolerate it. While as a man I do not like Jesse Jackson I pray for him because I fear the price he will have to pay will be high. And I fear the price his followers may have to pay will be just as high
