Two weeks after placing order at Barnes & Noble.com, I still haven't received my books! Their tracking option did not work for 10 days! I've placed over a hundred orders at amazon over the past five years and have not had a single bad experience. I used B&N this time because I was given a gift card. This is the last time. Never again. Ever.
