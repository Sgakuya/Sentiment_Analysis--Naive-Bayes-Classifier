My my, what an interesting record this is. What does tattermedalion and a junketer mean? Oh, definitely not my favorite Queen album, but this is definitely a masterpiece. My favorite off of this has to be...uh...well, I like Fairy Feller's Masterstroke ---it's a cute little song that has a fair amount of meaning at the same time. March of the Black Queen (I swear, this band finds more ways to incorporate themselves into songs than any I've ever heard) is one of the most layered songs I've ever heard...possibly an inspiration for Bo Rhap? Well, let's face it, I'm not a 70's Queen freak, and i don't think this is the glossiest album, but it's definitely chock full of fan favorites and will live forever in rock history. Take care, everyone!
