I was not impressed with his tenure in the White House. History will treat him as one of the worst preseidents to lead this nation. Out of touch with the common man, woman, and child. I remember when he ran for re-election against Clinton; it took an act of congress to get him to approve extended Unemployment benefits for unemployed American workers. He put too much emphasis on US foreign policy and not enough on the US economy.
