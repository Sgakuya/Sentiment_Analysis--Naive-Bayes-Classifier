I haven't been a Savage Garden fan for long but when the song Hold Me came out I knew I had to get the album. The songs they sing speak volumes and the words speak the truth. I think Darren is very talented and he has a unique voice which just melts me.I'd luv to see them live and I hope I do soon. Thanx Savage for bringing something new into my life.
