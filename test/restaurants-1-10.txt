Yuk! I can't understand how all these people can pretend to like this stuff. The flash roasting process (roast at twice the temperature for less than half the time), that Mr. Peet adopted to save on his labor costs, is what makes his coffee taste so bad. Some of you may remember the ad campaign that Peet's put out to convince people that drinking robust, smoky (= nasty, burned) coffee was sophisticated and that those who drank normally roasted stuff were wimps. It would seem, from all these enthusiastic 5-stars, that he succeeded beyond his dreams. A friend of mine took a pound of Peet's French roast back to France with him. It was universally pronounced undrinkable.
