The White album, if nothing else, is possibly the most diverse rock album of its time. From Blackbird , to Helter Skelter , to Honey Pie there's a song for just about everyone every mood. The best surprise? While My Guitar Gently Weeps . Who knew? The quiet Beatle can rock with the best of them.The tension can be sensed between bandmates here, but the fact that they pulled this album off anyway says something.
