This CD is almost a perfect follow up album to the first one!! It shows their depth and versatility as a band. The songs come from a place that we can visualize through experience or through the lyrics. Deep Inside of You is beautiful, and An Ode To Maybe talks about a laundromat, but it is a lot of fun to listen to! I hope everyone enjoys this CD as much as I am.
