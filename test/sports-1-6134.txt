Please... sometimes I didn't even know he was on the court. Put him on a team without Hinrich and Collinson where he won't be the third option and then the country will realize just how good he is. Head is down when he dribbles, shooting is erratic, too small for a SG. NBA would eat this guy up and spit him out. I hope he likes the European lifestyle, because that's where he'll be for the next 10 years.
