Bush is the worst president that this country ever had.The problem starts in Afganistan so lets start a war in Iraq, how is that logical.How can America be so stupid and elect a president that all he does is help the rich.If you are rich you don't need help. His plan to help better public high schools is just a BIGGGG lie. The school right down the block ONLY has a 20% graduation rate and how is that improving. The country nearly spends more money on a unjust war. I heard that alot of people voted for Bush beacuse he is against abortion. HELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO he is killing thousands of innocent people in Iraq. he should send both of his two drunk daughters to Iraq, which by the way are always on the papers because they close down bars. How can a man manage a country when he cant manage his own two daughters.This country has gone on a DOWNFALL and it is a DISGRACE. 2008 I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!! COME SOON
