Emotional is a beautiful masterpiece. If you want an album that touches your heart and soul, make sure you pick this one up. Finally a young brother opens up the door to his heart, and let us hear what's inside. I loved I Wish the first time I heard it on the radio. My favorite tracks are #6,9,13,15. Carl, thank you for putting LOVE back into love songs.Now get back in the studio and give us some more. God bless you baby! Lana
