Yes the man set the path for the future American presidents... expansion through extermination . The man also really did nothing in office, the only thing about him during his presidency is that he was the first, of a long line of horrible, violent people. I don't really get the raping slaves thing. Maybe it's true but Washington was kinder to his slaves then most other presidents. None the less he owned slaves, rampaged through Native towns slaughtering all. But I suppose the majority of you find this excusable because of the time. Since that's what most European decendants where doing.
