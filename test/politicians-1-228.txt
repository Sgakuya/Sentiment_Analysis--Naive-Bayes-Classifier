I assume this is about Mary I (Tudor) and not Mary II (Stuart). Mary I was unfortunately a woman embittered by her father Henry 8 who declared her illegitimate. She tried to return her kingdom to the catholic church by killing and punishing those who were protestant, which earned her the nickname Bloody Mary. But, her father had been even bloodier.
