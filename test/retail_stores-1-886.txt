customer service is non existant! here is my letter to them: I EDITE .... ORDER YOU TO CLOSE MY ACCOUNT AS OF THIS MOMENT! NEVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE HAVE I BEEN TREATED WITH AN INCREDIBLE DESDAIN AND UNPROFESSIONALISM AS I HAVE EXPERIENCED THROUGH DEALINGS WITH LANE BRYANT CUSTOMER SERVICE ! IT SHOULD BE CALLED CUSTOMER DISSERVICE! THE 800 888 9644 NUMBER THAT YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE. THE RECORDING THAT SAYS: YOUR CALL WILL BE ANSWERED IN THE ORDER RECEIVED, BY NEXT AVAILABLE OPERATOR IS AN INSULT TO THE CUSTOMERS EVEN IF THEY SHOULD BE FROM A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY! FROM BEING KEPT ON THE PHONE LINE, MORE THAN 2 HRS. (YES, TWO #@!** %% HOURS)AND NOT GETTING TO SPEAK TO ANYONE, IS THE MOST INSULTING AND DEGRADING TYPE OF CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP THAT LYNE BRYANT CAN DISH OUT ON IT'S CUSTOMERS! I DEMAND AND DESERVE AN APOLOGY AS WELL AS THAT I BE CONTACTED BY A CORPORATE OFFICER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! FORGET SOON AS POSSIBLE I WANT IT TODAY, NOW! I AM SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE TREATED SO DISDAINFULLY, SO I WILL MAKE SURE, THAT YOUR FINE NAME GETS THE AIRING IT DESERVES FROM ALL KINDS OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES, ON RADIO AS WELL AS TV. WITHOUT PREJUDICE, EDITE.
