Matthew, Kerry was tagged for flip-flopping not because of how he voted on any issue before congress. I'm not sure if this is the exact number, but the last time I compared his voting record, he was the MOST liberal voter in congress, voting with the conservative position (or the ACU position) on 2 of I think 98 issues. That doesn't sound like flip-flopping to me, and it certainly doesn't sound much like he is considering "add-ons" when he votes, just the party line. He was tagged for flip-flopping during the election, because he tried to be everything to everybody, and everything Bush was not. He tried to say things here and there that made him seem moderate, without loosing his base in hard-line liberals (which, with his voting record, would be virtually impossible). Republicans just capitalized on his doing what every far left (or right) candidate does. Your logic dealing with abortion is a little shaky too. For some reason no one considers murder statues "big government". I can't imagine why having them apply to abortions would be considered big government. Your argument regarding gay marriage holds up. But I have a big problem with the gay agenda's tendency to advocate for a change in the interpretation of laws to include gay marriage as if it was here all along (which, incidentally is the same thing liberals have done with abortion). Since the constitution says nothing specifically about gay marriage, it MUST be left up for the states to decide. I'm not a huge fan of Bush. He's not perfect by a long shot, but Kerry scares the heck out of me. The liberal agenda these days seems bent on usurping the integrity of the Constitution I can't stand it. John Kerry IS the poster child for the Democratic Party because his is THE most liberal voter in congress. Put these two together and you get a candidate that I can't give more than a one. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but he stands for everything I'm against.
