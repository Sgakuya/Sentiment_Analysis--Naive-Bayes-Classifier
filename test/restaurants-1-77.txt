I am with frogger. Yea, I have only been in an actual starbucks twice my whole life, so what? Everytime I have gone in there, I feel like I am holding everyone up, trying to decide. I am actually standing outside of the line, but the guy waiting next, me tells me to go ahead, and I order what sounds good, then it ends up to be orange flavored coffee. EW! I have gone there again and got the weirdest look when all I wanted was a plain coffee. So what? I want plain coffee. It's the only way to determine if their coffee is really all that great. And guess what? It ain't.
