Looking back at her track record as Attorney General (Waco, departure of Elian, obstruction of justice in the campaign finance investigation, etc.), there is no way this woman has the right requirements to be govenor of Florida. She will most likely go down as the worst attorney general history due to her mishandlings in almost every situation she put her hands in.
