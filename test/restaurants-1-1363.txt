We stopped today at the Sonic here in New Port Richey, Florida. After deciding what we wanted to order, we pushed the red button as directed. Then we pushed it again...and again. No one ever acknowledged our presence so we went to the door and asked the girl there how we could order. She ignored us. Another girl came out and we tried to talk to her, but she was so busy flirting with a young guy in a car that she blew us off, too. So we said to hell with Sonic. Wendy's got our $25 food order. We will NEVER go back there or any other Sonic after this wretched treatment.
