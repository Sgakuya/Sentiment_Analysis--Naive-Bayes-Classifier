Once again, they have teamed up to make a terrific record. First listen through the CD really impressed me, I am excited to keep listening until I wear out the CD. Pretty low-fi compared to the first in the series. I liked the Billy Bragg songs better on the first one, but they are nice here. Will there be a last leg to create a possible trilogy? 'Secret of the Sea' is a beautifulsong on the reocrd as well as in a live performance.. If you wnat to bring a tear to your eye, listen to ' Remember the Mountain Bed' and I hope you find the joy and pain in that song that every man should find when thinking about the love of his life and either missing it, finding it, regret relinquishing it or losing out on it for whatever reason. Airline to Heaven' takes on a new meaning after you hear it open up a Wilco show. It is crazy how great this band is.
