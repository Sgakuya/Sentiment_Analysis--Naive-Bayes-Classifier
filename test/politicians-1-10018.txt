Ok, I have to say it....why the hell was the W REelected....oh, wait that's right because people weren't willing to get rid of the dense little trained monkey after his first 4 years of leading us into more financial problems that Regan and his father did combined, not to mention the other idiotic things he has done.. Let us also see that joyous clip again where the World Trade Center was bombed....now bear with me here, but if the plans were in motion for so long, why wait to do it until George was elected.....can we say personal vendetta....DUH!! Not only that, but we made fun of Bill and ridiculed him for his affairs, but we fail to see that this type of behavior has been going on in this moral country since the first George (I mean Washington) led our country. Bush rants about the decline of morality by allowing gay marriages, but exercises few morals when sending more troops to die for no apparent reason. Even if it were necessary to take out Saddam, the government should have already been turned over to the people there, and if they mame, dismember, or murder one another, then they are accountable for what they do, not our men and women. Oil has risen to an all time high and even worse is that so has unemployment....in short we have a lot of people in this country that don't have jobs that are unable to afford the gas to look for work and can't receive unemployment benefits while searching because without gas there is no way to get out to get a job. I guess this makes sense if many of those people starve to death or join the armed services to be sent to war and then are killed, if the plan is to use unemployment as a method of population control.
