Oh my god! As always, it being Bruce, it gets a 5 just for the sake of it's being him! But it is a seriously excellent album! I would recommend it to anyone! I of course, love Because the Night , Cover Me , I'm on Fire , Fire , Jersey Girl and all the other love songs, because of my neverending crush on the Boss! But every song has something superb to offer! I find myself feeling so many emotions when I listen to it. From desire (Cover Me, I'm on Fire, Because the Night) to pride (Badlands, Reason to Believe) to bittersweet longing for my past (Thunder Road, No Surrender, Bobby Jean) to sadness that I'm not Bruce's Jersey Girl! . I listen to this album constantly, and if you love Bruce (like I do!) you MUST have it!!! Plus, there is a million and twelve great pictures and all the lyrics in the booklet that comes with it! Only the best ever!!! To quote one of the fans that you can hear in the background on Jersey Girl : WE LOVE YOU BRUCE!!!!
