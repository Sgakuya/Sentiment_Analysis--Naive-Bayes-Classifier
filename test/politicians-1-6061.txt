Oh, God. Here goes a brand new spanking long rant. Now please listen. John Ashcroft is against abortion, but also against sexual contraceptibes including Birth Control pills and IUDS. That stance is very hypocritical. John Ashcroft also voted against any one who was pro-choice. Why can't he accept other people's points of views? He is very fond of Bob Jones University which prohibits gay students and interracial dating. I have a problem with that because my boyfriend is Chinese. If someone was going to tell me who to date, I'd have a problem with that. And what's with all the opposition to anyone who's gay, lesbian, or bisexual? They are people too.
