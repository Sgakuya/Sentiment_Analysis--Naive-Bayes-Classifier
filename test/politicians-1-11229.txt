Typical politician....shows up to wave to the audience, tries to be humorous and does it badly, poor grammar, and answers questions with canned answers like we're workin' on it as he rushes to leave for his next hand-waving event. What the hell does that mean! If the issue is not on his agenda, you're wasting your time. You're not important enough unless you're a major contributor, a large employer, or carry a lot of clout. When he said he was working for the great people of Montana, I thought I was included, but it sure didn't seem that way.
