The store in Dundee Il at Spring Hill shopping mall was terrible to me on April 26,2004. I wanted my wedding ring cleaned real quick and the elderly woman there who wears too many diamond rings tried to turn me away for another customer she had called. She did not want to take the time with me or my ring, she was very rude and then when she did clean it for me she just held it under the airsteam for maybe 5 seconds to get me out of the way for her other customer. I wish I knew her name. My ring was expensive when I bought it and she couldn't be bothered with me. --amanda slavik amanda_slavik@hotmail.com
