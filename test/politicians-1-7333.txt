Rev. Jesse Jackson represents God as a minister. In that case, how could he represent Al Gore? Partial birth abortion, gay rights and the anything goes morality. He should be ashamed of himself. Black people are not stupid nor are they helpless. He is definately an embarassment to our race. Furthermore, President Clinton and Al Gore are not for minortiy rights, just minority votes!
