This rating would be the same if I was rating Papa John's, Dominos, Little Caesers, or most any other Pizza Chain. Why pay hard-earned money for an awful tasting, greasy, thick bland crust, with rubber cheese, sloppy sauce, and garbage-caliber toppings served up by the Pizza Chains. Instead, find yourself a nice family-owned restaurant that specializes in New York or Philadelphia Style Pizza. There is no comparison.
