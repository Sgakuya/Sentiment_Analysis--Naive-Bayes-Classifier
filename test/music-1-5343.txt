Whatever on Earth convinced Steve Earle that we actually give a damn about his political opinions? He started out back in the '80's as a great southern rock tinged country picker that could do no wrong and has developed into a drug influenced washed up Neil Young- Bob Dylan hybrid who can't pick his way out of this wet paper bag of an album. Give up, Steve.
