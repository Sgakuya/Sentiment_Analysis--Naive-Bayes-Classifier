We arranged a move through Starving Students six weeks in advance of our actual move. We confirmed one week before, one day before and the morning of the move. We HAD to be out of our house on the day of the move. Bottom line, they cancelled the move at the last minute because their guys were tired. In my opinion, they probably overschedule their movers and cherry pick the most lucrative moves. They are horrible, and the most unprofessional organization with whom we have had the displeasure of working. We did the move ourselves with the help of some very good friends. Do not use them ever!
