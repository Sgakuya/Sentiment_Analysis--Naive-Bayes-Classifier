Worst president I can think of . . . maybe George Jr. will be even worse, the jury is still out on that one!! Remember the star Wars plan, the Neutron Bombs, and all the other idiotic killing devices he wanted to station everywhere? I grew up in Germany during the early 1980's, and we had all the American missiles pointing at us from one direction, and the Russian ones from the other. I feel extremely fortunate to have reached the ripe old age of 31, and it's certainly not thanks to old Ronnie, aka more bombs, please! Reagan!
