Korn, Limp Bizkit, etc. etc. etc. They're all the same band and they're all phony garbage wannabees. This "band" and Korn and the rest of them are what Scott Ian called "backstreet boys with guitars". Just like on my comments about the Korn album, this is another reason why the 90's were the worst decade in the history of music when it comes to hard/heavy music.
