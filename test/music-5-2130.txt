Why does a band have to retain it's initial qualities to keep the respect of their fans? It seems as if Maroon disappointed a lot of BNL fans out there, but I, for one, have never been more impressed. For the first time in a long time, Maroon has exhibited the tremendous capabilities of Steven Page and Co. as songwriters and musicians. Sell Sell Sell plays like a Evita -like show production with a tango- tinged melody and a men's chorus, but it manages to be tongue-in-cheek as it pokes fun at the film industry. Infectious and upbeat songs like Falling For The First Time and Humour Of The Situation explore the beginning and the end of relationships without pretentiousness or melodrama. When Steven Page sings lyrics like A world that loves its irony must hate the protest singer in Helicopters , a song about touring in war torn, delapitated countries and the guilt and sadness it instills, it's a sure sign of maturity. So is Off The Hook , a song of a cheating husband and the wife who leaves him, which opens with soft, warm beats that feel like cashmere on naked skin and consistantly grows louder and more intense as the victim in the story finds new found assurance and strength. The musicianship in this album is flawless and ambidextrous as the band acheives songs like Conventioners with the intimacy of a lover whispering sweet little nothings or the ironic Tonight Is The Night I Fell Asleep At The Wheel which sounds like a circus theme but covers the morbid subject of a car wreck and death. Indeed, the Barenaked Ladies have created an album that slightly differs from what their fans are used to, but that shouldn't detract from it being an album with tremendous craftsmanship and truly amazing music and lyrics. Maroon just serves as an example that while a band is progressing into maturity, its fans' mentalities stay the same.
