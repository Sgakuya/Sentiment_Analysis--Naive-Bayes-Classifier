Yeah, like we should respect a so-so guitarist who stole all of his hits from black blues musicians. Ever notice how all his old stuff is his best stuff? (well, not his, black blues musicians stuff) Ever notice how his new stuff is all two and half minute, radio friendly crap that have no interesting or challenging guitars riffs in them at all? At least Kenny G admits he makes easy listening music, Eric still clings to the idea that once, a million years ago, he made rock and roll.
