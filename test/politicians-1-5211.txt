I really think that Al Gore should be given a pacifier--I mean he keeps acting like a baby I want a recount, I want a recount, at least until it finally goes MY way!!! I can just picture him with his hands on his hips and stomping his foot and holding his breath until the count finally goes his way. He AND Bush have torn the very fibers of the electoral system apart with this recounting and appealing. Stop being such a sore loser and concede already. If it was going the other way I'd be saying the same thing about Bush. Both of them need to learn when enough is enough. Thank you. Sue
