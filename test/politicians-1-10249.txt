I wish the republicans would sometimes remember to live by the morals that they constantly preach about, and start thinking for themselves. Then maybe they would wake up and realize that: 1) Iraq is no more free than it was when we entered it, the Iraqis didnt vote for us and we torture and degrade them too 2)Christians do not kill in the name of ANYTHING, and neither do they lie through thier teeth to get us into fruitless wars, roll back pollution cortrols, fight civil liberties, etc. 3)Wars cost LIVES not just dollars (Kerry knows this he fought in one, though Bush was hiding behind daddies money at the time and binge drinking on the side) 4)The war in Iraq has NOTHING to do with terrorism, It was planned before 9/11 all of the justification that linked it to terrorism was fabricated (remember those WMD?) 5)the only immorality that Clinton had that Bush doesnt share was sexual, but Clinton didnt alienate us from our allies. 6)in the Bible Jesus was renowned for his compassion and forgiving nature, the Antichrist was renouned for his ability to make war. Didnt hear any of this on Rush Limbaugh? Pull your head out of the gutter and learn how to Read!
