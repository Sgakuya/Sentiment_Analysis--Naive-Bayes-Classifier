Quite possibly, Quentin Tarantino's greatest gift to the world. You can tell that some serious thought lies behind each of the tracks on this album. Even more amazing is the way the songs somehow seem to complement each other - even though they are taken from perhaps the broadest array of musical genres that I have ever heard assembled on one album. Surf music, soul, funk, 50's, rock - this soundtrack has it all.
