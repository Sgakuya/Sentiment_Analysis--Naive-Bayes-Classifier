does maryland have some talent, yes. But personally I hate to watch Gary Williams, i think he's a crazy dramatic basketcase. And Maryland fans are a disgrace. It's hard for me to support a team where the fans have no class, as seen when they hit Carlos Boozer's mom in the head w/ a beer bottle, when they riot, and when they chant f*ck jj.
