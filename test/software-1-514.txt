The program is a pig. There is nothing more annoying than hitting the backspace key and having the document formatting on your page get ruined. Worse yet, you have no clue why it happened. You try to redo it, and itr happens all over again. I switched to WordPerfect as my word processor a few years ago. It will read and write MS Word documents, but it creates, manages and edits them much better then Word. Do yourself a favor. Get WordPerfect and simply save your documents in MS Word format. You'll keep your sanity if you do.
