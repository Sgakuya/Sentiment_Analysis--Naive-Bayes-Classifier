The most evil store on the planet! Only skanky, shallow W.A.S.P.s shop here. The other day I was in a restaurant and some idiot walked in wearing a white shirt that said FITCH on it, nothing more. Bet he payed 20+ bucks for it too, tool. CLONING WILL ONLY FINISH OFF WHAT THIS STORE STARTED! GET A MIND OF YOUR OWN! DON'T WEAR CLOTHES WITH LOGOS ON THEM!
