I am a total Hanson Fan...and I was obsessed in the begining...then with the sonic boom of boy bands i sorta shoved them back and got into the other bands...when they released this time around (the song) i wasnt impressed...then with If only...i decided to buy the cd...and became instantly hooked..i went out and bought their old one...and about every one i could get my hands on...This Time Around (The album) is a really great cd...with good music and deep lyrics...and not to mention plenty of fun songs...the hanson boys have talent and they really do apriciate music and not just the fame...I think they have a good thing going!
