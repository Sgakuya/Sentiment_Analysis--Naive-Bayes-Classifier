This man (and I'm being kind calling him that) is an amoral piece of human garbage. If he had a different last name, he would have served a prison sentence for his actions (or lack thereof) that deprived a young woman of her life. I am incredulous every time I see him addressing the Senate or campaign crowd , acting morally superior. How dare he?
