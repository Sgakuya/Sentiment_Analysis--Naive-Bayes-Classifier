update: I give him 1 star. he sucks, ran a horrible campaign, spent 99% of his time campaigning in states gore won in 2000. votes for the war before he voted against it. associated himself w/liberals, big mistake (I'm a moderate). He's a scumbag who never had a chance. even though i voted for him, i really can't say w/any certainty that America would be better off w/him and his snobby elitist family; i'd rather party w/the bush girls. I was an Edwards supporter in the primaries so i'm really hesitant to give this guy more than 3 stars....he seems to know his facts yet at the same time doesn't seem to understand the lives and problems of everyday americans much like the current administration but he's better than bush so what can ya do???
