Lloyd Carr is keeping the Wolverines from getting anywhere. I have never seen a team with less discipline or mistake prone than the Michigan Wolverines. They recruit great athletes, and that's the only reason they have had the limited success they've had. Look at Ohio State and Michigan State to see what a disciplinarian coach can do for their teams. Both Tressel and Smith have instilled a "my way or the highway" type of swagger that has taken their teams to the next level. Michigan looks a lot like Cooper's last few Ohio State teams before he was shown the door. FIRE LLOYD CARR NOW!!!!
