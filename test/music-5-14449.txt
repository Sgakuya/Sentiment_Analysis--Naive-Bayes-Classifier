The best Les Mis recording- the international cast recording offers fewer songs. Colm Wilkinson who sings on here IS Jean Valjean. Yea, I know that Do You Hear the People Sing?, Castle On A Cloud and On My Own have constantly been sung at auditions over the past ten years and I've heard them over and over. But most of the other music hasn't lost its appeal for me. Stars and One Day More still sound amazing.
