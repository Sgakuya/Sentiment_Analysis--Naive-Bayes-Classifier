Upon finding out some of my belongings were damaged or 'lost', and that Two Small Men had doubled the original estimate, I refused to sign the credit card receipts. Two Small Men served me with small claims court papers, I immediately filed a counter claim. The JUDGE ruled that I was only liable to pay Two Small Men the amount on the ORIGINAL estimate, and they were responsible and had to pay me for all damaged and 'lost' items. Don't stand for their strong arm tactics, take them to court and get Your Justice. Otherwise they win, and you're just another door mat to them.
