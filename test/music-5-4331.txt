This is a MUST HAVE album for any ELton fan!! it has such timeless hits such as Goodbye Yellow Brick Road , Daniel, and Rocket Man. This album first introduced me to Elton, and I love him!1 Prolific writitng from Bernie Taupin and addictive rhythms from Elton power this collage of classic Elton songs.
