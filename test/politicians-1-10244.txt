Often smaller than life, it's not really fair to say he was the worst president, because he was actually not elected into office. Full of contradictions: No WMDs, Lowers Taxes in time of war (no president has ever done that), creates a new, huge bureaucracy (totally opposite to the concept of smaller govt), creates an Imperial foriegn policy vs. the 'humble' philosphy he espoused in 2000, cannot define the term 'Compassionate Conservative', oversees the biggest govt power grab in history, blows all of the global (& much of the national) goodwill after Sept11, says 'we'll go it alone', then calls on the UN to help us out....where do I stop. I want my strong AND smart country back! Dang-It, Jr's supporters are even dumber because they think 'misunderestimated' is an actual word! Bill Clinton may have done us wrong by screwing an intern, but Bush, jr is just screwing the country.
