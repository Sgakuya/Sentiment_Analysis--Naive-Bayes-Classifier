UM needs to go outside the "Bo Family" and get a coach that has evolved with the game of today (not the battle in the trenches trying to hold off your opponent that it used to be). My senior year at UM is now ruined with the way the play calling is and the motivation that he doesn't bring to the team. 3-11 since 2001 vs. ND, OSU, and bowl games, 1-7 since 98 in first road games, and bringing in top 5 talent that heads nowhere indicates to coaching. Jim Herrmann's defense is always exposed, and I can't remember the last run to the outside on offense. John Cooper for OSU had a record of like 114-41-3 and was fired for going 2-10 vs. UM. Lloyd's stats are just as bad.
