Just like his father, time will show what kind of a president he really is. Sneaky and dumb are a lethal combination and some of the quotes he has made in the past years are true classics which reveal that daddy's money and name still can't fix a C average. When he can't invade any more countries and the economy s*** hits the fan, this guy will be history. He can take Asskroft with him. You know, I'm a moderate, sort of Republican, sort of Democrat, but I can't handle a fool who tries to sneak his agenda through at every opprotunity and take away rights granted to me by the Constitution. He can take his Partiot Act and cram it up his big white blowhole butt. I'm not even going to get into what this cretian has done to education while in office. take a look at what happened in Texas while he ruled there. Pathetic. Absolutly pathetic!
