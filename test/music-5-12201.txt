Before his freshman album, I'd never heard of Carl Thomas. I must say After listening to him , I wish I had. This brother is truly blessed and gifted. Each of his songs reached out and caressed its way around my heart. His lyrics make you want to grab on to your other half and feel what he is singing about. Tracks 2, 6, 9, 13 and 15 are definitely on point! You have my undivided attention Mr. Thomas. I eagerly await your sophomore CD and all of the others to come. With talent like the one you possess, I'm sure there will be others. Keep em' comin' and you will forever have my ear. Much Love, L.A Freeman
