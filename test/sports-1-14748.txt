emmitt smith hung on way to long, tainted his career. would have been okay if it was with a big market team or a winner, but the f-ing cardinals? i guess he was good but he sucks ass cause he always kept every single touchdown ball. not his first or hundread of his career but EVERY SINGLE ONE! thats really stupid. one.
