This is one of the best bands to hit the scene in the last ten years. It offers an alternative to the uncreative bunch of bands with their three or four guitar chords and bathroom lyrics. If all you like is teenage pop rock, stay away. If you enjoy profound writing and great musicianship, you better hop on and get ready for a delightful ride!
