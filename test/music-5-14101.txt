Before making such un-educated remarks, listen to the CD. This CD sounds like nothing they have done before, which holds true for all of their albums. They keep re-inventing themselves so as not to sound old and stalem, like so many other older groups. This album mixes rock with classic balladry and great R B. Another great effort from a great team of songwriters/singers/musicians.
