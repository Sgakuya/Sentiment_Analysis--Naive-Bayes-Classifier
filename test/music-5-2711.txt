Sgt Pepper is a one of a kind. Some people make comments about the album and say it is dated. Well this may be true in some ways but such a collection of wonderfully written songs doesnt exist anywhere else. I challenge anybody to record an album anywhere near as good as this on a 4 track tape recorder today... Just buy it.
