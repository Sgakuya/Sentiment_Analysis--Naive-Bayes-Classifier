My boyfriend purchased a 10 stone opal bracelet from Kay's for my birthday. I noticed today that a stone was missing. I took it to the Kay in Danvers, MA and they said I had to go to the Kay in Peabody to speak to that sales rep (that is the store he purchased the bracelet from). He also purchased the Extended Service Plan (ESP). He was told at the time of purchase that the ESP would cover any stones if they fell out. I went to the Peabody store and they said that the warranty didn't cover the stones that a different warranty would of had to of been purchased to cover the stones and it wouldn't cover the opals because they aren't consider gemstones. They said that the warranty covered the gold repairs. I said that if the gold prong didn't break, then I wouldn't have lost my stone. My friend was w/me and made a comment that the sales people will say anything to make a sale. Do you believe the rep actually agreed w/my friend!! I now have a bracelet w/3 broken prongs each holding a different stone (less the one already lost). I was told that they would replace the stone at cost (I would have to pay for it)and that they would repair the rest of the prongs as per the warranty. After reading some of these comments, I'm afraid I'll never see the bracelet again!! We will never do business with them again and will let everyone we know how horrible their customer service is!
