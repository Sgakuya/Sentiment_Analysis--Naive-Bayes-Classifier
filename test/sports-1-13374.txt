I have updated all of my comments on college football teams since I now have an all-time list placed elsewhere. In most cases that meant a higher rating for the current team. In Temples case it is still terrible. They simply can't buy a win. This team will remain bad and may eventually give up football altogether. That would save them a lot of embarrassment.
