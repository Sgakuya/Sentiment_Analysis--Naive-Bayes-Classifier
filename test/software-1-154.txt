I bought Home Business, and State. Seemed fairly easy enough at first although I didn't care for the look and feel of the software. Reminds of the old style Windows 3.1 software, big and bulky looking. It' wasn't all that clear on how to navigate from form to form, page to page, but eventually I *think* I've figured it out. Then, nothing but problems. Software problems, download problems. I now have to do my taxes manually and I'm out the cost of the software to boot! Tech support responded within 24 hours, but their suggestions have not worked. I still have own a non-working program! This is the worst software I've ever used in my life and it's handling my taxes??? Thank you, but I'll go back to doing them manually if this is what computerized tax preparation is all about!
