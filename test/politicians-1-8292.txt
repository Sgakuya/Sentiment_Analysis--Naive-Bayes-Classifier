He took money away from education, pumped a huge amount of tax payer dollars into defense (a dead investment), and should have been impeached for his involvment in the Iran-Contra scandal. He wqas a horrible leader. The only thing he had going for him was the fact that he was a good public speaker. I find it ironic that he was anti stem cell research, and he died of Alzimers.
