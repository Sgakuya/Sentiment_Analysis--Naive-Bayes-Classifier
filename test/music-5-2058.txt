Yet another beautiful record from Wilco. Although they don't seem to cover any new ground with this album (with the possible exception of a little more piano), every song reminds you of why you liked Wilco in the first place. Handshake Drugs should be up there with their greatest songs, and the 11 minute long Spiders will get stuck in your brain. But some of the real gems on this record are some of the shorter, quieter tracks. Buy it when it comes out. Until then you can hear it on wilcoweb.
