Me and some friends seen Busta Rhymes 2 weeks ago.. I must add he was rude. He yelled at us for no apparent reason what so ever. My friends were big fans of his and couldn't believe they was looking at a real star.. My friends were only 19 and 20.. But he was like, Why you f----ng staring at me.. some people don't like to be f---king stared at . Now I, found that to be very rude.. We the fans help make him who he is and this is how we are treated. I gave away all my Busta Rhymes things and I just don't like him now because of his ways..
