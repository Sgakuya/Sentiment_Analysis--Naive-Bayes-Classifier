 This gets my vote as the best record released last year. Lyrically and musically this is definitely the complete package. I was really hoping that he wasn't just going to do Soundgarden type material. They were okay, but somewhat limited in their output. I was very pleased with trax like WhenImDown and WaveGoodBye . They show a soulful side that there just wasn't room for during the SG days. Can'tChangeMe , Mission and PillowOfYourBones are other favorites of mine also. No Pop Top-40 here (Thankfully), just great music with feeling. Peace.
