A few nights ago, I ate at that new Chili's restaurant in my hometown. The restaurant used to be pretty good and I hadn't been there in months. I thought it would be good like the last time I went. WRONG! The fried chicken strips I got were too greasy, the onion petal I ordered was raw in the middle, and the gravy that came with my Chicken Crispers meal was way too spicy! A few hours later, I developed indigestion and an upset stomach. My mom also became ill with a sour stomach, and we both belched a lot. It took a full day for my stomachache to go away completely. My mom and I complained to the manager about our bad food and our horrible service to Chili's manager. We will now be getting free food because we talked to the manager about our bad experience. I would be willing to eat there again if they improved their entrees and made the waiters' and waitresses' services better. If you're looking for good food, do not waste your time or money by eating here!
