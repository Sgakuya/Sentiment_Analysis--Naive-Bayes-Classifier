This is an excellent CD. In college, I made a mixed tape of all of my favorite Beatles songs and Beatles 1 just about matches it to a T. Starting out with fun hits like Love me do and I want to hold your hand, it mellows out for a bit with Yesterday and then picks up again with more all time favorites. The only song missing for me is Julia. Finally, you end up with The long and winding road, the perfect ending to this amazing CD. Hardcore fans, this is a necessary addition to collection, all other fans, this is the best collection of Beatles songs you can get in one place. It is also a great introduction to anyone who hasn't yet discovered this legendary band.
