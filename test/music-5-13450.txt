Just bought the cd. Great lyrics personally i love btnh and i beleive they are the greatest rap group out there. They are totally unrated. I wish i could here them on the radio but its alright cuz if i dont ill just by there cds! I recomend this cd and every other cd of theres to anyone who likes deep rappers with flow
