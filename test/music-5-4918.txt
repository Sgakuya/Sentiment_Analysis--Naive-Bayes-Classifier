i am a 26 year old single mom with 2 small children. and im not really a country fan but this song one voice is AMAZING and done beutifully. I think people leave rude comments are obviously jelouse or immature. or just have problems with thier own insecurities. it makes them feel better or macho to cut someone who has done much better then THEM in there life down. this song makes me cry when i think about my 2 kids ages 3 and 5. thanks billy
