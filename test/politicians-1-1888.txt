What a joke this guy is. Jeb will do anything his brother George asks him to even if it adversly affects the people of Florida. He very rarely makes decisions based on what the PEOPLE want and rather chooses avenues to better the republicans. I am a liberal but that doesn't mean that I am total anti-conservative, but Jeb is making it mighty easy to be one.
