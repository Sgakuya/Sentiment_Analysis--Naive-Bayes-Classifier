Ok i just wanna say that in my opinion this cd rocks. And i admit i am a teenage girl and maybe it is mainly ppl my age who like em. But you've gotta admit these guys do have talent, which is a lot more than you can say about some of the bands out there. And you guys mouthing off about em isn't gonna change anyones opinion of em. You either love them or you hate them, and personally i love em. Plus like many ppl have said, Joel and Benji are majorly hot!!!!! Peace out.
