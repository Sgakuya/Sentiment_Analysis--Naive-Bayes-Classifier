A friend introduced me to Carole King's music by giving me Tapestry as a gift when it first came out. Though many favourites have come and gone over the years since then, Carole King remains at the top of my list and Tapestry has some of her most outstanding songs. Needs to be re-introduced to this generation of music lovers!
