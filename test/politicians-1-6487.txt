As a minority, people like waters, jackson, sharpton(I believe it is), make me sick. When they open their mouth to speak, it is straight venom, hatred for those who don't believe the way they do. They have the guts to proclaim they are Christians, give me a break. The fruits of the Spirit --- gentleness, kindness, compassion,loving, tenderhearted,merciful, etc, things that are loving. I don't see it in them. Please people, they are dragging the minorities down the gutter with them. If you want to move up don't listen to them and those liberals. Even if there is not a hint of racism, the likes of these people make sure it is. Jackson, waters and sharp, they make themselves a judge, I wonder who died and made them God. That is why I am not a democrat. America is a great country, it is for all the people not just for the democrats, this is a country where we should agree to disagree. I am so fed up with these people, they need to get a life. Wake up and repent to the Lord. People of God doesn't act this way, the Spirit of God is gentle,tenderhearted and a peacemaker, not dividing people against each other. I don't understand how waters ever got her position, who in their right senses would vote for her. Jackson and sharp, who give the title of Reverend. Please note that these people are wolves in sheep clothing. God save America and keep Your grace on us. Quit bashing true men of God- Ashcroft Bush. I am not white but it is not about color, it is about honesty, integrity and respect. America is losing it fast, our soon to be gone administration was cheap, filty and disgusting, how could anyone look up to leaders like that. Doesn't us minority get it, they used the minorities for their votes, they say they care, but they don't. WAKE UP AND COME TO YOUR SENSES
