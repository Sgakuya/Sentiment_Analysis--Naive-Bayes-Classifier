We should regret that we can't give this RAPIST negative stars! Not just the rapist of women, but also of our Bill of Rights. Nobody has done more to eradicate privacy rights and the right to keep and bear arms. (Perhaps he needs his zipper fitted with a trigger lock ...or his mouth!) His jihad against the Bill of Rights was not only shameful, but treasonous. Whenever children died at the hands of criminals, he arrived at the scene of the crime faster than the coroner, solely for the purpose of scapegoating America's 80 million-plus gun owners. He turned the ATF and FBI into a modern Gestapo. He deployed character assassins like James Carville to defame anyone who rightfully disagreed with his various lies and schemes. He is not a leader . He couldn't tie his shoes without consulting a pollster. However he could fool many blind and child-like member of America's Khmer Rouge Democrats into doing his bidding. Stalin would be proud, but no free-thinking American should be.
