I think Colin Powell is a disgrace to all blacks in general considering what he had to say about nigerians. I understand that the country is corrupt and does need a change but i do not understand why Colin powell will generalize that all Nigerians are frauds. That is terrible. My parents are from nigeria and i won't even consider them middle class. I will consider them low low class. This is because my parents never cheated anyone of their money. Colin powell is not from nigeria therefore, he needs to keep his mouth shut and not make faulty generalizations about things he hardly knows about. Millions of nigerians do not have food to eat on a daily basis just because some idiots who are up there are enjoying the wealth that is not evenly ditributed. It's a shame to put us all together and consider us one. You have definitely appealed to my emotions. Please, do not ever say things like this again. President Bush is dissapointing me, considering the people he is choosing to be in office. I voted for him and now i'm thinking, maybe i shouldn't have. People like Powell, Whitman etc have no place and should be given none in our governmental system. Thanks
