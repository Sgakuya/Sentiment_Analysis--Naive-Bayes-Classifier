STOCKTON, CA 10/7/2005 I went to a lunch I had been looking forward to with one of my very good and long time friend in celebration of my birthday. We had a wonderful lunch. Then in plain view of several waitresses the lady at the table across from me asked what it was I was eating. I told her it was my birthday and it was my birthday cake. She said, "Oooo, how nice, may I use your fork and have a bite?" I said , "No you may not." With the waitresses and the hostess still watching (I was hoping they would come to my rescue) and to my utmost horror this lady reached out with her hand and dug her fingers into the cake and stuffed it in her mouth. I was horrified. My friend and I just sat there with our mouths open in shock. Then I got mad and told the lady to get away from us and our table. The waitress came over and told us she had seen the whole thing and did we want another piece of cake. Well by then I was so upset, my birthday ruined, I felt nauseous from having that woman's fingers in my food. All I wanted to do is leave. Do you think that the Macaroni Grill offered to compensate me in anyway? They didn't even apologize, watched the whole thing take place and did nothing. I went in there happy and carefree and left sad and disgusted. As far as Macaroni Grill is concerned they need some serious lessons in public relations. I doubt I will ever eat there again. And I don't mind suggesting to others that they might think twice before eating at the Stockton, CA Macaroni Grill.
