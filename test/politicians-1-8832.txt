When asked why he had the affair with Monica, his retort was, Because I could. What a wonderful role model for my kids! His presidency was sucessful, on an economic level at least, because he had to deal with a fiscally responsible Republican congress spending the money and not spineless, poll-watching Democrats. He has Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich to thank for the economic boom of the 90's and the end of deficits. Even though it's the TOTAL picture of a presidency that defines success, I still think he was a TOTAL disgrace.
