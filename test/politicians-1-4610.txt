Smug, arrogant, hypocritical, deceitful....ol' "5 deferments" Cheney is evil personified. If I ever see him in public, I'll start throwing Big Macs his way... He was closing a real estate deal on a mansion in Maryland while people in New Orleans were sill on their rooftops. If he had a soul I don't think he could sleep at night...but apparently he sleeps pretty well.
