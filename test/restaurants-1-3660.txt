Ow, ewwww, why and NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Everything is bad about this pizza! It is unfit for human comsumption! I would not feed it to my dog! More seriously, the toppings are especially disgusting, closely followed by the cheese and sauce. The best thing about this pizza is the crust, although this is merely bad, not terrible. If you are really craving pizza, go elsewhere!
