Riding with the King is a classic. I have been waiting for years for Clapton King to get together in the studio do what they do best. The guitar duels are well done and hearing BB Clapton playing acoustic is such a treat. The music on Riding With The King is what I was expecting from Eric Claptons (From The Cradle) and was disappointed. Riding With The King is a Classic!
