If I could put a half-star I would. I used to work for this company and our store policies are complete crap. You can't exchange damaged or worn clothing and you can't get your money back at all. Employees are not even allowed to bring back their clothes. Our cheap accessories are final sales. On top of that Forever 21 was in a legal battle that lasted about 3 years over alleged sweatshops.
