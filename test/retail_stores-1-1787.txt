My young daughter in school,with a small child, bought tires at walmart. she had just had her car aligned. She bought the warrenty. paying to go to college she has littlemoney to spare. The tires wore out in three months!!! Walmart would not replace them. They told her the alignment was bad and voided her warranty. I took the car to Tire Engineers. They ran specs. and said the car was fine. The tirers were not up to standard. I had to call senior management and my daughter was without a car for days. Walmart is taking too much of the market for limited income families! They do not care about anything but making sale. certainly not standing behind it.
