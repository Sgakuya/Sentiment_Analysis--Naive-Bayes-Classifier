Thatcher - the half wit who sold off council housing to the few while leaving the rest to rot (how many on the waiting lists now Thatch? Don't care? Of course not). Thatcher - the loon who trebled the amount of people unemployed having used the electioneering slogan "Labour isn't working" (and with a "mere" 500,000 unemployed under the previous Labour govt). Thatch, who could not even afford a set of dentures that fitted properly. Thatcher - who slobbered at the backside of that brain-dead old fascist Reagan, her brother-in-arms. Thatcher ... a has-been whose own party had to sling her foul old backside onto the scrapheap ... the best thing the Tories have ever done. But wait ... son of Thatch is still around and his name is Tony Blair.
