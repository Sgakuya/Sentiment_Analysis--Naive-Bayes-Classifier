Flight left early causing us to incur almost $1000.00 for rescheduled last minute flights. After contacting several different departments at several different times,(including their Customer Complaint Department - totally useless in my opinion) US Airways is refusing to accept any responsibility and refuses to reimburse us for the extra expense.
