I had a bad experience this hoilday season on a return .OLD NAVY should have a post hoilday season return policy!I was given a gift with no gift receipt or org receipt (some people just are funny about giving you a receipt)well I think that when you get a gift and want to exchange it for something else and spend more money that you should not have to get a mail credit sent to you then have to go back to the store when it comes in the mail to hopefully still get what you wanted to exchange for .how rude are they when they know that it is Christmas!!!! No wonder I shop at Macys!!I will never buy there again they just lost a customer ,I always get my friends and family gifts to old navy but not no more after i spend alot of money there and they could not accomidate me !!Shame on them!!!!
