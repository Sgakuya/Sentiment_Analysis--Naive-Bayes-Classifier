In the top 5% of most radically liberal senators currently serving. Had the nerve to tell Condi Rice her integrity or ethics had been forgotten when she all but played dead when Bill Clinton was accused of groping women. Normally, this would have been OK except who can ever forget her breathy, nostril flaring, indignant attacks upon Clarence Thomas who was accused of having done far less. Political hypocrite and intellectually dishonest. Sometimes I hate being a Californian ... I would vote for almost anyone if I thought he or she had a chance to unseat her.
