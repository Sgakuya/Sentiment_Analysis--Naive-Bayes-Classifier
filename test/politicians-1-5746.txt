Hillary Clinton is a liar with a very selective memory. I'd like to know exactly what qualifications she thinks she possesses that would enable her to do a decent job as Senator (especially of New York). This Election Day should be a joyous occasion because the U.S. is finally unloading Slick (Sick) Willie. Now we may be stuck with six more years of him and his shrill wench of a wife. I wish both of them would get on a mule and trot back to Arkansas.
