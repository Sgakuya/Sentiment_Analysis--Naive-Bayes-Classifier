Like their musical influences Pink Floyd and King Crimson, TOOL live is an actual experience. You know a band is tight musically when all four members can create a live performance so great that you would not know the difference btween a live show and one of their CDs. A TOOL concert is also a theatrical show for the human mind. Lots of visual appeal between stage sets, lights, images, videos, stage presence, costumes, make-up, and so on. It's one complete show in a constant flowing movement (a different feeling than just setlist and staged encore). A ticket to one of thier concerts is worth any price.
