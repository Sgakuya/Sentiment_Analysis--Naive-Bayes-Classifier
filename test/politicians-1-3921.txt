He is a RAT. He gets one star because that is as low as you can go. He does poorly when he gets off the message provided by others and has to think for himself. Truly a pawn of the rich, and one himself, he wants to give the oppressed rich their just tax cuts and let the middle class pick up the slack, or is it possible that he wants to return to the ways of Regan and run up another $5 Trillion in National Debt. This election was his to loose and he's done just that.
