This is my favourite Green Day album. It has a nice mixture of really good songs on it. Songs such as When I Come Around , Basket Case , and Welcome to Paradise are on this CD and they are the kind of songs that you won't get sick of. Or so I've found. I've had this album ever since it came out over here and I'm still not sick of it. This is a great album to have, especially if you like the fast paced style of Green Day.
