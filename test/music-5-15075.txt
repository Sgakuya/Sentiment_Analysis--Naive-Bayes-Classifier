I agree that this disc is first rate, but I really can't stand Teardrop for the simple reason that everyone at school had ONE Massive Attack MP3 and it was ALWAYS Teardrop , not to mention that they all thought it was Massive Attack and Portishead. Man Next Door , Exchange , and Inertia Creeps are the real highlights here.
