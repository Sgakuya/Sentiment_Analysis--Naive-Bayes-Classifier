What talent. . .strong, great hands. But Tony Gonzales is better at the TE position. If he can just grow up he will have a great career. . .but he is on the fast-track to supidity. He has been treated with kid-gloves by the New York Fans and Media because of his talent and (possibly) his skin color. Jeremy, you are very good. Shut up and play if you want to be great. When is the New York media machine going to stop hyping average white players? (See- Jason Sehorn.) HE ONLY HAD TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES LAST YEAR! On what basis do fans love this guy? He had more fumbles than TD's. . .
