If Hillary Clinton gets elected in New York, I will be 100% convinced that our gov't is completely corrupt. As of now, I still hold a sliver of hope. My faith has slowly slipped over the years and with the Clinton administration, it has come close to diminishing. However, I don't want to give up completely and move overseas until I have to. Hillary winning might be the straw that breaks my back. I am continuously embarassed for her.
