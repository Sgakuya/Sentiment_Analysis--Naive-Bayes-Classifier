Come Away With Me is a CD I've played again and again since being introduced to it by my nephew. With quality like this in her first release, I think Norah Jones will amaze us all in coming years. Her voice and style have a depth and maturity that is rare even in many more experienced singers. I can hardly wait for her next release!
