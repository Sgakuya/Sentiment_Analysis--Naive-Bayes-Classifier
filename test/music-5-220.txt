Some would make a justifiable argument for Mellon Collie, but I think this is their magnum opus. Siamese Dream is The Smashing Pumpkins' most consistent, brilliant work to date. The only bump in the road is Sweet Sweet, and at around a minute and a half it doesn't have much of a chance to be offensive. What a great album.
