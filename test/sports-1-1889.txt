I don't think there is a team or a group of fans more annoying than the New York Yankees. I'm glad they lost again so that we don't have to hear all the big mouthed New Yorkers yap about how great they are. I won't deny that they have some talent, but so do the Cubs and the Braves and the Red Sox, but you don't near as much yaping from their fans (excpet when the Cubs fans talk about superstitions).
