Neocons are animals, Dubya is a monkey and Dick Cheney is lord of the jungle. Anyone who thinks this guy is actually running the show needs to go back to school. He is definitely the funniest president ever, if Rateitall had a weblist for that. After having a president who could pose a formidable threat with his language, now we get one who couldn't win a debate with a three-year old. What balance. Tricky Dick though, he's the real Sith Lord here. Bush was chosen to be the president because he is not mentally competent enough to actually assert himself and run the show against Dick's wishes. That last election was rigged, there is no way American voted Bush back in. Even most of the diehard Republicans were certain he was gone. Here's to the day this crooked administration is finito!
