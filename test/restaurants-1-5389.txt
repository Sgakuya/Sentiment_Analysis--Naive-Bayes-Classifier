My husband and I went to the Golden Corral in Jacksonville, NC today for lunch. Unfortunately, after we had eaten he spotted a roach crawling on the wall next to me. He squashed it and I told our waitress. She went and told the manager. He must have run into the back of the restaurant because he never came out to apologize or anything. After that I itched all over and vowed to tell everyone I know about the roaches in Golden Corral.
