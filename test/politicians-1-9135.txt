Without question, communist Bill Klinton and his communist wife can best be described as the biggest frauds America has ever seen. Klinton sold us out to China and if this were a different era of our country's history, Klinton would be swinging from the gallows with a rope around his neck guilty of treason. If Janet Reno wasn't so worthless and if our elected officials had any courage, Klinton would be behind bars awaiting his execution. The budget surplus that Klinton gave us is the result of giving America the largest tax increase in history and gutting our military forces. I sure hope I outlive Klinton because I look forward to the day when I can visit his burial site and urinate on his grave. Klinton's grave may become one of America's biggest tourist attractions. Klinton is America's worst nightmare!
