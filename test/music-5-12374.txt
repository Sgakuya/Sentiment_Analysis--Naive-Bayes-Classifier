I have been in love with Jagged Edge since day one, and I will continue 2 do so 4 as long as the LORD allows me 2. They are truly 4 talented and FINE (especially Quick) group of guys, and I look 4ward 2 seein' them in concert in a town near me. They give me music that I can enjoy throughout my day and night. Whatever the mood I'm in, there's alwayz a JE song that goes right along with it and that is something that I love 2 death. K.
