So if Strom Thurmond had been elected back in 1948, then we wouldn't be having all these problems now, Mr. Lott? I don't believe that allowing a black girl to go to a white school is a problem. I don't believe that letting a black man eat in a white restraunt is a problem. I don't believe that letting a black man sit down next to a white man on the bus is a problem. I don't believe that equality for all of our citizens is a problem.
