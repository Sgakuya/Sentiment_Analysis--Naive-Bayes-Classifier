I've been listening to Pink Floyd all my life, thanks to my father(he's a big fan), but I've only recently started to listen to them on my own. Listen to The Wall at night time, and you'll never want to listen to anything else. It's a rock and roll musical complete with themes and funny English people. You'll love it.
