OH BOY! I was blown away when I saw Lifehouse in concert not too long ago. They are excellent! Another singer whose songs come from experience. A definate 5 star break-through album. I can hardly wait for the next one! These guys will have great success....and the lead singer is only 22 years old! Makes me feel stupid.
