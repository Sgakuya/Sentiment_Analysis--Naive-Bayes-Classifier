I get sick of politicians using over hyped patriotism as a legitimate campaign issue. It is not. I am also sick of him getting labled as such an honest guy. He backtracked on many things said during the race including his stance on the confederate flag and his feelings for Gov. Bush. He has lied to get elected just like any politician, and shouldn't have a reputation of honesty. Also, would the press please quit shoving him down our throat! He didn't win! Obviously the American people don't love him like the press does!
