Well, his last few days in office will solidify Slick Willy's place as worst President in history. Pardon 140 criminals, cops a deal for lying to a Grand Jury, puts additional regulations on already over-regulated lands....and steals the Ws from all the keyboards! What an immoral, unprofessional, illogical group of criminals ever to occupy the White House.
