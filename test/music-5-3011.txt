Their first masterpiece. Every song is a stunner. I Should Have Known Better is one of John's best love songs. I have to make a comment about another user here--Jackie72. Comparing Milli Vanilli to the Beatles will get you stoned by real music fans. Get off this page. Talk about songs with NO soul at all. I have no response to that. How can anyone? Go back to your Puff Daddy and Eminem CDs and leave the Beatles alone.
