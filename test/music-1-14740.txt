I seem to recall some cool, mellow Irish-sounding stuff from the movie, but Celine Dion's horrible voice makes owning or listening to this soundtrack an impossibility. What a horribly malignant waste of fifty pounds of flesh she is! I kinda wish the ancestors responsible for that disease of a woman had been on the Titanic.
