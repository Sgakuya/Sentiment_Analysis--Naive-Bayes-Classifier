Opinions on this CD seem to be very divided. Half the U2 fans claim it marks the point where U2 left the Joshua Tree golden days for their less-impressive electronica-influenced music. And the other half claim that songs like One and Mysterious Ways make this a candidate for U2 s best CD. Well I like War, Unforgettable Fire, and Joshua Tree better than Achtung Baby, but I still think it s a great CD. When it was first released I must have listened to it, almost exclusively, for weeks. Acrobat and Love Is Blindness, songs on this CD that are usually overlooked, are probably my favorites.
