I have never had a good experience here. Service is TERRIBLE. After you get your food, prepare to never see your server again, assuming he or she is actually the one bringing your food. Want refills on drinks or fries (as the menu claims)? Tough. The food is ok, but portions are small and for the price it's nothing special.
