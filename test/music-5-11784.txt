It's impossible to put GC in any genre, it's like a human thing to do that, we are all the same species but we are put into different stereo types. GC plays music i mean so do the backstreet boys, they aren't soo much different, but some social doctrine said that they had to be put into certain categories. GC is doing a good job in this CD of putting out their feelings and experiences in their songs with catchy tunes and rockin lyrics, it's great. I will support GC for everything! They rock my face off!
