While I will not be changing my rating, and it is not in my nature to feel guilty about anything I have said about dook. Given some of the tacky, classless things their fans say about opponents, I'm sure they would never do this. Afterall, we are talking about people who make fun of players for being from impoverished backgrounds, and who can forget the things they used to say about poor lil Kris Lang. Even given all that...........I checked on their game last night, saw Shelden Williams, and an overwhelming sense of guilt came over me about my old comment. I will never respect dook as people or the politics and attitudes they represent, but Shelden is just a kid trying to make it as a baller. I thought about his momma reading that comment. I thought about seeing this thing on Sportscenter where K asked him if he had a girl, and him bashfully replying, yeah. It is hard to explain, but for some reason I just felt awful. The rating stays the same, but I take back that comment. But, their bench still looks like a Dungeons and Dragons club. Or, a republican haircut club. Or, a kkk rally.
