I wish there was an option for NO stars here. I see nothing good coming of Granholm and her minions. She is crippling Michigan economy and losing jobs for us, daily. K-mart is considering relocating, Frito Lay has closed it's doors and with each passing day, more jobs are lost. She is taxing us to death, whether it be tobacco, gas, property, auto insurance and the price of licensing a vehicle and the taxes that businesses need to shovel out is causing these businesses to take their businesses elsewhere. I don't know who in their right mind voted this tax happy lunatic into office but I certainly hope they don't repeat this grave mistake. Please, take Jenny from the block out of Michigan and send her back to Canada!
