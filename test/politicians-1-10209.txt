What a terrible president--probably the worst one I can remember having. Our economy is in the toilet and he has gotten us involved in another Vietnam. Thanks for destroying the country, Dubya. UPDATE:To LanceRoxas: I have not heard the term pinko since the early 1970's when All in the Family was all in the rage. Perhaps you are Archie Bunker reincarnated. You certainly seem to share his intellectual gifts. YET ANOTHER UPDATE TO LANCE ROJAS: While, I couldn't get through your most recent post, certain things jumped out at me, eg., the constant exclamation points and shrill references to libs and leftist pinkos. You are a screeching cheerleader for the rightwingers. We already have Kerry04;why don't you become Dubya04 for symmetry's sake?
