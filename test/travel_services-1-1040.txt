A total scam all across the country. These guys aren't students. Most of these guys are hired straight off the streets in skid road type areas. My suggestion is getting all details in writing and signed before using them. Make them give you a flat rate if you have to use them. They will charge you more but then can't reneg on the deal. They also have a plethora of extraneous charges in their arsenal; bogus travel time, heavy object charges, stair charges, elevator charges, walking distance charges, etc. Also take the whole boat for insurance or you will be sorry. This company was almost thrown out in WA State. Only by paying huge fines did they keep their business there. Make sure you get copies of all invoices before and after the move. Also know that they cannot leagally hold your items for payment. Call the police as it is theft. Have your signed estimate out and waiting for when the police arrive, because if you use this company you will need them.
