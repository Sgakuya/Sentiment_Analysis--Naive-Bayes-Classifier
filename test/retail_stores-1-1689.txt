The Kmart where I live is terrible. It is filthy, you can never find anything. Prices are mismarked on the shelves, They always only have 1 or 2 lines open and they are SLOW. I think that the only requirement needed to get a job there is to have a pulse. The employees are rude, stupid and do not speak english. I asked an employee to help me find a black polo style shirt and she said she didn't know where they were.
