I saw her on Showtime concernt 3/28/04 and was appalled that she is so sexual explicit and her performance and role model for young teens was a disgrace. She's all about SEX and masturbating in front of millions to sell a show was just way off base. I think she's trying to fill the shoes of Madonna and who needs another Madonna in this day and age we live in. Can't someone be wholesome and a good role model and not be all about SEXY!! all the time.
