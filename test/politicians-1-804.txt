Smug little so and so. Glad to see Fianna Fail got a good pounding in the local elections. I hate the way he talks too, he sounds like a asthmatic Dublin schoolboy with a stutter. Too eager to bow and scrape to other world leaders. He is wayyyyy too pro-EU and he'd rather spend Irelands money on football stadiums, private jets and obscene security measures for Bush than little things like health, education, the poor, roads and rail.
