The father of modern American liberalism. Just wanted to thank you for making it so easy for us realists to prove that liberal idealism does more harm than good. Your 14 points were a disaster paving the way for such problems as the rise of Nazi Germany and the genocide in the Balkins. On top of that you were a stubborn man who could not believe that anyone besides your ivy league self could be right. You were in charge during one of the most pivitol points of the 20th century and you blew it. America needed a leader not a teacher. Where was Henry Cabot Lodge when we needed him?
