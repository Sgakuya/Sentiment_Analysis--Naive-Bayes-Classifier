CREED is the best rock band I've ever seen LIVE. If you're not a fan, go see a LIVE CREED show ' you will become one! Their talent and energy are simply amazing! CREED's music lyrics are unlike any other ' quite unique in my opinion! CREED is one band that truly appreciates their fans ' on numerous occassions, they have publicly commented on how much their fans mean to them. I believe CREED will be around for a very long time!
