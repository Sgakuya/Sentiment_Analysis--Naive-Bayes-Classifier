Look who Gore surrounds himself with: Jesse Jackson, Bill Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Dick Gephardt, Rob Reiner. These are people with one thing in mind. Themselves. Jesse Jackson still thinks we should pay black people money because thier great-great-great grandfather was a slave. Oh Boo-Hoo. Get over it. You've had your chance over the last 30 years to prove yourselves, especially with affirmative action (which Gore loves). AA only degrades people saying you're not good enough to make it on your own merits, so we'll give you unfair help .
