This store may be OK for jeans and other items that you can use for years but is WAYYYYY too expensive for clothing that you want new every season(and you are going to get tired of the prints, colors and slogans, anyway). One tip: A&F and Old Navy are owned by the same corporation,so of course they make the clothes in the same line of production, and, interesting enough I have noticed that Old Navy carries the same style and quality of A&F with lower prices. So stop this trip of A&F logo everywhere , and give a look at Old Navy. I wouldn't say everything they do is great, but you gonna find some cool (and cheap) stuff over there.
