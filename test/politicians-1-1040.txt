I cannot for the life of me understand how this man won an election! All he's done since he came to power is cause trouble. He destroys refugee camps, the airports, the docks. He bombs policestations, the palestinian authority, he's put Yassir Arafat pretty much in house-arrest. Many isrealis are critical of what he's doing, the UN is critical, the EU is critical even his own government is critical! As far as I can tell Ariel Sharon is not in the least interested in bringing peace between Isreal and Palestine. Not one bit. He makes unreasonable demands, he breaks his deal of the bargain and he constantly claims that he is fighting the terrorists (palestinians) . How? By destroying civillians homes? Oh yeah, Sharon you rock my world. It's amazing what a guy like him can do and get away with. Ariel also claims that Yasser Arafat isn't doing enough to fight terrorism... Maybe if Ariel didn't set out to kill palestinian millitary/police they'd have an easier time arresting people! Anyone care to guess how much longer Ariel Sharon is going to act like an imbicile? And to all the people giving Ariel Sharon 4 or 5 and talking about God, haven't you people heard of Love thy neighbour !?
