Larry Bird had Ainge, McKale, Parish, and Johnson. The only team that reminds me of this starting five is the Sacramento Kings, except Peja isn't Bird, and Webber isn't McKale. If Sacramento, as a whole, had more character, they would be the best team of all-time. He is one of the best pure shooters of all time, but he is no Danny Ainge. He is not the most athletic player, and there are tons more individuals, who are better than Bird, and I can name too many who are not included on this list. Bird is a great player, but because I don't think he's one of the best, I'm sorry Bird fans, he has to get the 1.
