I have been treated poorly from customer departments but Lane Bryant sets a new low.10 days before Christmas I placed an order which promised delivery by Christmas if you payed for Express Delivery, great but.I received an email confirming my order and was told I would receive another email in 24-48 hours with details of the order. 48 Hours passes and nothing, send an email and at this writing 2 days later still no response. Called to get a tracking # on day 2 and low behold when I tried to track it I am told by UPS it is an invalid #. Call back and get the most rude person I have ever dealt with and am told the only # they have cannot be used to track a package and just what did I expect her to do about it.(ATTITUDE)days later package should have arrived but guess what. Call lb again and emplore there help and this time am given a tracking # for UPS, called them and guess what, INVALID #, another call and by this time with Christmas around the corner and a large part of my wife's Christmas in the hands of LANE BRYANT I am more than a little __ssed, this time I actually get a person with a little compassion and when I relay some of what has happened and the tracking # she immediately stops me after 5 digits of the # and tells me she knows it is a invalid #. OK finally I get a # and might get it by Christmas but the lies and the pressure are inexcusable by anyones standards. OK so I know I shouldn't wait so late but after all I am a man and that's the way we do things, at least sometimes.Life is nothing but lessons learned and I have learned one this week, don't trust LANE BRYANT. First and LAST of my money they will ever get.
