If there was a spot on the above to leave all stars blank, I sure would have rated this man 0 stars.I have to say this has got the be the most worthless man in Washington today. Come on people, in Vietnam he was a journalist who also had a bodyguard. The recent debates showed us everything we needed to know about this man. He is short tempered, has the personality of a rattlesnake. All he did was act like an jackass. Instead of acting like a grown up seeing as how he is our VP , he acted like a child who didn't care about anything else except making Bush out to be the bad guy. As for slinging mud about Bush's DUI, that was stupid. Clinton/Gore administration turned the White House into a Whore House. Who could possibly consider that man to be our President. Bush, you have my vote...
