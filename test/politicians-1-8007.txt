PDR was a socialist and had ideals that could have mirrored Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. In addition, he also used Pearl Harbor as an excuse to go to war with Germany, a sacrifice that could have been lessened to enter WWII. I think anyone who had 12 years as president could have done much better like Ronald Reagan.
