On Sunday, 05/04/03, I went to the Church's in Bay City Texas drive thru. The service was terrible and the floor of the resturant was so slippery with grease and food that the employees was sliding to do the work. An employee came from the back and came out front picked his nose and then went to the cooler got chicken strips out without washing his hands. I will never visit this place again. This is my hometown and I was totally embrassed came home with my lunch and thru it in the trash.
