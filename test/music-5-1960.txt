am amazing album that has rhythm, depth, and some damn good solos. its as well rounded as an album could be, with soft songs (are you sad?) and some harder ones (everyone's a junkie) to the ones in between (if you believe). i strongly reccommend it for anyone who is a fan of our lady peace, everclear, matt good band, f11, etc.
