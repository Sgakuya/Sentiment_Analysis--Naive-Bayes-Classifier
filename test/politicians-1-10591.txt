I just cannot see how Americans could choose such a backward and narrow-minded person as their president. George Bush Jr. is disliked all around the world for his ultra-conservative mentality and environmentally unfriendly agenda. It's sad to see that the US is stuck with a president who was chosen by less than 50% of the American population! By the way, I find George Bush very unsophisticated and uninformed. I've heard he's only been abroad a few times and those were trips to Mexico! For example, I heard he's never been to the UK! Also, in this year's Summit of Americas he referred to the language of Mexico as Mexican instead of Spanish!!! Not to mention he was once tricked to believe that Canada's prime minister is called Mr. Putin instead of Mr. Chretien! See, this person is leading the world's most powerful country. Sad indeed.
