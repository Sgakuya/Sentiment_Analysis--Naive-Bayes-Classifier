Terribly overrated. Nuked the Japs, not once, but twice, which were most unneccessary actions against defenseless civilian populations when you consider the Japanese military was all but vanquished. So, he had the blood of 200,000 innocents on his hands. That's a great legacy, an envious place in history, the turd. Did virtually nothing to address the issue of civil rights, despite the fact that it was an issue whose time had come. Presided over that totally needless Red Scare of the era and did nothing to rein in the illogical public hysteria over a threat that never existed. Got us involved in Korea, which led to the needless deaths of thousands of U.S. troops, and did nothing to assuage East/West tensions or establish the primacy of democracy. Oversaw a post-WWII recession of significant depth despite an increase in true aggregate demand. Spent more effort defending the singing ambitions of his talentless daughter against well-deserved criticism in the press than doing something that was actually constructive and progressive. He should have stuck to haberdashery and small-time political grabassing. Many of the pinheaded posters here praise the man's "balls," by dropping the A-Bomb, but how much courage does it take to sit behind a desk 12,000 miles away from the action and have someone else do the dirty work? Sounds like a yellow-bellied coward to me.
