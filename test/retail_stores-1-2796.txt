Me and my husband went to Fred Meyer to buy our wedding band and we were treated very nice the sales person made us think we were buying jewelry in a nice and professional place. They didn't have my size so they told me it would take 6 weeks for my ring to get ready. After 6 weeks I called Fred Meyer and they didn't know where my ring was not even had any information about it. They did not return my call and I had to call 4 more times to ask about it. After 9 weeks I got fed up with it and I went to the shop to get my money back. The assistant manager Andrea was very rude and unhelpful and accused that was not her fault since she didn't sell the ring to me. They were totally unprofessional and irresponsible. And the people whom sold the ring to us were not working in that store anymore. I also bought an insurance with the ring in case of diamond lost and they didn’t return the money saying that the price I paid was for the adjustment of the ring I didn’t even get. I do not recommend anybody that store they have horrible customer service and do not do what they tell you they will do.
