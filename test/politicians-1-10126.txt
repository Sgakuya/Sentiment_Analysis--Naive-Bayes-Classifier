After the election I have come to realize that 52% of the U.S. has choosen a retarded cowboy. The man cant even speak correctly, let alone make important choices with the concequence of death if choosen incorrectly. He even makes it more difficult for imagrents to get in the country. The only good thing about this president is he makes Jon Stuarts job a hell of a lot better.
