McAfee is as bad as Microsoft, only interest in one thing, $$$. It came with my computer with a firewall, virus protection, privacy service and more, BUT those only last one year and each service you need to pay at least 30 dollars to renew. You also need to pay 70 dollars a year for some online protection crap. Go with Norton, it does the job and won't make you bankrupt when you need to renew. Norton is also less of a hassle to use.
