I had never heard of the song or the singer until I saw his video on GAC, and I fell in love with it! I just spent the last half hour trying to find a place where I could tell Billy how much I loved the video. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a stalker or anything like that, but I fell in love with the video. I think he is a very talented individual, and I definately look forward to seeing more of his work on T.V. as well as on the radio
