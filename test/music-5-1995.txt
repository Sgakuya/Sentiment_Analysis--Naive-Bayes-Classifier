At last, an album which actually involves pure, raw talent that shows that the plastic, identical bands are not the only thing around. Its about time that we had an album that is unique. This album has a load of great foot tapping songs (and yes, you will mimic the guitar noises) Lets hope White Stripes are around for a long time
