I still love hearing this album--every track sounds as fresh as they did in '77. The recent remaster includes Silver Springs, which was the B side of the Dreams single and a highlight of their 1997 reunion tour (the live version was pulled as a single). I recommend the remaster even if you already have the original pressing. Intraband dysfunction is well-known by now but it produced some of the best rock and pop recordings of the '70s. I still rank Tusk as the best Fleetwood Mac record, but this one comes very close.
