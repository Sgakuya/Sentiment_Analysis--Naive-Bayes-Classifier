Yeah, this one is pretty outstanding. Superstition is almost unbelievable when it comes on, it's just such a HARD song. It's perfect in a manner that's about 180 degrees from the other perfect song on the record, You Are the Sunshine of My Life, which is just so serene, generous and optimistic. But in my opinion, the hidden treasure on this record is Maybe Your Baby . A little while back I put together a great CD mix of early 70s soul songs, and even amid incredible songs like Sly's If You Want Me to Stay, Curtis's Superfly , and Al Green's Belle -- this one stands out. Some people might say it goes on too long, but I can groove to Stevie and friends singing May-be your ba-by done made some oth'a plaaaaaans all day and into the night.
