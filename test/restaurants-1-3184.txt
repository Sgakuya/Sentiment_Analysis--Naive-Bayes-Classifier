i once enjoyed the restaurant in the orlando area, but once i moved to long island new york and had a horrific dining experience, i will NOT be returning to any pizzeria uno. The restaurant was dirty (mind you very slow volume) the food was cold, the dishes were dirty and management was hanging out at the bar while the restaurant looks like a tornado blew in
