Just another in the revoving door of Head Coaches here in the desert wasteland of the NFL. When it comes to coaching here in Arizona, NFL stands for NOT FOR LONG! Pity, too. The problem is not in the coaching (except for maybe Buddy Ryan!), but in the front office, who won't spend the cash to hire the talent to bring a winner here.
