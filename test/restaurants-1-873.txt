My family goes to Subway (store # 24445 located at 101 Ocean Beach Hwy, Longview Wa 98632)at least twice a week. Today we had the very worst experience and service we have ever had at Subway or any other resturant for that matter. It was bad enough to where we plan on never returning to that subway or possibally any other. We spend approximately $50 to $60 a week. The casher was very rude to us we ordered 5 sandwiches and none were marked she told us to open them to see what was what. We ordered all with meals and had a filled Subway card to cover one of them, she acted as if it were a problem to use the card. when we grabbed our chips she said hey you have to pay for those, my wife said we ordered the meals and she said you should have said that when you paid. my wife said we did other customers in the store said they heard her say she wanted the meals with all the subs. when we began to eat the subs the bread tasted very stale and dry. There were two employees there it was 1:15pm when we had lunch, their names on their tags said Kasee one one and Debbie on the other. Shift change came before we could complain about the bread. We found from another employee that the lady that was rude to us (Dwebbie) was the manenager of the store, we were even more dissapointed. We didn't finish our meals. This is the only bad experience we have ever had at this store, however, it was bad enough to where we most likely will never go back
