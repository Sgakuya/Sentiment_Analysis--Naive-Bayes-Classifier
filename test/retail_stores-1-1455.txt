Another week...another change in placement of items in the store. When I get the chance to go shop at my local Meijer in Kettering, Ohio, I am on a limited time schedule and do not have time every week to find where things have been placed from week to week. While the employees are willing to help, I do not feel that that should be there job and I think that the managers need to find something better to do with their time and employees than to constantly move things around.
