I loved their food until I worked there (for 2 weeks). I found out way too much about how they have their servers handle clean dishes with dirty hands. The policy was: full hands in, full hands out. So, this meant that after we cleared a table took the dirty dishes to the dish washing area, we couldn't leave the area without grabbing a stack of clean dishes (to keep the cooks stocked). TWICE I was repremanded for washing my hands before returning to get clean dishes!!! So, this often meant that BBQ sauce, who knows what else was getting on the clean dishes -- via our dirty hands! I rarely eat Chili's now, if I do, I only get take-out!! They don't use the dishes for take-out!!
