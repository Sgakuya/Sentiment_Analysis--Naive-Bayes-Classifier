Okay...what to say...I hated him. I don't think there has been a conservative president that was good. His idea for trickle down economics was just pure idiocy. Republicans like to say that he ended the Cold War, BUT HE DID NOT. He just happened to be president during it. He may have gone over there, but IT WAS REALLY GORBACHEV WHO ENDED THE COLD WAR. And even though I don't like Jimmy Carter, he was better than this a$$hole. Don't know how anybody in their right mind could like him.
