I voted Democratic all my life but I refused to vote for this democrat. My brother was scarred by his tour of Viet Nam while Clinton cleverly skipped out. And all the lies! And eight years of promisis never came about. My poor, elderly parents voted for him hoping that Clinton would change things so that they would pay less for their prescriptions. They could have had it a lot easier. I am not one to throw stones, but what a shameful episode in our history! Hope this election thing is settled soon... The Chinese need to know where to send their checks!
