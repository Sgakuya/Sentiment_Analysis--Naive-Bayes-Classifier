If you can find enough meat on a Subway sandwich to satisfy the hunger of a gnat, that's amazing. These sandwiches are bird food on a bun, so it's no wonder that repulsive load who lost hundreds of pounds of disgusting lard by eating at Subway, and became a spokesman for the chain, slimmed down eating this crap. There's less calories on Subway sandwiches because it's all salad. Of course, the overall health of the aforementioned slob probably sucks and I'd hate to take a look at the Internal Man. Remember folks: as cold cuts are full of all kinds of poisonous crap, they're about the worst stuff you can eat, so beware!!!
