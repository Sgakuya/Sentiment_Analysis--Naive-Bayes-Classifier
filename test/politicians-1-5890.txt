It's frightening and quite depressing to consider this birdbath is one of the shining up-and-coming stars of the GOP. That must be a totally talent-bereft outfit if this is the case. To begin with, this guy is anti-Social Security but represents the state that has the highest number of retirees excepting Florida: you'd think that would be enough for the voters of Pennsylvania, fueled by oldfart wank resentment, to turn this douche out as a One Term Wonder, but the folks out there in the Keystone State obviously have their collective heads up their collective butts. Secondly, he has every right to air his views on homosexuality, but considering how mentally retarded and out-of-touch his perspective is, you either have to write him off as a parochial, antiquated idiot or shiver in your boots over the fact that he's worked his way pretty far up in the Senate in a short period of time. This guy evidently does not believe in equal rights and protections under the law, a cornerstone liberty of our country he swore in his oath of office to protect, which is grounds for impeachment. He also does not feel that Americans have an irrevocable right to privacy, which indicates he's just another conservative autocrat who wants to turn our democratic republic into a fascist state. If you started poking around in his private life, personal finances and business dealings, he'd probably scream like a stuck pig. This is typical of those hypocritical GOPers. The Democratic party of Pennsylvania should locate an electable candidate and raise a pile of money and get the people to get rid of this enemy of the people.
