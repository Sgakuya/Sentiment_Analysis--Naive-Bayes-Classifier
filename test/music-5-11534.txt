From start to finish, this is a GREAT CD. I bought it a couple of years ago and it is the only CD in my collection that has remained in my steady rotation. Drawing on a combination of rock, rap, ska, reggae, and a bunch of other genres, Sublime produces a unique and hard-hitting sound. There are so many great tracks on this CD that it is hard to pick a favorite one. Sublime's music isn't for everyone, however. There are fairly explicit lyrics and uncomfortable subject matter in some of the songs. Nevertheless, if you've heard a couple of the songs which get regular airplay (Santeria, Wrong Way, What I Got) and you've liked them, pick up this CD. You'll love it. It is too bad that this is the last we will see from them.
