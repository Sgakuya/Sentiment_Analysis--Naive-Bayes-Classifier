I don't care who's the latest and greatest band, which movement is in, which one is out, Elvis will always be the King. I'm only 30 years old, but I've always admired all of his tunes from Teddy Bear all the way up to Moody Blue . His music has become the foundation of other artists who have then influenced today's artists. He will always be THE lasting icon in rock and roll today and for years to come. Even though I don't like techno, I like Conversation , it's good to see Elvis incorporated into raves across America.
