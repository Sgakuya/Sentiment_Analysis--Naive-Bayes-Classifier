Pearl Jam is doing what they want to do and it is cool for the fans to grow with this band....I highly doubt anyone who listens to Pearl jam for the music would want to go shoot their dog. So, FLY, i am glad that you didn't like it, and i dont want to see you hanging out at any of the concerts either.
