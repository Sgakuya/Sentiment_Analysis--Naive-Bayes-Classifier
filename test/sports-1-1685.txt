The Boston Red Sox has the second highest payroll in MLB and Boston accuses the Yankees of buying championships? At least the Yankees have gotten it done over and over again but the Red Sox blame not winning a championship for 86 years, despite having all the money and all the amazing talent, on a so-called curse. That is sad. The Boston Red Sox had no excuses for not getting the job done.
