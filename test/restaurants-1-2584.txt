Horrible food. Beef has no beef flavor. Why is it everybody else's hamburger patties are pinkish-brown, and McDonald's are ash gray? Coule the eyeball-binder rumor be true? If they accidently come up with something with any appeal whatsoever, it is removed from the menu by the next time you try to order it. Their fries haven't been that great since they threw out the beef-tallow in favor of the vegetable oil. Awful service. I live in the United States. Is it too much to ask that your order-takers habla ingles?? The worst ad campaign ever thrust upon the public.
