Blockbusters over here are diabolical. The range of films are pathetic and the staff are incompetent. I'd rather watch films that happen to be on TV or pick one of the 100 + DVD's in our collection, or better still go to the cinema rather than face a sullen, mumbling member of staff who takes forever and a day to complete one transaction.
