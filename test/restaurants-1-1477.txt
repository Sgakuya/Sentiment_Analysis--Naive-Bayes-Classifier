Stay away from the store in Cleveland, TX. The burgers are dry, the buns are usually stale and the mayo doesn't taste right. The employees are rude. It is a franchise, not a company store. Corporate needs to step in and fix the problems. Most of the other food is terrible. I will not be going again, ever.
