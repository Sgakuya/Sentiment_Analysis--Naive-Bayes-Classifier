I work there i wish i wasnt an ethical person or i would steal everything i could, i have worked at A e for 2 years now and it still blows. And for A F they blow too for being so damn expensive! A E did not rip anyone off especially not A F thats impossible because how it works legally now adays is if you put a different name on the shirt its yours so get over it, its not even a discussion to be discussed about.
