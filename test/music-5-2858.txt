The Beatles actually released this album before the ground-breaking, revolutionary recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Each song contains its own ingenuity. This album provided us with Strawberry Fields Forever, All You Need is Love, Baby You're a Rich Man, and Penny Lane. The title track to start off the album kicks it off well. Flying and Blue Jay Way are little-known songs that bridge the album together well. Your Mother Should Know is a favorite among adults, I'm sure. Fool on the Hill is a favorite of mine and McCartney's answer, if you will, to Lennon's genius Nowhere Man on Rubber Soul. It is probably the most underrated Beatles album ever released. It ushered in their evolution towards psychedelia. And who could forget one of the greatest songs ever and Lennon's favorite Beatle song, I am the Walrus ? What an album by the greatest band to ever walk the earth.
