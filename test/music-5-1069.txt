This CD is the greatest CD of all. The songs are very moving and I can really relate to what Creed is singing about. The song that really got me was Arms Wide Open. Which the lead singer of Creed, Scott, wrote when he found out about his wife becoming pregnant. I reccomend this CD to everyone of all sex and age. To me, it is like a therapy.
