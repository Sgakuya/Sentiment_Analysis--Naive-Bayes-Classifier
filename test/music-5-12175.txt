 Emotional reminds me of tunes from the great Stevie Wonder. Carl is a wonderful, passionate, soulful singer who deserves a lot more recognition than he is receiving. Some tracks to check out are Emotional , I wish , Hey Now , Come to Me ,....Even the intro is beautiful!! This CD is a must buy. Much success to Carl in the future.
