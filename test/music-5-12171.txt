Carl Thomas is by far one of the most gifted artist I've seen in awhile. He sings with his soul. You can see in his eyes that he sings from experience and gives us his all. I wish him a long and prosporus career. Thank you Carl, for sharing your talent with us, and thank you for inspiring me with your gift, to never give up on my goals of making it.
