Gore a leader??? Leaders unify. Leaders unify. Is what Gore and that group doing now bringing this country together. No. They are keeping up the process of dividing this country into groups to fight against each other. Gore spent his whole campaign pitting one group against the other. Is that leadership? Is that class??Now, if Gore did become president and for some reason he needed the whole country to back him on something, then how could that happen????
