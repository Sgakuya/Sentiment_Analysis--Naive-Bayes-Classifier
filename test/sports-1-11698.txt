If this website enabled someone to post a ZERO rating, THAT'S what I would give Wallace. He has quit! He should just go ahead and make it official and vacate his office. 70-16 AT HOME to Bowling Green is the last straw! Even in the less-than-illustrious history of Temple University football, that's a new low. All he's done the last few weeks is blame everyone except . . . the man in the mirror. The buck stops with YOU, buddy. And I say, so should the BUCK$$$. GET . . . OUT!
