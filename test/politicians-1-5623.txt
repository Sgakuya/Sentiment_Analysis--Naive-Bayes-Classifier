Hillary Clinton, I'm almost speechless. I don't like her, for one she probably has enough botox in her face that's probably worth enough to feed the world. When her idiot husband was elected president, she thought we were electing her to office as well. (hence her comment while Bill Clinton was President, I'm not going to let a few reporters pawing around ruin this administration, WE are the President) Side note: When Bill Clinton had his MULTIPLE affairs, the ONLY single reason she didn't divorce him was for her political career. She is the one person in this entire country who if elected President, which I'm sure she'll either at the last second run in 2004 or wait until 2008, I would flee the country till she is out of office. The Real Truth is right, we are scared of her, BECAUSE SHE'S AN IDIOT! If she does decide at the last second to run in 2004 it's because she doesn't want everyone to have enough time to see what a disaster this country would be if she was elected. If she were ever elected President this country would collapse! PLEASE AMERICAN VOTERS, DO NOT VOTE FOR HER!
