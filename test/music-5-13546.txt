EMINEM is the most talented rap hip-hop artist i have ever heard. I have both of his albums both have lived up to expected standerds, BEST MUSIC EVER!! The lyrics are not only funny but also apply to real life, he says whats on his mind that can be really hard to come accross these days. I say, Em rocks!!! I've been a hardcore fan ever since 'Hi, my name is'.
