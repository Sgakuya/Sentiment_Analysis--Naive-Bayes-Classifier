I was sold a piece a jewelry by a manager at the Westminster Mall, COLO. store that was defective. It was a gift for my husband and she noticed an issue with the clasp when she went to box it up. She mentioned there was an issue and she would fix it. She went to the back room for 5 minutes and then came back up and proceeded to box it up. When I gave my husband the gift-the clasp and one of the gold eyelets that attaches it to the gold bracelet were mangled. Not only was this bracelet defective-the manager went back to fix it-and either made it worse-or decided to sell it to me anyway knowing it was bad. I went to the store the very next day to get a refund and was told that no one in the store could handle it and they could reach no one to tell me. I would have to come back another time. They did offer to repair it and apologized-but there is no way you want to pay for a new product-get a defective one that is sold to you and then wait for a repair. Buyer beware! This is bad news. I also called their home office in Chicago and a very snotty operator told me that no one at the office -none of their executives handle customer issues. She said I must follow the chain of command. I did leave a message for a district manager and a regional manager. The DM called to say if I go back to the store for the third time-I will get a refund. He was apologetic and polite. I will go to the store for the third time tonight and see if I get the credit to my account. Any company that hides their home office VPs from customers is not a company to shop. They also have no way to email them on their web-site. They obviously want to stay sheltered. Not a way to build a good reputation-for their customers or employees.
