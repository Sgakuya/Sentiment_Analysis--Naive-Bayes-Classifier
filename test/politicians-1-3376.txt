A puppet who has alienated many first-world nations (and the wrong third-world ones) thus ensuring that we are in more danger than ever. Only Bush fans believe him- the rest of the world (I said world) knows better. There are no weapons. There were no terrorists in Iraq until we showed up. There is no sound fiscal policy- he spends money like a drunk liberal in his or her wildest dreams. There is no real domestic agenda except to further a pro-Christian anti-anything-else stance. (Still waiting for the constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, right? Still waiting for his magic-bullet to fix Social Security, right?) I wish for a centrist fiscal conservative who can live in a world of freedom instead of this obvious intellectual migdet who has made mistake after obvious mistake. The arrogance on display has been clearly unwarranted by this administration. The island is shrinking, kids, come to the light.
