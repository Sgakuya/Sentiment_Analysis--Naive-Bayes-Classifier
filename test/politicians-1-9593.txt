Please spare me the silliness of the self-created falsehood about James Earl Carter being a Good Man. He isn't and wasn't. His deceitful pettiness and vindictive nature as a politician, President and after the Presidency is amply documented. His career is filled with inept treason at every turn. The amount of misery and oppression generated by his actions and his inaction with the enemies of this country that he supported over the years is enough to qualify his as a Quisling and a hater of this nation. Remember Iran, North Korea, Haiti, Nicaragua and Egypt to name a few. Carter has never met an enemy of this country that he didn t support and defend. Much like Clinton he specialized it the weak lipped petulance that some southern Baptist preachers affect when they wish to pretend virtue. The fact that along he is now a Noble Alumnus along with Arafat, Mandela and a host of other anti-western dregs should give even the densest some pause. As to the comment that he won the cold war only a childish imbecile to subscribe to such tripe. The events of his Presidency doesn't support your tenet: His indecision cleared the way for the Soviets to invade Afghanistan and he never dared to support the anti-soviet Afghans but his did boycott the 1980 Olympics. The purchase of the bankrupted Islamo/Fascist Nasserite Thug Sadat was solely economic transaction that we continue to pay for and not true peace. We should give him to the French they deserve each other.
