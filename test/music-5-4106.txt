This is Springsteen, and still 80s... what's not to love! I have to cite this as one of the BEST Springsteen albums ever! I just love it to death! There is some kind of cozy magic to this one that just blows me away. The sad, romantic songs touch my heart, and the faster tracks (few as they are) show that the E Street Band will always be the best! This album makes me feel so much for Bruce in his first marraige, and hearing his current wife (of 10 years this year!) singing in the background is almost a foreshadowing! I don't know what it is, but All that Heaven Will Allow will always melt my heart...
