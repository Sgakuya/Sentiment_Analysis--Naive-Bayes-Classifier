Frickin' BRILLIANT!!! I listen to this almost exclusively since I bought it in July. One of the best albums I've ever heard by anyone. I wasn't even a Coldplay fan before I got it... I was blown away how fantastic this album is. Don't miss it! Warning Sign and Amsterdam are my favourites, though the entire album rocks.
