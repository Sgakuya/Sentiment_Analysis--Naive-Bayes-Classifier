No, six stars. Seven, eight, NINE! TEN!!!! The best of S G, one of my favorite bands of all time (just under Queen and the Stones) deserves a special rating, as in ten stars for ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! However, Simon and Garfunkel forgot a lot of stuff on this CD. Everything they ever did should be on that CD, because there songs were some of the best in the industry! GO S G!!!
