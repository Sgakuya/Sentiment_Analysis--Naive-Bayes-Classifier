A terribly overrated leader. He steered the country in the wrong direction in Cuba, southeast Asia, and in many ways through his domestic policies. Many of his ideals were admirable but ideals are not action. His personal arrogance and sexual habits were shameful. Obviuosly, he did not ask what he could do for his country before he asked what his country could do for his private entertainment.
