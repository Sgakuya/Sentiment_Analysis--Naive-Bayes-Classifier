I went to a new Tim Hortons in Redcliff, Alberts. I am a Tim Hortons fan buys all my doughnets and coffee there butttttttt since this new one opened up i have gone there 4 times and 3 different times they have ran out of things like for eg the first time they ran out of hot chocolate like what Tim Hortons runs out of Hot Chocolate, then i went there and they were out of chocolate chip muffins and then i went the last time and they ran out of white bread. Well i think it is time to try another place i am sooooooo mad i cannot even tell you. Tim Hortons is going down as bad as Mcdonalds.
