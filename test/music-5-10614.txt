I like every song! Wow! Talk about rare. I hate it when I buy a cd and get just one good song, a could have been good song, and a bunch of useless noise! I stopped buying CD's for that reason. But I got into a music spurt and purchased Avril's CD along with a few others and I was blown away! I really like every song! And Her CD was the only one in the bunch truly impressed me.
