About 20 years before their time. This is groundbreaking, fantastic, unique music, and it brings back a lot of good memories - and is just as good today as it was back then. Add It Up used to get me about as riled up as is possible with music, and my first employer may still have the words from Kiss Off written on its wall as a parting gift from me (yes, i had some issues).
