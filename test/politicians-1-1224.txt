Yassar Arafat is a pig. I don t mean to wound the feelings of all the swine out there, but Arafat is pathetic, and so also are his followers. He sends in the children to do his dirty work, gets them killed, and then sends the parents of the slain cash. If he were a man, he would end the massacre of the innocent in his goal to send all the Jews into the sea. If he were a man, he would negotiate in good faith with a people who want peace. If he were human, he would have compassion for his own people. He cannot have sympathy for his people if he allows them to live in such filth. All of Palestine looked much like the West Bank and Gaza prior to 1948, and now Mr. Arafat wishes to return Israel to the pristine pigsty he and his fellow comrades wallow in today. As I said at the beginning.
