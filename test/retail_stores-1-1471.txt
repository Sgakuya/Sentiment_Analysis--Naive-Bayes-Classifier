Ladies, if you are foolish enough to shop at Saks in LA, PLEASE watch out for the store personnell, if they think you are a Jewish B***ch from Beverly Hills it might be frame-up time. And they are always rude and stuck up, one wonders why people who have such a problem waiting on others bother to get jobs like that. :-)
