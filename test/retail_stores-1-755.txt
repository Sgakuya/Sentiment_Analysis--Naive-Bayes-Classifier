Old Navy, owned by the Gap Inc., which also includes Banana Republic, offers cheap clothing not necessarily because it's low quality but because it's made by child labor and marginalized women in developing countries that are paid unfaily (by their country's standards), are not unionized, and undergo harsh working conditions (globalization at its finest, no?). I've worked in the appearal industry for 5 years, so, have done extensive research on thus subject. Even some of The Gap Inc.'s internal management agrees with these accusations.
