I really like this bands sound.The Trip-Hop genre has really caught my intrest over the years. Teardrop is one of my all-time favorite songs. Man next Door , Dissolved Girl and Inerita Creeps are the best songs though. The cover art is very neat too. If you just want a simple CD to relax to, then Mezzanine is for you.
