If you are a true fan of music O.K. Computer is for you. Its innovative sound and dark, paranoid lyrics make it one of the best of the 90's. Also check out The Bends, Kid A, and Amesiac and notice Radiohead's drastic changes as artists. They are all instant classics. Just a question; with the abundance of 5 star ratings why does this album only get a 2.97 rating? And WHY is Ricky Martin rated ahead of Radiohead?
