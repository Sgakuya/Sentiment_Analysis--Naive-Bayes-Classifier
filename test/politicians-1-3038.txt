I am so sick of pinhead liberals like Canadasucks and Scarlett feather talking about peace and prosperity under Clinton. Peace what peace? You liberals seem to forget that in 1993 under Clinton the World Trade Center was bombed by Islamic Terrorists. Also under Clinton the USS Cole was bombed, several American embassies were bombed, we attacked Yugoslavia and Bosnia, and of course as Canadasucks so graciously mentioned the Oklahoma city bombing. Economic prosperity? THis of course was all Clinton's doing huh? BZZZZZ! Wrong it's called the internet boom. The high tech/internet market exploded and gave us the economic prosperity not Clinton. And when the high tech/internet sector bubble burst while Clinton was still in office we started losing jobs and the economy turned south and liberals blamed of course Geroge Bush. Clinton just happened to be in the right place at the right time during the .com boom and you liberal pinheads call Clinton an economic genius but not one of you can actually explain in detail exactly what Clinton did while he was in office to give us the so called economic prosperity. I dare Canadasucks or Scarlettfeather to submit a new post explaining in detail exactly what Clinton did that was directly responsible for the economic properity we had in the 1990's. I dare ya. You probably won't do that though. In typical ignorant liberal fashion you will probably reply to my challenge by saying something like I could explain it you, but conservative republicans are too stupid to understand the brilliant economic mind of Bill Clinton and other liberals so I won't even waste my time. Your bullpoop liberal smug intellectual superiority complex is laughable. If liberals and Democrats are so intellectually superior to conservatives and Democrats why did Kerry lose? Why is there a republican Congress?
