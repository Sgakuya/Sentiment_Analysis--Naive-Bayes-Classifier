I have to laugh at these people that say that you need to stand behind your president, it is the American thing to do . No! You stand behind your country. The president is only a man, he is not your country. As a Canadian I was a little concerned at the fact that we would not become involved in the Iraq war, even though I thought that the President wasn't really making a good arguement for war. But now, I am glad that our PM kept us out of it. I have always stood by my first impression of Mr. Bush, that he is a war monger, an elitist, money and power hungry and oil hungry!!
