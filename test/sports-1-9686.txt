i'm sick of dennisrodman (below), he sounded just like a kindegarten kid. BULLS are contender ??? thank god they're in the eastern conference; more forgiving conference. who's their go to guy now ? crawford ? chandler? curry ? in the past they get rid of BRAND, ARTEST, MILLER, ROSE (3 of them were allstars). what can you expect ? (in JORDAN era, bulls are the greatest, and has the greatest fans) but NOW ????
