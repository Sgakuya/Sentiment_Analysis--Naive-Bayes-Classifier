I, too, have a problem with someone who takes on the title of reverend and wishes to be addressed as such, telling that it is a woman's right to choose. I also have a problem, since I live in Palm Beach County...having him come here to cause descention and confusion and stirring the people up to a point where there may be disorder and fighting. I am a Christian and I think it would be a better thing if Mr. Jackson would lead prayers instead of riots.Prayers do much more than secular rhetoric. I believe Mr. Jackson should take the Reverend part off his name..it certainly does not show an example of Christ and HE is the only one who should be called Reverend. Let go, Mr. Jackson and go back to what God called you to do...whatever that is.
