Tonight I had the Double Dutch Chocolate ice cream with a mix-in of Peppermint Patties. The sugar cone tasted stale and flat. The ice cream flavor was pale. The candy chunks were large and so not well mixed around. Worst of all, this ice cream has a really greasy mouth feel. This last attribute makes it the WORST ice cream I've ever tasted.
