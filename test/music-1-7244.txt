This song is about a somewhat cliche topic. I think a lot of people say, That's life, quit whining. It comes off as embarrassingly sincere, and I want to hide my eyes out of embarrassment for them when I see it. The video didn't inspire compassion or connection with the band or song, just a sad contempt that should have been left for the album without a video. It reminds people of childhood traumas, which they may see as accurately reflected in the video, they'd rather not identify with it and whine about a pain that they want to believe that they are over .
