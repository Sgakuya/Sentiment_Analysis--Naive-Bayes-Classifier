You know the Bengals have been a laughingstock for a long time when their fans are getting excited that they are 3-5. I mean most other teams would start getting ready for the draft with a record like that. Carson Palmer is praying to the gods that John Klitna can somehow finish the year with this crapfest joke of a team. You know he hopes never to start for these idiots. Peter Warrick is so overrated and nobody cares about him. The smartest guy on this team is Corey Dillon, who wants to get traded. 3-5 doesn't make his nipples hard and start thining Super Bowl like the rest of the people in cold and windy Cincinnati.
