Jesse Jackson notice REV is missing has had a child OUT of wedlock, why should that surprise me? as far as Rev according to The Bible he cannot minister, be a pastor etc. his reputation is marred. So according to Biblical LAw he has to drop the Reverend label not that he ever diserved the honor to begin with... now he has to cause trouble and hatred as a common citizen.
