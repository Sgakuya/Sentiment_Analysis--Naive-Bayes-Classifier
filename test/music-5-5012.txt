It took me a long, long time to warm up to Alison Krauss's voice, after years of listening to powerhouse voices like Tricia Yearwood, Martina McBride, and Natalie Maines. But to not appreciate Alison's delicate soprano is to completely miss the point. I'm so glad I gave her a chance because this CD is now one of my all-time favorites. I love the mixture of bluegrass with some of the more radio friendly country sounds. I can't wait to experience their sound live.
