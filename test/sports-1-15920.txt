Overrated like no player in NFL history. Take him away from a team that throws screen passes 50% of the time and has a dominating defense and you would have watched this guy crumble right out of football in less time than it took to draft him (however long 6 rounds last). The proof is in the following points: 1. Charlie Weis could make my grandma look good in the QB position. His system is as QB friendly as you can get, witness the amazing transformation of Brady Quinn at ND. I'm an ND fan, but come on, Quinn is nowhere near as good as Charlie is making him look....same with T.Brady. 2. The whole "Poise" and "cool under pressure" hype is a bunch of b.s. Brady's quarterback rating drops a whopping 18 points (as of this past Friday 97 to 79) when he's blitzed. Just watch his games, if there's pressure on him, at all, watch him throw it way over his receiver's head or into the ground, he can't handle it. Again, without that defense and a LOAD of 1-2 yard screen passes, we're not even talking about this guy. On any other team, he'd be out of football by now...long gone.
