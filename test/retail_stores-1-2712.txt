Rock bottom of the barrel when it comes to service--it's been three months, I'm still without a kitchen--they CANT get the order right! I'm about to pull my hair out! don't go to lowes for kitchen remake--designer doesn't know left from right or up from down--manager failed us and didn't reorder or correct THEIR error--it's nuts. Over a dozen major errors and we're still without a kitchen!
