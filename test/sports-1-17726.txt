It's fricking funny how a good team led by a bad-ass q.b. can regress into a 1-7 joke led by some 5th-string middle school guy named Shit Shittner or something when the other useless tool, Doug Johnson, goes down or is pulled because he sucks so bad. Wow what a difference Peerless Price has made on this offense. I think we found out he has plenty of peers... called DEFENSIVE BACKS. Poor old Dan Reeves will probably need yet another bypass after this humiliating season. Michael Vick will probably stay 'injured' until he gets traded to a real team with a chance to win more than one game per year.
