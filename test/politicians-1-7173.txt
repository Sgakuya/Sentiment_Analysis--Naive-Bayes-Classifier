Jesse Jackson is probably doing more to cripple the African-American culture than any other individual. He offers no fresh solutions to their plight; instead, he merely encourages them to go along with whatever new welfare/affirmative-action program the Democrats are pushing. People don't seem to realize that all this crap he keeps trying to push (on his own people, for God's sake!), isn't going to help them at all. It's just going to enslave them in a culture of hopelessness and dependence on the government. People like Jesse Jackson are destroying the African-American culture because they don't believe that they are a people strong enough to stand on their own collective feet and compete with the white race, economoically or intellectually.
