Years ago I bought CD's there often, I never go now. The store is way too noisy with all the radio equipment blaring (which the employees do nothing about.) The last time I went, one of the employees who apparently hadn't met his quota, tried to high pressure me into getting one of their credit cards. Good prices or not, I won't be going back.
