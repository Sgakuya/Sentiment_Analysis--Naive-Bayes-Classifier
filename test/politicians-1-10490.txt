In terms of leadership, George W. Bush has not inspired me at all. When he could not capture Bin Laden as promised, he decided to focus on Saddam Hussein in Iraq as grand prize number 2. He has yet to face the fact that the Middle East does not want Democracy or our American way of life. War with Iraq is not the answer, not when you have allies like France and Germany who sale weapons of mass destruction to these nations. His economic policy as well as his foreign policy stink, and have no direction. The American economy is suffering not because of 911, but because of LACK OF LEADERSHIP.
