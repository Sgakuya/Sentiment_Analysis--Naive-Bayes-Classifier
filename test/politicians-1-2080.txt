How is it that a person can turn the state budget from a $10 billion dollar surplus to a $40 BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT (The BIGGEST state deficit in U.S. history)!? He has been able to spend about $50 million dollars in the couple years he's been in office. What does hehave to show for it: A crushing drain on the state power supply that has caused blackouts to about a third of the state's population (deregulation...what a BRIGHT idea), the current worst rated state educational system in the U.S. (and I thought Florida would get that title), one of, if not, the highest taxed state in the country (AND THEY HAVE A DEFICIT!?), and the list goes on like this. Whether or not it's because of republicans that started a petition for a recall, it is clear that Davis must leave office for the good of the state. Otherwise, he'll turn California into the insane world that was portrayed in Escape From L.A. (I actually would not doubt it).
