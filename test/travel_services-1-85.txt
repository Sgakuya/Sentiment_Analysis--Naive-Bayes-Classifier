Southwest has to be the worst of the worst. Horrible lines at every turn, their cattle call seating is a pain in the you-know-what, their flights are unreliable and ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS overbooked. Unfortunately, they have some killer deals on airfare....but at what a price! THE WORST air travel I have ever used every single time I have been forced to use them. I try to avoid at all cost!
