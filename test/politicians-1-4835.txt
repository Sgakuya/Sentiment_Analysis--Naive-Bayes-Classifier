Rumsfeld should have his name changed to Rumpsfeld. He is exactly as coined, an asshole. He has no regard for the troops that are working for hime. Telling them that dying is part of war and that additional armor would not help them anyway. He should be out there walking around as is and see if he wish that he had retracted his statement. Rumsfeld has his head up Bush's ass like others in Bush's administration.
