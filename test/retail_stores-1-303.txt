I received a camisole for my birthday that was too small. They didn't have another in my size, couldn't order one, and didn't know the catalogue number. They then refused to give me cash and gave me a gift certificate instead. Added to that I find out a sweater I ordered from them is backordered for a month. Questions I sent to the online contact department went unanwsered. Teh final straw was when I got the sweater two weeks late. They need to improve their service. Especially for the prices.
