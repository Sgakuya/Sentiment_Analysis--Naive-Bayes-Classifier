Mr. Jackson has shown his true colors (and they ain't rainbow) when he blew his cool by suggesting that he would incite riots if his choice for president were not honored by the Supreme Court. What a phony this guy is! Probably the most divisive politician(?) on the planet. He has done much more harm to racial unity than he has ever done to help it. A Class-A opportunist, he shows up like a bad penny everytime he thinks he can make it on TV. A sham! If there were minus-star ratings, he would earn a couple!
