I don't care if OJ was a talented player. He is still a big creep. For years, he used his wife as a punching bag. Than he killed Nicole and her friend. The stupid jury voted Not guilty because his high-price lawyer used the race card. I agree with Abichara. The juice has done nothing positive for the black community. Right now, he is playing golf or spending time with his bimbos.
