It is time to step down Mr. Byrd, way past time!He already has half the bridges, highways and hospitals in the state named after him for crying out loud!When he speaks he utters dull statements that usually do not make any sense.Again, do our country some good and retire, please!Update:It is funny how the minorities back the democrat party for their supposed fighting for civil rights and racial equality, when one of the leaders(Byrd)is a former KKK member.Shows the ignorance of most democrats.
