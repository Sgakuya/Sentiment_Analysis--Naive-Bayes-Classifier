Al, I've got one thing to say Twiwanna Brawley! Remember how you defended this girl without ever asking her if she was telling the truth? I lived in New York at that time and I will never forget the lies and the rallies and the boycotts, the way you moved people to anger, against whites, because this girl didn't want to tell her parents she had been out catting around! You give people a bad name!
