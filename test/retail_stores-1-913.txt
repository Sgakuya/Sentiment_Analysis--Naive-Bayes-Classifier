Just had to join in the pile-on here. Between their sale of thongs for kids, racist T-shirts, and their legion of mindless suburban teenage devotees, this store represents everything wrong with the corporate retail industry. I can understand buying slightly ripped jeans, but what's with the pair I saw in the window of an A&F in an L.A. mall, that looked like a lawnmower ran over them? And why do they play thumping house music in their stores? It doesn't go with their frat-house image at all. Weird.
