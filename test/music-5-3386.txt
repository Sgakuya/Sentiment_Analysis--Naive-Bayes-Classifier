Super album! They were way ahead of their time on this one. If I heard this album today not knowing Pink Floyd, I would've thought it was a new album. And that Wizard of Oz thing? How genius was that?!? Here's what you do, after the 3rd roar from the MGM lion. Press play from the beginning of Dark Side and be prepared to be mesmerized!
