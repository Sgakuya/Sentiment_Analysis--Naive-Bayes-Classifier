This brutal excuse of a band is lucky the ratings don't go any lower than 1. This album is the biggest pile of trash forced down the publics throat in absolute years!!! If we aren't forced by MTV to listen to boy band garbage this and boy band garbage that , we are forced to listen to the inane whining of Destiny's child, Brittany Spears, or Cristina whats her name. Give me a break!!!!!!!!!!
