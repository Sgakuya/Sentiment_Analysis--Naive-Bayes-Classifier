The Eagles' first compilation, Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) (released in 1976), covers the band's most popular singles from their first four releases (ie Take It Easy, Witchy Woman, Lyin' Eyes, Already Gone, Desperado, One Of These Nights, Tequila Sunrise, Take It To The Limit, Peaceful Easy Feeling, and Best Of My Love). In other words, the singles off of their last two full-length releases are not included (eg Hotel California, New Kid In Town, Life In The Fast Lane, The Long Run, I Can't Tell You Why, and Heartache Tonight). These substantial omissions mean that some casual fans looking for a one complete retrospective may be more satisfied with The Very Best Of The Eagles (2003) which includes the hits from all the band's full-length efforts plus some great deeper cuts (eg James Dean, The Sad Caf√©, In The City, and Those Shoes). Nevertheless, in my opinion, no greatest hits package should be on this list as a compilation cannot really be compared to regular releases and does not represent the concept of a full-length effort.
