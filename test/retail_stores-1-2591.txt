Worst service ever by a Price Chopper store. Cashiers were polite and helpful. However, I witness a problem when a cashier asked for help and the store manager yelled at her in front of me. The cashier was running a easy scan four registers and informed me that she had training on the system. The store mangager came over and yelled at her due to the fact that she was not helping other customers. She could not help other patrons until she settled the problems. This was very disturbing and should not be subjected to any employee
