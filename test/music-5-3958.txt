I find a lot of Paul Simon's songs to be terribly trite and maudlin, so that I can't get swept away in his pretty melodies without putting it in the 'guilty pleasure' category. But the entire Graceland album is absolutely remarkable -- from the inspired musicianship (this is the album where South African artists appear on most of the tracks and then Los Lobos on another two) and unlikely song hooks, to his intimate vocals and fascinating lyrics. The words often use tiny details ( As if I'd never noticed the way the brushed her hair from her forehead ) to illuminate a character or situation that's just uncommon in most pop music. You need to have closed yourself off intentionally -- in allegiance to an alternative aesthetic -- to not be seduced by the Graceland album.
