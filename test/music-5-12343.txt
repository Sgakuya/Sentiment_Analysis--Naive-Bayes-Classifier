MS.PRICE YOU'RE A BAD DIVA! i HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SING WITH YOU AT MONTANA ON 11TH AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW I COULD BARELY COMPOSE MYSELF. MY ADMIRATION FOR YOUR GIFT AND YOUR EXTRAORDINARY USE OF IT CAN ALMOST CAUSE PARALYSIS. I LOVE YOUR VOICE, YOUR WORK ETHIC, AND YOUR LOVE FOR OUR FATHER, GIRL I HEAR IT IN YOUR LAST CUT! I TOO KNOW WHO HOLDS MY FUTURE! I WISH YOU THE BEST. OH YEAH, THAT WAS A DIFFERENT STAR SPANGLED BANNER GIRL, AND YOU MUST BE COMMENDED FOR YOUR EFFORTS AS A WRITER.
