Jethro Tull is among the best band in all of Rock. This is their signature album. They are among the most creative, adventurous bands out there. Soaring flute passages are interwoven with solid hard giutar leads. It's deceptively infectious initially, but utterly complex as rock/pop goes. Anyone interested in Jethro Tull should grab this collection.
