Lawyers and judges lay the founndation with mud and straw. I can see how the decay works. Object of them are to get gain; and they gain according to their employ. The Rev. Louis Jackson lays traps and snares to pervert the ways of the republic. I still hope we are governed by laws instead of by kings, or dictators in modern parlance. I guess we now have the 3 stooges back. Lawyers,judge and the Rev. Louis Jackson.
