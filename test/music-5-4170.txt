Great album from the greates three member band ever. Important to remember when the Police were seemingly make all this great music, Sting and And could barely stand each other yet they still managed to set the standard. Much of there stuff is wrongly mixed in with a lot of the crap that popped up in the 80's but time has proven this bands true talent.
