DO NOT BUY THIS CD! If you have, save yourself now and throw it away. Not only are the songs on it your basic blonde/bubble gum pop that only the 12 and under set can actually appreciate, some of the songs on it aren't even the same versions that are played on the radio (and trust me, the original versions of the songs they did remix are even worse than the ones on air).
