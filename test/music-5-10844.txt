This is such a great cd. Usually there are one or two songs that I do not like on a cd, but this one is diffrent, I like ll the songs. After I got it I could not take it out of my cd player, and I would listen to it every chance I got. The lyrics are so great and they deal with diffrent issues you can relate to. I highly suggest you go out and buy it!
