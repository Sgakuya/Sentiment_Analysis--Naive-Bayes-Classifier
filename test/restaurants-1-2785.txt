Just tried the Hardees NEW Big Chicken Fillet. What a hunk of junk! Whoever approved this sandwich should be fired! Pre-formed breaded chicken tastes like cardboard. Same as McDonalds. ATTN: All fast food businesses----if you can't equal or surpass Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich, then don't bother with the chicken sandwich. Wendy's uses real chicken, I don't know what that garbage was in the Hardees sandwich.
