I was traveling from DC to Des Moines and was checking my baggage in 8 hours early and was offered the chance to get on an earlier plane. I accepted the chance and arrived in Des Moines around 3PM with only 2 of my 4 bags. The baggage attendant for TWA was rude and refused to deliver my bags to Ames Iowa where I live. I called Customer Service and the CSR was also insulting and talked down to me. I asked whatever happened to the customer always being right and he informed me that was a McDonald's policy, not TWA's. I guess that is why another airling bought them and they will soon go out of business. The MD-80 planes they fly are old looking and dirty. The seats are so narrow that you feel cramped. They advertise about all this space but the only space you will find is the gap in your wallet after you pay for their service. I would recommend another airline if you can. This airline has no real concept of customer service and is only interested in getting your money.
