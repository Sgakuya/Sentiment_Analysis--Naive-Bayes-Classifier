I am a minister and I have to say that you do not resemble a minister.You took on the name Reverend before you were a preacher. (If you indeed preach)(God's word).You cause so much trouble wherever you go.You keep racism alive for your personal gain not to help minorities.Instead of working to defame Bush you should do like the Bible says to pray for our leaders I wish the minorities could see you for what you are.But until they do, I guess you wont have to get a real job.YOU WILL NEVER BE A MARTIN L. KING because he actually cared for the people unlike you.I believe in time of ML King you would have run for cover.I grew up in a very poor section of town.I lived in low income apartments with majority of my neighbors were black.I have never been racist,but according to you since I am white then I have to be racist. That is an insult and I dont like it and I dont like your agenda.I love all races.It makes God's plan complete. I believe people would forget about race barriers if you would stop reminding people of them.I will pray for you because I believe you are on a fast track to a bad fate.
