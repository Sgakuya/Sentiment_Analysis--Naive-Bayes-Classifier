This is one of the best Hip Hop albums produced in the last 15 years. It's beautiful, a rough cut, perfectly defined. Q-tip comes clean while still connecting through abstract metaphors with his co-workers. Beats are phat while using Cherokee's skills on Technics and Vastecs. This album is still a classic, from what's starting to be old school.
