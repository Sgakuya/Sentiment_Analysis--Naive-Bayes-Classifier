You know, it seems as though everyone the Bush/Rove machine have managed to place in various high profile offices is solely to please and pander to their far right evangelical base. What about us moderate protestants? Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson don't speak for us....and neither does Bush or Ashcroft. John Ashcroft has run amock since 9/11. What's happened to 'due process?' And now, Bush and Ashcroft have the right to jail any American citizen for an indefinite period of time simply by claiming they are an enemy combant. Who determines what actions are classified as 'enemy combatant?' Is my speaking out against the Bush Administartion enough to qualify me as an 'enemy combatant?' Bush and Ashcroft pose a higher risk to my freedoms and way of life than Saddam Hussein does....
