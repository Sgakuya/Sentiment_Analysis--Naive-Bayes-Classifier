What a horrible experience! After being delayed at the airport for more than 4 hours, due to weather (the airlines excuse for non-refundable delays ... the weather was PERFECT all day at both departing and arrival locations), MY LUGGAGE DIDN'T MAKE IT! Not only did they have more than 1.5 hours to tranfer the luggage at the connection flight, but when I arrived they said, It might come in sometime tomorrow between 2 am and 12 noon. We don't deliver any more, you will have to come back to the airport to retrieve your luggage. I have a 10am meeting and they will do NOTHING to help, but everything to SCREW IT UP! DELTA really does live up to its reputation of being a horrible airline, it will soon follow in the footsteps of its other horrible predecessors and good riddance!
