I live on the border of Mexico, therefore I know what true Mexican food should taste like. Taco Bell is a far cry from authentic. Other than that, I hate to burst other's bubbles out there... but the two Taco Bells in our town were found to have human feces in their hamburger... as reported by our lovely local health inspectors. No wonder I used to kiddingly call them Taco Smell . Ummm... yuk...
