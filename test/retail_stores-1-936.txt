The Abercrombie for kids in our mall was recently touting halter tops and obscene looking low-risers in the store windows. I'd have a problem wearing this myself back when I was 19, but targeting this slut-fest at kids is gross. Not to mention the stuff is overpriced and perpetuates the label conscious snobbery among middle-class wanna be's.
