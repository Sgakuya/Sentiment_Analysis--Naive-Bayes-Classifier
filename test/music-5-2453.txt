Even after Sgt. Pepper, this is still considered THE modern-pop masterpiece, and also considered one of the greatest albums ever made. (And I agree fully.) I used to hate the Beatles too before I really listened to them, now I think they were really brilliant songwriters. Even the worst producer on EARTH wouldn't stop this kind of genius from shining through.
