Too little, too late. Could've been the man to lead Democrats in 1992. He wasn't the man to lead Democrats in 2004. He has some core principles, most notably supporting labor unions, but like Al Gore, Gephardt had a pro-life, pro-gun voting record that was abandoned once he became a mainstream Democrat. He didn't have a positive message during his campaign, and came off more gloom and doom than the other candidates. Due to his personality, I don't think it was coincidental that he was the first one who exited the race.
