I have to laugh, I see we have the 7 dwarfs all giving out their ratings of 1 star each... Hi Ho, Hi Ho and away they go, poor babies must have some real problems... Clay is a true MAN in every sense of the word and is a great artist.. His concerts are for everyone young and old and everyone has a great time... He is a true talent and a man with a great heart that truly cares for others less fortunate.. There is not enough time to list all that he has done for others... To bad it isn't contagious for some who have rated him..
