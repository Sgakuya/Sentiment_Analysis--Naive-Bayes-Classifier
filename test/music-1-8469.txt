SONG THIEF! You all are aware, I'm sure that the bassline used in this song and music video was STOLEN from a much worthier group! Okay - let me get this straight. Idiot. Camera focuses on idiot. Idiot jumps around and pretends to be singing. WOW! What a stroke of genius! Gimme a break, people. What happened to real music videos? (I also must not decline to mention that Queen and Bowie received no credit for their stolen bassline.) Take care, everyone!
