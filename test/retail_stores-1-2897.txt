My fiance had purchased my engagement ring at a Whitehall location in Cincinnati Ohio. We were relocating to Virginia and took the ring into the Greenbriar Mall location in Chesapeake Virginia 3 days after purchase to have it sized (and I noticed that the diamonds only seemed to glisten in the sun- hmm... they said they would clean it and it would shine). We realized the ring was on sale and we asked for the difference in the original vs the sales price. We were told that Whithall could not do that because we did not purchase it from that location. We were then told we had to return the ring to them and buy their ring (mind you, it's the same exact ring) to get the sale price. In addition, they tried to sell us another ring and band that was more expensive than what we had. We spent over 2 hours in the store going back and forth because they did not want to exchange our ring and give the sale price. Also we were told it would take a week to have the rings sized. We went back to retrieve the rings and was told to come back again because they had broken the key off in the vault. We came back yet again and was informed that we had to come back the next day because the locksmith was not going to make a trip there that day. We came back once more to pick up the rings- they told us we had the rings not them. By this time I was so furious, we demanded our money back because it was way less than 30 days to receive a full refund which was/is their policy. The 2 sales idiots told us we could not get our money back because we did not have a warranty and the ring which they still held in their possession had been sized...luckily for us we had purchased the warranty! They came up with excuse after excuse trying not to return our money in full. By that time I was ready to hit the roof,ring someone's neck!!! and give the sale reps a reason to call security on me...At last, a couple hours later, we got our full refund. WARNING...DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM WHITEHALL.
