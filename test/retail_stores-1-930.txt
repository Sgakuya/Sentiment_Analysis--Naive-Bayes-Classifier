Did you know that their choice of colors does not include black? Also it seems that they are racist..do you ever see any models in their advertisments (even staffs) that are asians? hispanic? black? Hello, where is the minority people? So basically to even it out, its like that they dont need to show minority in their advertisements, but more sex appeal instead! Isn't America most represented of being diverse?
