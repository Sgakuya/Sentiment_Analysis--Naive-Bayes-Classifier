I've been encountered by numerous Beatles compilations in my life, and all of them good I might add, but the 1 album is THE essential hits project, especially for the Generation Y crowd who are curious about a little band from Liverpool who changed the world of rock and roll once upon a time. That's why I was very pleased to see it hit #1 for a few weeks. The album perfectly displays, in chronological order, how their sound matured from the Meet The Beatles sessions all the way up to Let It Be . A great CD!
