Britney is a great singer, has great songs, is really pretty, has a great body, is close to her family, etc.!! NOW, CAN I ASK, HOW IS SHE A BAD ROLE MODEL??? A LOT OF SINGERS OUT THERE NOWADAYS(LIKE EMINEM!) SUPPORT VIOLENCE AND HATRED TOWARDS WOMEN... does britney do ANY of those? NO! she is a good role model! she has a wonderful body, so she can't show it off? it's not like she's singing NAKED! many teenage girls i know also dress with barely nothin on, britney is NOT the only one! Personally if i had a body like that i would dress the same way! Go Brit, and keep up the good work!
