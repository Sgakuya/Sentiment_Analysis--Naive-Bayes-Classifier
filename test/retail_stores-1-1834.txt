I've had the great misfortune to have been employed by Wal-mart for a summer. I unloaded the semi trailer full of merchandise every morning at 3:00 and worked until 1:00 PM. Horrible job. What really knocked my rating down, though, is the fact that Wal-mart employees are sort of a cult. Every morning, the regular employees would get together for a team-meeting where the store manager would tell them how much they sold yesterday and what their goals were for the next day. People ate it up and actually *cheered* their co-workers for their good work, or (god-forbid) to do better. Come on, guys! Let's really get at 'em today! Let's beat that goal! And the rest would reply with earnest, enthusiastic wahoos or something to that effect. To top it all off, they'd finish with a cheer. The manager would yell give me a W! Give me an A! Give me an L! and so on, and they'd do it, and then he'd go What's it spell? ... WAL-MART! Louder! WALMART! Who's number one?? OUR CUSTOMERS!! I'm serious. Employees had real gold Wal-Mart rings. And I don't mean rings purchased at the store, I mean gold rings that say Wal-Mart ON them. Insanity. Pure insanity. I'm lucky to have gotten out of there without getting the customary lobotomy.
