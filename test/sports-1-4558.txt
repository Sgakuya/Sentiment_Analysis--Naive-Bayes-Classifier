Rarely do I take exception to one of your comments Solenoid DH, but as an IU grad I have to give my 2 cents on this one. If Knight was setup he did it to himself - over a looooong period of borderline and often sanctioned psychotic behavior. The fact that he was NOT kicked out of IU sooner and his childish tantrums overlooked for way too long has probably done more long lasting psychological harm to his players than a not so great grade on their math exam. Good riddance to bad rubbish!
