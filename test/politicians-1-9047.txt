I've never been a Clinton fan and never could be the reasons are many and most have been more than covered here on RIA. But I do think his personal life and sexual problems should have been left out of the circus we call the media for all our sakes. It seems that anytime a trial or legal action becomes both national and international entertainment the chances of justice prevailing becomes slim to none (i.e., the OJ trial). Right, wrong or just plain mean spirited, Clinton s enemies were many and he was bound to be a target at one point or another for valid or invalid reasons. As far as I m concerned, Clinton s enemies were as despicable as anything he did because, in the end, they only proved they were willing to stoop to any depth and sacrifice even the common decency they claimed to hold so dear in an attempt to nail him. I would like to say to these people; the end, my selectively pious friends, does NOT justify the means no matter how much you wish it would. The Clinton hunters , whoever they were, were simply jerks of a different philosophy, but jerks just the same. And, in their underhanded way, they defrauded the American public in a manner that was just as ugly as Clinton s various escapades. My viewpoint now is that as disgusting as many things concerning those years appeared to be they were probably no more disgusting than what was going on in the other camps. Their actions and Clinton s set a lot of new precedents which now leads me to believe that Mr. Clinton was just a harbinger of worse things to come and I m not pointing my finger at exclusively Democrats OR Republicans.
