I made a reservation for a one way truck rental on 5/4/2005. The reservation was for 7/31. One week before the trip my reservation had already been deleted. I called the 800 number and was told that it was fixed. On the day that I went to pick up the truck, my reservation had again been cancelled. I was in flames. My original quote of $254.00 had jumped up to $550.00. Not happy. Three hours later I walked away with a $300.00 rental. Had to rush to L.A. and to make my plane back to Seattle on time. When I called the 800 number to make a formal complaint, I was continuously blown off. I contacted my lawyer. I will continue to go above and beyond my means to slander Budget Rental.
