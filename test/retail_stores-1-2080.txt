i used to but all my electronics and dvd's there until they butchered the installation of my car stereo and i had to waste my vacation trying to get it fixed. they took no responsibility, so i stopped going there. since that time, they have probably lost about $15,000 in business from me. should change their name to circuit shi$ty.
