Too bad there isn't a lower rating for an admitted racist. This clown was a former Southern Democrat-turned-Dixiecrat-turned-Republican in 1954 because he couldn't stomach the radical notion of allowing black people to be treated as--gasp!---human beings. States' rights? Come on, people! That's nothing more than a misnomer for allowing oneself to express bigoted sentiments without feeling guilty, under the guise of free speech and protecting oneself from that bug-a-boo, the federal government. Jesse Helms is a moderate compared with this yokel. This exalted South Carolinian was born December 5, 1902 in hardscrabble South Carolina backwoods country. (Edgecombe County, for all you Strominator buffs.) I thought you had to be dead to have a stamp---or, in S.T.'s case, a lake---named after you. How the good Palmetto State people could keep electing this buffoon to represent them and all that he exemplifies mystifies me. I suppose when the Strominator passes on to that great ol' Winn-Dixie in the sky, he'll be able to scarf down all the Royal Crowns and Moon Pies he wants. God bless Strom, and God help America!
