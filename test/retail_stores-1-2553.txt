Try working at Albertsons! You get the inside scope on how terribel it is. They overcharge on the prices while advertising that they are the cheapest around. 1 to 2 registers open at a time with no manager to be found. Then they cheat their employees out of earned pay and vacation. Albertsons is a collection of cheap, greedy rich bastards.
