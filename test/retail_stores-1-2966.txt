Stay away from Kay. In the last year I have bought 2 diamond earings a aquamarine ring, a wedding band, one carot engagement band, and a mens wedding band. Everything but the earings had to be returned and fixed. Center stone diamond cracked on engagement band. Loose diamonds in all others after having for 3 weeks. My wife and I have been married for two months and had our rings for 4 weeks and do not have them now. Hopefully not all K Jewlers are as bad as Lansing Mall Michgian and Meridian Mall Michigan. I wouldn't go to these or their partner store Jarod's but its your time and money.
