McCain is a sellout for the liberal lobby pretending to be a republican. As far as I am concerned, those who claim baby murder, sodomy and gun control as Constitutional while sporting the (R) for their political affiliation are mere traitors to the American people and our free republic. McCain is a communist who will sell our Constitution and our BILL of RIGHTS (not bill of privileges) to the highest bidder for his own political gain. I wish every liberal republican calling themself a moderate would jump ship and tote the (D) or the (I) next to their title.
