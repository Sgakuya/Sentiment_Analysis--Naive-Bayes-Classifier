We used two men and a truck from Brian G. in Statesville, NC. They moved us more than three months ago and have not sent anyone to our home to look at the damages that were done. We have a stainless steel side by side refrigerator that we bouth in 2003. They dropped one of the doors and put a big dent in it. When they were taking the refrigerator out of the house they forgot to take the glass shelves out. They fell out and got scratched that has now turning into cracks. I would not suggest you use this company. They sent out two young men, they compained, were in to much of a hurry and one of them cussed me out.
