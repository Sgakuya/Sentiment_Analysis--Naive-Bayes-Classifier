Carl Thomas' Emotional is one of the best cd's to hit the charts today. But unfortunately, Carl does not get the publicity he should or the push that would give him the props that he deserves. The whole cd is tight, every song makes you groove and at the same time puts you in the same place that he was at when he made the track. I ain't hatin Carl!! Love ya baby!
