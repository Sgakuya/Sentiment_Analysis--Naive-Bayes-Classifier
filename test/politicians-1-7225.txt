As a white Euro-American I am identifying myself as a Euro-American (I like being politically incorrect) just a blacks, hispanics do same. I think that Jesse Jackson is a Race hustling poverty pimp ! I am using the same phrase that Ken Hamblin uses. Ken Hamblin is a black conservative radio talk show host from Denver. Therefore, the afro-americans can not accuse me of racism, hate crimes etc... Rev Jackson, needs to return to preaching the Gospel of Jesus, rather than the gospel racism, hatred, blame whitey for everything etc.. I wonder what Rev. Jackson will say to God on judgement day...
