I'm referring to the bags, not the coffee. I have been trying to email these comments directly, but addreess on bag doesn't seem to work. I buy the procuct in whole bean form at Raplph's Market in Sherman Oaks, CA approximately every two weeks - 1/2 to 3/4 lb, and grind it there into Seattle's Best bags provided. I store it in the bags, inside of a freezer bag, at room termperature. After a few uses, the bag begins to separate - sides and bottom, so that coffee is leaking all over the place. (try to convince your wife that you have thoroughly cleaned up the mess). Those are my constructive comments. Joe Friedman joefriedman1@cs.com
