Pink .. has an amazing attitude and an amazing voice and shows it all off here ... on her Album Cant Take Me Home I feel that she sends out a possitive attitude and outlook on the world of music and the world itself . She also Gives alot Of young girls confidences and boosts them to where they are suppose to be. She also sends s very good point that men arent always needed to make a women happy .. its a girls world .. but men just live in it !! It's The Girls Turm !
