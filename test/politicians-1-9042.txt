Though a smart man, Clinton wasted a tremendous opportunity through his love affair with the lie. Sure, his various sexual picadilloes are well-documented, but his first love was the lie. If you can't trust the president, something is terribly amiss. And in Clinton, we had a man who just could not be trusted to tell the truth, even when it made political and personal sense to do so. A very smooth politician to be sure, but history will likely judge him as a failed president.
