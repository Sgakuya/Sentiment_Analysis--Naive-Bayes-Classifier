I just won over $1500 from them in Small Claims Court. In addition to banging up and scratching a lot of my furniture - much of it antique - they refused to pay for some items entirely, like a mattress in which the driver had burned a cigarette hole and the complete chewing up of the new paint job on the porch. Per the court order, they should have paid me by a couple of days ago and haven't, so I guess it's back to the courthouse I go. DON'T use this company!
