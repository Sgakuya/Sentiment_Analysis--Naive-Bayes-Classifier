To say the least, this kid is an offense to the music scene on the worst possible level of POP. How can he call himself a singer, I don't know. I know 2 things, though: 1) His parents deserver a severe beating. A kid his age shouldn't be allowed to be exposed, and explored my media like that. You see, Charlotte Church is one thing, she actually has a gift from God. This child star is just a failed attempt to be famous, and to try out some sort of talent (WHICH ISN'T THERE), so as not to miss the success of his brother (who also sucks incredibly). 2)The people who actually consider (for one split second) buying this cd, deserve a very painful and severe spanking. People who actually buy this crap and like it, deserve to undergo an unthinkably painful near death experience.
