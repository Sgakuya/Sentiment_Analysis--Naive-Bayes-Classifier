I will never rent or buy from Blockbuster Video in Tucson, Arizona again. I have had money on gift cards that mysteriously disappeared upon check-out and the clerks seem borderline retarded. I had $1.75 on a Gift Card today which would have paid for half of my rental fee. I also had a DVD in hand that I was also going to pay cash for. When she told me, There's no money left on this card... that's the straw that broke the camel's back. Never again will I go to Blockbuster, nor will I ever purchase Gift Cards for my employees (Christmas, Secretary's Day, etc.)
