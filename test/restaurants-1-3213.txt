Papa John's pizza tastes terrible! Very uninspiring bland sauce that tastes like it came from a can, and the mozzarella cheese is not stringy and fresh. ANY mom and pop 'NY type' pizzeria blows this mass produced crap away! If you like the taste of Papa John's pizza, you haven't tasted superior 'pie'!
