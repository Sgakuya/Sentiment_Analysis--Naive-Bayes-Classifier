George Bush was the driving force behind the Kurds, encouraging them to rise up against Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War. Then, after they believed in him and did what he said, he left them to fend for themselves, without removing Saddam. And Saddam's punishment to the Kurds was cruel and deadly. I hope George Bush has this cowardice on his conscience.
