Savage Garden makes me re-evaluate my life and it helps to show me that not everyones life is peachy(2 beds and a coffee machine). this kind of songwriting always makes me feel like there are people out there who know things about life and are smart enough to sing about the way things really are. So I ask everyone to open yourself to the possibilites- not just the song and how its performed(which is good anyway) but listen to the words. See if you can relate. NOW THATS MUSIC!
