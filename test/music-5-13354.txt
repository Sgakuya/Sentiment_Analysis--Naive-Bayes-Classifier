Nelly's CD go hard! It is awesome. He is very talented. I seen Nelly's concert and it was awesome. All of the music is very different. The beats have you bobbin your head! I can't wait for his next CD. Everyone go out and buy the St.Lunatics CD coming out on March 27th. In case you don't know Nelly is a part of a group called St.Lunatics which includes Nelly. So go get it. I mean buy it, please don't burn it from Napster or bootleg. Support him by buying him. Don't be cheap.
