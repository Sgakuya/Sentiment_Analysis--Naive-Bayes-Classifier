I've been following this guy in the news now for the better part of 15 years. During the 1988 presidential campaign, I seem to recall that he advocated stricter tariffs and other regulations to clamp down on the trade deficit with Japan. At the time, this sounded like a good idea (now, I'm not so sure). However, he was at least expressing a constructive thought in trying to solve a problem. Since that time, I've noticed a dearth of helpful ideas on his part--during the Clinton years, the only times I recall hearing much out of him was in Clinton's defense. In the last 18 months, the only times I recall hearing much out of him was to bash George W. Bush. Dick, you seriously need to find a real issue to take leadership with. When it happens, I may not agree with you politically, but at least you'll have something more constructive to occupy your time.
