AVOID THIS COMPANY - Two Small Men (With No Brains) posted the positive comments on this board. This is a typical scam of these low-lifes. They will make you regret the moment you heard of them. Here is what you can expect from these thieves: They will give you a low quote that they will not honour and they will charge your credit card before they pick anything up - the quotation says C.O.D. and they cannot charge anything - call your Credit Card company immediately; They will break every promise they make; They will not show up on the agreed time/day and they will not be honest about why they are late; They will not answer your calls (try blocking your number - they're always trolling for the next victim); They will not be equipped - no basics like boxes, tape, blankets, dollies, inventory tags, nothing! - They will not take care of it later at the warehouse; They will use unbonded 'employees' who are either just out of prison or on day-parole for theft (or worse) - they will steal whatever they want from you because you cannot prove it; They will extort you for more money before delivery - call the police immediately. Their insurance is a joke and just another way to burglarize you. These fraudsters will make you sorry you ever learned to dial a phone. Use a reputable company and save yourself some very painful grief. I had the misfortune of dealing with the Montreal unit of these scum. Yeah you, Jeff Crawford. Dork!
