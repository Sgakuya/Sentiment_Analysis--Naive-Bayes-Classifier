This album deserves way more than 5 stars. This is history here. Talk about a groundbreaking album! I could listen to Sgt. Pepper's over and over and over. Each Beatle contributed so much to the album, and it shows. Without Sgt. Pepper, music as we know it wouldn't be the same today, and all those petty little boy bands need to thank the Beatles that their fame exists today. I can't imagine what it would be like to be there, to hear this album for the first time, while nothing else even a little like it. Even if you dislike the Beatles, (you are such a stupid person in the first place), you can't deny that this album changed everything. There's nothing else to say except that this is the best album ever! Oh, and JenSecret74, it's Lovely Rita, not Lonely Rita, the next time you rate something, you better get the facts straight, hon.
