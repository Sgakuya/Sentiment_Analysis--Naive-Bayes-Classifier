Thank God for Florida! A whining hypocritical law breaker. His lying over the 96 campaign violations and his willingness to countenance Bill Hill's moral lapses was a revelation and said loads about his integrity. He didn't fool too many people. Not only did he fail to win his own state, he couldn't win his home county.
