Allen Iverson is a huge ballhog. He takes like 25 shots a game and makes a quarter of them. He talks stuff that he can't back up. I truly hate AI and I hope detroit crushes the 76ers. Again Iverson isn't a team player and I know I wouldn't want him on my team. If you have any comments e-mail me at cphelpsplayer@yahoo.com
