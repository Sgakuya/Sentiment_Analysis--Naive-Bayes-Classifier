I met P!NK in the Philly Airport on my way to LA and she was goin there too and I thought it was the coolest thing of her to stand in line by herself w/ nobody around. I got a pic and an autograph w/ her and she was like the coolest person I've ever met. Then I saw Tiffany Amber Theisen on my plane n I gave her a nice, friendly smile and what a you kno what . She gave me the dirtiest look w/ her ugly blonde hair. O well.
