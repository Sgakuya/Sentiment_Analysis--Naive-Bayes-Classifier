I recently worked as a ice cream scooper at a friendly's and have to tell everyone that the hygene of the chain is disgusting, especially the ice cream portion (and I used to work at a McDonalds whick are very clean) I would not eat anything there unless i was able to personally make it and see what type of environment the food items were comeing from.
