Jesse just announced that he is the father of a 20 month old child, born out of an affair. But yet we continue to consider this man a leader of our people? Granted we all mke mistakes and I (as Paul said) am the chief sinner of them all. but how dare this man stand and oppose a true man of God (John Ashcroft) the way he does? John is probably the only man in poliltics who is willing to stand for the name of Christ! Jesse, how dare you call yourself a man of God and not support a TRUE brother in Christ?????
