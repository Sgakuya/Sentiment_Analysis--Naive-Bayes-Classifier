Large selectin of junk, most of the stuff they sell is refurbished. You can find anything there, except what you're looking for. The "great "helpers" (if you can find one) are usually clueless, only a handful of employees now what they're doing. Fry's deliberately and maliciosly sells the defective ECS motherboards, the story is absolutely genuine. They are aware of it and continue to frantically promote and sell them almost exclusively. They are to blame as much as the manufacturer. The scam is, it takes a long time to figure out what's wrong with brand new computer, after trying everything you can think of, including re-installing the operating system several times, you finally realize that it's a mainboard problem, but by that time it's too late to return it. So you go back and buy a different one, and while you're there, you pick-up something else. It works for Fry's, they have the promo fliers posted right there, by the "returns" line, so you have plenty of time to plan a shopping spree while waiting to return the crap you bought last time. For maliciousness, I would give them a 0 rating, but that's not available.
