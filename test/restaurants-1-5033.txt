I've never cared for Italian restaurants. I was taught to cook at my grandmother's knee. An Italian meal is made and served almost immediately. It's not frozen and it's not reheated. The sauce has always been a problem. It's either fresh or it isn't and if it's sitting in a pot all day, it's not fresh. I've never had good sauce in an Italian restaurant.
