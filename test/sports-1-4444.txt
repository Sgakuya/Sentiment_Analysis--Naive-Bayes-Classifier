An absolute lie! Smoke and mirrors. Has yet to develop a player into a great player and instead just recruits them. A used car salesman instead of a coach! Runs a dirty program that everyone ignores. Has the biggest mouthpiece in Dukie V but rarely lives up to the hype. This man has wasted more talent than Mack Brown.
