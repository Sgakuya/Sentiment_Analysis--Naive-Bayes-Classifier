Borders came to Billings, MT with promises for new jobs in our struggling economy. However by the time I was fired from this horrible workplace, I learned they wanted NOTHING to do with local economy and just with Borders bottom dollar. Bringing in a staff of out of state people to work the store after the local people who worked 12 hour shifts to SORT the store were let go. Borders is very unfair, greedy, and they DONT care about your community be warned!
