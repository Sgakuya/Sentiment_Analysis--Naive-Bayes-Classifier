I think everyone knows at least one Pink Floyd song. This album ranges from their hysterically funny first album 'Pied Piper At The Gates of Dawn' - 'Bike' being the best one. To beautiful songs such as 'Comfortably Numb' and 'Wish You Were Here' This is a must for people who want to know more Floyd songs and for die hard fans.
