Wake up America! We have a political whore on our hands with Al Gore. No one has seemed to realize the devastating consequence our nation would face in the event our mid-east oil gets cut off. Our country would come to an abrubt halt because we get 62% of our oil from there. And yet we have a self aggandizing vice president tapping our emergency oil reserves to fool the American public (which he did) into believing he was helping us when gas prices began to rise pass $2.00 a gallon. Our reserves are for extreme emergency only. Most do not know that less than 300,000 barrels make it home heating oil and 1.5 million barrels were refined to diesel fuel. A long way from the 30 million barrels released. Where did they go? Try Europe, the brokers of this oil are not committed to selling just to the United States. If we begin to drill right now for our own oil it will take 7 years for it to get you the consumer. By the way we have no altenative fuel, isn't that right Mr.Gore. This guy is just a worst extention of Bill Clinton, at least Clinton had reasons to tell us lies. I am a Viet Nam veteran and am very ashamed to say this is the kind of leadership ou country elects.
