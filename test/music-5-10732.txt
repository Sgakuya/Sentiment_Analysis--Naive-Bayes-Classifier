I reallllly love it! It's amazing how they improve day after day! I didn't hate mmmbop and all their single from their first official album, Middle of Nowhere, but I didn't like them (the singles). But now they do a great job, it's a beautiful album, ROCK album! Listen to it and you won't be dissapointed!
