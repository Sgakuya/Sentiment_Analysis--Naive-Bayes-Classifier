This old kook should have been part of history before I left grade school! I m sorry, but there comes a time when people need to realize they just aren t as sharp as they once were. One of my grandmothers lived to be 102 years of age, was still in her right mind until she died but certainly should not or could not have been doing a job like this. That and the fact that we are talking major old-time bigot here should be enough to convince SOMEBODY that age limits can be a good thing.
