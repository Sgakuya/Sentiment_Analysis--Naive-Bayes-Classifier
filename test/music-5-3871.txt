Pop brilliance. Crime of the Century may be their critical triumph, but Breakfast in America was their commercial one. Both albums are must-haves for any pop and rock music fan. The Logical Song was a bit overplayed, but I still enjoy hearing it. And Take the Long Way Home ranks with Give a Little Bit as their finest musical moment.
