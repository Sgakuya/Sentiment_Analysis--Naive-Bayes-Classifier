Bush is definitely conservative, but he is hardly compassionate. He made fun on national TV of a woman pleading for her life. Despite the request of a county sheriff, a prosecutor, a judge, and a pardons and parole board to pardon a convicted killer based upon DNA evidence demonstrating that the man was clearly innocent, Bush refused to grant a pardon until several months later when the national media forced his hand. How can a man who claims that he has been saved by Jesus Christ support the death penalty? Does he think that someone who was nailed to a cross would support the state killing people?
