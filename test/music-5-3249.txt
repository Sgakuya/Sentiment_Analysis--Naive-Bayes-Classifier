Simply the greatest thing mankind has ever produced. It was make or break for Bruce and he made it. Every song on here is a classic, Born to Run, Thunder Road, Backstreets, Jungleland, 10th Avenue Freezeout, She's the One, and Night. From beginning to end, from when the screen door slams, to when the rangers have a homecoming, this is the quintessential rock n' roll album.
