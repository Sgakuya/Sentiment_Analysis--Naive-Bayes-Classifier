All I can say is he is slick enouth to contaminate, and pull the wool over John McCains eyes. H must be really a good politican. He has helped attribute a large block of votes going away from McCain next election. I expect his actions, not McCains. They both ran against the Bush Camp before, I wonder who will be the Demo candidate for Pres John or Joe? The other can be the VP nominee!
