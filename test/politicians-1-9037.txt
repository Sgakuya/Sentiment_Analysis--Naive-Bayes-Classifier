Isn't there a lower rating...like a picture of a swamp. . . or maybe a pig stye. . . or possibly a trash can?? It is to our country's great and lasting credit that we can have utter waste holding the top office in the land, and still survive. Not to say we didn't (and are - in some cases still) suffer. That thing that somehow held the office for those eight years is a complete waste of the air we all need to breathe. I can't stand that a penny of my tax dollars goes to the thing's support.
