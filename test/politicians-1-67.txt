I have nothing to say about this woman personally, but rather the entire system that she represents. Maybe someone can explain it to me. Don't these people (the Royal Family) function essentially as parasites on the host-country where they reside, sucking the lifeblood and vitality out of its people like some aged, decrepit tapeworm? What do any of the Royals do to justify their livelihoods, their cushy existence? Do they work? Are they entertainers? Do they produce anything? Are we still using that timeworn canard about them helping to promote tourism? And if the British aren't bad enough in their slavish devotion to these high-class wastrels, what in the name of God is the allure of these Royals that so appeals to people in America? This almost compulsive fascination with Prince Harry, and Charlie (Alfred E. Newman look-alike), and Princess Di, and Fergie...Is it that our lives are so empty and meaningless that we obsess over any soap-opera banality that is presented to us? Oh well, we Americans have our George Bush, I guess the British are entitled to their Queen Mum...
