Oakey is not terribly known for his hardcore trance, but this album is deffinitely the best of the best. Hooked me from note number 1, and even has inspired me to become a DJ as I have quite a passion for music. Fitting the number one DJ in the world inspired me to become a DJ with his first album released in America... I highly reccomend it for any person who claims to 'love' electronica.
