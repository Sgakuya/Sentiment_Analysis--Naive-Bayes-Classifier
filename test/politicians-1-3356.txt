Incompetent, corrupt, arrogant - possibly the worst president in history. Facts International Opinion of the US: A survey of 11 countries [Australia, Canada, Brazil, France, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Russia, South Korea, United Kingdom, United States] - for the television programme What The World Thinks of America, to be aired this week in the UK - revealed that 57% of the sample had a very unfavourable, or fairly unfavourable attitude towards the American President. The figure rose to 60% when discounting the views of the American respondents. Source: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2994924.stm Democracy in Iraq? We are told (finally) that the US will be in Iraq for a long time. The Bush administration has said it doesnt want a theocracy, but the same ICRSS survey found that The most popular leader in Iraq was the country's leading Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani. Did we go into Iraq to create Iran-lite - theocracy? Many people told the neocons that this is exactly what democracy in Iraq would probably end up looking like before the war. Bushs ability to create and implement wise policies? In 2002, John J. DiIulio Jr., who's the former head of he president's faith-based initiatives, is quoted as saying "What youve got is everything, and I mean everything, being run by the political arm. It's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis." He composed a 3000-word letter excoriating the Bush government. The Bush administration thinks they solved the political problem he created by forcing him to recant a month later. When a guy who LIKED Bushs ideas (after all he took on the job of coordinating faith-based initiatives), writes a multipage letter condemning the governments ability to function effectively, it looks WORSE when he is forced to recant shortly thereafter Mao Tse-Tung would have been proud of the speed with which DiIulio was reeducated. Another Republican who worked for the Bushites and couldnt stomach them any more: Paul ONeill [Summary of his assessment: Policy decisions are determined not by careful weighing of an issue's complexities; rather, they're dictated by a cabal of ideologues and political advisors operating outside the view of top cabinet officials. The President is not a fully engaged administrator but an enigma who is, at best, guarded and poker-faced but at worst, uncurious, unintelligent, and a puppet of larger forces.] US Economy: White House Creates Highest Deficit Ever: 2004's federal deficit soared to a record $445 billion. GOP record on this issue? The current GOP-controlled government practices conservatism on the cheap. Big tax cuts are great and Bushs constituency celebrates them, but Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress spend worse than liberals did. My kids and grandkids are not being given the option to use their money to better themselves (the conservative advantage), we are piling on debt so that they will pay taxes without getting services (the liberal advantage). Summed up, Bushs government has provided the worst of both worlds to people who have no say in the matter at all. Federal spending has grown by more than 29% since President Bush took office, the highest rate of increase in 30 years ( http://www.independent.org/tii/content/press_rel/press_040624.html). The federal government now spends roughly $22,000 per household every year, up from $16,000 just 5 years ago, and the first time since World War II it has topped $20,000 per household in current dollars and households average fewer members now than any time in history. Bush has not vetoed a single bill. Why not? One big reason is that the Bush government is built on political patronage. Taxpayer money is doled out the political friends in Congress in a manner far exceeding the worst excesses of Democratically-controlled governments of the past. Farm subsidies, for example, go almost entirely to large agribusiness concerns and not coincidentally to states and districts that vote Republican. The Bush-backed farm bill allocates a record $180 billion in assistance to agribusiness over the next 10 years. Bushs Medicare plan was so costly that the White House threatened to fire Medicares chief actuary, Richard Foster, if he revealed his real estimates which were at least $134 billion more than Bushs claims. "Our projected budget deficits are not manageable without significant changes [in taxes or spending]...We simply cannot grow our way out this problem." Says U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, a former Reagan Administration official, who is a non-partisan auditor appointed to a 15-year term.
