The Best thing that can be said about her is that she is not Barbara Boxer (California's other senator). One half of the Democratic duo that billed themselves at The Cagney and Lacey of the U.S. Senate. Off the top of my head, the only American female politicians I hate more are Maxine Waters, Hillary Clinton and Boxer.
