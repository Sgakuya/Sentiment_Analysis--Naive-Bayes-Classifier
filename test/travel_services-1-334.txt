Save your money. British Airways business class flat beds are LESS comfortable than economy; don't dare eat any breakfast on their flights, the eggs and bacon were unedible. The check in staff are horriffic. Chances are you won't get your luggage delivered and the London airports are a joke and very smokey and crowded. Their flights are always crowded and it's a very uncomfortable experience. Chances are they will be in bankruptcy soon and it's not uncommon for them to simply cancel flights for no apparent reason, and they will offer no compensation to anyone.... ever. I wish there was a ZERO rating on this, as that would be more fitting than simply a ONE--TERRIBLE rating... save your money. Also, if you claim an award with their frequent flyer program, better plan a year in advance if you think you will get seats.
