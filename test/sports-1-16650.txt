It is one thing to talk trash against your opponent. It is totally another thing to talk trash and be unable to back it up. However, it is totally dishonorable to talk trash, be unable to back it up AND blame your performance on your teammates instead of yourself.

Mitchell ought to have had the decency to own up to his brash talk and give props to the other team. But instead, he did not and burned bridges within his own team.
