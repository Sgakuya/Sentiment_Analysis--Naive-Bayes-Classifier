This man is probably the most despicable example of a human being that anyone could think of. He sits in the lap of luxury while his people starve and struggle to support his regime. He is a fugitive war criminal. He oversaw the killing of thousands of his own people and thousands more who didn't agree with his ideals, all in the name of a religion he clearly doesn't follow. He broke families and homes and brain-washed his people through fear and threats. He claims to be all-powerful, yet he runs from threats. He ordered the burning of oil fields in Kuwait, ruining the environment and the livelihood of thousands. He okayed the use of civilians as human shields. He will do anything to stay in power because that power is a drug to him. It isn't that he is brave enough to stand up to the US, it's that he's so scared he needs to keep making useless threats and changing his soiled underwear every half hour.
