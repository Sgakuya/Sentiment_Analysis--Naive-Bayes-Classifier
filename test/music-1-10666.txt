This band is simply trying too hard. There is nothing else to it. Everything sounds strained, and every song is searching for a catchy hook, which it never finds. Nothing about it is genuine or original. The opening guitars in Bent sound like a second rate Heart rip off, and even the title is the name of a lesser known, far better mid-90's band.
