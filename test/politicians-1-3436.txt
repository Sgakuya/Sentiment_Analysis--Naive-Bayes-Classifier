To LanceRoxas, first of all, if your girlfriend thinks George is hot, then you must be in awful shape, or are you dating an eighty year old? You sound just like W. I believe what I believe and to hell with the facts. People like you are a strong argument for legalizing a minimum I.Q. for voting rights. Out of one side of your mouth you criticize LBJ, who was a sorry excuse for a human being, much less a President, but the other side of your face praises Bush who has done the same thing. Instead of defeating Al-Quaida and capturing Bin Ladin (whose family escaped America on the only civillian plane in the air on 9/12, per George), he left the job half done. He has treated the conflict in Iraq like he has everything else in his life, he screws it up and leaves it up to someone else to clean up. How can you expect the man to run the country when he can't control his own addictions or those of his own children? And I am guessing that you served in the same theatre of operations that George did, Kerry served, if he had never saved a single life(and he did) or won a single medal ( he won several) then the very act of srevice to his country makes him a better man than Bush could ever dream of being. By the way, did you actually see the Moore's movie? Or wre you, like the other 3.5 million other Americans who have lost jobs in the last four years too poor to buy a ticket. The most damning footage in the film was not Moore's opinion, but film of George being himself. One last word of advice, My father, who also served in Viet Nam in Riverine Assault Groups, used to tell me that it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. P.S. Errin, the only conviction George has was for drunk driving, he would have been convicted on seven counts with his brother Neil over the S&L scandal but those charges vanished just like his military records and the medical records from his stay in rehab for his cocaine addiction. Clinton smoked pot in college as a kid, George snorted cocaine while his daddy sat in the oval office, state whom you support and be catagorized.
