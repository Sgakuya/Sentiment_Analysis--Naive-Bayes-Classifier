Now heres a place that takes food to a whole new level. Out of this world, Nothing that bad can come from here. Earth has some strange things on it, But nothing as strange as Mc Donalds meat. The chicken, what part of the universe do they get that? The burger meat, Why is it that greenish/grey color? And why does it not even smell like meat? The Mc Rib, Now heres one of the great misteries of science, they have been tring to figure this one out for years. And the smell Ohhh Yeah that smell. To this day I get sick to My stomach on that smell, Just have to pass by Mickey D's and my gut goes all to hell. Oh well should'nt be to harsh on this subject. What do you expect from a fast food chain run by a Clown.
