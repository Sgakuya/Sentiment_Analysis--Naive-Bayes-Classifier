Should be re-named Golden Pig Trough. Full of entirely low quality fattening foods. Chaotic enviroment and so-so prices. Only people I personally know who like this place are people who over eat consistantly. I know no one with any culinary taste whatsoever that considers Golden Corral to be quality dining.
