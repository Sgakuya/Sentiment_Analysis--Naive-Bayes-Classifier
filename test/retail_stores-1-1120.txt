Ok , I couldn't get a 0 on this thing... I am anti- Hot Topics ! Hot topics is for poser crack headed preeps!!!no self respecting subculture-er would ever buy everyday wear from there!! being goth or punk or raver is about being different!!! Hot Topics is no different from GAP or Abbacrombie and Fitch !! Punk goth and all those others are about DIY fashion!! It's a unique way to express yourself!!! Hot Topics is a mass producesed B.S. system like everything else main strem!! hot topics sucks!!
