Horrible experience and it hasn't even started...suppose to be here yesterday and never showed until 6:30pm and without boxes...when I spoke to customer service they said Oh we're packing? Yikes, we sent them packing back to their planet and they were suppose to be at my house Sunday at 9am...well by noon no movers and when we finally tracked them down they had traveled 50 miles in the wrong direction..Should have stopped it then but...I will never use recommend or utter this company's name again NEVER
