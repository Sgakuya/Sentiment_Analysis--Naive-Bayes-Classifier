This guy should really be a Republican. The last thing America needs is another pro-business, pro-religion ideologue like Holy Joe. In my view, Lieberman is nothing more than a sanctimonious, self-righteous JERK. Additionally, electing an Orthodox Jew as President will destroy what little credibility the USA has remaining with the Arab/Muslim world and will virtually guarantee the indefinite continuance of terrorism against America from that quarter. If Lieberman gets the Democratic nomination, I will, for the first time in my life, vote for somebody besides the Democratic candidate, probably Ralph Nader.
