Stroke 9 is an awesome band they have a unique sound like no other. With catchy lyrics you will not be able to get this albumb out of your head. Finally a cd u dont have to skip. There is a song that everyone can relate to on this album! watch for their new cd out next year too! Nasty little thoughts is worth the money!
