I am disappointed in your work with Dashel today. Fear of the future has to be your motivation for giving up the Republican core attitudes and voted desire for whatever slight majority we could muster. You make it so easy for the Democrats to regain control of everything. I feel you made a bed with them for your own political benifit. You will lose, then so shall we.
