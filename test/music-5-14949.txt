This was the first CD I ever bought and I absolutely loved it then, as I love it now. That has to be a sign of a good CD, if it has 5 years of staying power. Espeically with my ever changing likes and dislikes with respect to music. Any CD that can pull off having the Butthole Surfers with the Cardigans is alright by me.
