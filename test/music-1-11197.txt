Just when they stop showing pictures of him and Britney Spears and how tragic their break-up was they go and try to get me to think that a Justin Timberlake solo album is a good idea. The guy is not an artist of any kind. He doesn't write his own songs or even make his own dance moves. He is nothing but eye candy. But it was pretty funny watching him nearly piss his pants after his friends tricked him into believing that the IRS repossed his house and all of his belongings.
