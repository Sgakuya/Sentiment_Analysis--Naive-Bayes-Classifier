I've heard much hype about this restaraunt so I was excited when my friend got a job as a Manager there I thought great now a cool place to go out and eat free food... NOT! The Kitchen was filthy, they use the same bowls over and over to make the same food without cleaning them aside from wiping with a rag and virtually everydish is soaked with oil. Not exactly the healthiest food I've ever had but if your willing to clog your arteries to eat food from a filthy kitchen served by a staff that is less than friendly by all means go for it.
