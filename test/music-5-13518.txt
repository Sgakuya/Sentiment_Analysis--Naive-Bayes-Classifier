OUTKAST IS THE MOST CREATIVE, UNIQUE, ORIGINAL GROUP EVER. EVERY ALBUM THEY DROP IS SUPERFLY!!! THEIR SONGS ARE ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE NOT HEARD BEFORE AND THEIR MESSAGES IN THE MUSIC ALWAYS HAVE TRUE AND SPECIAL MEANING. STANKONIA IS ONCE AGAIN A WHOLE DIFFERENT FLAVOR AND I LOVE IT. B.O.B. BLEW MY MIND WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT. 5 STARS OF COURSE AND NO ONE CAN TELL ME DIFFERENT.
