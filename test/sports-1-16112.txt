Michael "Media Creation" Vick is not as good a quarterback as Kyle Boller right now. Look at the numbers, people. And for all of you who are waiting for Vick to mature, compare his first five years (okay, 4 full years) to Culpepper's, Cunningham's, Elway's, Young's, Garcia's, or ANY other mobile quarterback's and you'll see that Vick sucks. They all matured by there 3rd or 4th year. Vick is ending his 5th and you're still saying he'll be great when he matures. Come on, sheeple! Stop drinking the kool-aid that ESPN is handing you.
