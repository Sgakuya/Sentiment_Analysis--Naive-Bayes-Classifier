Clay's nothing special. His pitch is okay, but his songs are annoying, and the sound of his voice is pretty annoying. Cheesy is the word I'm looking for. Okay so, everybody goes on and on about what a great guy he is and how fun he is in concert, well...whoopty-doo. This is about the music, folks. None of that means a darn thing if I can't enjoy his sound. Want a real voice? Try something REAL-- like Josh Groban.
