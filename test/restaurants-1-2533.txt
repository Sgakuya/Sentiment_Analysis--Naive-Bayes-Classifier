McDonalds food tastes like cardboard but it's all the gentic components they put in it that makes it taste good. Every time I eat there it never fails to give me gas and a stomach ache. I haven't eatin there in a long time and I just recently saw Super Size me and I don't ever want to eat there again. Read the book Fast Food Nation or watch Super Size me and I'll bet you'll think twice about eating there. Something about ground meat from thousands of different cows from countries around the world in their hambuger patties is frightening.
