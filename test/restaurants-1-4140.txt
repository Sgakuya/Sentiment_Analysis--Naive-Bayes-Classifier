My wife and I have had several bad food experiences at Changs, from stomach cramps, to just bad service. The restaurant uses a good customer service formula but the food quality is equal to any fast food Chinese. The dining setting is well done for the price of the food. But if food quality is more important I do not recommend this restaurant.
