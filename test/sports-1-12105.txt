He is the most overrated player in college football since Gino Toretta. He played on a pretty good team and obtained inflated numbers by playing in what turned out to be an extremely average Big 12. He was MIA in OU's two biggest games. He will never be an NFL starter and won't last more than a couple years on the next level.
