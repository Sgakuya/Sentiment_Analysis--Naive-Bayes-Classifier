Blockbuster sucks. They love to charge late fees even when you turn in the movies on time. One time we rented a movie, and I remembered we returned it early because it was a shitty movie, and a couple months later we got a notice in the mail from Blockbuster saying we owed a late fee of $130.00! Those idiots.
