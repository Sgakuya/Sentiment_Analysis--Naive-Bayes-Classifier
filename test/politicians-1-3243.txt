A fat, big mac, cheeseburger eating slob with a little weenie. He had the delusion of making the statement at the beginning of his reign of incompetence: we are replacing the most corrupt cabinet and President that ever held office! For the rest of time he will be remembered as the fat slob, hypocrite, with the teeny weenie. Teeny weenie thanks to Monaco's journal of distinguishing marks of the president's anatomy.
