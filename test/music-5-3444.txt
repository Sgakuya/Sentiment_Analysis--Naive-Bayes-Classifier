I'm both surprised and disappointed to find this quite magnificent album so low in the ratings here.It recently returned to the British top 50 charts,after 28 years,and is still a classic reminder of why Elton came to be so phenomenally successful;full of superb melodies and pop-rock standards-Candle in the Wind(The beautiful original,to Marilyn Monroe),Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,Bennie and the Jets,Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting,Roy Rogers,The Ballad of Danny Bailey,the quite tremendous,atmospheric Funeral for a Friend..and others.The soaring quality of the music is maintained through its double album length.I know Elton isn't for all tastes,but for those of you unfamiliar with his early work,it's definitely well worth discovering.
