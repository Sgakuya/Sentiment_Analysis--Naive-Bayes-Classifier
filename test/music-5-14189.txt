One of the best soundtracks of all time. A mix of old time songs, folk, bluegrass. James Carter The Prisoners singing Po Lazarus hooks you from the beginning. Great songs such as Big Rock Candy Mountain, You Are My Sunshine, Down to the River to Pray, I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow, In the Jailhouse Now, and Lonesome Valley. But the most haunting and memorable song is O Death performed with such sorrow by Ralph Stanley. Great performances by Alison Kraus, Dan Tyminski, Chris Thomas King, The Fairfield Four, Gillian Welch and more. Every song, every note is a gem and will remind you what good pure music is about.
