Dirty restaurants, horrible food, (anyone else make the mistake of trying that rotton pot-roast sandwich?), combined with the worst service in the world makes a single star seem generous. This is a shame. Years ago, I really liked Arby's. Their beef isn't half bad. Unfortunately, one trip to the franchise on Green Bay Road in N. Chicago, IL will sour you forever.
