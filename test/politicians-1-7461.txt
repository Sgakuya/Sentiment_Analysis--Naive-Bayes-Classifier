Ah, yes, Ray "School Bus" Nagin. Although not quite as incompetent as the dangerous indecisive Governor Kathleen Blanco, Nagin truly dropped the ball as many ways as possible. Satellite photos not only prove that school buses were present after Katrina--but were not waterlogged as much as 24 hours after the most significant parts of the storm were gone. The roads between the buses and the Superdome were clear. And, his weak-kneed stance on villianous looting was a dangerous position to take.
