I may not live in Dick Gebhardt's district, but that will not stop me from assisting those who are trying to find someone to run against him at the next election! His siding first with Clinton and now with Gore only shows he is NOT interest in upholding the law, on getting his way. We have enough of those people, we need new blood.
