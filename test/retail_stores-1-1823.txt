I live outside Philadelphia and surprisingly enough I don't even know where the local Wal-Mart is. I have shopped at them before and had no qualms with the prices or any other part of the general activity of shopping. I don't like Wal-Mart because it represents what I see as one of the worst things America is doing to itself and the world. By having a Wal-Mart in every town, it slowly strangles the independently owned stores. This is leading to a homogenization of America and I hate it. You can go anywhere in the country and see the exact same thing: A strip mall with a Wal-Mart and a Mcdonald's; I prefer to have a different experience of culture and lifestyle in New England then in Southern California, but it's becoming that everything, everywhere in this country is becoming the same.
