Kid A is the kind of album that grows on the listener the more she listens to it. It took me a while to appreciate it's hauntingly beautiful sonic qualities. Many people have attacked it, calling it pretensious and frustratingly obtuse, and I'll admit it's not especially welcoming , but I personally enjoy listening to challenging music. Music that brushes past the listeners ears without provoking her to think or feel anything (even ambivalence) may be considered an easier listen, but I believe that music is always better when the listener is encouraged to take part in the music through analysis, repeated listening and personal interpretation. For anyone else who feels the same way about music, I highly reccommend Kid A. The hauntingly beautiful How to Disappear Completely is my current anthem !!!
