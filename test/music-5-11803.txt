I love Good Charlotte so much. My best friend also loves them and she introduced me to the wonderful world of punk. They are amazing. They have really great voices (pretty unusual for modern boy bands. HA HA!) and they play their own instruments which I find really cool. They're all extremely good looking too which is an added bonus. I love their songs and that they don't all sound the same. That's all. Billy, Benji, Joel, Aaron, Paul, I LOVE YOU ALL!!!! :) Emmy
