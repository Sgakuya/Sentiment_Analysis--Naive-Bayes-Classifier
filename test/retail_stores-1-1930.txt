My experience with this drugs store in VA was to have my prescription lost in the time it went from drop off window to the pharmacist (about 5 feet). I was very upset and the staff seemed to accuse me of not knowing if I left the script. I know this is a violation of the Federal HIPPA regulations and feel they did not keep my information private. So beware, even if drop the script off the staff and wait in the store-you never know about yor information and may not get timely antibiotic therapy.
