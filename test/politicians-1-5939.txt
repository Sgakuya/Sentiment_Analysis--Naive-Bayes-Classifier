This syphilitic, alcoholic murderer has gone off the deep end, I fear. I was in disbelief earlier when he complained about water torture allegedly used at Abu Ghraib, apparently forgetting that he himself drowned a young woman. Then, his hat trick was to disparage the US presence in Iraq right before the Iraqi elections. His family needs to hold an intervention, and tell Teddy to retire (or tell him last call, which he may better understand).
