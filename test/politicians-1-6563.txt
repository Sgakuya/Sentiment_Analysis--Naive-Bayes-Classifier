Let me paraphrase Senator Daschle. If most of us could keep enough money to buy a muffler, a few lucky souls might get a Lexus. So every American needs to send the IRS enough money to buy a muffler so that NOBODY can have a Lexus (except for Daschle and his buddies.) Does Senator Daschle think we're stupid or something?
