The previous comment is absolutely correct....Dillard's treats their employees like something they stepped on in the street, and from personal experience, it shows on the sales floor. After getting yelled at by managment, I was not as helpful to customers as I would have been if I enjoyed my job. There are plenty other stores to shop at where the employees are happy to be there and to help you, please shop there. Dillard's does not deserve the public's business, especially when you can walk to a different department store and buy the same brands, and get much better service. Also, don't ever go to Customer Service in a Dillards store...the ladies back there are unwiling to help with anything. Usually they will disappear to a back room and wait for you to get discusted and go away. For the selection and prices, Dillard's is not worth your time
