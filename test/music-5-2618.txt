Whoever thinks the chain of songs toward the end of Abbey Road are filler just doesn't get it. These short brilliant pieces build one on another and culminate in one of the most satisfying climaxes I've ever heard on a recording. As good as the rest of the album is, these filler cuts are absolute genius. One of the best and most influential pop albums of the rock era.
