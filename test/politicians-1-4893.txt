Rumsfeld is a tough talking politician who has had a fair degree of success in political infighting in Washington. His interest is not in building the Armed Forces as an institution but rather as driving it to support the political aims the the Bush administration. Like the rest of the senior people in the Bush administration he has no military service. Rumsfeld is not interested in having generals who point out the problems of military solutions for the administration's political aims. The result is the promotion system for generals is much more based upon the expression of political views than competence. This is not a good development if you care about the long term future of the U.S. miliary.
