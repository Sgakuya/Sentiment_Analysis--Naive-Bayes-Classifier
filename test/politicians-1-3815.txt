The most accurate description of George Bush I have heard is an empty suit. It is amazing that no one seems to notice that Bush took credit for all sorts of programs in Texas that he either had nothing to do with or opposed. Gore was caught in non-factural statements about unimportant items. Bush made non-factual statements about important items and no one seemed to care. It is as if no one expected him to know what he was talking about, but voted for him anyway. Amazing!!!!!
