Sounds just great to me. My first impression is that I like it as much as any Superchunk stuff I have. I'm bitter I was asleep at the wheel when Portastatic was out in SF for Noisepop... but what can you do. "Registered Ghost" and "I Wanna know Girls " are the two tracks that are standing out for me.
