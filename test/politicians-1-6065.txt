If it were simply a case of one man living the life God wanted him to live, there would be no problem, you could just avoid people like that. Unfortunately this maniac is enforcing his own very narrow view of Christianity and morality on the rest of the country, forcing them to adhere to the same racist, misogynistic, arbitrary values that his diseased mind adheres to. People have a right to worship anyway they wish, but to force others to your own insanity is illegal and immoral. It's not even God's way.
