I fell Abraham Lincoln was one of the worst Presidents In history.His Emancipation Proclamation Did nothing to really stop slavery, all it did was stop any new states to enter the union from engaging in acts of slavery.My opinion is that What Lincoln Did to the states that seperated Was horrific,How would you like if some one Told you the way you lived your whole life Was going to be takin away by some president You didnt even get a chance to vote for?Well most southerners got told that and when they rebeled and seperated from the union Lincoln acteed like a spoiled Brat saying no its MINE! And Sent the army there to Beat and insult the states into surrender...oh yeah and when they surrendered that definitly was not the end of the torture The states Basicly raised a white flag and said Ok Fine i will go back to the states i dont agree with what you are doing but just please leave us alone,BUT because The states still didnt agree with what Lincoln was doing The army still Tortured the people of the confederacy till all of the peoples pride was gone.So if you REALLY still think Lincoln is a great president thats your opinon But just Look in between the lines of the history books to what there not telling you.
