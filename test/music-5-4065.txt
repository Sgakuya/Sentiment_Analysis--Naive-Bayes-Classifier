Released in 1981, Rush peaked with the band's full-length effort Moving Pictures. This release contains some of Rush's more popular and accessible (read mainstream) songs such as Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, and Limelight as well as the instrumental YYZ. There is simply not a weak song on the entire release, and it doesn't suffer the excesses of its predecessors (eg 2112). Moving Pictures is clearly the first full-length release to acquire if interested in Rush.
