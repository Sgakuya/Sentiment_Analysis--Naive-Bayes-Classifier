Miller is a great clutch shooter, but he retired way too late. He was washed up his last few seasons. Artest...just saying his name or seeing his face gets me mad. He needs to go to jail for a few seasons and then when he comes back maybe he'll have learned NOT to mess with the Pistons. O'Neal is stuck-up and arrogant. Lots of players in the league could score as much as he does, and with a better shooting percentage. The Pacers need to make big personnel changes, cause they aren't going anywhere fast.
