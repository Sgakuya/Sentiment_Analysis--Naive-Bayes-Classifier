I was jerked arround and had to sleep on the floor for 3 days. I was over-charged and the hired boys couldn't read the words GLASS and FRAGIL. Numerouse items broken. I was spoken too in a vulgar manner, and when i refused to pay full price he wouldn't leave my apartment. NEVER AGAIN! BOY COT 2small men!
