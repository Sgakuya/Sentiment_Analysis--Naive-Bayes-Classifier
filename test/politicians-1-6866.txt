Mr. Lott, you are a pitiful excuse for a human being. Just because you are no longer Majority Leader (praise the Lord), and the Republicans have lost control of the Senate, you plan to amend every piece of legislation to fit Mr. Bush's right-wing agenda. The majority of this country doesn't like Mr. Bush's agenda. Senator Jeffords left the GOP because of the sharp swing to the right. You are a warped, spiteful little man and hopefully, the people of Mississippi will wake up to see you as you really are, therefore, replacing you with a more reasonable, fair-minded individual. The Senate would be a better place without you.
