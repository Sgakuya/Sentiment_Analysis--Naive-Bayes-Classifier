I ABHORE racism and I wish Jesse would work to pull the races together instead of marching in everywhere to pull them apart! I am a white female and have no problem with ANY race. I DO have a problem with those that are determined to keep everyone separate. Mr Jackson-LISTEN to your buddy Vice President Gore! It's time for EVERYONE to come together. PLEASE STOP pulling everyone apart!
