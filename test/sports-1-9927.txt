Sorry had to add to my disgust for the rat as he has now just tossed Kerry Kittles to the Clippers for another draft pick.....great....which conference do the Nets play in next season the Big East or the ACC????.................If Bruce Ratner were on fire, I would toss on more gasoline. What a scumbag. Buys a team so he can build himself a pretty building and tramples on the tortured souls that have rooted for the Nets and endured hell to finally get to have some pride in a team that was to be championship contenders for years to come. Rod Thorn should trade Kidd, let RJ go and quit so Ratner can run his team over to Brooklyn and his new, empty building. Lets go Bobcats.
