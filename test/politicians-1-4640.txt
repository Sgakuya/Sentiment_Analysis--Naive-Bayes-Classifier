WHO CAN DENY THE FACT THAT HALIBURTON IS GETTING ALL THE CONRTRACTS IN IRAQ AND CHENEY IS THE CEO????? GIVE IRAQ BACK TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE!! WE ARE ALL PAYING THE WHITE HOUSE FOR PERSONAL AGENDAS, YOU THINK GEORGE SR IS THINKING ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN HE MEETS WITH SAUDI OFFICAILS ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DISCUSS BUSINESS MATTERS AND NOT ONE QUESTION IS RAISED TO THEM EVER ABOUT OR TO THE BIN LADEN FAMILY?? YOU THINK WE SHOULD HAVE FLOWN THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF TIMOTHY MCVEIGH OUT OF THE COUNTRY IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE OKLAHOMA BOMBING? STOP LIVING IN DENIAL PEOPLE!!! THE SENATE JUST CONFIRMED TODAY THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE WAS NOT RELIABLE IN GIVING OUR ADMINISTRATION A REASON TO ATTACK IRAQ. YES THERE WAS ONE OFFICIAL IN THE REGIME THAT MAY HAVE HAD TIES TO AL-QUAIDA. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS ARE DYING BECAUSE OF A HUNCH??? DO NOT RE-ELECT THESE CROOKS IN NOVEMBER OR WE WILL BE SCREWED, WE HAVE ALREADY BRED A NEW TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN IRAQ WITH OUR INVASION. THE MEDIA IS LISTENING TO AN ADMINISTRATION THAT TELLS THEM WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT SHOW US, JUST LIKE THE ELECTION THAT WAS OWNED BY AL GORE BUT THAT IS A WHOLE OTHER CROOKED STORY
