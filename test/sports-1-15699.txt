He started off hot, but he it too undersized to be a MLB. He didn't jack swat this past season, cause he could't handle the big men blocking him. He is so overrated, cause bears fans are grasping for something to cheer for on that crappy team. to even compare him to ray lewis is completely laughable man. let's see how crappy he does this year and it'll settle this once and for all. i might have given him a 2 but he also get's rated extra low by me because i am a packer fan. F-ck the Bears! Favre is God!
