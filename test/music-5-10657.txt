Rob Thomas is a genius! His lyrics come from experience and his voice sings the pain. You won't find many other singers out there like him. MAD SEASON is a great album, the more you listen the better it becomes. I have a new favorite song everytime I listen to it. The people that don't like matchbox twenty are the ones that like junk music, stuff with no meaning. This album, like YOSLY, speaks volumes to those who want to listen and understand.
