This video is horrible. The visuals themselves are a clone of every rap video I've ever seen. The song is even worse- a cheap ripoff of the classic I'll be Watching You by the Police. Couldn't Puff Daddy write an original song to pay tribute to his friend instead of changing the lyrics to someone elses?
