This is the Beatles' greatest album and an undeniable rock classic. It's full of wry humor and an experimental edge like the White album, except with more polished, experienced-sounding production and arrangements! Whether listening to the clever, humorous escapism of Maxwell Silver Hammer and Octopus's Garden , the mellow but expressive Something or the hard-edged I Want You (She's So Heavy) I can't help but smile. It's such a clever, well-planned, well-produced album with expertly crafted songs. Rock wouldn't be the same without it!
