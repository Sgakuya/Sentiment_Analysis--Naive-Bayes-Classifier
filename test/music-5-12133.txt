At first, I really was not an Ashanti fan until my cousin talked me into buying her new cd. This was one of the best things I did. Turns out she's a pretty good singer.I really could relate to her song called Freedom. I think people should give Ashanti a chance instead of saying something negative about her just because her name is brought up. Plus she a good actress too! I love the new movie Coach Carter with her in it.
