According to the history books, Abraham Lincoln freed the African Americans from slavery, about 135 years ago. Jesse Jackson and the liberals are slowly but surely returning the African American community to bondage. The fact that 90% of the African Americans voted for Al Gore is going to destroy any progress that has been made in the last 40 years. To all of the African Americans out there, wake up before it's too late. It has taken 200 years to destroy the prejudice that was created when this country was born. We have come a long way in the past 40 years. People are starting to look at people from different parts of the world without paying any attention to the color of their skin. We need to continue to move forward. Thank you. Jim Becker
