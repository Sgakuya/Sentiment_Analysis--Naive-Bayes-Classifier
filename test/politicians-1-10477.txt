 A war demon. If Saddam cuts up people and eats them, how come he was our ally and \how come we sold him the poison gas to defeat the Iranians who at the time happened to be on our S list? Gee, he was o.k.then, but now he's not o.k.? Our #1 bad guys keep changing but one thing that doesnt change is that they are usually Arab. Hmmmm, could it be we are just a teensy bit racist?
