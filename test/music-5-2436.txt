Rubber Soul influences Pet Sounds influences Revolver influences Smile influences Sgt. Pepper... These were the years of revolutionary progress in rock music. Brian Wilson and Lennon/ Mc Cartney were having a pivoting role in it, bands like the Rolling Stones could do nothing more than follow. Revolver is one of these great albums. Just ask a techno act like the Chemical Brothers what a song like Tomorrow never knows still means to them today!
