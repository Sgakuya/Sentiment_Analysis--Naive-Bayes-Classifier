I will never shop at Kay's again nor will I recommend it to any of my friends. I bought a Promise Ring for my Girlfriend and I got the Optional Warranty that supposedly covers the cost of getting it fixed. Well, the band broke and I went to 3 different Kays and all of them told me that they could not fix it based on the warranty but it would cost $150 more to fix it. They then tried to talk me into Trading it in for a new one. When I asked why they would not honor the warranty, not a single one gave me an answer. They basically ignored my question. I am in the market for an engagment ring and I know that I WILL NOT buy from Kays any more. This place is shady and rude.
