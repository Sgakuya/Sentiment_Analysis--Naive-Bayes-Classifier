I'm usually a leader not a follower. But I have to admit like everyone else, Netfix started off good when I joined; now it takes a week to receive one movie for that matter. Damn 2 and 3. I'll be lucky to get all 3. But I was getting them like clockwork like 6 months ago. LOL. I got Fargo and Event Horizen on Thursday Sept 23rd. I watched them, and threw them back in the mailbox that same night. A gambling man would say the post office should get the DVD's Friday morning when they open up and out they go. Man, it is now Wednesday Sept 29 and they just got the DVD's back this afternoon. Terrible service! I should have gotten at least 2 other movies by then. It now takes a week to get 1 to 2 movies. I like to report the DVD's as missing so when they do get it back at Netflix they can have on record that it's their fault complaints are rolling in, it's their incompetence. Not customers. I want the head to see what's going on. When people start bouncing out of Netflix he will see why. What are they doing there? This company could be real hot too if they would just do it right. It's sad, because I told 3 of my boys to join and they did. Wait till I tell them I may be bouncing out now. LOL. For $22 a month I'd rather go back to Hollywood Video than get 3 movies a week. Even though if you compare the price to rent 3 movies a week from HV, it comes out more expensive, Netflix still is better. But, It was a better feeling knowing I was getting like 6 movies a week. To see it cut down kills me.
