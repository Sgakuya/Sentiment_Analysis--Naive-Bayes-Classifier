I thought Hanson's firt CD Middle Of Nowhere was a good CD, look how many good songs where on that one for 3 young kids from Tulsa. Now This Time Around came out and it has several good songs on it. They have matured so much since the first cd came out. The music has more to it and has more of a Rock/Pop style instead of just Pop.I enjoyed this cd more than the first and I liked the first cd. Wait until their next cd comes out, I'll bet it is more like Rock and Roll this time. Unlike N'Sync and The BackStreet Boys, Hanson plays their own instruments and write their own songs. Looking forward to their next cd.
