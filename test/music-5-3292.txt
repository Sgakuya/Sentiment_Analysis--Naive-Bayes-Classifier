Being a vocalist myself I immediately loved this album. The meaty guitar with the 4-5 part harmonies really rocked me. What I always snicker about now it the fact that the year that record broke (I think it was 75-76, I was 15-16)none of us even remotely considered the gay thing. The band was called Queen and we were just oblivious. It was some different world back then.
