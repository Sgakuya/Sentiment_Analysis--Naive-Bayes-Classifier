I've got to side with nbas696du. Don't get me wrong, Dave Matthews Band is a group of extremely talented musicians, but unfortunately the music they choose to make caters to fashion stoners and high school jocks/pretty boys looking for a sensitive angle to advance their date-rape schemes. And not to mention the cult members they have as a fan base, who live and die by THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEWS. Hey, bro, Dave and I are on a, like, first name basis, man. Like, totally. Ahunh, sweeeeet, dude.
