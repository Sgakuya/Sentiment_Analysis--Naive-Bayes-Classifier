Come on guys, let's face it, Fred Durst has no talent, either as an artist or a video director. First of all, the song terrible, with lyrics that any eighth-grader could've written, very simple instrumentation (mostly thanks to Fred Durst...guitarist Wes Borland left because Fred wouldn't let him truly show his talents), and horrible whiny vocals. And the video attempts to be daring and different, but just comes off at stupid. Seriously, looking at this video all I can think is WTF is this crap? It's gross too. It looks like this band's 15 minutes of fame are just about up, and I couldn't be happier.
