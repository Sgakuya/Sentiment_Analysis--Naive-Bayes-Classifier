ON 1-6-06 I WITNESSED AN EMPLOYEE BEING BELITTLED BY AN SUPERVISOR IN AN ILSE, WHERE I WAS SHOPPING IN THE NEXT ILSE I WAS VERY DISTURBED THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN ON A LATE NIGHT SHIFT BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER WAS VERY RUDE AND HORRIBLY TRAINED TO RUN A SHIFT OF EMPLOYEES DURING THEM HOURS AND NOT HAVING NO RESPECT FOR HERSELF OR OTHERS I WOULD NOT SHOP AT THIS STORE.
