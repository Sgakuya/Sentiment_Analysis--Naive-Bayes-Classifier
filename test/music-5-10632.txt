I don't get why eveyrone is always saying Avril Lavigne is just another pop artist! Most of the people who say all that, haven't even giving her a chnace and really listened to her music! If you just listen to her album ( Let Go ), you'd see how talented she is! Avril has a great voice and all her songs really have something to say, unlike Britney and Christina's.
