Give me a break. The only thing this guy knows how to do is set and shoot... have you ever seen this guy drive to the cup and create offense? So many people rave over this guy making clutch shots in important games. That is ALL HE CAN DO -- is make 3's when it counts. And actually when clutch shooters miss it is quickly forgotten. The term clutch is overrated.
