Black Star's raw lyricism and conscious skill prove that rap can be much better than the gansta, crunk and pop-rap is all over the radio and MTV these days. Mos Def and Talib Kweli are the perfect complements to each other's styles, and are a very potent combo on the mic. Both have gone on to successful solo careers and remain, in my mind, 2 of the best emcees in all of hip hop. Black Star is an absolute classic, a must-own for a real hip hop fan.
