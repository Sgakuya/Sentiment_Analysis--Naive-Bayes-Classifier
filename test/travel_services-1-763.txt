I went against my gut and rented from Advantage as opposed to a national rental company, due to a good deal on Expedia for $28/day from LAX for a full-size car (wanted an Impala, received a Dodge Stratus). I drove the car down to Orange County and parked it on a Monday night. When I was dropped off Wed. night to return to LAX, the car was completely Dead. After 30 minutes on hold, I had to have someone else take me to LAX, and had to leave the car in the hotel parking lot. Spent the entire 40 mile drive to LAX on hold trying to get through to someone. Finally got through and upon explaining the situation, was accused by Mafih that I had left the lights on or something and would be responsible for any tow/repair bills, or any damage during towing, to which I did not respond in kind. I rent a car under the premise that it is new and reliable, and if there is a problem will receive prompt and proper assistance, not paying for their junk's problems. This guy never recorded the call, never told anybody. When I called back the next day, had to go through everything all over again like the company, and the whole call center in San Antonio had Alzheimer's. Therefore they have even attempted to charge me for an extra day because they had no record of the calls and attempts to tell them the car was broken down. All that was on the rental receipt was an 800 number, and on the recording it gave emergency road side assistance number. Nothing on the agreement of who to call etc. The employees of this company are some of the worst I've dealt with, with an astonishingly uniform lack of customer service/satisfaction attitude. I spent the next 3 days talking to 3 different people, including the LAX station manager several times. It took them until Sat. to go and get the car. Unfortunately, I left my business portfolio in the front seat as it was dark and with no power did not see it when I jumped out in a hurry. Magically, not a single person who has towed the car, checked the car out, cleaned the car, found the portfolio, and it's gone. almost 10 hours of numerous phone calls, most to the branch manager, and it's still not resolved. Worst experience in 20 years of traveling
