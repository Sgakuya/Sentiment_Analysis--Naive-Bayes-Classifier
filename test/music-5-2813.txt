A great album, probably their best. I don't really listen to it anymore, as I bought it almost 20 years ago, and have heard almost every track about a billion times on the radio, when I listen to this band I'm likely to play the more obscure album tracks- but there's no denying that it's one of the best debut albums ever and enormously influential.
