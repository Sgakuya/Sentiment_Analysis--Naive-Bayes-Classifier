Not The Bends , or even OK Computer esq, this album is an aquired taste , especially if your more into Radiohead's guitar influnced stuff.However, Kid A takes a walk down the Massive Attack path, combining futuristic vocal sampling with crass 80's analogue malarky.Of course its experimental ut none the less this album is wicked, you just need to watch Bladerunner a few too many times first, then you'll get what Tom Yorke is all about!
