The Eagles are my favorite band of all time and they always will be! There wasn't a single song on this album that I didn't like. It would be nice if bands of today could make an enjoyable,ENTIRE, album. Then again, I'm talking about the greateset band of all-time. A person should just expect to be truly entertained listening to them.
