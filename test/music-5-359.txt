Why, oh, why, didn't rateitall separate rock into a separate category from pop? How can you even compare Radiohead to Ricky Martin? They couldn't be more different. Radiohead has so much creative talent and Yorke's vocals are so passionate, I feel like I want to cry during some of the songs on this cd. The music is so complex and the lyrics are intruiging. It's the music I never knew I wanted, but when I heard it, it seemed to be exactly what I needed. Now, if only Radiohead would go back to making albums like The Bends and OK Computer...Kid A seemed a bit off the wall for me.
