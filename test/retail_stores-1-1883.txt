I have always enjoyed shopping at Dillard's until today. I guess it is because I never returned anything before today. I bought a shirt for my husband that was too large and we wanted to enchange it for something else. The salesperson seemed to not want to help us at first and the manager was extremely rude and abrupt. Anyway, because of the 30 day policy and some other reason that they did not want us to know, we could not return the shirt. We still ended up purchasing some trousers which we almost did not buy because of what just happened. Anyway, Dillard's is no longer a favorite store for me.
