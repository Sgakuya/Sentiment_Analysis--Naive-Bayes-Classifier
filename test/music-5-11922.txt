I think TLC are the greatest female group. After bankruptcy, I believe they are back on top of the music game again. I love Fanmail because TLC knows that without the fans their music would be nothing. I love the song Unpretty because it makes me feel good inside. I feel good because I know that I am beautiful and do not need make-up to prove it.
