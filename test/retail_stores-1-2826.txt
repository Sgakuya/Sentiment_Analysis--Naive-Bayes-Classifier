12/24/05, Stonerige Mall location, Pleasanton CA: My husband purchased a gold necklance with pendant aprx $900. for my XMas gift. Athough it was a pretty necklace, it was not suited for me. I personally went back on 1/1/06 to return. Explained my situation, saleslady very understanding and explained husbands frequently purchase jewelry wives return. I was persuaded to browse for an exchange, by the saleslady. I found a necklance with a nice multi circle pendent, with pave' diamods. $35 More. Took it home, examined it, did not have the sparkle that it had under the store lights. Felt it was not the worth the money I spent. 1/9 went back to store to return, same sales lady, she said I needed my credit card to return. That day I did not have that particular card with me. She said come back with your cc and she would process my return, as I walked away she added, "enjoy it until you return it, you have 30 days." Went back on 1/10, different saleslady, said the manager is the only one who could process my return and he would not be available until 1/12. Called Manager at the store on 1/12 prior to driving there again. Manager, Wade, advised me no return will be honorded. He said store credit only or exchange. His exlanation was what I had done by returning the original XMas gift was considered a trade in, trade in's are not refunded. I' am currently pursing my refund, outcome pending.
