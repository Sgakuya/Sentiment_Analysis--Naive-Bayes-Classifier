It took me a while to warm up to the first Mermaid Avenue, but, once I did, there was a two week period where I didn't listen to anything else. After playing Vol. II a few times, the same thing seems to be happening. Apparently the majority of both CDs was recorded during the same sessions, so it's not surprising that Vol. II seems to capture the same spirit as Vol. I.
