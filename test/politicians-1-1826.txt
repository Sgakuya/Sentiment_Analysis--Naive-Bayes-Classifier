What a D*ckhead this jerk is. It is beyond me how a pompous a** right winger from Michigan like this can get elected in Massachusetts. Whats worse, his PR stunts running on the conservative ticket for 2008 presidential election, and he's govenor of the token blue state Massachusetts? Who'd have thought. That will surely capture the attention of red America and it's rather frightening.
