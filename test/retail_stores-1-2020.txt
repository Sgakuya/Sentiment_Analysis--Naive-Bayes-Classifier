Recently went in to purchase a product that was listed in weekly ad (wasn't in stock) and asked if one could be shipped from another store. They denied my reguest and tried to sell me another model at a higher price. Also one employee told us buying Roadrunner gets instant credit of 50 dollars. After we had it installed we took the receipt back and was told it was a mail in rebate.
