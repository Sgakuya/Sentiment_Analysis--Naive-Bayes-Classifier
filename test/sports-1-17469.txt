Unfortunately there is no rating below 1 star. What a bunch of whining preschoolers! There is a reason so many teams passed on Moss, he is a morally bankrupt delinquent(however talented he may be)that no one needs in the locker room or on the playing field. I play when I want to? What kind of Barbara Streisand is that? No one on that team has the class or work ethic of a Rice, Favre, Elway... I could think of a hundred examples. Anyway I'm not going to waste any more words on the lamest team in professional football. Oh, maybe one more word. CHOKE!
