I love the album - it s got wonderful and extremly deep lyrics and the music in very sensitive. Feels like Sting really is a grown up now... It really touched me. I guess you have to have a certain mind-set to understand what s going on in his song...what he s trying to say. The only thing that I missed was Vinnie Colaiuta playing drums on all tracks; he just played on a few this time! He s simply the best drummer walking on this planet! ;-) In my humble opinion...Hope he ll be back on the road with Sting sometime soon.
