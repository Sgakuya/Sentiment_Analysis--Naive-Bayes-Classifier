This CD is awesome. I mean it--well, it's a collection of the hits, so you'd expect it to be great, but still. Many songs from their earlier CDs are there, including favorites like Shine and Breakfast, and popular songs like Joy and Woo-Hoo. Lots of variety in the songs, I thought. God Is Not a Secret (featuring Tobymac) was admittedly a little different from the Newsboys typical style, but it was a fun break in the CD. Very well done, five stars.
