A leftist elitist who failed miserably in her Health Reform initiaitve. Moved to New York and was elected by the sheeple of that state. She has not done anything. She is not really that bright nor is she particularly articulate. She is cunning, wise, clever, power hungry, and agressive. Her style of lecturing the American people wears thin. Kerry will not get elected because she and Bill will see to it. Otherwise she will not be able to run in 08. We will see what her staying power really is.
