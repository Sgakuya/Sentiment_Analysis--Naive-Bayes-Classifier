Although I enjoyed their reasonable prices on a couple of occasions, this hasn't made it worthwhile getting charged for damage that appeared after I returned the car to their secure car park. Damage I wasn't informed about until 30 hours after the branch opened, and damage I have been unable to see to document on threat of being billed for time out of service!
