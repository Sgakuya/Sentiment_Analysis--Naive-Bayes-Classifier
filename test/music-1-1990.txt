Why are all artists releasing a new album of their greatest hits. And they all are awful. This one is no exception. This Cd could bore you to tears, if you actually spent the time to listen to it. Besides 2 or 3 songs, the Cd is not a good collaboration of Lenny Kravitz hits. The record company should be ashamed of themselves.
