He coached one season in the NFL (8-8 by the way, with a Parcells roster) and people make him out to be the second coming. George Welsh has forgotten more football than Groh knows. As far as recruiting, nobody has done less with more. He routinely has a stockpile of blue chippers, and can't do squat with them. Give those players to Coker, Friedgen, Beamer, etc. and they's be a BCS team yr in and yr out.
