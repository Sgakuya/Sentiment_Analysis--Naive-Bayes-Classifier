Ms Reno did a terrible job as Attorney General. It was a contant battle between her conscience and her slavish devotion to Bill Clinton. Consequently,she ended up satisfying neither. Why do people like this never feel any shame over their performance? Why do they often think they deserve another chance? Writing a book might be a better idea IF she were brutally honest about her decisions while heading up the Justice Dept, but that will never happen.
