An alcoholic maniac. I hope his liver is so inflamed that it pushes the rest of his organs against his rib cage and causes him unimaginable agony. If there is justice in the world than no more severe alcholics will get into positions of power comparable with this one. (Just look at Bush, as IF he quit drinking, and even if he did he still behaves like an alcoholic.)
