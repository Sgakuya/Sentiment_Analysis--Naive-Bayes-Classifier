Never liked this store or other exclusionary chains like it. think Abercrombie is bad for the youthful moral of the country. is another in a LONG LINE of corporate devices used to keep the youth dumb to the world around them and their parents constantly in debt. also--obviously owned by pedifilers based on the trashy catalogs and in store billboards. all the clothes look the same, thus making the nation look the same thus ruining everyone's sense of individual worth....strictly EVIL.
