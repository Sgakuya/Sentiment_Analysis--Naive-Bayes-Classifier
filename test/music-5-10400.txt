This was his first, but not the last. This debut CD made Josh a household name. The young man is incredible! His selection of music is perfect for his voice--so powerful and clear. He can sing anything, but the selections in French, Italian, and Spanish are the most wonderful songs I have ever heard. And he will only get better with time, if that is possible. Go buy his CDs and DVDs to experience this incredible talent for yourself.
