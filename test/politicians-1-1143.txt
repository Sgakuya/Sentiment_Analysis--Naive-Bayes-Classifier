sorry all -there is a COMPLETE misunderstanding of why schr√∂der acted in the iraq conflict like he did: hes surely not mr.chiracs asslicker. the opposite is right: he was so happy to found any other politician who supported his policy. cause he did the policy to win an election campaign, that was nearly lost. in general hes the wakest most opportunistic chancellor we had so long. this is why he said: we ll NEVER Will take part. neither when the UN decides so. in comparison mr. chirac hat a clear position. but he has other abilities. he is a master of speech without content. and he has a good feeling about public relations. so he likes to give very different roles - always that one which gives him the biggest support. to be understood right: i liked his decision, not to take in a war that was made for national interests not for humanity. cause otherwise i m asking myself where the pressure is on such autocratic systems like saudi arabia. that are called friends. or where the troups are that helping the people in the genozid of ruanda. where no oil exists. but this is another subject. up to now his the most worse chancellor germany ever saw. he has no visions, no values. but he likes to stay in power.
