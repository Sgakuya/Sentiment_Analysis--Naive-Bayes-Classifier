This is one talented young man! He is not 'opera', and has never claimed to be. He was labeled that because of the Italian songs he sings. He puts so much emotion into his songs, you almost believe this young man has experienced a long, full life. I only wish I were 30 years yonger (I'm 50). I have loved music of all kinds, but noone has ever had this effect on me.
