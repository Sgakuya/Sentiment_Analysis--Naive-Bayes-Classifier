Bill Clinton promised when inagurated that his would be the most ethical administration in history. HA! Filegate, Whitewater, Chinagate, Zippergate, impeachment, perjury, obstruction of justice, sexual assault, sexual harassment, turning the army into the Red Cross with guns, losing the US Nuclear codes! He was a terrrible president and a terrible man. It is too bad I have to give him a score of 1, he deserves a 0.
