I don't know what the big deal is about Tim Hortons! I guess it's true that money can buy you a lot of sex appeal! I know there's not enough of them around, but I think Country Style rocks!..They used to suck big time, but in the past year, I think they've totally changed everything for the better. I think it's just a matter of time before Country Style kicks Tim's butt! Before you think I'm blowing hot air, think about the following: Tim Hortons coffee comes from those little vacuum packs. Country Style coffee is whole beans like you see at a higher end place for the same price. Donuts? Fuggedaboutit! Country Style donuts are huge. And yes, fresh, NOT frozen. And Roll up the Rim to try again? With Country Style's Turn Up a Winner contest, you win something every time. I've collected about $12 worth of prizes already, and I'm not even a heavy coffee drinker! To all you Tim Heads, next time you see a Country Style, I invite you to just go inside and give it a try...and tell me what you think!!!
