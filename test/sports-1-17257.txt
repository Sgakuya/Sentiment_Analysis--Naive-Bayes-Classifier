How great is it to see this franchise struggling? And, it isn't like they have good things on the horizon. They aren't a young team, Aikman is a hit away from retirement, Emmitt is one of the best ever to play the game, but he is an old 31, and their defense is awful. It is time for Jerry Jones to fire himself as GM and bring in someone who knows what he is doing. As a Cowboys hater, however, I rest easy knowing that he'll never do that.
