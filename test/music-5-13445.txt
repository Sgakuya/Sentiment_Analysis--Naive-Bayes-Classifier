No amount of hatin' from all y'all dumb mo***af***az can stop Bone from being the, undoubtably, the greatest rap group of all time. They did it once, twice, thrice, they did it best... no rapper in the world can equal Bone's talent. So whatever y'all Bone hataz say, there ain't no other rapper out there who is nearly as good as Bone. And that's a fact.
