company has outsourced american jobs to india, whose customer service either doesn't understand or doesn't have access to correct account info. company has owed me $$ for several months now because of csr mistake! we should make an effort to support businesses that hire our citizens, since they profit from our business and tax laws!! just trying to avoid paying a living wage.
