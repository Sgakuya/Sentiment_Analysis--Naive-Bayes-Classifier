Al Gore is not a bad man. He will tell you anything you want to here. The true definition is a co-dependent. So far we have heard that he wants to do away with guns in one state; he then comes to the South and tries to reassure people that he only want to take the guns away from criminals. He has been part of an administration that has not enforced the tough gun laws on the books. He also says he will give tax breaks to the people who need it. He supported Clinton's tax break .. My taxes went up and my family income is less that $75,000. Who did it help? Not the majority of Americans who live in the middle and pay the majority of taxes. He has supported policies that have hurt me personlly and hurt the population in general. It is time for new blood and life in Wachington.
