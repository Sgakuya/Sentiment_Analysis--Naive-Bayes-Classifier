This is too funny, I just had this for the 1st time today. Everyone at work was raving about this pizza.Cheap, you cook it at home. Went there, I thought this is cool, the workers were very friendly, the place was clean, the pizza looked awesome as I brought it home. Hmmm, we cook it on this cardboard tray ? It was done, I have never had any food in my life with so much grease on it.I got through one piece, finished half of the second,and i was full and nauseated.This was awful. My grlfriend got sick, you know the kind of sick where you have to run to the bathroom alot?? After we were done the 3/4th's remaining pizza sat there on the counter, it must have weighed 20 lbs after the grease solidified as it cooled.
