I got the CD expecting to hear beautiful songs such as one voice , but when I listened to it, I was embarressed, because my parents were listening to it, and this 12 yr old kid was singing about love and serious relationships. Totally not anything like one voice. I hate it. it's a bad CD and I would never buy any Billy Gilman product again!
