Corporate welfare, tax cuts for billionaires, government secrecy, warmongering. Bush Jr. is a puppet for America's most evil interests. He can't even string together a coherent sentence. It's disgraceful. And the blatant hypocracy of being so eager to send young Americans off to war after having dodged the draft himself. The Texas National Guard wasn't too rough an assignment during Vietnam, and he didn't even show up for that.
