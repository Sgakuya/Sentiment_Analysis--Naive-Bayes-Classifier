It goes without saying that Lloyd needs to go. What I hope won't happen again WHEN Lloyd gets canned is promoting someone from within the organization. Michigan needs to hire a head coach who has no prior affiliation with the University of Michigan Athletic Department. The last two coaches (Gary and Lloyd) were both former coaches under Bo. WE NEED NEW BLOOD. I only hope that once a new coach is hired, he will bring in all of his own people (i.e. fire the entire coaching staff, not just the head coach). Only then do I believe we have a chance to restore the team we once knew as a national contender.
