I give Mr Clinton one star,sorry system does not go any lower.most of the comments on this man hit close to the mark,maybe if Bill Clinton had not dodged the draft he would understand words like,honesty,integrity,commitment and duty.How a man can sit in the white house and claim to care about the country he refused to help defend amazes me.His legacey should be,I held an job I had no right to.I bet him and Hillery laugh there asses off every night.
