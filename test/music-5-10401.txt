Josh Groban,apart from being a terribly handsome man,has the voice of an angel and the lyrics of a genius.His songs have helped so many people in so many ways that its impossible to keep count-i am one of those people....His inspirational songs and phenominal voice saved me from suicide....there's no sugar coating such a thing....He will always and forever remain my favorite singer and if you can see this Josh,i just wanted to say thank you,for literally saving my life....
