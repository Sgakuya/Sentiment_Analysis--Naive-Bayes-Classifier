RUN AWAY FAST!!! These people are the worste. I gave a deposit of $1,000 for a $5,000 engagement ring. I left it to be sized and they had switched the stone with another cracked and yellow stone. I tried to get my money back so I could use towards another ring elsewhere but their management won't give back. No one knows how to fix this and eeven the senior management are idiots. DO NOT BUY HERE!!! IF you need to build up credit, better to go to smaller jewelry stores.
