It's a toss up between Oakland, Detroit, Jacksonville, and these guys as to who's the worst team in the NFL. The ships at San Diego's Navy bases should shoot the stadium when they practice to end the agony their fans must surely go through. Watching Drew Brees play is like watching a Mexican donkey show... terribly wrong yet strangely you keep watching it. Now they are starting Doug Flutie. The best thing about him is that he had a crappy Corn Flakes imitation cereal made with his name on it, and it tastes like eating sawdust. Flutie had no arm whatsoever when he could still play, and now old age has robbed him of his scrambling ability. David Boston is a horrible leader, and LaDanian Tomlinson is damned to obscurity on this weak and fragile team. If he's smart he'll demand a trade to a better team... no wait, is there a worse one?
