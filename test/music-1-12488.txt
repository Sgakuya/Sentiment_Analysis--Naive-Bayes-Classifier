Wait a minute, TuPac had a hit? He had greatest hits? Wouldn't that counter the fact the TuPac had no talent and only sold albums because of his phony, MTV tough guy gangsta image and the fact that he was a pretty bitch that looked like he took it on the down low pretty regular. Looks like lots of people are making lots of money of this guy, long after he's dead. Those people don't respect him, even though he was just a little bitch wannabe gangsta, nobody respects that, to be a ganagsta is to be a punk, a little boy desperate to be a man. No matter how much all those punks talk about respect they don't know what it is, how to earn it or gain it or what to do with it once it's there. I'll bet he's sitting up in Heaven right now, grateful he doesn't have to pose anymore.
