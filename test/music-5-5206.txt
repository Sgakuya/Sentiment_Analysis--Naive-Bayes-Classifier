Hank Williams influenced so many country singers in his short life. Listen to this great CD of his greatest hits and you'll know why. He set the standard of a great country song of a love gone bad, of a cheating heart, and even managed to add a few bouncy tunes. I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry is quite possibly the greatest country song ever written and to hear Hank Williams sing it will bring chills. Move it on Over is a catchy tune. Jambayla is a classic. There are so many great songs on this CD. Good introduction to him.
