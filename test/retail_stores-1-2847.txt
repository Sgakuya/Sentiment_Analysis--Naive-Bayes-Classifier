My husband and I use to buy everything from there. They change employee's all the time. After losing all 4 of the best girls that the Lakeland, Florida store had and put in the new male manager, it has been terrible. Very unfriendly and they act like you are bothering them to see something. I am VERY disappointed and I will never shop there and tell everyone that I know, not to shop there. Deborah Wright
