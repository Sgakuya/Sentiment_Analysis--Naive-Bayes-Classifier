this guy admitted after conceeding the election that he never really wanted to be a politician, and that he was pushed in that direction by his old man. Great. How could anyone like a man who doesn;t care one bit about his job? Would you like it if you were going for surgery and your doctor said he was going through the motions to please his daddy, and didn't care about the job? SCARY.
