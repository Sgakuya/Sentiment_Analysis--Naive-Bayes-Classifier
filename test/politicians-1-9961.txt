I'm going to level with you all: I don't think much of our President. I don't like Dubya because I think he's arrogant. To me and many people who don't agree with the President, he struts around like a peacock. He's an ideologue. He acts as though his policies and decisions are absolutely infallible. Anyone who dares disagree with him is anti-American and/or terror-loving. Allow me to get on my soap-box for a minute to say that it isn't anti-American in my way of thinking, at least, to be opposed to measures that increase the government's ability to spy on its citizens (Patriot Act). Neither is it anti-American to be opposed to torture, which is not (or at least should not) be the American way. Bush honestly did do well right after 9/11. But only days after 9/11, the tone of political discourse changed. All of a sudden, everything that Bush did was absolutely correct, and anyone who disagreed was aiding terrorists. It's one thing to want unity after a national disaster. It's another thing altogether to act as though anyone who disagrees in the least with the President's decisions is anti-American. First Amendment rights to free speech apply even during tragic times! I really dislike Bush's connections to right-wing Christians. If he were merely politically conservative, I might cut him some slack. But he seems to allow his policy to be dictated by extremists like Jerry Falwell and others like him, and it frankly makes me sick. There is very little worse than a fundamentalist with an agenda. Yes, I dislike the way in which Bush not only marketed the war in Iraq but his handling of the war following our decision to invade. Dubya painted Kerry as a "flip-flopper" during the last election. Maybe Kerry is a flip-flopper, but many Americans seem to forget that Bush changed the rationale for going into war several times, always acting as though the previous rationale had never been given as a reason for invading Iraq. First it was WMD. Then the war was all about liberating the Iraqis (a valid cause, as Saddam was evil and the Iraqis deserved better). Now, Dubya and his supporters are saying that we went into war because Saddam was a bad guy. Saddam was a bad guy; you'll get no argument from anyone in this country. But Dubya should have used that as his rationale in the beginning rather than change the story when it was politically expedient. Now we have a President who claims to be a Christian of high morals, though he vows to veto a bill to ban torture. Some Christian. That's just my opinion.
