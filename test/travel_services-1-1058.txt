First, they showed up late! Then, they took there sweet time loading up their truck and taking cigarette breaks. They even stopped several times to make up some drama over a garden snake that had wandered into my garage. After finally getting to the new place, they charged me for an extra hour that hadn't even happened. Meanwhile they unloaded and threw my things into my home as fast as they could- not concerned that they broke several of my items. I even caught one of the guys stealing from me!!!! After they left I realized that my brand new washer had a part broken off the back that ended up costing my $200! The adjuster came to look for five minutes and now when I call their number has been disconnected!! STAY AWAY!!!!!
