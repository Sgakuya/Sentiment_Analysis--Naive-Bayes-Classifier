Try Netflix...to hell with Blockbuster. No late fees, incompetant employee's to deal with. Have had problems of all sorts from Blockbuster for years, can't believe I have maintained my membership this long. Last straw..purchased popcorn sweet & salty the most disgusting tasting popcorn I have ever tasted. Went to return one unused tub and they would not accept. Rather than lose $1.50 they definately lost a $20+ per week customer. Stay away from them if you can...they are the worst, hopefully they will become obsolete in the near future.
