I Hop in stockbridge GA is not a good place to eat. They don't know how to make an omlet, theres are tasteless, when you ask for baked herb chicken then give you dried out fried chichen, there seasoned red potatoes are extremely salty and when someone asks for a steak well done they don't know what well done meas and gave here one med.well. I will probably never eat there again because the cook dosne't know how to cook.
