The guy loves to flip flop on many very important subjects. One day he loves the war on Iraq the next day he hates it make up your god damn mind. The idiot doesnt even have a vice president yet and the voting day is in November he needs to get in the game or there is no way he can win. I am so glad Kerry is runnig against Bush because thats just one more reason why bush is going to win. Oh yea he has an enourmousley big head.
