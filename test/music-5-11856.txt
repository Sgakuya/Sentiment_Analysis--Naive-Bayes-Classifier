Yeah, I also think that it's not Blink's best album, but you should definitly check it out and buy it cuz it's good. I think that The Mark Tom and Travis Show is their best cd, but they only had it for a limited time(i feel like one of those guys on the commercials, you know? But this is only for a limited time!) and for all you guys out there that got that CD, enjoy it! But going back to Take Off your Pants and jacket, it's a great cd, check it out, I think you'll enjoy it.
