This guy has been on my Ignore List (along with folks like Rosie O'Donnell, Joan Rivers, and Jerry Springer) since 1992. I'll never forget the night I turned on the Republican Convention and I saw Pat Buchanan just absolutely spewing hatred. His hate-filled rant was certainly a far cry from George Bush Sr's. A Thousand Points of Light speech at the 1988 Republican Convention. Anyway, I turned off Buchanan in mid-rant and I have been ignoring him ever since.
