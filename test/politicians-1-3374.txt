Although I like him personally (would love to go out for a drink with him, even if he only had ice tea), his policies and actions will prove to make him out as one of the worst, if hot the worst, president the US has ever had. And I was a Republican until the last election when I switched out of sheer discouragement. Looking back the only kudos I can give him is his general openness, in that he does communicate with the press and citizens quite often.
