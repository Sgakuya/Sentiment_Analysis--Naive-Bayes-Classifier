Tom waits greatest album and one of the best albums ive ever heard. Clinking clanking booming percussion, lazy new-orleans sax, drunken piano. Like an opera, performed by a bunch of homeless jazz and blues musicians. The album starts with the line 'we sail tonight for singapore, we're all as mad as hatters here...' and it continues on with amazingly vivid and descriptive lyrics, all through this beautiful album. Buy it, borrow it, download it, just get it and give it a few listens before you make up your mind, because it is quite different.
