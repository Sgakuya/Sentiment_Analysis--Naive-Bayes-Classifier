Say what you want, but this is a great album. I picked up my $5 ticket to see Oasis at the original 9:30 Club in Wash, DC when I first heard Supersonic (1994-ish)...then went out and picked up this album. I wasn't disappointed one bit. They don't exactly put on a great show, but Noel can certainly write a song. Sad that this album is rated so poorly...but not many have rated it yet.
