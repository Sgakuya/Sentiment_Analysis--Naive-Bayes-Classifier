ICK! Had the misfortune of flying on BA recently on a business trip. Admittedly, I was looking forward to trying out their new first class seats, but what a let down. They were so uncomfortable that I almost volunteered to go back to ecomony class to spread out back there. The meals were cold when they were edible, and the crew was the surliest I have ever encountered. Next time I will insist on Continental.
