I just have to say that you people that freak out about it 'not being punk,' grow up!! Good God, what does 'punk' mean anyway? Now adays, 'punk,' which used to be a group of people that wanted to be different, is just another clique, exactly what 'punks' didn't want to be. There is a stereotype for 'punks' now too? Isn't that what you 'punks' didn't want? Hmmm...anyway, Good Charlotte is one of my favorite bands, and definately my favorite PUNK band.
