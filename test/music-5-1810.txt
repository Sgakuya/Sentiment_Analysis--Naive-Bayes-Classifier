THIS IS A GREAT CD! MAYBE IT'S NOT AS PUNK AS THEIR OTHER CDS, BUT SO WHAT? IT'S STILL A GREAT CD! IT HAD GREAT SONGS LIKE CASTAWAY, WHICH IS A TOTALLY COOL SONG AND BLOOD, SEX, AND BOOZE WHICH IS A VERY COOL AND FUNNY SONG! I LOVE THIS CD NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS. BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT THE THE SONG HOLD ON HAS A GREAT MESSAGE AND IT'S A GREAT SONG TOO!
