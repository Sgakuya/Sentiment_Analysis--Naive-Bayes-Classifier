Yes, Saddam was/is evil. Yes, he killed his own peole. Hey, guess what? He was put into power by the CIA. The West sold him WMDs. He's a tyrant. You can't call him a Muslim because he clearly did not follow Islamic ideology, also he changed faith to get popularity. He wasn't a socialist either you ignorant pricks. He and Dubya are as bad as each other. But he does have a very impressive mustache.
