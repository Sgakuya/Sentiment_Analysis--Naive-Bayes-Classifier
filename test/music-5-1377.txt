Any one that would give this album a one star is not really listening to what has been done. Without a doubt this is the best album of the eighties and one of the top ten albums ever made. I wasn't even a fan of U2 when this album came out, but after listening to it several times something happened. Everytime I listened to it afterwards it got better and better. If it wasn't for the jerks trying to bring it down just by voting with one star it would be at the top or very near the top. I don't believe that anyone who listens to this album completely through ten times can come away from it and not think that it is a true masterpiece.
