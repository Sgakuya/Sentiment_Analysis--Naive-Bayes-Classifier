GRAY DAVIS IS A UNABLE TO LEAD. HE BLAMES EVERYONE AND DOES NOTHING TO HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS. IF HE WANTS TO HIRE TWO OF GORE'S HACKERS AT $30,000 PER MONTH THEN HE SHOULD USE HIS OWN MONEY. WHAT RETURN ON THE DOLLAR WILL THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA GET FOR THIS MONEY? HOW WILL IT SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS? TO INVITE BUSH AND THEN RUN ADS TO TRASH HIM, SHOWS THE MENTALITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. BUSH IS RIGHT. WE NEED TO SOLVE OUR OWN PROBLEMS. WE JUST NEED TO GET THE RIGHT LEADERS TO DO IT.
