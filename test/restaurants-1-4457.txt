i only went here one time but, that was surely enough. we ordered that onion thing, and it was so greasy and it didnt taste all that great. i ordered a pasta and chicken dish that was atrocious. the sauce was cold, the pasta was stuck together and the chicken was leathery and had no flavor. this restaurant is a definite no-go.
