I loved his concert. It was the first ever that I had been to. Every song, one right after the other was made beautiful by his voice. He is funny too. I loved his one liners. He not only has a beautiful voice and great sense of humor, but he also has immense character. The love he has for his fans is unmatched by any other singer. The man is synonymous with love.
