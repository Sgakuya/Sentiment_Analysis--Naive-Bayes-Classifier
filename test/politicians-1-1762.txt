Divisive and short sighted, to this governor everything looks like a nail. Gives short shrift to logical needs for mass transit in favor of double decking freeways that will still bottleneck at the same old exits. Just another republican toady paving paradise. Could it be a coincidence that she comes from Hawaii's largest car dealership family? (Cutter) Her support of GW Bush is just shy of zomboid, and her secret (yet highly publicized photo op) trips to Israel on the state dime are worse than irresponsible when we're in such a fiscal crunch and embroiled in an unjust war in the middle east. Lousy, shameful and uninellgent leadership.
