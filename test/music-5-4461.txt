Just saw Josh in Vegas last week...my 3rd concert since July '04. He's becoming more comfortable with his music and himself on stage! He has a rare talent and the ability to turn any song into gold. He has wisely chosen incredible support of musicians equally as talented as him. Considering that the public has shifted its' desire to family-friendly entertainment, Josh Groban is the one entertainer who will keep that promise.
