I'd heard that this was their worst album as well - but to be honest I don't think it is. Garbage seem to evolve their sound with each album, and I think that the evolution with beautifulgarbage is a good step. Its more funkier, still has the strong dark lyrics to boot. If you say that you don't like it, listen to it a bit more and see if your opinion stays the same.
