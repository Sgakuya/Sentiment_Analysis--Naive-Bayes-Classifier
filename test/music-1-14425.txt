Didn't see the movie, but I saw the video and that was rather inventive. Liked that a lot. - From 11/29/01. Okay, now I have seen the movie... AND IT SUCKED!!! I couldn't stand this piece of garbage. Nearly became only the second movie I have ever turned off without watching the whole thing. The music? Can you say CAMPY? Reworking rock and roll songs in an early 20th century setting? I thought the medley was good, but the rest was just GARBAGE. I can not believe this movie was nominated for anything, let alone best picture.
