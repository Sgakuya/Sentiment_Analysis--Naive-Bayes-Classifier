Rock should be fun and not up its own a*se with all that crap about 'my life being a pile of s**t' to whit the execrable Radiohead, Kurt Cobain, Smiths etc. Wallow in your own misery in private you self-centred nerds. VH along with Aerosmith, Motley Crue have never taken themselves seriously. VH 1 is a classic party rock album with seminal guitar pyrotechnics that paved the way for a whole new generation of axewielders. 'Eruption' 'Running with the devil' and 'Aint talking about love' are the highlights in a solid album wiht no fillers.
