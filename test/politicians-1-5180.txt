madd on 11/14/00 Does anybody care about how the Presedential Election is looking like a race for a selectman in a small town? How about the stock market costing everybody thousands of dollars because Gore or Bush will not concede. Bush is the man to run this country and Gore should be ashamed of himself for what he is doing to the Presedential Election process.
