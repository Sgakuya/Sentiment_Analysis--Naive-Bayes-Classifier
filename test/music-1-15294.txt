This is one of the only CD's I've ever thrown away! SO TERRIBLE! You can switch to any track on the album, and it sounds exactly the same. I love all music, especially electronic...trance, techno, breaks, jungle, ambient, etc... but this minimalistic techno is just a cheesy way of labeling a crappy album. Boom......booooom......boooom...just bass the whole album through, very very bad music.
