i think this album is fantastic i wasn't even into rapp before slim shady. i have to admit i started of likeing marshall because i thought he was fine.i think this album is the best music i have heard in a long time. i have so much respect for Marshall he's had a hard life and all his rapps are honest my favourite rapp is stan and the way i am, but i like all of them. My least favourite is Amityville.
