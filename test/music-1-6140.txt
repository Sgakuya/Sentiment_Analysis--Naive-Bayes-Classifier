Wining, complainig, and basic hashed riffs. Fred Durst is like the little brother that won't shut up. Now I understand why Wes left the group (other than the fact the band lacks of musical talent).When you want a real song about standing up for yourself. Don't go to 'Break Stuff, go to Pantera's 5 Minutes Alone off of Far beyond Driven. That's music!! This is not!
