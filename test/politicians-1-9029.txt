Personally - charming, morally flexible, if not bankrupt; thieving, deceptive, adulterous, gluttonous, immature, greedy, and selfish. Politically - astute, charismatic, intelligent,often well-advised, corrupt, manipulative, subversive of the US processes of government. A shining beacon of human sewage elevated to the highest elected office in the nation, if not the world - to set an example for a generation of how loathsome you can be and still get ahead. Wonderful.
