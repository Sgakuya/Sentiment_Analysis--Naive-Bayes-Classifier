GARBAGE. The only redeeming thing for this game is the cool ESPN Sportscenter integration. After the coolness of that wears off you're left with a horrendous football game with cheesy music, sfx, play selection, gameplay... I could go on and on. You can get this for $7.99 used if you really want it, but I'd stay away if I were you.
