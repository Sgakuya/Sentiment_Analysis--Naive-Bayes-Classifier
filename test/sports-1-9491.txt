Eric Snow is a terrible basketball player. I've met hundreds and hundreds of guys in the gym who are better basketball players than Eric Snow. There should be never be a guard in the NBA who regularly misses a wide open 10 foot jumper. Every year as the new season begins, all the sixers fans pray every night that some foolish team takes him off our hands. I'd start frickin' carrot top at point over snow, and that's no lie.. at least he'd know not to shoot.
