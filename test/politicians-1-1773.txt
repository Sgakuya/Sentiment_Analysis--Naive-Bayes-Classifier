Mark sanford is a horrible Gov. because he plans to charge for medicaid and and attempts to privitize the states public service authority,santee cooper, which could result in a 40% power bill increase for many south carolinians. And for the non wealthy people he is attempting to give the wealthiest people tax cut which could result in costing the state billions of dollars and which would have caused credit rates to fall even more, and while trying to put the state iv a debt hole he still hasn't even addressed the high property taxes. Now that does not sound like a good gov. to me now does it?!
