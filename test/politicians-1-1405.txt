A prissy leader for a prissy country. He's definitely hiding something. Somewhere he has ties to Saddam. Secret deals or something. He's had all the proof in the world about how dangerous Saddam's regime is and insists that going to war is wrong because were dealing with life and death here. Tell that to the opressed people in Iraq who continue to witness people being murdered by the thousands under Saddam. Tell that to the american families of the victims of the terrorist attacks. THE LAST TIME THE FRENCH DEMANDED THIS MUCH PROOF OF HOW DANGEROUS A REGIME IS IT ROLLED RIGHT THROUGH THEIR COUNTRY CARRYING GERMAN FLAGS WITH BIG SWASTIKA'S ON THEM!!
