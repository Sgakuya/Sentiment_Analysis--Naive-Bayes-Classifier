McDonald's is Terrible! Just look at Supersize me. That man ate McDonald's for one monh and he got so fat. He bloated up faster than you can say hullaballoo! McDonald's food is fattenning, disgusting, and stale. They cook their food in the morning then leave it out all day for anyone to eat. Ther fries are salter than the Dead Sea. You can see the blood in their chicken sandwiches. Their milkshakes are made up of syrup. And much more! Sorry, but if you expect me to eat there, I'll pass!
