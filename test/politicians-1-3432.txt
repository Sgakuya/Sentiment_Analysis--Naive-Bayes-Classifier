I'd give zero stars if I could. This president is very uninvolved with policy. He doesn't read and inform himself enough to take an independent stance within his administration. By most accounts, he has little to say during meetings (he exudes a very Reaganesque level of involvement). The problem with this is, he is very easily influenced and manipulated by others in his administration. These people may have very vested interests and they care very little about the legacy they are creating that will be attached to Bush's name and reputation. He could change all this by informing himself, and for all I know, if he had informed himself he would have made very different decisions.
