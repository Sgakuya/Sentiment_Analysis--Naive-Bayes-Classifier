I'm guessing that the high percentage of 1-star ratings given to this category is the result of people who don't like Rod's voice or don't like Rod's disco. Maggie May , Mandolin Wind , Tomorrow is a Long Time ; if only they knew what a great collection of songs this is- some covers, some originals, rocking and heartfelt- for this album and those classics at the beginning of your career (plus your recent battles with cancer)- I'll say this: bless your cotton socks.
