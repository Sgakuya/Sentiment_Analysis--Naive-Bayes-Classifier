If there is one thing I can credit Al Gore saying, it was his speech AFTER the election. He said that he would wait until ALL the votes were recounted and whoever had the higher number of votes was the winner. He added that he would accept the recount no matter who came out the winner. But then Al has made other statements that he later either retracted or claimed he didn't say. If he means what he says THIS TIME, he will call off the menions who are stirring up the press. I haven't seen that yet. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with a confused country waiting for our next President, yes, but it also leaves us with a country that is tearing itself apart (thanks ABC,NBC,CBS,MSNBC,CNN,and all the entertainment seekers). If the Palm Beach voters are allowed the revote, watch the bloodsport begin! Then ALL of Flordia will want the same, then the rest of the States will cry'foul', and all hell will brake loose in Floria with every activist group in the country trying to influence the revote. The country needs closure on this election. The law needs to be followed. NO revote! Al Gore needs to control his comrades. Bush,too. And let's all calm down and move on.
