Were I ever unfortunate enough to be trapped in one of these concerts, I would cheerfully pay serious money to be allowed out. And by the way, one does not have to have attended one of this talentless dweeb's concerts to rate it. One only has to listen to said talentless dweeb's febrile attempts to manipulate his vocal chords, and one has all the information one needs. Unless of course, one is a mallethead, or a Clay Aiken fan. Sorry for repeating myself there. And as for sljones who seems to have had a taste bypass at birth, here's a clue: a sugar frosted turd is still a turd. Comparing this hollow, media created, limited range high school quality singer with the likes of Sinatra and Elvis, is like comparing the writing style of sljones with William Faulkner.
