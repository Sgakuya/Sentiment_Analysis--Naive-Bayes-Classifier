This is a classic. With the exception of Around the world and Da Funk , every track on Homework was grounbreaking in the disco-house genre. When this album first came out, every house DJ in the Chicago area played these tracks into the ground. Daft Punk changed the sound of house music. Almost every house record that came out after Homework had filtered disco loops in it. In fact, Daft Punk pretty much started the whole French House genre. great for at-home listening or for DJs.
