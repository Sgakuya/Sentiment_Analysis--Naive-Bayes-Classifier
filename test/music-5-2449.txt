This was the first Beatles album I ever bought and listened to. I did it my second year of college, and the very first time I ever heard Eleanor Rigby, I knew that this was the greatest band of the 20h century, and I would be in for a huge treat. I fell in love with the entire album, and the Beatles motivated me to study music. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the Beatles from 1964-1966, during their time of greatest growth. This album should be treated with the highest respect, and if you believe it deserves any less, you really need to educate yourself on the methods of making quality, eternal music.
