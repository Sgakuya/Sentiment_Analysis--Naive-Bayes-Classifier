Have you ever noticed that when a J. Crew item was manufactured in a Western nation, J. Crew catalogs note the items origin: made in Italy, USA, UK, Canada, Scotland, etc.? However, when an item was manufactured in the 3rd world, J. Crew catalogs note the item as imported. Usually, when an American hears the term imported, it means that the item is exclusive enough to bring here, since the item is top notch, and therefore costs more. For example, Amstel Light is imported from Holland, Rolls Royce is imported from England and St. Andres is imported from France. Therefore these items generally cost more than your plain American beer, car or cheese. Unfortunately, when J. Crew terms an item imported, it almost always means the item was made in a 3rd world nation. Therefore, the item is not necessarily exclusive, but probably simply cost less for them to manufacture. My question is, is J. Crew trying to deliberately mislead the American public by selling Americans cheaply made goods under the pretense that it is imported, or is J. Crew simply eliminating Asians, Blacks and other non-Whites from their advertisements? Now that I think of it, there used to be more non-Whites in their catalogs. Granted, their handful of token minority models almost always have classic Caucasian phenotypes, but at least J. Crew once had some sort of quasi New Englander diversity. Would anyone like to file a class action lawsuit against J. Crew? I have at least 12 years' worth of catalogs to prove my point. Perhaps they would settle out of court by giving us all warm wool roll-necks imported from the Philippines.
