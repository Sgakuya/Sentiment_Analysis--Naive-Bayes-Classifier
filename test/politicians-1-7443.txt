We need a negative rating on the scale. This thug is illegally trying to disenfranchise Democrat Texas voters. Kudos to the guys who fled to Oklahoma and New Mexico; even if they don't get their way, they can make pint-sized gasbag bust a blood vessel or two. There's another possible upside to all this; apparently about 80% of Texans disapprove of this loophole redistricting, and there's an election next year.
