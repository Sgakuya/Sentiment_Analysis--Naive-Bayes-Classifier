Could the service at Tim Hortons be any worse? Furthermore - steeped tea? That's a sorry attempt at trying to rip people off if I ever heard one. First off - the definition of 'steeped is as follows: To soak in liquid in order to cleanse, soften, or extract a given property from. To infuse or subject thoroughly to. To make thoroughly wet; saturate. That covers ALL tea. Secondly, as I believe we've all noted, why would anyone pay more for more water? Tim Hortons is garbage.
