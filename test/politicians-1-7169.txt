Mr. Jackson always seems to be Johnny on the spot whenever there is anything controversial that involves someone of color. Who pays his way when he makes all of his transcontinental trips? As far as his usage of the title, Reverend it would be more appropriate to be Irreverent. I hope God speaks to his heart that he may turn from his current ways and truly be Reverend Jackson.
