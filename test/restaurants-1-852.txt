SUBWAY SHOULD BE ASHAME OF THEMSELVES...WHEN I ORDER A SANDWICH I DONT WANT SOME SKIMPY SLAB OF OVERPROCESSED MEAT -- THATS JUST PLAIN CHEAP...IM SICK OF HEARING PEOPLE GO ON ABOUT THE VEGGIES -- HOW MANY PICKLED VEGGIES IS GOING TO SAVE A LAME EXCUSE FOR A HOAGIE?...I CAN GET A MUCH BETTER MEATBALL SANDWICH AT A LUNCH-STAND FOR HALF THE PRICE...AND THE ROLLS HAVE LITTLE TO RECCOMEND THEM, JARED HAS OBVIOUSLY NEVER HAD A GOOD ITALIAN ROLL BEFORE...WANT DOUBLE THE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK? GO TO WAWAS.
