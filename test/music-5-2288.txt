12 Stones' first cd sounded fresh and original, right up to the lyrics and sound. This one, Potter's Field, gets away from that originality. Gone are any traces of their personality. Straightforward rock is used for the duration of the album, and it sounds like almost any other rock album you've heard. The lyrics are cryptic and can get throughly confusing. What's the point of some of these songs? If you like basic rock and/or liked 12 Stones' first cd, give this a listen. For the person who wants to hear them at their best, though, try their self-titled debut.
