What a great guy Mr. Lincoln was...led our nation into the biggest unconstitutional war we ever fought. He was the bad guy. Cared nothing about holding a nation together. For him it was power!!! Abe against the South. Search out the truth, Abe was not anti-slavery. Took us into four years of bloody war and the North still controls the South.
