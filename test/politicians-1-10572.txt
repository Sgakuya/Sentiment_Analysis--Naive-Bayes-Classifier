It makes me laugh to see whining comments such as these. All invective, no attempt to address the issues. I'm no big Bush fan, but: 1) He did NOT steal the election. Even an exhaustive investigation by the NY Times--with nothing good to say about the guy--had to conclude that his election was legitimate. 2) Nobody stupid gets an MBA from Harvard. 3) Anyone who is observed as closely as the President is going to make rhetorical boo-boos. Listen to the tapes of any Eisenhower press conference. Clinton and JFK were exceptionally good speakers--but they had more serious flaws, didn't they?
