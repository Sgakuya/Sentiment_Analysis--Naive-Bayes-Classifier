Makes plays look spectacular, that Andruw Jones makes look easy. Plays he has to dive for , Andruw makes standing up. Plus , he's a puss.............When Zambrano drilled him for the second time in the game ( making it clear that he wanted to fight Edmonds ) , little Jimmy put his eyes toward the ground like a punk , and took his base. Andruw would've whooped that ass !
