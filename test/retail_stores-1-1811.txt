Cheapest food and diapers, that's the only reason I go and once I have enough money to spend a little more, I'll go somewhere else. I hate patronizing this EVIL corporation. Just last week the Today show had a woman on suing Wal-Mart for gender discrimination. There are dozens of other simmilar suits in litigation. Only 10 percent of management positions are held by women and some women have complained of staff meetings being held in Hooters restaurants. Just try to unionize a Wal-Mart. Sam himself used to try to get all folksy with the peons by putting on a name-tag and hanging out at the loading docks, but if any of them suggested unionizing, he threatened to fire them in a heartbeat. Even today no Wa-Mart is unionized and people who have tried to do it have been fired for ridiculous reasons like stealing the use of a company typewriter to write a union proposal. Real folksy place. Most employees are paid minimum wage and qualify for food stamps and cannot even afford the co-pay for benefits Wal-Mart offers. I'm not even going to go into the treatment of employees overseas in sweatshops, but I'll say this- how would you like to be a 12 year old girl working 80 hours a week in a Bengali factory and make 18 cents an hour? Wal-Mart seems to think that's O.K. Next time they start airing their nauseating Christmas commercials with little kids and misty-eyed employees, think of why they do that. Any company that scrambles that hard to put forth such a sqeaky-clean image most certainly has some stinky-assed skeletons in their closet.
