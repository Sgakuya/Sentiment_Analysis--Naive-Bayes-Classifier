Who is Jesse Jackson? Why should he have any influence over anyone? He is a dispicable, self serving individual, leading his own people down the path of destruction. Get out of politics Jesse and do some real work. Surely you do not believe that you are sharing the word of the Lord. The bible says, the anti-christ will come. Do you think that has happened? I do.
