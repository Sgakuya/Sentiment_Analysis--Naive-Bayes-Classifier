One of the biggest hypocrites in that City of Hypocrites. Assumed such a sanctimonious attitude during the Bill Clinton Impeachment Fiasco, yet was responsible for destroying some poor slob's marriage because he couldn't keep his hands off the guy's wife. Then tried to rationalize it by calling it a youthful indiscetion, despite the fact that he was well in his 40s at the time. Just another phony like the other whores and whoremasters on the GOP side in recent years: Newt (used to sit in the pews reading the Bible while Calista was in choir practice, before going out to the Motel 6), Livingston ( The Speaker of the House Who Wasn't : a regular Romeo), Armey (denied tenure as a college professor, in large part, for being too familiar with the co-eds), Barr (married three times, speaks out constantly against abortion yet paid for the one his second wife had), Chenowith (carried on in an extra-marital affair for years: question is, Who could get aroused by a troll like that?), Burton (fathered a child out of wedlock and wasn't enough of a man to put his name on the kid's birth certificate: this guy's a real pile of crap), Bono (Sonny's widow supposedly likes rock and roll drummers who have pronounced cocaine problems), Bob Dole (in addition to being a womanizer in his pre-Viagra days, he also skipped out on paying two years of child support for his daughter: Great Guy), and the list goes on. Hyde is also one of the most repulsively overweight members of Congress, which is, generally speaking, an august body of noteworthy lardasses.
