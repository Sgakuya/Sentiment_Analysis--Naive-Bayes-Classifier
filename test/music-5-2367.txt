My personal favorite Wow ever! Includes songs like New Way To Be Human by Switchfoot. Stranded by Plumb was really good and introduced me to Tiffany Arbuckle's amazing music. Gravity by Delirious is a fun song that makes your head spin. Overall the best Wow they've put out. It remains a fun listen from beginning to end.
