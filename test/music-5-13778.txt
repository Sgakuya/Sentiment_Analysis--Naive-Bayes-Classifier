Big Pun was great and still is the great Puerto Rock artist! I have all his albums! Its such a shame that he had to leave us so soon because he definetly was an awesome person and lyricist! Pun would without a shadow of a doubt if he was still alive be keep smacking it to us like homey the clown with new groovy beats and rhymes! Just Everyone remember Pun cuz he was truly a talented artist and great person and deserves your respect! I Definetly give Pun all the respect and love he deserves! Even though Pun is gone he will be around for a long time i feel because people i know are still listening and shaking their asses to his tunes. i know i do alot and thats what has got me the nickname BIg Pun from some friends and well cuz i am big 2, but i say no man quit don't call me that there is already one great Pun call me Big City or sumthn else. so well just keep it real im out!
