I am VERY unhappy with the poor customer service I have received. In late December I tried to return an item to a local store. The clerk was extremely rude and refused the return, embarrassing me in front of other customers. When I returned home, I called customer service and told my story. The man I spoke with apologized and offered to make up for this stressful experience by sending me a refund check. However when I called to check on the status of the refund, I was told that I had been sent a merchandise credit instead. I then talked with a number of people in customer service, including a woman in the corporate office, but they all refused to help me, merely restating the refund policy. Although they said they were sorry, it didn't come across as genuine. All three persons I spoke to sounded annoyed with me. I then sent an email complaint but received the same unhelpful response, with the same tone. I'm amazed that such a large company is so inflexible with their policies that they can't even help a customer who had been treated so badly in one of their stores. Policies do not serve their purpose or benefit a company image if they cannot be adjusted in unusual circumstances like mine. Considering my experience at the store, I feel strongly that I deserved more help than I received. This company's guarantee says Every item we sell will give you complete satisfaction or you may return it for a full refund. It does NOT say a full refund in whatever form we choose. This company's creed is To give you such outstanding quality, value, service, and guarantee that we may be worthy of your high esteem. The terrible customer service I received is completely inconsistent with their guarantee and with their creed. Why state these promises if they have no intention of fulfilling those promises? Shop at L.L. Bean or Lands End instead. They stand behind their guarantees.
