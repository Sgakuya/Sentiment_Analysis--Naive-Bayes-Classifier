Clearly the majority of the New Tattoo comments left here are from hard-core Motley Crue fans. That's fine, and from what I understand New Tattoo hasn't disappointed the Crue's faithful followers. But if you aren't already a fan, this CD isn't going to convert you. It's just more of the same loud, talentless noise this band has been putting out for years. In a matter of months, this CD will be completely forgotten by 99.999% of music fans - as it should be.
