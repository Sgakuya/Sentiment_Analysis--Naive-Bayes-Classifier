This is a wonderful album, from the gorgeous pop of Dreams to the more complex sounds of The Chain and Gold Dust Woman. I love You Make Loving Fun too. I never tire of this record and is a must for any collection. Musically, this band are outstanding and this shows in tracks such as Go Your Own Way. The latter half of Gold Dust Woman is a great way to finish this record and is awesome.
