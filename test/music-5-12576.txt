I gave this album a 5 because of the fact that I feel it was his most successful. Something that proves that is that most of the songs on his Greatest Hits album come from that one album. This shows how great of a CD it was. It's not like other CDs that only have 1 or 2 good songs on them. Personally, I can listen to pretty much the entire album without getting bored of it.
