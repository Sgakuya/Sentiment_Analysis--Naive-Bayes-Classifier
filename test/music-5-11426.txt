Spanish Bombs, London Calling, Train In Vain, Rudie Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, The Guns Of Brixton, Death Or Glory, Clampdown, Lost In The Supermarket my personal favorite The Right Profile. Excellent double-album(who, at the time would have thought any punk band capable of serving up enough material for two records at once?) following the classic releases of The Clash Give 'Em Enough Rope(if you don't have it, shame on you!). We lost much when Joe Strummer left this world. One question remains...why does Rolling Stone continuously list London Calling as the best album of the 1980's? It was released in 1979...or do they mean it doesn't count until it's US release.
