Soundtracks are usually a hit and miss thing. You go to a movie, you remember that one song, buy the soundtrack and then the whole thing sucks and the one song you heard, isn't even on it. Well, that is the usual occurance with soundtracks. However, Pulp Fiction blows that theory out of the water. This is a CD you can put in and not have to worry about. It is a great mix of music. One of my favorite soundtracks.
