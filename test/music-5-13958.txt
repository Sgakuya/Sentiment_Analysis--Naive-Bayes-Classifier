One of my favorite albums. Their music comes with a deep message and I can relate to most of the songs on this album. Though the CD is awesome, it can't come close to how amazing their live show is!! If you get the chance to go see them, DON'T pass it up!!! They are one of the few groups that have honest lyrics about everyday situations that a lot of people deal with. Unique, overflowing with talent...what can i say? (Oh, and to MISS10072et: You are SO right about the awards thing!!! They really deserve so much...)
