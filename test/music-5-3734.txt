Truly awesome effort. Perhaps the best-played rock record of all time. Strong songs ("Why Does Love Have To Be So Sad," "Layla," "Bell Bottom Blues") and very tasteful production. "Little Wing" is just totally, f**king staggering, about the highest, most blissful rock anthem imaginable, a rare instance where a Hendrix cover was superior to the original. And still sounds great after all these years, not dated at all.
