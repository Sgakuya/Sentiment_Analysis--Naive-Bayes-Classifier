Good Charlotte blows really hard. They are pop-punk mainstream crap who tries to sucker in 13 year old kids to wear arm socks like the Avril Lavigne trend and make people think that's what punk music really sounds like. All you hardcore punks know what I'm talking about. The Germs, Ramones, Dead Kennedys, etc. are the real punks. When did we end up with all this Good Charlotte, Sum 41 FAKE PUNK music?
