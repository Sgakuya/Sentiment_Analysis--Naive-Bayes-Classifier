Thankyou! I almost did a move with SS from california to florida. After this that move will not take place. Just another warning, there is acompany in San Diego, California called Move Plus that claims to have the cheapest rates--- that is all a con too. They gave me a quote for $1,500.00. by the time they showed up it went up to $3,500. They wanted to charge me for everything under the sun including tape at nearly $4 per roll. The movers and customer service were very rude and unprofessional.After I told them that I wasn't paying that and i cancelled the move they left my apartment in complete disarray. They took one of my sofa cushions and claimed not to have had it because the driver didn't want to turn around to return it. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM THEY ARE JUST AS BAD AS SS.PLEASE DON NOT USE MOVE PLUS LOCATED IN SAN DIEGO, CA. OH! AND THE SUPPOSED FREE STORAGE THAT'S A LIE TOO.
