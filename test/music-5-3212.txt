this album is awesome! i agree with a previous post that is like a greatest hits album, b/c everything on it you've heard. the band included so many influences on this album from blues, folk, jazz, heavy rock....just everything. john paul jones is probably the most underrated musician of all time. if i could give this album 10 stars i would.
