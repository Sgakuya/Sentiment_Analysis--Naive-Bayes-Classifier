We love one voice, my 15 year daughter Rebecca was killed in a farm accident this August, we found in her purse, My favorite sone is ONE VOICE, every time we were in the truck she would say turn the radio up its my song. She would say I hope the song reachs someone.Over 1000 people at her funeral,everyone said she touched everyones life by living and loving this song. She was active in 4H and FFA, president of 4 clubs and Vice Pres. of the Arkansas Shorthorn Assoc. her voice was heard. This song will always be special because it was played at her Funeral on 8-19-00. When everyone hears this sone Remember REBECCA. rmclement@arkbluecross.com
