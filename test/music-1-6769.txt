Why, Linkin Park? Why must you infuse your rap (the most horrid genre of music of all time, by the way) within society? Linkin Park is really just a terrible, virtually and absolutely talentless band that wouldn't be capable of defining the word songwriting if all of their rice and gold chains depended on it. The vocalist (whom has no talent, mind you) has, quite possibly, the most insubstantial technique I have ever heard in a rock band. He just whines and whines and, most atrociously, whines yet again. Th other vocalist (following suit with the aforementioned no-talent scheme, obviously) just raps, and, as you should have acknowledged by now, all modern rap sucks, and very few classic rap bands were noteworthy. ....I have very eclectic tastes. But anyway, this is a horrible, repetitive hip-hop album that masquerades as rock and roll. If you want this so-called rap/rock sound to be in your collection, go purchase Rage Against The Machine, Public Enemy, The Beastie Boys, or Run DMC (the most former being the most aggresive, rock-eqsue of the four; also the only one I truly enjoy listening to). This is horrible folks. Don't buy it.
