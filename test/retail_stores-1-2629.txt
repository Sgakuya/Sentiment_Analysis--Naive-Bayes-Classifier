I've been with Kroger since 1991 and have always walked the line. I'm not perfect, but I never have been disiplined for anything,officially anyway. Recently I was left in charge of my store, which is not supposed to happen. I am Drug G/M dept. head and don't get paid to run a store. I took a complaint call from a customer who was upset that the night before U-scan was the only thing open after 11 pm. I explained to him that corprate wanted it that way and we were just doing as told. He then proceeded to cuss me over and over calling me an f_c_in idiot and other colorful metaphors. I finally snapped and gave him a little back and hung up the phone. He then called my D/M and now I'm on suspension. I'll admit I deserve a write up for losing my cool. But these people are trying to fire me now. For a first offense. This is why moral is so low amongst me and my co-workers. Kroger will not stand up for it's employees or even attempt to do right by them. My union rep says I will get my job back. That Kroger violated several items in the union contract.Truth be told, I don't know if I want my job back. unless it's my only option for a steady paycheck. The management team at #526 sucks and it shows through this and many other events. I should never have been in charge of that store. I don't get paid to be an acting member of management and I also had no union rep present when I was suspended. This company is on the decline. That treat the good ones like crap and let the bad ones get away with anything. Don't shop at Kroger. They don't deserve your business! I'd also like to urge any parent who has a teen working in the grocery business to urge them to achieve larger goals in life then working for a grocery store. This is truly a deadend job. I was a fool to think this could be a career to be proud of. I have made many friends at Kroger. I've also seen many leave and go on to bigger and better things. I know that my children will NEVER work in this business.
