Chicago is the all-time best group. Just think about it...who else has had so many top hits and been around for 34 plus years. Their music is timeless and ageless. I've been to two concerts this year and have 3 to go, what I notice at each one is the range of ages attending. I also belong to their fan club...there are 15 as well as 50+ people participating. The band members are also very genuine. They are a great group of guys. I know I speak on behalf of alot of Chicago fans when I say we are sure they will be in the Hall of Fame soon! Thanks!
