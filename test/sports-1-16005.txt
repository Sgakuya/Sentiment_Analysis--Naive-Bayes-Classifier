He's a pothead that's destroyed his entire career, reading the earlier comments before his leave of absence is hilarious, poor guy, he'll be on Celebrity boxing pretty soon...he owes 8.6 million for his SB, and his 550K contract will only pay off so much. Will he ever get a huge contract again? Very doubtful, and he's getting up in age. He's done.
