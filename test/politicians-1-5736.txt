Hillary Clinton is a demagogue, plain and simple. Why in the name of heaven did she run for Senate in New York? Because she wanted to run in a place she could win? That is ridiculous. All she was doing was capitalizing on her popularity among feminists and other liberal demographics (who shall remain nameless). She's proven time after time that she has no respect for anything but staying in power. If she had left President Clinton when he was getting blown by a girl young enough to be his daughter, I might be able to muster some respect for her, even though I disagree with her. I'm sick of her political celebrity. She will, I hear, run for president in 2004. Give me a break. Hillary Clinton is invisible. She is nothing more than a transparent representative of the more liberal left, the way Bush and Gore are transparent representatives of the moderate right and moderate left, respectively. She has even more personality than Bush or her husband, though, so she will, no doubt, win. God help us.
