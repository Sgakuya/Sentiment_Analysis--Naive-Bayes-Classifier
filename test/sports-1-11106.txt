Give skinny an award for recruiting. Fulmer always has some of the best running backs in the country. He's a one dimensional coach who relies on his talent instead of his coaching. The reason Florida beats him so often is because no matter how much you hate Spurrier (or I guess now hated Spurrier), Spurrier is a superior college coach. Since Fulmer is completely incapable of changing his game strategy, Fulmer always loses to any coach who is familiar with Fulmer's coaching style and has equal athletes. Anyone can do what Fulmer does coaching-wise. Fulmer should get on his knees everyday and thank God for the UT alumnus that bankrolls his running back recruiting.
