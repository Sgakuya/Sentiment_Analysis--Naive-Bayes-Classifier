So im supposed to fly with AIRTRAN at 6 in the morning. I wake up at 3 to catch my flight, and they dont even have pilots ready for my flight. Pilots show up at 7 30 and we leave almost 2 hours late. So my connecting flight(YOU SEE THEY DONT HAVE DIRECT FLIGHTS UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO ATLANTA) leave early, and I miss it. So i have to spend 6 extra hours in the airport while my sister is stuck an hour from her home waiting for me to show up at the airport. To top it off, I had to wait for my baggage once i got there.
