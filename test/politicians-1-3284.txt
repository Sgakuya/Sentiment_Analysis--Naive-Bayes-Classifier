Failed foreign policy. Bribed North Korea. Sold calssifed information to China. Treason by any definition. Lied under oath - should be disbarred as lawyer. Raised taxes, after stating he would lower. Negotiated bad treaties (CWT) and forced Senate to pass. Makes Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon look good.
