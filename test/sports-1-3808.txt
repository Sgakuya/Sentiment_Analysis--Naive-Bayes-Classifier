Barry Bonds is a total A-Hole, the biggest the game has ever seen. I rate him zero stars as a person unfortunately, he is a solid baseball player. The real question is would he be as good without the use of steroids. Playing mostly in SF where the fences are closer, I dont see him be the superstar in another stadium and without the use of steroids. Again a totally Gigantic A-Hole.
