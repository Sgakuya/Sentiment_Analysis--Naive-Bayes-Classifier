Great album. A collection of terrific songs from one of great musicians of our time. It makes me angry, though, whenever I hear BORN IN THE USA held up as a patriotic song. It gets played every July 4th by mindless creatins who don't realise that it is actually a great protest song, about the terrible and shameful way we treated our returning heroic vets from Vietnam.
