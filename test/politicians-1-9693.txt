Believe it or not, the true beginnings of the Viet Nam war can be traced back to various problems that were never resolved after the completion of WWII. However, the actual war officially started during the once much-ballyhooed Kennedy Dynasty. Oddly, people tend to overlook that I guess it s a kind of selective judgment thing people do when they sense anything charismatic about a public figure. Not the first time, certainly not the last. Anyway, the fiasco was fully underway when Johnson was sworn in and continued on and to escalate throughout his administration. The war actually did not formally end until 1975 during the Ford Get Down Get Back Up Again term. Johnson, having inherited this legacy, ended up attempting to deal with it during its nastiest and most horrible period. As far as much of the world is concerned (myself included), he blew it big time. Instead of ending it he chose to him haw around and hand it off to the next guy. That disastrous delay cost countless lives, heartache and internal strife within this country. Support of the Civil Rights movement was a good thing yes. But Viet Nam caused a stench we are still able to smell to this day and BTW, speaking of civil rights, guess who were very often heading up the front lines? First clue: they did not have money for college and many times they could claim African heritage.
