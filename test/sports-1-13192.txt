ut is the most overrated team every year for the past two years they have been spanked by lesser teams in lesser bowl games and they still whine about not being in better bowl games and shut up about peyton manning tee martin was the one who got you the championship that you wouldn't have won if florida state didn't have to use a 3rd string Qb.I guess the only reason ut fans don't mention tee martin is because he is black.
