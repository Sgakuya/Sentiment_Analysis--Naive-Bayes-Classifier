The social mess we see today (enormous taxes, lazy people demanding more more welfare) are the result of FDR. He tried to pack the Supreme Court. He tried to make himself a benevolent dictator. He apparently wanted us to go to war and may well have known in advance about Pearl Harbor. He was a smart aleck, the worst we had until Clinton was able to set a new low standard. He was an egomaniac. Worst of all, the guy didn't think anyone else should be president as long as he lived, and he had the gall to stay in there until death finally removed him. That's not leadership, and it's not inspiration. It's a quiet tragedy.
