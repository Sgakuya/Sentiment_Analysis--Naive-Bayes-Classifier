Another liar for the lock-step Bush Administration, on the board of a petroleum company making billions off the high prices of oil. Why did she call Willie Brown, the mayor of SF, on the night before 9-11, to tell him not to fly to NY? Why did she lie about Iraq's WMD's, when she knew darn well they were no threat to us?
