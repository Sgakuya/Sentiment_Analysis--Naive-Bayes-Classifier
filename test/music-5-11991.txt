Destiny's Child's sophmore album has major hits such as Say My Name, Bug A Boo, and their latest Jumpin', Jumpin'. It has its share of dance music and soulful ballads. The album ends with their acappella version of Amazing Grace. I personally recommend this album to those who like good R B. These ladies are great.
