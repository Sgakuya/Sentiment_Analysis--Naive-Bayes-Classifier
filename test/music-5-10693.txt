If you are looking for an album that sounds like their debut, you may be a little disappointed, but on its own, it is a GREAT album, more mature, and still hanging on to their party rock sound! Don't worry... Bent isn't the best song on the album.. Angry and Crutch are both awesome. This is definately a CD you can throw in the stereo and play all the way through! ******Can I give it six stars?******
