I went to a burger king last week, and i ordered a crosaindwich, hash browns & cini-minis. The cashier told me that I had to order a drink, I told her I didn't want a drink, and she told me she couldn't complete the order unless I got a drink, so I told her fine give me a diet coke. I get up to the window and hand them my money, and she said croisanwich meal and french toast, and the woman told me that they were out cini-minis(which she could have told me when I was making my order, but she assumed that since they were out of cini-minis that i wanted french toast) then i told her that I ordered cini-minis not french toast, and she yelled at me we're out of cini-minis, and she handed my money back said have a nice day and closed the drive-thru window on me... She didn't have to make up my mind for me, all she had to say is I'm sorry we're out of cini-minis, would you like french toast, it would have saved me gas and money.
