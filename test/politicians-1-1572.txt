This guy is a ruthless dictator who does not even care about his own people. They are dying of starvation and diseases(thanks to US sanctions and Uranium spraying on the Iraqi civillians!). He just wants to stay in power no matter what it takes; if US really wanted to take him out it would have done so a long time ago. But US is afraid that democracy might be restored in Iraq so it keeps him there.
