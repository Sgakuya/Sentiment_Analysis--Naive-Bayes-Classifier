Mark Richt should leave Georgia. You can not play the conservitive style of football he continues to play and ever win a SEC title, much less a national title. His poor decisions cost Georgia the Auburn game, and his lack of imagination and design for a different quaterback cost Georgia the Florida game. MARK RICHT HAS GOT TO GO!!!
