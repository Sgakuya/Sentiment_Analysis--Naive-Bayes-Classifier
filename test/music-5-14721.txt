Amazing depth, and a tremendous and legitimae exploration of the humanity of Christ. The music is powerful, memorable and relevant, even after all these years. Not for the conservative Christian taste; no use subjecting yourself to something that will truly bother you! For those who are more liberal, you can feel the Truth come through, and in an astounding, clever, wrenching musical score.
