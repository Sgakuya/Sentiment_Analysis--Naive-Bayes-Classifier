One of the best albums to come out of one of the better two-year periods in recent music history ('91-'92), the Chili Peppers maintained the energy that brought them fame in their early years even while becoming more sophisticated in their song writing. I would rate it along with Faith No More's 'Angel Dust', Soundgarden's 'Bad Motor Finger' and Nirvana's 'Nevermind' as the best albums of the nineties.
