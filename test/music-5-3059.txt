i honestly believe it is one of the best albums ever. utterly ground breaking for its time, it challenged and evoked deep emotion. extraordinary considering he was only in his mid-twenties at the time. he apparently was doing a lot of acid at the time but anyone who thinks this undermines the quality or credibility of this music is a fool. any lover of music, of any age, anywhere, will i imagine adore this album.
