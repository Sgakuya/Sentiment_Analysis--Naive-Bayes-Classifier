I used to love this store back when I was in high school and just starting college. Granted, this was almost 10 years ago...Anyway, they used to have such great, classic clothing that was preppy and nice enough to wear to work on casual day. It also was made to fit normal adults and the quality was high. I still have a sweatshirt from 1992!! Now, the clothing is cheaply made, fits only teeny tiny pre-teen girls, has silly childish sayings and that gawd awful glitter crap on it and is overpriced. Obviously, I am out of the target market at 26 years old and I am certainly no beast at 5'6 , 125 lbs., but their clothes don't fit me and frankly, I would look like an idiot wearing them. Oh how I wish they would go back to the classic, normal sized, high quality clothing they used to sell!!
