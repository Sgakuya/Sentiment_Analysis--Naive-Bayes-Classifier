Very much a whimsical, sassy, needs to get over herself and quit trying to convince the public that she has any place in our government! I know she won in New York but why? I will tell you why. She has this way of turning off the interested people so they just shut her out of thier minds, also I believe that a mass majority of the women in this country believe that she was so wrongfully done by her husband bill, that they just went ahead and voted for her because they felt sorry for her. That my friends is democracy in action! DONT YOU THINK?
