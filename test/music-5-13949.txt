One listen to this relatively new CD and you'll find that The Bee Gees are one of the best live performers ever. The music sounds clear and crisp along with the perfect three-part harmonies. They don't ruin the song by changing lyrics or unneeded ad-libbing. Any deviation from the studio recording is an improvement. Ex: Words and Islands in the Stream which is better than the Kenny Rogers-Dolly Parton recording.
