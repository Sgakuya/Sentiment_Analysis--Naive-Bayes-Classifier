Nelly is my idle. He is the most amazing black man i have ever seen in my entire life. I no longer like the song country grammer and EI because all you people who THINK u like nelly like them. I liked country grammer at least 6 months before it came out on the radio. If ur a real nelly fan your favorite Song would prolly be either Come Over off the flex CD or Ride Wit Me which im about to not like anymore because its starting to be played on the radio. Batter Up is also a hot song. 1 more comment.. Nelly is GOD PAIN
