Bush is merely a puppet for the good ol' boys who will stoop at nothing to regain the presidency. Cheney and his big oil cronies will be calling the shots if he gets elected and that is truly frightening! The Republicans think they can replicate Clinton's popularity with Bush, Jr. and use it as a Trojan horse to get the old guard back into office. They have nothing else going. They cannot find an intelligent, likable Republican in one package.
