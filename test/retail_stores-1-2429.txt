We bought the all natural butternut squash soup with the whole foods label. Butternut squash soup is my favorite soup and I was looking forward to it. My husband and I sat down to eat it and it was incredibly awful! It was as sweet as a donut!!!! We had to throw it out. Butternut squash soup is not as sweet as donuts. So my question is why would a whole foods natural store put so much sugar in their products? If you try to make chili with can beans and they were so sweet it was ridiculus. There is no reason to put so much sugar in anything. I can see it in maybe jam or a donut... but beans? and soup? unless its chilled fruit soup, there is no cause for it.
