Just before the end of October, when I watched Billy Gilman's Oklahoma video, I was instantly one of his new fans. Billy is an awesome singer that sings about issues and situations that can still be turned around for the better. Billy is a 12 year old country musician which people of all ages and from all walks of life can enjoy!! Gilman is someone who greatly respects himself and other people. God has really blessed this 7th grader with the gifts of music. Also, God uses Billy to touch people's hearts. Gilman is a priceless gift from God, not a teen idol. I would be more than happy to get an autograph from this multi-talented musician. Keep up the great work Billy! God Bless You!!!
