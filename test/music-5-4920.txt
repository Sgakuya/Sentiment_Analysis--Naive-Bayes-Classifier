It would be nice if people were a bit more encouraging for kids like Billy that have heart and courage to reach for their dreams. Anyone calling this crap might look at their own life (as well as learning to spell, Billy can spell by the way)and regroup before insulting a little, hard-working talented boy. Go for it Billy!
