I remember when Al Gore stood next to Bill Clinton after the truth came out about Bill's sexual episodes, and had the nerve to say that Bill Clinton would go down in history as one of the best presidents ever. What misplaced loyalty. Doesn't Al have any moral either? I'm glad he finally lost the race.
