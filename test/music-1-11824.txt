I would never buy this piece of crap wannabe punk CD.I hear this horrible band almost everywhere and it is annoying.It would be less irritating if Simple Plan would just admit that their a bubblegum pop clone boy band. The thing that irritates me is that certain fools are buying into the bull**** that MTV is cramming down their throats. Certain people actually think that Simple PLan is a punk band yet they don't realize that Simple Plan is anything but. Simple PLan show none of the punk ethos at all,it's just another example of greedy corporations wanting to make the almighty dollar.
