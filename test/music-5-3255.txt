This album is one of my favorite Springsteen albums! I don't know what it is about it, but somehow, it just captures this wonderful energy and feeling! The always superb E Street band has put together a great sound, and with Bruce's heartfelt and heartening lyrics, you can't help but want to crank this really loud and sing along to every single song! I have listened to this only god knows how many times, and I never tire of it, in fact I find myself playing it as often as possible! There is not one flaw in this whole collection of songs, and I recommend it to anyone! It just might make you a Springsteen fanatic, too! Baby we were born to runnnnnn!...
