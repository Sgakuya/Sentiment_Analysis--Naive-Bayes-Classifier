Portishead has always been one of my very favorite groups. I have loved them since I first heard them. I have listened to Portishead for about six or seven years now. I saw them perform live. Their music gets to me emotionally. Dummy is my favorite album by them. I listen to it almost everyday. Their music is very instrumental and the lyrics almost accompany the instruments. They create a nice mixture of exciting and serene feelings.
