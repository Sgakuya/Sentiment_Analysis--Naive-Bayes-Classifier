A big, strong ol' president was Ronnie. Taught us all the meaning of jingoism and how to value money. Remember kids, you have to have a populist platform, don't worry about selling out, just get elected! Don't worry if you're in the lower-class category! Presidents like Ronnie Reagan will give you a smile and a wave, and you can hold the American flag, with bible and astrology book, while you decorate that box you're living in on the street.
