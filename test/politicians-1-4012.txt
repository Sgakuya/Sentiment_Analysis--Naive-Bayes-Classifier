Edwards does have good looks and charm, but I find him very cunning and sly. Sounds like I'm describing a lawyer, oh wait a sec, he is a lawyer so it fits perfect. Edwards in my opinion is in no shape to help lead this nation. He is just like Kerry, is swayed by popular opinion so he will conform to whatever is popular, not what is right.
