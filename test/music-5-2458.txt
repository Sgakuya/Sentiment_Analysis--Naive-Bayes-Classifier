I wouldn't rate it as #1 like the vh1 list did. However, it is in my top 10 and I can see why they did put it as #1. At the time in 1966, not such a psychedelic album had ever been recorded. A song that is overlooked for some crazy reason is And Your Bird Can Sing. It is such a powerful song. Bill Clinton believes that Elanor Rigby is the most brilliant piece ever, which I can relate to. Taxman is an upbeat, powerful song. I think my personal favorite from the album is Doctor Robert (only on the British version). It is another absoulte masterpiece from the far and away greatest band.
