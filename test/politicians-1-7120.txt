I am so glad Jesse Jackson finally got caught with his immoral act of having an affair and fathering an illigitimat child. Maybe now he'll stop his holy attitude. He is such a hypocrit. Minister? HA! I assure he is no friend to black people. He desires the spotlight and that is his only agenda. There are few if any in the black community that has anything good to say about him. If you doubt it, check. I have.
