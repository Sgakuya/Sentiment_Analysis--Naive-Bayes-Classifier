Did you know that the state legislature only meets every other year in Texas? How can we expect this man to work with Congress? His tax plan gives 40% to people making over 200,000 dollars a year? Do you fit in that class? How about school vouchers? The man must hate public school. Gore is clearly the better choice. How about wanting to privitize social security partially. Hope none of you young people want SS. Gore's plan will protect it much better.
