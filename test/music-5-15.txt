The album that made me a big U2 fan. Unlike anything they recorded prior to its release (although their take on Cole Porter's Night and Day in 1989-90 was a sign of things to come). Every song on this record is a stunner. And each has its own sound. Zooropa, the follow-up, contains moments of brilliance as well but those songs have not endured. What would you rather here, Numb or One?
