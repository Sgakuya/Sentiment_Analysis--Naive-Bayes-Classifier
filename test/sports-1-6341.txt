OVERRATED, you can talk loud about achievements in college level (yes, because guess how many all american high school signed to DUKE). yet speak softly about DUKE alumni in NBA (tell me about greatest dukies: laettner, hill, hurley, ferry, jay williams)..... thanks to coach K obviously for creating such beautiful program.... but they're good and valid in college level only, not beyond.
