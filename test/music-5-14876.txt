This is a fabulous CD!! It's a must-have. Often times I get bored easily listening to soundtracks that contain songs that are actually sang by the artists. But, this CD is different. I just can't stop listening to it. The songs are just too great!! I think this is the best soundtrack CD with various artists ever!!
