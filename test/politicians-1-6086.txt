Ashcroft is in a close race with Cheney to see which one is really the biggest fascist. This guy is a threat to our civil liberties as a people. The only way that this guy has any balance is with regard to abortion and guns. He figures that he'll restrict the RIGHT that a woman has to choose, now don't worry about the population going up too much, because he'll also make sure everyone has a gun; that way we can stave off a population explosion!
