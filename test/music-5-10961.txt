Nsync rocks!! OK In the beginning I wasn't a big fan,but grew to love them. NSA is a great album with lots of catchy songs.This i promise you is such a great song that tells the person you love exactly how you feel. The tour kicked a**!! I've never been to a crowd pumping concert such as this one. Hey If i can listen to Metallica and eminem and kid and limp, and still love Nsync,ya'll that cant,SUCK!!!! Jc- ya !!!
