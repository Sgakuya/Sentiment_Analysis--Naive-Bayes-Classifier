What a disaster!!! Thanks to his egocentric efforts, we will now seemingly have the worst environmenal President in our history sitting in the Oval Office, sharing the west wing with the NRA and oil lobby. I trust that when the mineral rights to the front lawn of the White House are sold and oil rigs stand before the Truman portico, you IDIOTS will look back on all this with pleasure. A sheer debacle and a strategic nightmare that accomplished absolutely NOTHING positive.
