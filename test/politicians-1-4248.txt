I work in Washington DC for a federal environmental agency. Under 12 years of Republicans, our policies directions were all in support of industry. Under the 8 years of the Democrats, there is a much greater commitment to the environment much good has been done. If Nader's candidacy results in the Republicans retaking the White House he will have done harm beyond any good he thinks he is doing. A vote for Nader is really a vote for Bush!
