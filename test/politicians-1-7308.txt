Rev. Jackson, you are as much an extremist as David Duke. The difference is the skin color you support . Your actions and your diatribe are counter-productive to any racial integration progress. I think you have ulterior motives in that you create crises to keep your name in print. I don't think you care about racial minorities, I think you are only interested in the promotion of you own self interests. You are a discredit to America as an American (black, brown, asian, native american, or white). Basically, shame on you for creating racial animosity and promoting prejudice rather than promoting racial healing. You should just SHUT UP!!!
