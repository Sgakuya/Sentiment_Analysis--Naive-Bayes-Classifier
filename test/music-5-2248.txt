One of the best live blues CDs ever recorded. If you listen to B.B. King's Live at the Regal CD and don't think he deserves a 5 rating, then there's something wrong with you. This man is a living legend who has profoundly influenced multiple generations of musicians. Take Eric Clapton, for instance. Clapton, who has influenced countless musicians himself, points to B.B. King as his biggest hero. I was lucky enough to see King perform in Atlanta a few years ago, and it was an amazing experience. If you want an easy introduction to his music, start with something like Blues Summit, where he does duets with other artists. But when you're really ready to jump in, pick up Live at the Regal, his best recording.
