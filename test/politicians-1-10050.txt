So yeah, let's keep on blaming problems on those we disagree with instead of holding people accountable for their actions. Mr. Political, I couldnt agree MORE! So, isnt it time George Bush came forth with the truth? Just days ago it was reported (and substantiated) that in July 2002 there was a meeting in which Tony Blair announced he had already committed himself to supporting Bushs plans for invading Iraq. At that time British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw acknowledged that the case for war was thin as Saddam was not threatening his neighbors and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea, or Iran. Also in a separate secret briefing for that meeting it was stated that Britain and America had to, quote CREATE conditions to justify war!! Lastly, A British official reported on his recent talks with Washington, quote, There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being FIXED around the policy. All this before Bush even sought Congressional authorization to go to war. What a great President!!
