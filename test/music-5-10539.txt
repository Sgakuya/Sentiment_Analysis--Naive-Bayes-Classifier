Not long time ago I bought few CDs,among them also THE BEST of Ricky Martin.I don't belong to those group of peoples who have been describe in the haters' messages here. Belonging to a majority of the citizans of the world and being highly educated and hard working person, far away from any latino culture connection,I have found the music of Ricky Martin extremely enjoyable and inspiring and Ricky has been the one who among the all others latin artists has been able to introduce the latin culture to the other parts of the world. His music makes people happy and his balads are simply breathtaking. I have given to the Best of.... the best mark possible. And at the end,don't hate him if he is better in anything and everything than you, haters ...
