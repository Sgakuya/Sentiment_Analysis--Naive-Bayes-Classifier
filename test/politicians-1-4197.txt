This is a post-election rating where one wonders if Nader deliberately threw the election to Bush. Perhaps Nader was paid to do so. He did, in fact, betray all of the liberal philosophy he purported to stand for and received nothing in return as far as recognition is concerned. If one wants to build a party, do it from the ground up, at the state level, then into Congress. It doesn't work top-down and it is not reasonable to assume Nader is naive enough to not know this.
