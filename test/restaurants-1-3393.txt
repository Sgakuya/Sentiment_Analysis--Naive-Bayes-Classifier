pizza hut is sooo disgusting! i have fond memories of eating pizza hut pizza as a kid, but the pizza isn't the same anymore. in the past the sauce was real good, and the crust was thicker, but now...it's all super greasy, the cheese seems fake, the cheese is mushy and salty, the sauce is bitter and gross; while the crust is grease laden in some bites, sometimes it's a little crispy. the only time i eat pizza hut is when my family will not agree on what i want and i have to make them happy by chosing pizza hut. i don't know why they like it. i always have to dab it with napkins. i would rather eat the cheapest frozen pizza out there! seriously! not to mentinon that pizza hut has always made me nauseated...and occasionally has everyone running for a toilet.
