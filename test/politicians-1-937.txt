Before I post any rating to Hosni Mubarak, I'd like to answer all the comments I've seen on this page. Islam is the only thing right on earth nowadays, and whoever says anything about it is an ignorant and has the devil in his side. Anyway, Mubarak is not considered as a president to the Egyptians, the last president was Sadat and Sadat and King Fisal was true leaders to the Arabs and Muslims. The west realized this fact and set those leaders up and made everything to get them out of the way. One day, it will be soon, Islam will prove its reliability and trusty is spite of Jews nose and tricks
