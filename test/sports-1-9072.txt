I can't ignore this. It's too perfect. He threw it right in my wheelhouse! This is Grant Hill's exact statement tonight during halftime of the Wiz-Heat game 4, about Rasheed's guarantee, He should've guaranteed game 3 in my opinion . But hey, what do you expect from a Carolina guy? Well, Grant Hill should've made the PLAYOFFS. But hey, what do you expect from a Dookie? Say, you played for Detroit, didn't you Grant? Yeah,that's right. How many championships did you lead them to? Just curious. Punk ass bitch. Go rehab, and don't worry about what Carolina guys are doing in the Playoffs. Dookies are fishing right now. You focus your little mind on that. What do I expect from Carolina pros?- 30 NBA championships, bitch. The question is, what do I expect from Dook pros? - not a damn thing! Now go rehab that ankle, knee, tongue, or whatever it is this week. Oh, and 'Sheed guaranteed a win last year in the playoffs. Do you recall what happened? Thought so........ ....F%cking nerd. I'm gonna put him on my Dook/nerd weblist. He sucks. He gets a one rating from me. When was the last time Rasheed was available to do halftime show during the Playoffs. Thought so. Go rehab, punk!.............go rehab in vain. )))) )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) )))))))))))))UPDATE. Hey Grant, when you played for the Pistons in the 90's and you guys played the Bulls, what did you expect from a Carolina guy then? Well, you know what I expected, a whoopin' for you and the Pistons. And I'll be damned if that ain't exactly what I got. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT FROM A CAROLINA GUY THEN!?!When you lost to Carolina 7 times in college, what did you expect of Carolina guys then?! Thought so. In the future, try not to say words you're gona eat. WE WILL CALL YOU OUT! I can't believe you would dis 'Sheed when he is STILL PLAYING, and you're on vacation. When he is AN NBA CHAMPION, and YOU are a perrenial NBA loser. You're a punk. Talking about Carolina guys?!?! Son, you didn't beat them in college or pros! - what do you know about Carolina guys?! You've never beat them and you run your mouth?!! Please, you're a punk. Good luck next year...........maybe you can get another PITY BASED all star appearance!!!!!!!!!!!!)))))))))))))))))) )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) ))))))))))UPDATE. WHAT NOW!? That's what I expect from a Carolina guy! That's what I expect, bitch! Now go enjoy your vacation, punk. And remember for future reference, FEET DON'T TASTE GOOD! - cause you ate your's today. guaranSHEED!- bitch. Just like he guaranteed last year.
