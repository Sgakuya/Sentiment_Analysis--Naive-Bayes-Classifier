This place doesnt even deserve a star! YOu will have diarhea the minute you leave the place, it smells terrible and can you say greese??? More than Mc Donalds! I think you have to live down south to enjoy this resteraunt. The only good thing that came out of me going thier was that my friend got a millitary macaw in disneys animal kingdom to say waffles and grits...really funny.
