Led Zep - you either love 'em or hate 'em. This is their best known probably best respected album, and it might not have the sheer passion of their 1st, or the bad-ass rock of their 2nd, but I reckon - yeah- it's their best ever. 'Stairway...' has been done to death but you can't deny it's a brilliant song, the first two tracks show that Zep can (and did) wipe the floor with any other rock group. The other songs are all great I love the sound of 'Four Sticks' - nothing else like it. And 'When the Levee Breaks' - what a drum sound! A wall of sound before the term was invented. A classic, and rightly so!
