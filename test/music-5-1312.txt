This is probably my favorite Bowie album of all of the great records that he has released. Unbelievable that he was 25 when he wrote and performed this ground-breaking material. It is somewhat of a 'rock opera' that tells the listener a story of imminent doom. As reflected by the thitle of the album, it follows the rise and fall of this pop/alien icon named Ziggy Stardust. Timeless piece of work that is coming up on a 30 year anniversary in a couple eof years. Even today, it is still way beyond its years. Get the record, see the movie, put on some platform boots, dye your hair orange and paint your face up with a blue and red lightning bolt drawn through the middle of it and tkae a spacey stroll with Bowie... Or you can just kick back with a couple of drinks and wish you were around to experience the phenomonen of Ziggy in the doldrums of the early 70's.
