I don't believe Gore cares about the citizens of this country in the least. The impression he leaves me with is that he just wants a promotion, no matter what the price. Of course it isn't coming out of his pocket, so I guess he feels it is okay that he drags the American people through this legal temper tantrum. It is just sickening. He hasn't shown any consideration to the morale of his own country.
