Saturday Night Fever is a classic and anyone who likes having fun will admit to that. So what if it's disco, that doesn't mean it's bad music. Funk was nothing like rock and that wasn't attacked like so called disco music was. The great thing is that disco is alive. There are so many new albums around the world like Jamirouqui, Spice Girls, Anastacia, Brand New Heavies, S Club 7, Spiller, plus dozens more who have had disco hits in Europe over the last seven years. So don't be ignorant when reviewing this album and give it a rating it deserves LIKE FIVE STARS!!!!!!
