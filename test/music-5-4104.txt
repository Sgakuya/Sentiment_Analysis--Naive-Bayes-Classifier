This whole album is a story. It starts out with a man trying to attract a woman. Then they meet, fall in love, and decide to marry. Then the man gets cold feet, but goes through with the wedding anyway. By Tunnle of Love they have begun to loose faith in each other and doubt there love. By When Your Alone they have separated, and Valentines Day offers a second chance at love.
