I don't know how anyone could not like this album, I seriously think anyone who is saying they hate it is lyeing to themselves. This album is a true piece of art. THIS IS REAL MUSIC PEOPLE! The entire album is amazing. I can go through the whole thing without wanting to skip over any songs, which is rare today.
