see, i dont see why everyone hates up on marshall. his lyrics are great. they shouldn't dis his imagination. they should be supporting it. and to all the parents who hate his guts, chill out. not everything he mentions in his verses tell the truth about his life or actions. you adults shouldn't care about what he writes.
