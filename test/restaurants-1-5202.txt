The one near my house here just closed. I never cared for the overpriced drinks. They supposedly had a two-for-one happy hour everyday but I never figured out how to do it. They always charged me full fare. Gone and easily forgotten. I think they have an inadequate vision of their clientele: they dont know who we are, where we are or what we want from a bar.
