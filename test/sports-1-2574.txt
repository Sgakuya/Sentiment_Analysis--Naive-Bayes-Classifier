Awful at the prospect for veteran trades. Fair at the veteran for prospect trades. Has made arguably the worst free agent signings over the past 6 seasons: Chan Ho Park!, Hildalgo, Van Poppel, Jay Powell for starters. Has allowed starting pitching to remain a glaring weakness. Has earned a general distrust amongst players.
