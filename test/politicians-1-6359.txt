Henry Hyde is a coward and a hypocrite. His affableness and amiableness are not signs not of virtue but of his hypocrisy and lack of principles. He's a pro-life fighter who Janet Reno loves, according to his own website. This is a sign not only of his hypocrisy but of his complete impotence. If he led the impeachment fight against Clinton, one should not wonder why that thug and his minions are still in office.
