Selfish wide recievers don't win jack. If you alienate your teammates, the QB won't throw to your bitch ass, and those offensive lineman that break their fingers and hands won't block for you. Randy will never win anything that matters- no matter how fast he is. What a waste. He's going to love Oakland. . .who's going to throw him the ball?
