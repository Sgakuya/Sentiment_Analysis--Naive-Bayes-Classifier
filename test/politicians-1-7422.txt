Absolutely Corrupt to the Core, A walking special interest, But I will admit despite the face I disagree with him on every major issue. I will give him the benefit of the doubt, he was a damn good majority leader who knew how to get legislation passed. When he was whip he once whipped 300 out of 303 bills successfully, that's pretty damn impressive.
