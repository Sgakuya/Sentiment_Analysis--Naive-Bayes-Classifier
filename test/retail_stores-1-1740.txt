I worked for Wal-Mart for about a year. Let me tell you it sucked. They were more interested in giving you double shifts so the higher ups could take a brake. If you didnt do something right the whole store was talking about it. I remember asking for one day off during the week. My baby sister was having major surgery and I promised I would be there waiting for her. The day before I was suppose to be off they told me they scheduled me for the next day. I tried explaining that I had asked for that day off for months but they said if I didnt come in I would lose my job. I told them to take their job and shove it. I joined the Army 3 weeks later and I have been here for the last 4 years. Screw Wal-mart and their Do only for me policies.
