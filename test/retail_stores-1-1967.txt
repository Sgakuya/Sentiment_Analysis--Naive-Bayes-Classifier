If you buy a product without any credit, and you don't mind buying from a company that is dishonest, go ahead. But there have been so many problems with my credit that Best Buy refuses to even talk about. Their on-line payment won't work, and when I called in to report this, I was told "it is working, you are wrong." There were even times when I scheduled a payment and all record of that disappeared. As I was trying to resolve this, I was given bad information by a customer service representative about what I should do, and what would happen to my account when if I could pay (as I was in another country for school and could only pay online) and when I followed that advice, I got exactly the substantial fees (including interest on a no-interest-for-six-months account) that I was told wouldn't happen for another month. When I called back to explain why I did what I did, I was told that I must be lying. The second time I called, the lady was kinder, but she said that the only thing I could do was write a letter and fax it to another department that didn't have a phone. She said I should pay what I wasn't disputing, and that the disputed amount, which I shouldn't pay if I wanted to dispute it, would be put on hold until they decided on my account. Well nobody got back to me about the dispute and within weeks I had non-payment fees. I called to explain that I had (again) done in good faith what I was told. And again I was basically told oh well. So now I'm going to pay it all, although I am literally going to eat less during school this year, because it's just taking too much time to dispute. But at least I can tell the truth online. Please boycott them for me, eh?
