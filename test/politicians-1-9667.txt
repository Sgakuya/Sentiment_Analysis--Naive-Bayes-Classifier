A textbook example of thrist for power gone amuck. Said to be a tough leader in the Senate, yet was strangly unable to convince Congress to adequately supply the American and South Vietnamese side of the Vietnam Conflict. His inaction and ineptitude there cost him the presidency. The subsequent fall of Vietnam also cost millions of innocent Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians their lives as communism infested Southeast Asia.
