Incredibly disorganized. Phoenix is a gigantic grid, so you'd think that running buses would be a simple matter - or that air conditioning them would be a necessity - but you'd be wrong. The whole system needs to be reorganized and rethought, and fast - Phoenix is getting so big it really needs reliable public transport systems.
