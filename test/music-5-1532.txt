Out of the entire Cd there is only one song that isn't good. "everything will be alright everything will be alright" over and over and over. But "On Top" and "Midnight Show" are great songs. This is one to keep in your car because its great to turn it up really loud and sing along. Great CD I hope they don't fade out after this one.
