Pierce really did not do a whole lot during a period of time in our history that the nation was falling apart. If he really did not want to be president like the history books say, then he should have allowed others that would have dealt with the tension between the South and North in a more aggressive fashion. The reason why a Civil War had to happen was because there was ineffective leadership during the 1850's. It was not until a strong leader came along (Lincoln), that the struggle was resolved, although by his time, it had to be resolved with a war. It did not have to be if we had effective leadership during the period.
