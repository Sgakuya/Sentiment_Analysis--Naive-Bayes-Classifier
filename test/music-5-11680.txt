If you think punk rock started in England, well, you're dead wrong! Punk had its roots with bands such as MC5 / Iggy & the Stooges, etc. These bands would later define an entire generation. Yes, punk rock begun in America. And if the Ramones and The Heartbreakers (Johnny Thunders band) didn't tour England during the 70s there would mostly likely be no British punk as we know it. This compilation assembled by Philippe Mogane documents the seminal proto-punks of the U.S west coast during the late 1960's, 70's, and early 80's, with bands ranging from the obvious [The Stooges, The Weasels, The Controllers], to the obscure [Max Lazer Band, The Attitude, Nu Americans], all dignity flattened and remastered for your modern convenience. And it's definitely a worthwhile addition to anyone's musical collection. Review by Willie Desamero.
