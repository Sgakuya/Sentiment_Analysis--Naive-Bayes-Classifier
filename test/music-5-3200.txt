When I think of the ultimate pop-music CD, this and Sgt. Pepper's are the two that come to mind first. Almost every song on Rumours is a classic. I saw a show recently on the turmoil going on inside Fleetwood Mac while they were recording this CD, and it blows me away that they were able to produce this kind of music in that environment. It's a shame our impression of Fleetwood Mac has been tainted by their annoying reunion a few years ago.
