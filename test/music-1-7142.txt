Ruined music for good, in my opinion.Come as you are was an excellent song, but the rest were of no use to me.I am tired of people defending Cobain and saying how great he was!Blaming Courtney Love for his death!She was equally worthless and still is.Bottom line is, Cobain was a twisted,warped,troubled,alcoholic,drug addicted scoundrel, who threw it all away and now resides in Hell by way of the shotgun!Update:I am sure my unhelpfuls will quickly rise after this but oh well!!!You people have no defense for Cobain.
