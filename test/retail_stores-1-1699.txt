If all K-Marts are like the one in my town, then it's no wonder they're going bankrupt. K-Mart is the only department store in town. The store is always dirty and mesy and it's hard to find anything. They have a lousy selection of stuff. Their clothes are of poor quality and look like crap after only a couple of washings. They never have any lines open. The employees are rude, lazy, and would rather be talking with their friends than doing their job. I hope our K-Mart closes and Target or Kohl's moves in. Those stores are both far superior to K-Mart.
